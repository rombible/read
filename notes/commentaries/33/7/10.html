When we complain to the Lord of the badness of the times, we ought to complain against ourselves for the badness of our hearts. We must depend upon God to work deliverance for us in due time. We must not only look to him, but look for him. In our greatest distresses, we shall see no reason to despair of salvation, if by faith we look to the Lord as the God of our salvation. Though enemies triumph and insult, they shall be silenced and put to shame. Though Zion's walls may long be in ruins, there will come a day when they shall be repaired. Israel shall come from all the remote parts, not turning back for discouragements. Though our enemies may seem to prevail against us, and to rejoice over us, we should not despond. Though cast down, we are not destroyed; we may join hope in God's mercy, with submission to his correction. No hinderances can prevent the favours the Lord intends for his church.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/micah/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Then - (And) she that is mine enemy shall see it, and shame shall cover her which said unto me, Where is He, He of whom thou boastest, the Lord thy God? The cause of her gladness then is, that the blasphemies of the enemy of God were to cease. This was the bitterest portion of her cup, that they said daily, "Where is now thy God? let Him come and save thee;" as though He could not, or as though He loved her not, and she vainly presumed on His help. Even when fallen, it was for His sake that she was hated, who seemed to be overcome in her: as He was hated in His Martyrs, and they asked, , "Where is the God of the Christians?" Now the taunt was closed, and turned back on those who used it. The wheel, which they had turned against her, rolled round on themselves. They who had said, Let our eye look on Zion, now were ashamed that their hope had failed. They had longed to feed their sight on her miseries; Zion had her reverent gladness in gazing on the righteous hess of God. Babylon was trodden down by the Medes and Persians, and they whom she had let captive beheld it. Daniel was in the palace, when Belshazzar was slain.<p>The soul of one, who has known the chastening of God, cannot but read its own history here. The sinful soul is at once the object of the love of God and hath that about it which God hates. God hates the evil in us, even while lie loves us, being, or having been, evil. He forgives, but chastens. His displeasure is the channel of His goodpleasure. Nathan said to David, "The Lord hath put away thy sin" <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-10.htm">2 Samuel 12:10</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-13.htm">2 Samuel 12:13</a>, but also, "the sword shall never depart from thy house". It is part of His forgiveness to cleanse the soul with a "spirit of burning" <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/4-4.htm">Isaiah 4:4</a>. "It seemeth to me," says Jerome, "that Jerusalem is every soul, which had been the temple of the Lord, and had had the vision of peace and the knowledge of Scripture, and which afterward, overcome by sins, hath fallen captive by its own consent, parting from that which is right in the sight of God, and allowing itself' to sink among the pleasures of the world."<p>So then  "captive, and tortured, she saith to Babylon, that is, the confusion of this world and the power of the enemy which ruleth over the world, and sin who lordeth it over her, Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy; when I fall, I shall arise;" Dionysius: "from sin by repentance, and from tribulation by the consolation of the Holy Spirit, who, after weeping, poureth in joy. "For the Lord helpeth them that are fallen" <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/146-8.htm">Psalm 146:8</a>, and saith by the prophet, "Shall they fall and not arise"? <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-4.htm">Jeremiah 8:4</a>. and, "I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live. If I walk in darkness, the Lord is my light"! <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-11.htm">Ezekiel 33:11</a>. For although "the rulers of the darkness of this world" <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a> have deceived me, and I "sit in darkness and in the shadow of death" <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/107-10.htm">Psalm 107:10</a>, and "my feet stumble upon the dark mountains" <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-16.htm">Jeremiah 13:16</a>, yet "to them who sit in the region and shadow of death, light is sprung up" <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-2.htm">Isaiah 9:2</a>, and "light shineth in darkness" <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/1-5.htm">John 1:5</a>, and "the Lord is my light, and my salvation; whom then shall I fear"? <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-1.htm">Psalm 27:1</a>. and I will speak to Him and will say, "Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path" <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-105.htm">Psalm 119:105</a> "He draweth me from the darkness of ignorance and from the black night of sin, and giveth a clear view of future bliss, and brighteneth the very inmost soul within."<p>Dionysius: "Even if a mist have come upon me and I have been in darkness, I too shall find the light, that is, Christ; and the Sun of Righteousness arising on my mind shall make it white." I will betty patiently, yet gladly, the indignation of the Lord, (Dionysius): "all adversity, trial, tribulation, persecution, which can happen in this life;" because I have sinned against Him, "and such is the enormity of sin, offered to the Majesty and dishonoring the Holiness of God, and such punishment doth it deserve in the world to come, that if we weigh it well, we shall bear with joy whatever adversity can befall us." Cyril: "For although for a short time I be out of His Presence, and be; "given to an undistinguishing mind" <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/1-28.htm">Romans 1:28</a>, yet, seeing I suffer this rejection justly, I will bear the judgment, for I am not chastened in vain." "All chastening for the present seemeth not to be joyous but grievous, nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousncss unto them who are exercised thereby" <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-11.htm">Hebrews 12:11</a>.<p>Jerome: "The soul, feeling that it hath sinned, and hath the wounds of sins and is living in dead flesh and needs the cautery, says firmly to the Physician, 'Burn my flesh, cut open my wounds, all my imposthumes. It was my fault, that I was wounded; be it my pain, to endure such sufferings and to regain health.' And the true Physician shews to her, when whole, the cause of His treatment, and that He did rightly what He did. Then after these sufferings, the soul, being brought out of outer darkness, saith, I shall behold His Righteousness, and say, "Thou, O Lord, art upright; Rightous are Thy judgments, O God" <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-137.htm">Psalm 119:137</a>. But if Christ is "made unto us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption" <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-30.htm">1 Corinthians 1:30</a>, he who, after the indignation of God, saith that He shall see His Righteousness, promiseth to himself the sight of Christ." Cyril: "Then, having considered in her mind the grace of the righteousness in Christ and the overthrow of sin, the soul, in full possession of herself, crieth out, Mine enemy shall see it, etc. For, after that Christ came unto us, justifying sinners through faith, the mouth of the ungodly One is stopped, and the Author of sin is put to shame. He hath lost his rule over us, and sin is trodden down, "like mire in the streets", being subjected to the feet of the saints. But the blotting-out of sin is the Day of Christ." Jerome: "And, because the end of all punishment is the beginning of good," God saith to the poor, penitent, tossed, soul, "the walls of virtues shall be built up in thee, and thou shalt be guarded on all sides, and the rule of thine oppressors shall be far removed, and thy King and God shall come unto thee, and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of God."

It was this which gave rise to the idea of the day of judgment and retribution which predominates in the prophetic announcements, but which simply forms one side of the revelation of the glory of God, as our passage at once shows; inasmuch as it describes Jehovah as not only judging all nations and regarding them according to their deeds (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-15.htm">Obadiah 1:15</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-16.htm">Obadiah 1:16</a>), but as providing deliverance upon Zion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-17.htm">Obadiah 1:17</a>), and setting up His kingdom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-21.htm">Obadiah 1:21</a>). The retribution will correspond to the actions of Edom and of the nations. For &#1490;&#1468;&#1502;&#1500;&#1498; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;, compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/joel/3-4.htm">Joel 3:4</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/joel/3-7.htm">Joel 3:7</a>, where (<a href="http://biblehub.com/joel/3-2.htm">Joel 3:2-7</a>) the evil deeds of the nations, what they have done against the people of God, are described. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-16.htm">Obadiah 1:16</a> Obadiah simply mentions as the greatest crime the desecration of the holy mountain by drinking carousals, for which all nations are to drink the intoxicating cup of the wrath of God till they are utterly destroyed. In sheth&#305;&#772;them (ye have drunk) it is not the Judaeans who are addressed, as many commentators, from Ab. Ezra to Ewald and Meier, suppose, but the Edomites. This is required not only by the parallelism of &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1497;&#1514;&#1501; (as ye have drunk) and &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1497;&#1514;&#1501; &#1506;&#1500; &#1492;&#1514; (as thou hast done), but also by the actual wording and context. &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1497;&#1514;&#1501; &#1506;&#1500; &#1492;&#1512; cannot mean "as ye who are upon my holy mountain have drunk;" and in the announcement of the retribution which all nations will receive for the evil they have done to Judah, it is impossible that either the Judaeans should be addressed, or a parallel drawn between their conduct and that of the nations. Moreover, throughout the whole of the prophecy Edom only is addressed, and never Judah. Mount Zion is called "my holy mountain," because Jehovah was there enthroned in His sanctuary. The verb sha&#770;tha&#770;h is used in the two clauses in different senses: viz., sheth&#305;&#772;them, of the drinking carousals which the Edomites held upon Zion, like yishtu&#772; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-3.htm">Joel 3:3</a>; and sha&#770;thu&#772;, in the apodosis, of the drinking of the intoxicating goblet (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-17.htm">Isaiah 51:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-15.htm">Jeremiah 25:15</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-12.htm">Jeremiah 49:12</a>, etc.), as the expression "they shall be as though they had not been" clearly shows. At the same time, we cannot infer from the words "all nations will drink," that all nations would succeed in taking Zion and abusing it, but that they would have to taste all the bitterness of their crime; for it is not stated that they are to drink upon Mount Zion. The fact that the antithesis to &#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1497;&#1514;&#1501; is not &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; ("ye will drink") but &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501;, does not compel us to generalize sheth&#305;&#772;them, and regard all nations as addressed implicite in the Edomites. The difficulty arising from this antithesis cannot be satisfactorily removed by the remark of Caspari, that in consequence of the allusion to the day of the Lord upon all nations in <a href="http://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-15.htm">Obadiah 1:15</a>, the judgment upon all nations and that upon the Edomites were thought of as inseparably connected, or that this induced Obadiah to place opposite to the sins of the Edomites, not their own punishment, but the punishment of all nations, more especially as, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-11.htm">Obadiah 1:11</a>, it must necessarily be assumed that the foreign nations participated in the sin of Edom. For this leaves the question unanswered, how Obadiah came to speak at all (<a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-15.htm">Obadiah 1:15</a>) of the day of the Lord upon all nations. The circumstance that, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-11.htm">Obadiah 1:11</a>, heathen nations had plundered Jerusalem, and committed crimes like those for which Edom is condemned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-12.htm">Obadiah 1:12-14</a>, does not lead directly to the day of judgment upon all nations, but simply to a judgment upon Edom and the nations which had committed like sins. The difficulty is only removed by the assumption that Obadiah regarded Edom as a type of the nations that had risen up in hostility to the Lord and His people, and were judged by the Lord in consequence, so that what he says of Edom applies to all nations which assume the same or a similar attitude towards the people of God. From this point of view he could, without reserve, extend to all nations the retribution which would fall upon Edom for its sins. They should drink ta&#770;m&#305;&#772;d, i.e., not at once, as Ewald has rendered it in opposition to the usage of the language, but "continually." This does not mean, however, that "there will be no time in which there will not be one of the nations drinking the intoxicating cup, and being destroyed by drinking thereof; or that the nations will come in turn, and therefore in a long immeasurable series, one after the other, to drink the cup of intoxication," as Caspari supposes, but "continually, so that the turn never passes from the heathen to Judah, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-22.htm">Isaiah 51:22-23</a>" (Hitzig). This drinking is more precisely defined as drinking and swallowing (&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;, in Syriac, to devour or swallow, hence &#1500;&#1506;, a throat, so called from the act of swallowing, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-2.htm">Proverbs 23:2</a>), i.e., drinking in full draughts; and the effect, "they will be like such as have not been, have never existed" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-19.htm">Job 10:19</a>), i.e., they will be utterly destroyed as nations. </body></html>
