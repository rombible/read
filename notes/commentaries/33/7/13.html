In the midst of the triumphant expectation of the glory to come, there rises up the vision of the desolation of the land in the near future, by reason of the sins of the people.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/micah/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:8-13 Those truly penitent for sin, will see great reason to be patient under affliction. When we complain to the Lord of the badness of the times, we ought to complain against ourselves for the badness of our hearts. We must depend upon God to work deliverance for us in due time. We must not only look to him, but look for him. In our greatest distresses, we shall see no reason to despair of salvation, if by faith we look to the Lord as the God of our salvation. Though enemies triumph and insult, they shall be silenced and put to shame. Though Zion's walls may long be in ruins, there will come a day when they shall be repaired. Israel shall come from all the remote parts, not turning back for discouragements. Though our enemies may seem to prevail against us, and to rejoice over us, we should not despond. Though cast down, we are not destroyed; we may join hope in God's mercy, with submission to his correction. No hinderances can prevent the favours the Lord intends for his church.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/micah/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Notwithstanding - (And) the land (that is that spoken of, the land of Judah) shall be desolate not through any arbitrary law or the might of her enemies, but through the sins of the people, because of them that dwell therein, for the fruit of their doings Truly "the fruit of their doings," what they did to please themselves, of their own minds against God. As they sow, so shall they reap. This sounds almost as a riddle and contradiction beforehand; "the walls built up," "the people gathered in," and "the land desolate." Yet it was all fulfilled in the letter as well as in spirit. Jerusalem was restored; the people was gathered, first from the captivity, then to Christ; and yet the land was again desolate through the fruit of their doings who rejected Christ, and is so until this day.<p>The prophet now closes with one earnest prayer <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/7-14.htm">Micah 7:14</a>; to which he receives a brief answer, that God would shew forth His power anew, as when He first made them His people <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/7-15.htm">Micah 7:15</a>. On this, he describes vividly the awed submission of the world to their God <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/7-16.htm">Micah 7:16-17</a>, and closes with a thanksgiving of marveling amazement at the greatness and completeness of the forgiving mercy of God <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/7-18.htm">Micah 7:18-19</a>, ascribing all to His free goodness <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/7.htm">Micah 7</a>:59<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/micah/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13. However glorious the prospect of restoration, the Jews are not to forget the visitation on their "land" which is to intervene for the "fruit of (evil caused by) their doings" (compare Pr 1:31; Isa 3:10, 11; Jer 21:14).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/micah/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Notwithstanding, </span> Heb. <span class="ital">And</span>, but well rendered here <span class="ital">Not-withstanding</span>, viz. these promises of restitution, and gathering in the dispersed Jews, &c., which took not place till more than two hundred years after they were first made by the Lord to his people; accounting thus, one hundred and thirty-three years from the captivating of Samaria to the captivating of Jerusalem, seventy years the Babylonish captivity lasted, to which add the years to Darius Hystaspes ere the temple was built, and the years to Darius Longimanus ere the city was built and the walls repaired, it will amount to a considerable sum of years. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The land, </span> of Canaan, shall be desolate; laid so by Shalmaneser, Sennacherib, and Nebuchadnezzar in the ruins of this last seventy years. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Because of them, </span> the sinful Jews, that dwell therein; which now in Micah’s time did, or hereafter shall dwell in it, in Canaan. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">For the fruit of their doings; </span> as punishment for their evil doings. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/micah/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Notwithstanding the land shall be desolate,.... Not the land of Chaldea, as some; or the land of the nations, as Jarchi and Kimchi; but the land of Israel. That part of it, which was possessed by the ten tribes, was made desolate by Shalmaneser king of Assyria; and that which was inhabited by the two tribes, by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and this desolation was to be, "notwithstanding" the above prophecies, and prior to the fulfilment of them. So some render the words, as in the margin of our Bibles "after the land hath been desolate" (g); and it is observed, partly to prevent wicked men promising themselves impunity from the above prophecies; and partly to prevent despair in good men, when such a desolation should be made. And then again it was made desolate by the Romans, previous to the spread and establishment of the church of Christ, by the success of the Gospel in the Gentile world, in the first times of it; and by the conversion of the Jews, and bringing in the fulness of the Gentiles, in, he last times of it; <p>because of them that dwell therein, for the fruit of their doings: because of the sins of the inhabitants of the land of Israel: the desolation made by the kings of Assyria and Babylon was for the idolatry of Israel and Judah, and other sins; and the desolation made by the Romans for the Jews rejection of the Messiah. <p>(g)   "postquam fuerit haec terra desolationi", Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator, Tarnovius, Drusius. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/micah/7.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Notwithstanding the land shall be desolate because of them that dwell therein, for the fruit of <span class="cverse3">{m}</span> their doings.</span><p>(m) Before this grace appears, he shows how grievously the hypocrites themselves will be punished, seeing that the earth itself, which cannot sin, will be made waste because of their wickedness.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/micah/7.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">13</span>. <span class="ital">the land</span>] i.e. the land of Canaan. Before the great promises of a golden future can be realized, judgment must have its perfect work. We might, however, render ‘the earth,’ i.e. the earth with the exception of Canaan. The desolation of the earth would help to explain the thronging of the people to Palestine foretold in the preceding verse.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/micah/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Notwithstanding the land shall be desolate.</span> Very many commentators consider the land of Canaan to be here intended, the prophet recurring to threatenings of judgment before the great restoration comes to pass; but it is best to regard the clause as referring to all the world, exclusive of Canaan. While the Messianic kingdom is set up, judgment shall fail upon the sinful world. "For the nation and kingdom that will not serve thee shall perish; yea, those nations shall be utterly wasted" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-12.htm">Isaiah 60:12</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-12.htm">Revelation 12:12</a>).

And they will burn among them, and consume them, and there will not be one left to the house of Esau, for Jehovah hath spoken." This verse not only resumes the discussion of the retribution, so that it corresponds to <a href="http://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-15.htm">Obadiah 1:15</a>, but it also affirms, as an appendix to <a href="http://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-17.htm">Obadiah 1:17</a>, that Edom is to be utterly destroyed. By the "house of Jacob" Judah is intended, as the co-ordination of the house of Joseph, i.e., of the ten tribes, clearly shows. The assumption that "house of Jacob" signifies all Israel, in connection with which that portion is also especially mentioned, which might be supposed to be excluded (Rosenmller, Hengstenberg, and others), is at variance with such passages as <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/46-3.htm">Isaiah 46:3</a>, "the house of Jacob, and all the remnant of the house of Israel," where the reason assigned for the co-ordination is not applicable. Obadiah uses the name Jacob for Judah because ever since the division of the kingdoms Judah alone has represented the people of God, the ten tribes having fallen away from the kingdom of God for a time. In the future, however, Judah and Israel are to be united again (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-2.htm">Hosea 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-16.htm">Ezekiel 37:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-18.htm">Jeremiah 31:18</a>), and unitedly to attack and overcome their foes (<a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-13.htm">Isaiah 11:13-14</a>). Obadiah distinctly mentions the house of Joseph, i.e., of the ten tribes, in this passage and in this alone, for the purpose of guarding against the idea that the ten tribes are to be shut out from the future salvation. For the figure of the flame of fire which consumes stubble, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-24.htm">Isaiah 5:24</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-17.htm">Isaiah 10:17</a>.
