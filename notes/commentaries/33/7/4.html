Men had no comfort, no satisfaction in their own families or in their nearest relations. Contempt and violation of domestic duties are a sad symptom of universal corruption. Those are never likely to come to good who are undutiful to their parents. The prophet saw no safety or comfort but in looking to the Lord, and waiting on God his salvation. When under trials, we should look continually to our Divine Redeemer, that we may have strength and grace to trust in him, and to be examples to those around us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/micah/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The best of them is as a brier - The gentlest of them is a thorn , strong, hard, piercing, which letteth nothing unresisting pass by but it taketh from it, "robbing the fleece, and wounding the sheep." "The most upright", those who, in comparison of others still worse, seem so, "is sharper than a thorn hedge", (literally, the upright, them a thorn hedge.) They are not like it only, but worse, and that in all ways; none is specified, and so none excepted; they were more crooked, more tangled, sharper. Both, as hedges, were set for protection; both, turned to injury. Jerome: "So that, where you would look for help, thence comes suffering." And if such be the best, what the rest?<p>The day of thy watchmen and thy visitation cometh - When all, even the good, are thus corrupted, the iniquity is full. Nothing now hinders the "visitation", which "the watchmen", or prophets, had so long foreseen and forewarned of. "Now shall be their perplexity" ; "now", without delay; for the day of destruction ever breakcth suddenly upon the sinner. "When they say, peace and safety, then sudden destruction cometh upon them" <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:3</a>. : "whose destruction cometh suddenly at an instant". They had perplexed the cause of the oppressed; they themselves were tangled together, intertwined in mischief, as a thorn-hedge. They should be caught in their own snare; they had perplexed their paths and should find no outlet. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/micah/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. as a brier&#8212;or thorn; pricking with injury all who come in contact with them (2Sa 23:6, 7; Isa 55:13; Eze 2:6).<p>the day of thy watchmen&#8212;the day foretold by thy (true) prophets, as the time of "thy visitation" in wrath [Grotius].

And thy heroes despair, O Teman, that every one may be cut off by murder from the mountains of Esau." In order to give up the Edomites to destruction at that time, the Lord will take away discernment from their wise men, so that even they will not be able to help them. The destruction of the wise men is not to be understood as signifying that the wise men will all be slain, or slain before any others, but simply that they will be destroyed as wise men by the withdrawal or destruction of their wisdom. This meaning is sustained, not only by the fact that in the second clause tebhu&#772;na&#770;h only is mentioned as that which is to be destroyed, but also by the parallel passages, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-7.htm">Jeremiah 49:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-11.htm">Isaiah 19:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-14.htm">Isaiah 29:14</a>. Jeremiah mentions here the wisdom of the Temanites in particular. That they were celebrated for their wisdom, is evident not only from this passage, but also from the fact that Eliphaz, the chief opponent of Job in argument, was a Temanite (<a href="http://biblehub.com/job/2-1.htm">Job 2:1</a>, etc.). With this withdrawal of wisdom and discernment, even the brave warriors lose their courage. The heroes are dismayed (chattu&#772;), or fall into despair. Te&#772;ma&#770;n, which the Chaldee has rendered incorrectly as an appellative, viz., inhabitants of the south (da&#770;ro&#772;ma&#770;'), is a proper name of the southern district of Idumaea (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-12.htm">Amos 1:12</a>), so called from Teman, a son of Eliphaz and grandson of Esau (<a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/36-11.htm">Genesis 36:11</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/36-15.htm">Genesis 36:15</a>). Gibbo&#772;rekha&#770; (thy heroes), with the masculine suffix, the people inhabiting the district being addressed under the name of the district itself. God inflicts this upon Edom with the intention (lema&#8219;an, to this end) that all the Edomites should be cut off. Miqqa&#770;tel, from the murdering, by murder (compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/9-11.htm">Genesis 9:11</a>, where min occurs after yikka&#770;re&#772;th in this sense); not "without conflict," as Ewald renders it, for qetel signifies slaying, and not conflict. The thought of connecting miqqa&#770;tel with what follows cannot for a moment be entertained (vid., lxx, Syr., Vulg.). It is opposed not only by the authority of the Masoretic punctuation, but still more decisively by the fact, that the stronger and more special word (qetel) cannot precede the weaker and more general one (cha&#770;ma&#770;s), and that the murder of certain fugitives is placed first in the list of crimes committed by Edom upon the Israelites (<a href="http://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-10.htm">Obadiah 1:10-14</a>). </body></html>
