The households are divided each against itself, and the relationships which should mean mutual confidence and support have become the occasion of the most bitter hostility. Our Lord adopts these words to express the strife and division which, He foresaw, would defile Christianity.

Men had no comfort, no satisfaction in their own families or in their nearest relations. Contempt and violation of domestic duties are a sad symptom of universal corruption. Those are never likely to come to good who are undutiful to their parents. The prophet saw no safety or comfort but in looking to the Lord, and waiting on God his salvation.

Selfishness rends each from the other, and disjoints the whole frame of society. Passions and sin break every band of friendship, kindred, gratitude, nature. "Everyone 'seeketh his own'." Times of trial and of outward harass increase this; so that God's visitations are seasons of the most frightful recklessness as to everything but sell: So had God foretold <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-53.htm">Deuteronomy 28:53</a>; so it was in the siege of Samaria <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-28.htm">2 Kings 6:28</a>, and in that of Jerusalem both by the Chaldeans <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-3.htm">Lamentations 4:3-16</a> and by the Romans . When the soul has lost the love of God, all other is but sceming love, since "natural affection" is from Him, and it too dies out, as God gives the soul over to itself <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-28.htm">Romans 1:28</a>. The words describe partly the inward corruption, partly the outward causes which shall call it forth.<p>There is no real trust in any, where all are eorrupt. The outward straitness and perplexity, in which they shall be, makes that to crumble and fall to pieces, which was inwardly decayed and severed before. The words deepen, as they go on. First, "the friend", or neighbor, the common band of man and man; then "the guide", (or, as the word also means, one "familiar", united by intimacy, to whom, by continual intercourse, the soul was "used";) then the wife who lay in the bosom, nearest to the secrets of the heart; then those to whom all reverence is due, "father" and "mother". Our Lord said that this should be fulfilled in the hatred of His Gospel. He begins His warning as to it, with a caution like that of the prophet; "Be ye wise as serpents" <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/10-16.htm">Matthew 10:16-17</a>, and "beware of men". Then He says, how these words should still be true <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/10-21.htm">Matthew 10:21</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/10-35.htm">Matthew 10:35-36</a>. There never were wanting pleas of earthly interest against the truth.<p>He Himself was "cut off" lest "the Romans should take away their place and nation" <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-48.htm">John 11:48</a>. The Apostles were accused, that they meant to "bring this Man's Blood upon" the chief priests <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-28.htm">Acts 5:28</a>; or as "ringleaders of the sect of the Nazarenes, pestilant fallows and movers of sedition, turning the world upside down, setters up of another king; troublers of the city; comanding things unlawful for Romans to practice; setters forth of strange gods; turning away much people" <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-5.htm">Acts 24:5</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-20.htm">Acts 16:20-21</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/17-6.htm">Acts 17:6-7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-18.htm">Acts 17:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-12.htm">1 Peter 2:12</a>; endangering not men's craft only, but the honor of their gods; "evil doers". Truth is against the world's ways, so the world is against it. Holy zeal hates sin, so sinners hate it. It troubles them, so they count it, "one which troubleth Israel" <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-17.htm">1 Kings 18:17</a>. Tertullian, in a public defense of Christians in the second century, writes, , "Truth set out with being herself hated; as soon as she appeared, she is an enemy. As many as are strangers to it, so many are its foes; and the Jews indeed appropriately from their rivalry, the soldiers from their violence, even they of our own household from nature. Each flay are we beset, each day betrayed; in our very meetings and assemblies are we mostly surprised."<p>There was no lack of pleas. : "A Christian thou deemest a man guilty of every crime, an encmy of the goals, of the Emperors, of law, of morals, of all nature;" "factious," "authors of all public calamities through the anger of the pagan gods," "impious," "atheists," "disloyal," "public enemies." The Jews, in the largest sense of the word "they of their own household", were ever the deadliest enemies of Christians, the inventors of calumnies, the authors of persecutions. "What other race," says , Tertullian, "is the seed-plot of our calumnies?"<p>Then the Acts of the Martyrs tell, how Christians were betrayed by near kinsfolk for private interest, or for revenge, because they would not join in things unlawful. Jerome: "So many are the instances in daily life, (of the daughter rising against the mother) that we should rather mourn that they are so many, than seek them out." - "I seek no examples, (of those of a man's own househould being his foes) they are too many, that we should have any need of witness." Dionysius: "Yet ought we not, on account of these and like words of Holy Scripture, to be mistrustful or suspicious, or always to presume the worst, but to be cautious and prudent. For Holy Scripture speaketh with reference to times, causes, persons, places." So John saith, "Believe not every spirit, but try the spirits, whether they are of God" <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-1.htm">1 John 4:1</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/micah/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5.

This is not said to lessen the value of friendship; or to discourage the cultivation of it with agreeable persons; or to dissuade from a confidence in a real friend; or in the least to weaken it, and damp the pleasure of true friendship, which is one of the great blessings of life; but to set forth the sad degeneracy of the then present age, that men, who pretended to be friends, were so universally false and faithless, that there was no dependence to be had on them: <p>put ye not confidence in a guide; in political matters, in civil affairs, as civil magistrates, judges, counsellors; or in domestic matters.

Kimchi interprets it of an elder brother; and Aben Ezra of a husband, who is to his wife the guide of her youth; and in religious matters as prophets, priests who were false and deceitful.

Cha&#774;mas 'a&#770;ch&#305;&#772;kha&#770;, wickedness, violent wrong towards (upon) thy brother (genit. obj. as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-19.htm">Joel 3:19</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/16-5.htm">Genesis 16:5</a>, etc.). Drusius has already pointed out the peculiar emphasis on these words. Wrong, or violence, is all the more reprehensible, when it is committed against a brother. The fraternal relation in which Edom stood towards Judah is still more sharply defined by the name Jacob, since Esau and Jacob were twin brothers. The consciousness that the Israelites were their brethren, ought to have impelled the Edomites to render helpful support to the oppressed Judaeans. Instead of this, they not only revelled with scornful and malignant pleasure in the misfortune of the brother nation, but endeavored to increase it still further by rendering active support to the enemy. This hostile behaviour of Edom arose from envy at the election of Israel, like the hatred of Esau towards Jacob (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/27-41.htm">Genesis 27:41</a>), which was transmitted to his descendants, and came out openly in the time of Moses, in the unbrotherly refusal to allow the Israelites to pass in a peaceable manner through their land (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/20.htm">Numbers 20</a>). On the other hand, the Israelites are always commanded in the law to preserve a friendly and brotherly attitude towards Edom (<a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-4.htm">Deuteronomy 2:4-5</a>); and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-7.htm">Deuteronomy 23:7</a> it is enjoined upon them not to abhor the Edomite, because he is their brother. &#1514;&#1468;&#1499;&#1505;&#1468;&#1498; &#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492; (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/7-10.htm">Micah 7:10</a>), shame will cover thee, i.e., come upon thee in full measure, - namely, the shame of everlasting destruction, as the following explanatory clause clearly shows. &#1493;&#1504;&#1499;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468; with Vav consec., but with the tone upon the penultima, contrary to the rule (cf. Ges. 49, 3; Ewald, 234, b and c). In the more precise account of Edom's sins given in <a href="http://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-11.htm">Obadiah 1:11</a>, the last clause does not answer exactly to the first. After the words "in the day that thou stoodest opposite," we should expect the apodosis "thou didst this or that." But Obadiah is led away from the sentence which he has already begun, by the enumeration of hostilities displayed towards Judah by its enemies, so that he observes with regard to Edom's behaviour: Then even thou wast as one of them, that is to say, thou didst act just like the enemy. &#1506;&#1502;&#1491; &#1502;&#1504;&#1468;&#1490;&#1491;, to stand opposite (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-12.htm">Psalm 38:12</a>), used here to denote a hostile intention, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-13.htm">2 Samuel 18:13</a>. They showed this at first by looking on with pleasure at the misfortunes of the Judaeans (<a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-12.htm">Obadiah 1:12</a>), still more by stretching out their hand after their possessions (<a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-13.htm">Obadiah 1:13</a>), but most of all by taking part in the conflict with Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-14.htm">Obadiah 1:14</a>). In the clauses which follow, the day when Edom acted thus is described as a day on which Judah had fallen into the power of hostile nations, who carried off its possessions, and disposed of Jerusalem as their booty. Za&#775;r&#305;&#772;m and nokhr&#305;&#772;m are synonymous epithets applied to heathen foes. &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1492; generally denotes the carrying away of captives; but it is sometimes applied to booty in cattle and goods, or treasures (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-21.htm">1 Chronicles 5:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/14-14.htm">2 Chronicles 14:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-17.htm">2 Chronicles 21:17</a>). &#1495;&#1497;&#1500; is not used here either for the army, or for the strength, i.e., the kernel of the nation, but, as &#1495;&#1497;&#1500;&#1493; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-13.htm">Obadiah 1:13</a> clearly shows, for its possessions, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-4.htm">Isaiah 8:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-14.htm">Isaiah 10:14</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/26-12.htm">Ezekiel 26:12</a>, etc. &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512;&#1493;, his (Judah's) gates, used rhetorically for his cities.<p>Lastly, Jerusalem is also mentioned as the capital, upon which the enemies cast lots. The three clauses form a climax: first, the carrying away of Judah's possessions, that is to say, probably those of the open country; then the forcing of a way into the cities; and lastly, arbitrary proceedings both in and with the capital. &#1497;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; &#1490;&#1493;&#1512;&#1500; (perf. kal of &#1497;&#1491;&#1491;  equals  &#1497;&#1491;&#1492;, not piel for &#1497;&#1497;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;, because the Yod praef. of the imperfect piel is never dropped in verbs &#1508;&#1497;), to cast the lot upon booty (things) and prisoners, to divide them among them (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-3.htm">Joel 3:3</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/3-10.htm">Nahum 3:10</a>). Caspari, Hitzig, and others understand it here as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/joel/3-3.htm">Joel 3:3</a>, as denoting the distribution of the captive inhabitants of Jerusalem, and found upon this one of their leading arguments, that the description given here refers to the destruction of Jerusalem, which Obadiah either foresaw in the Spirit, or depicts as something already experienced. But this by no means follows from the fact that in Joel we have &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497; instead of &#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1501;, since it is generally acknowledged that, when the prophets made use of their predecessors, they frequently modified their expressions, or gave them a different turn. But if we look at our passage simply as its stands, there is not the slightest indication that Jerusalem is mentioned in the place of the people. As &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514; &#1495;&#1497;&#1500;&#1493; does not express the carrying away of the inhabitants, there is not a single syllable which refers to the carrying away captive of either the whole nation or the whole of the population of Jerusalem. On the contrary, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-13.htm">Obadiah 1:13</a> we read of the perishing of the children of Judah, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-14.htm">Obadiah 1:14</a> of fugitives of Judah, and those that have escaped. From this it is very obvious that Obadiah had simply a conquest of Jerusalem in his eye, when part of the population was slain in battle and part taken captive, and the possessions of the city were plundered; so that the casting of the lot upon Jerusalem has reference not only to the prisoners, but also to the things taken as plunder in the city, which the conquerors divided among them. &#1490;&#1468;&#1501; &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;, even thou, the brother of Jacob, art like one of them, makest common cause with the enemy. The verb &#1492;&#1497;&#1497;&#1514;&#1492;, thou wast, is omitted, to bring the event before the mind as something even then occurring. For this reason Obadiah also clothes the further description of the hostilities of the Edomites in the form of a warning against such conduct. </body></html>
