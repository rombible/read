Among the promises made to Abraham and the other patriarchs, one important one was, that their seed should possess the land of Canaan. This promise, with those of a spiritual nature, will receive its final accomplishment in the conversion and restoration of the Jewish nation in the latter times. That people are said to be <span class="ital">beloved for their fathers’ sakes, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-28.htm" title="As concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sakes: but as touching the election, they are beloved for the father's sakes.">Romans 11:28</a>; and therefore we have reason to expect, that the mercies promised to their fathers will be made good to them, in God’s due time; <span class="ital">for the gifts and callings of God are without repentance, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-29.htm" title="For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance.">Romans 11:29</a>. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/micah/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:14-20 When God is about to deliver his people, he stirs up their friends to pray for them. Apply spiritually the prophet's prayer to Christ, to take care of his church, as the great Shepherd of the sheep, and to go before them, while they are here in this world as in a wood, in this world but not of it. God promises in answer to this prayer, he will do that for them which shall be repeating the miracles of former ages. As their sin brought them into bondage, so God's pardoning their sin brought them out. All who find pardoning mercy, cannot but wonder at that mercy; we have reason to stand amazed, if we know what it is. When the Lord takes away the guilt of sin, that it may not condemn us, he will break the power of sin, that it may not have dominion over us. If left to ourselves, our sins will be too hard for us; but God's grace shall be sufficient to subdue them, so that they shall not rule us, and then they shall not ruin us. When God forgives sin, he takes care that it never shall be remembered any more against the sinner. He casts their sins into the sea; not near the shore-side, where they may appear again, but into the depth of the sea, never to rise again. All their sins shall be cast there, for when God forgives sin, he forgives all. He will perfect that which concerns us, and with this good work will do all for us which our case requires, and which he has promised. These engagements relate to Christ, and the success of the gospel to the end of time, the future restoration of Israel, and the final prevailing of true religion in all lands. The Lord will perform his truth and mercy, not one jot or tittle of it shall fall to the ground: faithful is He that has promised, who also will do it. Let us remember that the Lord has given the security of his covenant, for strong consolation to all who flee for refuge to lay hold on the hope set before them in Christ Jesus.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/micah/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thou wilt perform the truth to Jacob and the mercy to Abraham - What was free mercy to Abraham, became, when God had once promised it, His truth. Abraham also stands for all those, who in him and his Seed should be blessed, those who were "aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world" <a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-12.htm">Ephesians 2:12</a>, in no covenant or relation with God, as well as those who were the children of the faith; pagan, as well as Jews. Jacob represents these who were immediately his children, such of the children of Israel, as were also the true Israel and children of faithful Abraham. In both ways the gift to Abraham was mercy, to Jacob, truth. So also Paul saith, "Jesus Christ was a Minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made to the fathers, and that the Gentiles might glorify God for His mercy." <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/15-8.htm">Romans 15:8-9</a> yet mercy and truth <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/25-10.htm">Psalm 25:10</a>, together, are all the paths of the Lord; they "met together" <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/85-10.htm">Psalm 85:10</a> in Christ; yea Christ Himself is full of Mercy as well as "Truth" <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a> : and woe were it to that soul to whom He were Truth without mercy. Rup.: "For to be saved, we look not so much to the truth of the Judge as to the mercy of the Redeemer." And mercy, in the counsel of God, reacheth wider than truth; for truth is given to Jacob, the father of one nation, Israel; but mercy to Abraham, "the father of many nations" <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-5.htm">Genesis 17:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-17.htm">Romans 4:17</a>. Isaac, it may be, is not here mentioned, because all to whom the blessing should come are already spoken of in Jacob and Abraham; in Jacob, all to whom the promise was first made; in Abraham, all nations of the world who should be blessed in his Seed, through the mercy of God overflowing the bounds of that covenant. Isaac is, in his sacrifice, chiefly a type of our Lord Himself.<p>Which Thou hast sworn unto our fathers - "That by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation" <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-18.htm">Hebrews 6:18</a>.<p>From the days of old - Alb.: From eternity, in the counsel of God; in promise, from the foundation of the world, as is said in the hymn of Zacharias, "As He spake by the mouth of His holy prophets, which have been since the world began" <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-70.htm">Luke 1:70</a>. Pococke: The inspired hymns of the Blessed Virgin Mary and of Zachariah take up the words of the prophet, and shew that they are already fulfilled in Christ, although they shall be more and more fulfilled unto the world's end, as Jew and Gentile are brought into His fold; "He remembering His mercy, as He spake to our fathers, to Abraham and to his seed forever" <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-54.htm">Luke 1:54-55</a>.

"Jehovah threw a great wind (i.e., a violent wind) upon the sea." A mighty tempest (&#1505;&#1506;&#1512;, rendered appropriately &#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; by the lxx) arose, so that "the ship thought to be dashed to pieces," i.e., to be wrecked (&#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1489; used of inanimate things, equivalent to "was very nearly" wrecked). In this danger the seamen (malla&#770;ch, a denom. of melach, the salt flood) cried for help, "every one to his god." They were heathen, and probably for the most part Phoenicians, but from different places, and therefore worshippers of different gods. But as the storm did not abate, they also resorted to such means of safety as they had at command. They "threw the waves in the ship into the sea, to procure relief to themselves" (&#1500;&#1492;&#1511;&#1500; &#1502;&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/18-22.htm">Exodus 18:22</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-10.htm">1 Kings 12:10</a>). The suffix refers to the persons, not to the things. By throwing the goods overboard, they hoped to preserve the ship from sinking beneath the swelling waves, and thereby to lighten, i.e., diminish for themselves the danger of destruction which was so burdensome to them. "But Jonah had gone down into the lower room of the ship, and had there fallen fast asleep;" not, however, just at the time of the greatest danger, but before the wind had risen into a dangerous storm. The sentence is to be rendered as a circumstantial one in the pluperfect. Yarkethe&#772; hasseph&#305;&#772;na&#770;h (analogous to harkethe&#772; habbayith in <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-10.htm">Amos 6:10</a>) is the innermost part of the vessel, i.e., the lower room of the ship. Seph&#305;&#772;na&#770;h, which only occurs here, and is used in the place of &#1488;&#1504;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;, is the usual word for a ship in Arabic and Aramaean. Nirdam: used for deep sleep, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-21.htm">Judges 4:21</a>. This act of Jonah's is regarded by most commentators as a sign of an evil conscience. Marck supposes that he had lain down to sleep, hoping the better to escape either the dangers of sea and air, or the hand of God; others, that he had thrown himself down in despair, and being utterly exhausted and giving himself up for lost, had fallen asleep; or as Theodoret expresses it, being troubled with the gnawings of conscience and overpowered with mourning, he had sought comfort in sleep and fallen into a deep sleep. Jerome, on the other hand, expresses the idea that the words indicate "security of mind" on the part of the prophet: "he is not disturbed by the storm and the surrounding dangers, but has the same composed mind in the calm, or with shipwreck at hand;" and whilst the rest are calling upon their gods, and casting their things overboard, "he is so calm, and feels so safe with his tranquil mind, that he goes down to the interior of the ship and enjoys a most placid sleep." The truth probably lies between these two views. It was not an evil conscience, or despair occasioned by the threatening danger, which induced him to lie down to sleep; nor was it his fearless composure in the midst of the dangers of the storm, but the careless self-security with which he had embarked on the ship to flee from God, without considering that the hand of God could reach him even on the sea, and punish him for his disobedience. This security is apparent in his subsequent conduct. </body></html>
