Men had no comfort, no satisfaction in their own families or in their nearest relations. Contempt and violation of domestic duties are a sad symptom of universal corruption. Those are never likely to come to good who are undutiful to their parents. The prophet saw no safety or comfort but in looking to the Lord, and waiting on God his salvation. When under trials, we should look continually to our Divine Redeemer, that we may have strength and grace to trust in him, and to be examples to those around us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/micah/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Therefore - (And,) when all these things come to pass and all human help fails, "I", for my part, "will look unto", (literally, "on") "the Lord" God, the Unchangeable. The prophet sets himself, I, with emphasis, against the multitude of the ungodly. When all forsake, betray, fail, when "love is waxed cold" <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/24-12.htm">Matthew 24:12</a>, and men, in the last days, shall be "lovers of their ownselves" <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-2.htm">2 Timothy 3:2</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-4.htm">2 Timothy 3:4</a>, "not lovers of God", I, - he does not say, "will trust," but - , "will" (Jerome), "with the eye of the heart contemplating, loving, venerating God most High, and weighing His mercy and justice," "gaze intently" with the devotion of faith toward Him, though I see Him not: yet so too I will rest "in" Him (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-15.htm">Psalm 25:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/123-1.htm">Psalm 123:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/141-8.htm">Psalm 141:8</a>) and "on" Him, as the eyes are accustomed to rest in trust and love and dependence, and as, on the other hand, the eyes of God "espy into" <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/66-7.htm">Psalm 66:7</a> man and dwell on him, never leaving him unbeheld.<p>I will "espy" Him, although from afar, with the eyes of the soul, as a watchman, (the word is the same,) looking for His coming and announcing it to others; and until He comes, "I will wait (I would wait") with trust unbroken by any troubles or delay, as Job saith, "Though He slay me, yet will I put my trust in Him" <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-15.htm">Job 13:15</a>. The word is almost appropriated to a longing waiting for God. "For the God of my salvation". This too became a customary title of God , a title, speaking of past deliverances, as well as of confidence and of hope. Deliverance and salvation are bound up with God, and that, in man's personal experience. It is not only, "Saviour God," but "God, my Saviour," Thou who hast been, art, and wilt be, my God, my saving God. It is a prelude to the name of Jesus, our Redeeming God. "The Lord will hear me".<p>His purpose of waiting on God he had expressed wistfully. "I would wait;" for man's longing trust must be upheld by God. Of God's mercy he speaks confidently, "the Lord will hear me", He, who is ever "more ready to hear than we to pray." He has no doubts, but, as Abraham said, "the Lord will provide" <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/22-8.htm">Genesis 22:8</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/22-14.htm">Genesis 22:14</a>, so he, "The Lord will hear me". So, when Jehoshaphat prayed, "We have no might against this great company that cometh, against us, neither know we what to do, but our eyes are upon Thee" <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-12.htm">2 Chronicles 20:12</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-15.htm">2 Chronicles 20:15</a>; God answered by the prophet, "Be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude; for the battle is not yours, but God's". Micah unites with himself all the faithful as one, "in the unity of the spirit," where in all are one band, looking, waiting, praying for His Coming in His kingdom. Lap.: "God is our only refuge and asylum in things desperate, and rejoices to help in them, in order to shew His supreme Power and Goodness especially to those who believe, hope, and ask it. Therefore all mistrust and despondency is then to be supremely avoided, and a certain hope and confidence in God is to be elicited. This will call forth the help of God assuredly, yea though it were by miracle, as to Lot in Sodom, to Moses and the people from Pharaoh, to David from Saul, to Hezekiah from Sennacherib, to the Maccabees from Antiochus. This our proverbs express , how God aids, when there is least sign of it." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/micah/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. Therefore I will look unto the Lord&#8212;as if no one else were before mine eyes. We must not only "look unto the Lord," but also "wait for Him." Having no hope from man (Mic 7:5, 6), Micah speaks in the name of Israel, who herein, taught by chastisement (Mic 7:4) to feel her sin (Mic 7:9), casts herself on the Lord as her only hope," in patient waiting (La 3:26). She did so under the Babylonian captivity; she shall do so again hereafter when the spirit of grace shall be poured on her (Zec 12:10-13).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/micah/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Therefore, </span> since times are so calamitous, and all sorts of men are so perfidious, since no sure comfort or relief from those that are nearest relations, and should be dearest friends, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I will look; </span> as one set in a watch-tower looks round about, and diligently observes all that stirreth; so will the prophet, speaking in the person of the faithful, the Israel of God; so did they who in Israel and Judah feared the Lord and walked with him; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">unto the Lord, </span> the God of mercy, power, truth, and wisdom, who can and will help. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I will wait for, </span> though he do not presently appear for me, saith the church, I will with patience expect, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">the God of my salvation; </span> who only can, and who graciously hath promised to save his church. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">My God will hear me; </span> he doth hear my cry, and will deliver me. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/micah/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Therefore I will look unto the Lord,.... Here the prophet, in the name of the church and people of God, declares what he would do in such circumstances, since there was no dependence on men of any rank, in any relation or connection with each other; he resolved to look alone to the Lord, and put his trust in him; look up to the Lord in prayer, use an humble freedom with him, place a holy confidence in him, expect all good things from him, and wait for them; look to Christ in the exercise of faith, which is, in New Testament language, a looking to Jesus; and the Targum interprets this clause of the Word of the Lord, the essential Word, who is to be looked unto, and believed in, as the Son of God, who is the true God, and eternal life; as the Lamb of God, that takes away the sin of the world; as the Mediator between God and men: as in all his offices of Prophet, Priest, and King; as the Lord our righteousness, and as the only Saviour and Redeemer of men; and that for all things; when in darkness, for light; when weak, for strength; when sick, for healing; when hungry, for food; when disconsolate, for comfort; in short, for all supplies of grace here, and for eternal glory and happiness hereafter; and though he is in heaven, and not to be seen with our bodily eyes, yet he is held forth in the word of the Gospel, and the ordinances of it; and is to be seen there with an eye of faith: <p>I will wait for the God of my salvation; who is the author both of temporal, and of spiritual, and eternal salvation; for the light of his countenance, when he hides himself; for the performance of promises he has made; for answers of prayer put up to him; for discoveries of pardoning grace, having sinned against him; for help and assistance in all times of need; for the salvation of the Lord, for an application of it, for the joys and comforts of it; and for Christ the Saviour, his coming in the flesh, which all the prophets and Old Testament saints were looking and waiting for: and who, doubtless, was upon the mind and in the view of the prophet when he uttered these words, <p>my God will hear me; this is the language of faith, both to say that God was his God, and that he would hear and answer him; the former is the ground of the latter; God has an ear to hear when his people cry; and sooner or later it appears that he does hear, by giving an answer of peace unto them, which issues in their salvation they have been praying, looking, and waiting for.

Come not into the gate of my people in the day of their calamity; thou also look not at his misfortune in the day of his calamity, and stretch not out thy hand to his possession in the day of his calamity: <a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-14.htm">Obadiah 1:14</a>. Nor stand in the cross-road, to destroy his fugitives, nor deliver up his escaped ones in the day of distress." This warning cannot be satisfactorily explained either "on the assumption that the prophet is here foretelling the future destruction of Judah and Jerusalem" (Caspari), or "on the supposition that he is merely depicting an event that has already past" (Hitzig). If the taking and plundering of Jerusalem were an accomplished fact, whether in idea or in reality, as it is shown to be by the perfects &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; and &#1497;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-11.htm">Obadiah 1:11</a>, Obadiah could not in that case warn the Edomites against rejoicing over it, or even taking part therein. Hence Drusius, Rosenmller, and others, take the verbs in <a href="http://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-12.htm">Obadiah 1:12-14</a> as futures of the past: "Thou shouldest not have seen, shouldest not have rejoiced," etc. But this is opposed to the grammar. &#1488;&#1500; followed by the so-called fut. apoc. is jussive, and cannot stand for the pluperf. conjunct. And Maurer's suggestion is just as untenable, namely, that yo&#772;m in <a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-11.htm">Obadiah 1:11</a> denotes the day of the capture of Jerusalem, and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-12.htm">Obadiah 1:12</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-13.htm">Obadiah 1:13</a> the period after this day; since the identity of &#1497;&#1493;&#1501; &#1506;&#1502;&#1491;&#1498; (the day of thy standing) in <a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-11.htm">Obadiah 1:11</a> with &#1497;&#1493;&#1501; &#1488;&#1495;&#1497;&#1498; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-12.htm">Obadiah 1:12</a> strikes the eye at once. The warning in <a href="http://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-12.htm">Obadiah 1:12-14</a> is only intelligible on the supposition, that Obadiah has not any particular conquest and plundering of Jerusalem in his mind, whether a future one or one that has already occurred, but regards this as an event that not only has already taken place, but will take place again: that is to say, on the assumption that he rises from the particular historical event to the idea which it embodied, and that, starting from this, he sees in the existing case all subsequent cases of a similar kind. From this ideal standpoint he could warn Edom of what it had already done, and designate the disastrous day which had come upon Judah and Jerusalem by different expressions as a day of the greatest calamity; for what Edom had done, and what had befallen Judah, were types of the future development of the fate of Judah and of the attitude of Edom towards it, which go on fulfilling themselves more and more until the day of the Lord upon all nations, upon the near approach of which Obadiah founds his warning in <a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-15.htm">Obadiah 1:15</a>. The warning proceeds in <a href="http://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-12.htm">Obadiah 1:12-14</a> from the general to the particular, or from the lower to the higher. Obadiah warns the Edomites, as Hitzig says, "not to rejoice in Judah's troubles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-12.htm">Obadiah 1:12</a>), nor to make common cause with the conquerors (<a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-13.htm">Obadiah 1:13</a>), nor to outdo and complete the work of the enemy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-14.htm">Obadiah 1:14</a>)." By the cop. Vav, which stands at the head of all the three clauses in <a href="http://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-12.htm">Obadiah 1:12</a>, the warning addressed to the Edomites, against such conduct as this, is linked on to what they had already done.<p>The three clauses of <a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-12.htm">Obadiah 1:12</a> contain a warning in a graduated form against malicious pleasure. &#1512;&#1488;&#1492; with &#1489;, to look at anything with pleasure, to take delight in it, affirms less than &#1513;&#1474;&#1502;&#1495; &#1489;, to rejoice, to proclaim one's joy without reserve. &#1492;&#1490;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500; &#1508;&#1468;&#1492;, to make the mouth large, is stronger still, like &#1492;&#1490;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500; &#1489;&#1468;&#1508;&#1492;, to boast, to do great things with the mouth, equivalent to &#1492;&#1512;&#1495;&#1497;&#1489; &#1508;&#1468;&#1492; &#1506;&#1500;, to make the mouth broad, to stretch it open, over (against) a person (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-21.htm">Psalm 35:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-4.htm">Isaiah 57:4</a>), a gesture indicating contempt and derision. The object of their malicious pleasure mentioned in the first clause is yo&#772;m 'a&#770;ch&#305;&#772;kha&#770;, the day of thy brother, i.e., the day upon which something strange happened to him, namely, what is mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-11.htm">Obadiah 1:11</a>. Yo&#772;m does not of itself signify the disastrous day, or day of ruin, either here or anywhere else; but it always receives the more precise definition from the context. If we were to adopt the rendering "disastrous day," it would give rise to a pure tautology when taken in connection with what follows. The expression 'a&#770;ch&#305;&#772;kha&#770; (of thy brother) justifies the warning. &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493;&#1501; &#1504;&#1499;&#1512;&#1493; is not in apposition to &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493;&#1501; &#1488;&#1495;&#1497;&#1498;, but, according to the parallelism of the clauses, it is a statement of time. &#1504;&#1499;&#1512;, &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;.  equals  &#1504;&#1499;&#1512; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-3.htm">Job 31:3</a>), fortuna aliena, a strange, i.e., hostile fate, not "rejection" (Hitzig, Caspari, and others). The expression &#1497;&#1493;&#1501; &#1488;&#1489;&#1491;&#1501;, the day of their (Judah's sons) perishing, is stronger still; although the perishing ('a&#774;bho&#772;d) of the sons of Judah cannot denote the destruction of the whole nation, since the following word tsrh, calamity, is much too weak to admit of this. Even the word &#1488;&#1497;&#1491;, which occurs three times in <a href="http://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-13.htm">Obadiah 1:13</a>, does not signify destruction, but (from the root &#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;, to fall heavily, to load) simply pressure, a burden, then weight of suffering, distress, misfortune (see Delitzsch on <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/18-12.htm">Job 18:12</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-13.htm">Obadiah 1:13</a> Obadiah warns against taking part in the plundering of Jerusalem. The gate of my people: for the city in which the people dwell, the capital (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-9.htm">Micah 1:9</a>). Look not thou also, a brother nation, upon his calamity, as enemies do, i.e., do not delight thyself thereat, nor snatch at his possessions. The form tishlachna&#770;h, for which we should expect tishlach, is not yet satisfactorily explained (for the different attempts that have been made to explain it, see Caspari). The passages in which na&#770;h is appended to the third pers. fem. sing., to distinguish it from the second person, do not help us to explain it. Ewald and Olshausen would therefore alter the text, and read &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495; &#1497;&#1491;. But &#1497;&#1491; is not absolutely necessary, since it is omitted in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-6.htm">2 Samuel 6:6</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-17.htm">2 Samuel 22:17</a>, or <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/18-17.htm">Psalm 18:17</a>, where sha&#770;lach occurs in the sense of stretching out the hand. &#1495;&#1497;&#1500;&#1493;, his possessions. On the fact itself, compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-5.htm">Joel 3:5</a>. The prominence given to the day of misfortune at the end of every sentence is very emphatic; "inasmuch as the selection of the time of a brother's calamity, as that in which to rage against him with such cunning and malicious pleasure, was doubly culpable" (Ewald). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-14.htm">Obadiah 1:14</a> the warning proceeds to the worst crime of all, their seizing upon the Judaean fugitives, for the purpose of murdering them or delivering them up to the enemy. Pereq signifies here the place where the roads break or divide, the cross-road. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/nahum/3-1.htm">Nahum 3:1</a>, the only other place in which it occurs, it signifies tearing in pieces, violence. Hisg&#305;&#772;r, to deliver up (lit., concludendum tradidit), is generally construed with  &#1488;&#1500;  (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-16.htm">Deuteronomy 23:16</a>) or  &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-9.htm">Psalm 31:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-11.htm">1 Samuel 23:11</a>). Here it is written absolutely with the same meaning: not "to apprehend, or so overpower that there is no escape left" (Hitzig). This would affirm too little after the preceding &#1492;&#1499;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514;, and cannot be demonstrated from <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/11-10.htm">Job 11:10</a>, where hisg&#305;&#772;r means to keep in custody. </body></html>
