When we complain to the Lord of the badness of the times, we ought to complain against ourselves for the badness of our hearts. We must depend upon God to work deliverance for us in due time. We must not only look to him, but look for him. In our greatest distresses, we shall see no reason to despair of salvation, if by faith we look to the Lord as the God of our salvation. Though enemies triumph and insult, they shall be silenced and put to shame. Though Zion's walls may long be in ruins, there will come a day when they shall be repaired. Israel shall come from all the remote parts, not turning back for discouragements. Though our enemies may seem to prevail against us, and to rejoice over us, we should not despond. Though cast down, we are not destroyed; we may join hope in God's mercy, with submission to his correction. No hinderances can prevent the favours the Lord intends for his church.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/micah/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>On this confession of unworthiness and trust the message of joy bursts in, with the abruptness and conciseness of Hosea or Nahum:<p>A day to build thy fences; (that is, cometh;)<p>That day, far shall be the degree;<p>That day, and he shall come quite to thee;<p>And there follows, in a longer but still remarkably measured and interrupted cadence, <p>the statement of the length and breadth from which the people shall come to her;<p>Up to and from Assyria and the cities of strong-land (Egypt;)<p>Up to and from strong-land and even to river (the Euphrates;)<p>And sea from sea, and mountain to mountain.<p>It is not human might or strength which God promises to restore. He had before predicted, that the kingdom of the Messiah should stand, not through earthly strength <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/5-9.htm">Micah 5:9-13</a>. He promises the restoration, not of city walls, but of the fence of the vineyard of God, which God foretold by Isaiah that He would "break down" <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-5.htm">Isaiah 5:5</a>. It is a peaceful renewal of her estate under God's protection, like that, with the promise whereof Amos closed his prophecy; "In that day I will raise up the tabernacle of David that is fallen, and close up the breaches thereof" <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/9-11.htm">Amos 9:11</a>. This decree, which he says shall be far away, might in itself be the decree either of God or of the enemy. The sense is the same, since the enemy was but the instrument of God. Yet it seems more in accordance with the language of the prophets, that it should be the decree of man. For the decree of God for the destruction of Jerusalem and the captivity of His people was accomplished, held its course, was fulfilled.<p>The destruction, captivity, restoration, were parts of one and the same decree of God, of which the restoration was the last accomplished in time. The restoration was not the removal, but the complete fulfillment, of the decree. He means then probably, that the decree of the enemy, whereby he held her captive, was to remove and be far off, not by any agency of her's . The people were to stream to her of themselves. One by one, shall all thy banished, captive, scattered, children be brought quite home unto thee from all parts of the earth, whither they have been driven, "from Assyria, and from strong-land". The name Matsor, which he gives to Egypt, modifying its ordinary dual name Mitsraim, is meant, at once to signify "Egypt" , and to mark the strength of the country; as, in fact, , "Egypt was on all sides by nature strongly guarded."<p>A country, which was still strong relatively to Judah, would not, of itself, yield up its prey, but held it straitly; yet it should have to disgorge it. Isaiah and Hosea prophesied, in like way, the return of Israel and Judah from Assyria and from Egypt. "And from strong-land even to the river" <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-11.htm">Isaiah 11:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/27-13.htm">Isaiah 27:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/11-11.htm">Hosea 11:11</a> (Euphrates); the ancient, widest, boundary of the promised land; "and from sea to sea, and from mountain to mountain" <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-31.htm">Exodus 23:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-7.htm">Deuteronomy 1:7</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-24.htm">Deuteronomy 11:24</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/1-4.htm">Joshua 1:4</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-21.htm">1 Kings 4:21</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-24.htm">1 Kings 4:24</a>. These last are too large to be the real boundaries of the land. If understood geographically, it would by narrowig those which had just been spoken of, from Egypt to the Euphratcs. Joel likens the destruction of the Northern army to the perishing of locusts in the two opposite seas, the Dead sea and the Mediterranean <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-20.htm">Joel 2:20</a>; but the Dead sea was not the entire Eastern boundary of all Israel. Nor are there any mountains on the South, answering to Mount Libanus on the North. Not the mountains of Edom which lay to the South-East, but the desert <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-31.htm">Exodus 23:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/34-3.htm">Numbers 34:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-24.htm">Deuteronomy 11:24</a> was the Southern boundary of Judah. In the times too of their greatest prosperity, Edom, Moab, Ammon, Syria, had been subject to them.<p>The rule of the Messiah "from sea to sea" had already been predicted by Solomon , enlarging the boundaries of the promised land to the whole compass of the world, from the sea, their bound westward, to the further encircling sea beyond all habitable land, in which, in fact, our continents are large islands . To this, Micah adds a new description, "from mountain to mountain", including, probably, all subdivisions in our habitable earth, as the words, "sea to sea", had embraced it as a whole. For, physically and to sight, mountains are the great natural divisions of our earth. Rivers are but a means of transit. The Euphrates and the Nile were the centers of the kingdoms which lay upon them. Each range of mountains, as it rises on the horizon, seems to present an insuperable barrier. No barrier should avail to hinder the inflow to the Gospel. As Isaiah foretold that all obstacles should be removed, "every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low" <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-4.htm">Isaiah 40:4</a>, so Micah prophesies, "from mountain to mountain they shall come".<p>The words are addressed as a promise and consolation to the Jews, and so, doubtless, the restoration of the Jews to their own land after the captivity is foretold here, as Micah had already foretold it <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-10.htm">Micah 4:10</a>. But is the whole limited to this? He says, with remarkable indefiniteness, there shall come . He does not say, who "shall come." But he twice sets two opposite boundaries, from which men should come; and, since these boundaries, not being coincident, cannot be predicted of one and the same subject, there must be two distinct incomings. The Jews were to come from those two countries, whither its people were then to be carried captive or would flee. From the boundaries of the world, the world was to come.<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/micah/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. In that day also&#8212;rather, an answer to the supposed question of Zion, When shall my walls be built? "The day (of thy walls being built) is the day when he (that is, many) shall come to thee from Assyria," &c. [Ludovicus De Dieu]. The Assyrians (including the Babylonians) who spoiled thee shall come.<p>and from the fortified cities&#8212;rather, to suit the parallelism, "from Assyria even to Egypt." (Matzor may be so translated). So Assyria and Egypt are contrasted in Isa 19:23 [Maurer]. Calvin agrees with English Version, "from all fortified cities."<p>from the fortress even to the river&#8212;"from Egypt even to the river" Euphrates (answering in parallelism to "Assyria") [Maurer].

Which words also are not directed to the enemy, as some interpret them; as to Chaldea or Babylon; and the sense be, that Cyrus should come thither, and take it; or any more remote enemy of the Jews in the latter day, to whom the day of the Lord should come, or his decree of vengeance or judgment upon them, or any enemy to waste and destroy them; but they are a continued address to Jerusalem or the church, signifying that "he", the people of the Jews, the body of them, with the proselyted Gentiles, should come from all parts to Jerusalem to rebuild it upon the decree of Cyrus; and that multitudes of all, or at least many nations, should flock to the church of Christ, upon the publication of the Gospel: <p>from Assyria: where many of the Jews, and even of the ten tribes, were, whither they were carried captive: <p>and from the fortified cities; in Assyria, and other countries, where the Jews might be placed, either as prisoners, or to do servile work, as repairing the fortifications; or for the defence of the country, from which they were to be and were released upon Cyrus taking of Babylon; and was a type of the redemption by Christ from greater bondage.

It may respect the extent of the church and kingdom of Christ in the latter day, enlarged by the numerous conversions of Jews and Gentiles in all parts of the world. The Jews shall be gathered from all places where they are, and join themselves to the church of Christ; and these several places, particularly Assyria, Egypt and the islands of the sea from whence they shall be brought, are mentioned in other prophecies; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-11.htm">Isaiah 11:11</a>; though this may respect, not barely the conversion and gathering of them to Christ and his church, but of the Gentiles also in those several countries, thus; they "shall come from Assyria, and the fortified cities"; that is, from the Turkish empire; the land of Assyria, and its fortified cities, being in the possession of the Turks, and in whose dominions many Jews at this day reside; and not only they, but multitudes in the Ottoman empire, shall be converted in the latter day, and become members of Christian churches; signified by the flocks of Kedar, and the rams of Nebaioth, that shall be gathered to the church, and minister there, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-7.htm">Isaiah 60:7</a>; and they shall come "from the fortress even to the river"; from everyone of the fortified cities before mentioned to the river Euphrates, which will be dried up to make way for the kings or kingdoms of the east, for their conversion to Christ, and embracing his Gospel; even the large kingdoms of Persia, Tartary, China, &amp;c. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/16-12.htm">Revelation 16:12</a>; or "from Egypt to the river Euphrates"; and so signifies the same as before, Egypt being part of the Turkish dominions; or else the Roman jurisdiction, spiritually called Egypt, may be meant, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-8.htm">Revelation 11:8</a>; and in several Popish countries are many Jews, who will be called from thence; as well as many of the Papists themselves shall be called out of mystical Babylon, and embrace the true religion of Christ: "and from sea to sea"; this is a well known description of the amplitude of Christ's church and kingdom in Gospel times, especially in the latter day; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-8.htm">Psalm 72:8</a>; or, as it may be rendered, "the sea from the sea" (e); that is, the inhabitants of the sea, or of the islands of it, shall come from thence to the church, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-11.htm">Isaiah 11:11</a>; these are the same with the abundance of the sea, that shall be converted to Christ, and join his people in the latter day, as in our isle and others, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-5.htm">Isaiah 40:5</a>; "and from mountain to mountain"; or rather, "and mountain shall come to the mountain" (f); that is, the inhabitants of the mountain, or of Rome, that is situated on seven mountains, of mystical Babylon, the great mountain; these shall be called from hence to Mount Zion, the church of the living God, where Christ with the 144,000 will be; and which shall then be established on the top of the mountains, and all nations shall flow unto it, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-1.htm">Revelation 14:1</a>.

While the judgment is falling upon all the heathen nations, Mount Zion will be an asylum for those who are delivered. Judah and Israel will capture the possessions of the nations, destroy Edom, and extend its borders on every side (<a href="http://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-17.htm">Obadiah 1:17-19</a>). The Israelites scattered among the nations will return into their enlarged inheritances, and upon Zion will saviours arise, to judge Edom, and the kingdom will then be the Lord's (<a href="http://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-20.htm">Obadiah 1:20</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-21.htm">Obadiah 1:21</a>). This promise is appended as an antithesis to the proclamation of judgment in <a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-16.htm">Obadiah 1:16</a>.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-17.htm">Obadiah 1:17</a><p>"But upon Mount Zion will be that which has been saved, and it will be a sanctuary, and the house of Jacob will take possession of their possessions." Upon Mount Zion, which the Edomites have now desecrated by drinking carousals, there will then, when the nations are obliged to drink the cup of intoxication even to their utter destruction, be pele&#772;ta&#770;h, that which has escaped, i.e., the multitude of those who have been rescued and preserved throughout the judgment. See the explanation of this at <a href="http://biblehub.com/joel/2-32.htm">Joel 2:32</a>, where this thought is still further expounded. Mount Zion is the seat of the kingdom of Jehovah (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-21.htm">Obadiah 1:21</a>). There the Lord is enthroned (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-17.htm">Joel 3:17</a>), and His rescued people with Him. And it (Mount Zion) will be qo&#772;desh, a sanctuary, i.e., inviolable; the heathen will no more dare to tread it and defile it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-17.htm">Joel 3:17</a>). It follows from this, that the rescued crowd upon it will also be a holy people (" a holy seed," <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-13.htm">Isaiah 6:13</a>). This sanctified people of the Lord, the house of Jacob, will capture the possessions of their foes. The suffix attached to &#1502;&#1493;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; is supposed by many to refer to &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; &#1497;&#1506;&#1511;&#1489;: those of the house of Jacob, i.e., the rescued Israelites, will take their former possessions once more. This view cannot be overthrown by the simple remark that ya&#770;rash cannot mean to take possession again; for that meaning might be given to it by the context, as, for example, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/30-5.htm">Deuteronomy 30:5</a>. But it is a decisive objection to it, that neither in what precedes nor in what follows is there any reference to Israel as having been carried away. The penetration of foes into the gates of Jerusalem, the plundering of the city, and the casting of lots upon the booty and the prisoners (<a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-11.htm">Obadiah 1:11</a>), do not involve the carrying away of the whole nation into exile; and the ga&#770;lu&#772;th of the sons of Israel and Jerusalem in <a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-20.htm">Obadiah 1:20</a> is clearly distinguished from the "house of Jacob" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-18.htm">Obadiah 1:18</a>. And since we have first of all (<a href="http://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-18.htm">Obadiah 1:18</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-19.htm">Obadiah 1:19</a>) an announcement of the conquest of Edom by the house of Jacob, and the capture of the mountains of Esau, of Philistia, etc., by the inhabitants of the south-land, i.e., by Judaeans; and then in <a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-20.htm">Obadiah 1:20</a> the possession of the south-land is promised to the ga&#770;luth (captivity); this ga&#770;luth can only have been a small fragment of the nation, and therefore the carrying away can only have extended to a number of prisoners of war, whilst the kernel of the nation had remained in the land, i.e., in its own possessions. The objection offered to this, namely, that if we refer the suffix in mo&#772;ra&#770;she&#772;hem (their possessions) to ko&#774;l-haggo&#772;y&#305;&#772;m (all nations), Judah would have to take possession of all nations, which is quite incredible and even at variance with <a href="http://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-19.htm">Obadiah 1:19</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-20.htm">Obadiah 1:20</a>, inasmuch as the only enemies' land mentioned there (<a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-19.htm">Obadiah 1:19</a>) is the territory of the Edomites and Philistines, whilst the other countries or portions of country mentioned there are not enemies' land at all. For there is no incredibility in the taking of the land of all nations by Judah, except on the assumption that Judah merely denotes the posterity or remnant of the citizens of the earthly kingdom of Judah. But this is not what Obadiah says. He does not mention Judah, but the house of Jacob, and means thereby not the natural Israel, but the people of God, who are eventually to obtain the dominion of the world. The discrepancy between <a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-17.htm">Obadiah 1:17</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-19.htm">Obadiah 1:19</a> is not greater than that between &#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1497;&#1514;&#1501; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-16.htm">Obadiah 1:16</a> and &#1497;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; &#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-16.htm">Obadiah 1:16</a>, and disappears if we only recognise the fact that Edom and the Philistines are simply mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-19.htm">Obadiah 1:19</a> as types of the heathen world in its hostility to god. We therefore regard the application of the expression mo&#772;ra&#770;she&#772;hem to the possessions of the heathen nations as the only correct one, and that all the more because the &#1493;&#1497;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-19.htm">Obadiah 1:19</a> is very clearly seen to be a more exact explanation of the &#1493;&#1497;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-17.htm">Obadiah 1:17</a>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-17.htm">Obadiah 1:17</a> Obadiah gives, in a few brief words, the sum and substance of the salvation which awaits the people of the Lord in the future. This salvation is unfolded still further in what follows, and first of all in <a href="http://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-18.htm">Obadiah 1:18</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-19.htm">Obadiah 1:19</a>, by a fuller exposition of the thought expressed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-17.htm">Obadiah 1:17</a>. </body></html>
