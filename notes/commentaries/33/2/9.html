Let the physician no longer attend the patient that will not be healed. Those are enemies, not only to God, but to their country, who silence good ministers, and stop the means of grace. What bonds will hold those who have no reverence for God's word? Sinners cannot expect to rest in a land they have polluted. You shall not only be obliged to depart out of this land, but it shall destroy you. Apply this to our state in this present world. There is corruption in the world through lust, and we should keep at a distance from it. It is not our rest: it was designed for our passage, but not for our portion; our inn, but not our home; here we have no continuing city; let us therefore arise and depart, let us seek a continuing city above. Since they will be deceived, let them be deceived. Teachers who recommend self-indulgence by their doctrine and example, best suit such sinners.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/micah/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The women of my people have ye cast out from their pleasant houses - (literally, from her pleasant house,) each from her home. These were probably the widows of those whom they had stripped. Since the houses were their's, they were widows; and so their spoilers were at war with those whom God had committed to their special love, whom He had declared the objects of His own tender care, "the widows and the fatherless." The widows they "drove vehemently forth", as having no portion in the inheritance which God had given them, as God had driven out their enemies before them, each "from her pleasant house," the home where she had lived with her husband and children in delight and joy.<p>From (off) their (young) children have ye taken away My glory - Primarily, the glory, comeliness, was the fitting apparel which God had given them (as <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-11.htm">Hosea 2:11</a>), and laid upon them , and which these oppressors stripped off from them. But it includes all the gifts of God, wherewith God would array them. Instead of the holy home of parental care, the children grew up in want and neglect, away from all the ordinances of God, it may be, in a strange land. "For ever." They never repented, never made restitution; but so they incurred the special woe of those who ill-used the unprotected, the widow, and the fatherless. The words "forever" anticipate the punishment. The punishment is according to the sin. They never ceased their oppression. They, with the generation who should come after them, should be deprived of God's "glory," and cast out of His land forever. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/micah/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9.

Not content to slay their husbands, they took their wives or widows captive, dispossessed them of their habitations, where they had lived delightfully with their husbands and children; so we find that, at the time before referred to, the people of Israel carried captive of their brethren two hundred thousand women, and brought them to Samaria, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-8.htm">2 Chronicles 28:8</a>. Some understand this of divorce, which those men were the cause of, either by committing adultery with them, which was a just reason for their husband's divorcing them; or by frequenting their houses, which caused suspicion and jealousy: <p>from their children have ye taken away my glory for ever; that which God would have had glory from, and they would have given it to him on account of; as their being brought up in a religious way; their liberties, both civil and religious; their paternal estates and inheritances, and the enjoyment of their own land; and especially the worship of God in the temple, of which they were deprived by being carried away from their own country: or it may be understood of the glory that accrues to God by honourable marriage, and the bed undefiled; and the dishonour cast upon him by the contrary, as well as upon children, who may be suspected to be illegitimate. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/micah/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The women of my people have ye cast out from their pleasant houses; from their children have ye taken away <span class="cverse3">{k}</span> my glory for ever.</span><p>(k) That is, their substance and living, which is God's blessing, and as it were part of his glory.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/micah/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">9</span>. <span class="ital">The women of my people</span>] i.e. the unprotected widows.

The "glory" is by some commentators, but not so appositely, referred to vesture exclusively.

"They who lie upon beds of ivory, and stretch themselves upon their couches, and eat lambs from the flock, and calves out of the fattening stall. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-5.htm">Amos 6:5</a>. Who prattle to the tune of the harp; like David, they invent string instruments. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-6.htm">Amos 6:6</a>. Who drink wine out of sacrificial bowls, and anoint themselves with the best oils, and do not afflict themselves for the hurt of Joseph." They lie stretched, as it were poured out (&#1505;&#1512;&#1495;&#1497;&#1501;), upon beds inlaid with ivory, to feast and fill their belly with the flesh of the best lambs and fattened calves, to the playing of harps and singing, in which they take such pleasure, that they invent new kinds of playing and singing. The &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;. pa&#770;rat, to strew around (cf. peret in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-10.htm">Leviticus 19:10</a>), in Arabic to throw many useless words about, to gossip, describes the singing at the banquets as frivolous nonsense. &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497; &#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1512;, articles or instruments of singing, are not musical instruments generally, but, as we may see from <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-12.htm">2 Chronicles 34:12</a>, compared with <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-26.htm">2 Chronicles 29:26-27</a>, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-5.htm">1 Chronicles 23:5</a>, the stringed instruments that were either invented by David (e.g., the nebel), or arranged by him for the sacred song of the temple, together with the peculiar mode of playing them; in other words, "the playing upon stringed instruments introduced by David." Consequently the meaning of <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-5.htm">Amos 6:5</a> is the following: As David invented stringed instruments in honour of his God in heaven, so do these princes invent playing and singing for their god, the belly. The meaning to invent or devise, which Baur will not allow to &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;, is established beyond all doubt by <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/31-4.htm">Exodus 31:4</a>. They drink thereby out of sacrificial bowls of wine, i.e., drink wine out of sacrificial bowls. &#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1492; with &#1489;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/44-5.htm">Genesis 44:5</a>. Mizra&#770;q, in the plural mizra&#770;q&#305;&#772;m and mizra&#770;qo&#772;th, from za&#770;raq, to sprinkle, was the name given both to the vessels used for the sprinkling of the blood, and also to the bowls made use of for pouring the libation of wine upon the table of shew-bread (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/4-8.htm">2 Chronicles 4:8</a>). This word is applied by Amos to the bowls out of which the gluttons drank their wine; with special reference to the offering of silver sacrificial bowls made by the tribe-princes at the consecration of the altar (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/7.htm">Numbers 7</a>), to show that whereas the tribe-princes of Israel in the time of Moses manifested their zeal for the service of Jehovah by presenting sacrificial bowls of silver, the princes of his own time showed just as much zeal in their care for their god, the belly. Mizra&#770;q&#305;&#772;m does not mean "rummers, or pitchers used for mixing wine." Lastly, Amos refers to their anointing themselves with the firstling of the oils, i.e., the best oils, as a sign of unbridled rejoicing, inasmuch as the custom of anointing was suspended in time of mourning (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-2.htm">2 Samuel 14:2</a>), for the purpose of appending the antithesis &#1493;&#1500;&#1488; &#1490;&#1495;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;, they do not afflict or grieve themselves for the ruin of Israel. She&#772;bher, breach, injury, destruction. Joseph signifies the people and kingdom of the ten tribes. </body></html>
