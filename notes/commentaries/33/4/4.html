It describes the state of the Israelites under Solomon—“Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and under his fig tree, from Dan even unto Beersheba, all the days of Solomon.” The vine and the fig-tree are the representative trees of Palestine.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/micah/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:1-8 The nations have not yet so submitted to the Prince of Peace, as to beat their swords into ploughshares, nor has war ceased. But very precious promises these are, relating to the gospel church, which will be more and more fulfilled, for He is faithful that has promised. There shall be a glorious church for God set up in the world, in the last days, in the days of the Messiah. Christ himself will build it upon a rock. The Gentiles worshipped their idol gods; but in the period spoken of, the people will cleave to the Lord with full purpose of heart, and delight in doing his will. The word halteth, describes those who walk not according to the Divine word. The collecting the captives from Babylon was an earnest of healing, purifying, and prospering the church; and the reign of Christ shall continue till succeeded by the everlasting kingdom of heaven. Let us stir up each other to attend the ordinances of God, that we may learn his holy ways, and walk in them, receiving the law from his hands, which, being written in our hearts by his Spirit, may show our interest in the Redeemer's righteousness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/micah/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But - And<p>They shall sit every man, under his vine and under his fig-tree - Palestine was a home of the vine and the fig-tree. Vineyards were a common property, possessed by all but the very poor , or even by them <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/5-4.htm">Nehemiah 5:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-10.htm">Jeremiah 39:10</a>. The land was "a land of bread and vineyards" <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-32.htm">2 Kings 18:32</a>. The vine was the emblem of the people, in Psalmists and prophets (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80-8.htm">Psalm 80:8</a> ff; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-14.htm">Isaiah 3:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-1.htm">Isaiah 5:1</a> ff; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/27-2.htm">Isaiah 27:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-21.htm">Jeremiah 2:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-10.htm">Jeremiah 12:10</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/15-1.htm">Ezekiel 15:1-8</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-5.htm">Ezekiel 17:5-10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/19-10.htm">Ezekiel 19:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/10-1.htm">Hosea 10:1</a>). The bunch of grapes or the vine-leaf appear as characteristic emblems on Jewish coins , chiefly in the times of their revolts under Vespasian and Hadrian . The fig is also mentioned as part of the characteristic fruitfulness of Palestine <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-8.htm">Deuteronomy 8:8</a>.<p>It too was an universal property <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-32.htm">2 Kings 18:32</a>. Both formed natural arbors; the fig had its name probably from its length, the vine from the arch made by its drooping boughs. Both formed, in those hot countries, a grateful shade. The vine, rising with its single stem, was spread over trellis-work or by props, so as to enclose a considerable space . Even in Italy, a single vine shaded a portico . In Palestine it grew by the walls of the house <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/128-3.htm">Psalm 128:3</a>.<p>Rabbis relate how their forefathers sat and studied under the fig-tree , as Nathanael was doubtless meditating or praying under one, when Jesus, being God, saw him <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-48.htm">John 1:48</a>. It exhibits a picture of domestic peace, each family gathered in harmony and rest under the protection of God, each content with what they have, neither coveting another's, nor disturbed in their own. Wine is explained in Holy Scripture to be an emblem of gladness, and the fig of sweetness . Cyril: "For exceeding sweet is the word of the Saviour, and it knoweth how to gladden man's heart; sweet also and full of joy is the hope of the future, wherewith we are enriched in Christ.<p>Such had been Israel's lot in the peaceful days of Solomon <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-25.htm">1 Kings 4:25</a>, the peace of whose times had already been made the image of the Gospel <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/72.htm">Psalm 72</a>; the coming of the Queen of the South from the uttermost parts of the earth, to hear the wisdom of Solomon <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/12-42.htm">Matthew 12:42</a>, had made her kingdom to be selected as an emblem of those who should fall down before Christ and serve Him <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/60-12.htm">Psalm 60:12</a> :10-11.

These proverbial allusions do assure us that they who were redeemed out of Babylon, and the servitude of sin, should enjoy their own with great safety and security, which literally was performed to the returned, resettled captives, and spiritually or mystically is made good among those that are redeemed by Christ, and who embrace the gospel. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">For the mouth of the Lord of hosts hath spoken it:</span> this gives us the greatest confirmation and assurance of the future accomplishment of the prediction and promise; the merciful, wise, faithful, and almighty God hath spoken it; he hath promised it, whose word spoken, commanding it should be, can make their state what he saith it shall be. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/micah/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But they shall sit every man under his vine, and under his fig tree,.... A proverbial phrase, expressive of the greatest tranquillity, security, and enjoyment of property; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-25.htm">1 Kings 4:25</a>; when persons need not keep within their walled towns and cities, and lack themselves up in their houses, but may sit down in their gardens, fields, and vineyards, and enjoy the fruit thereof; as the Targum interprets it, <p>"under the fruit of his vine, and under, the fruit of his fig tree.'' <p>It was usual for persons in the eastern countries to sit under vines and fig trees to read, meditate, pray, or converse together, where they grow very large, as were their vines; and even with us they are frequently raised and carried over supporters, so as to be sat under; and of fig trees, we frequently read in Jewish writings of their being very large, and of their going up to them, and praying on the top of them; and of sitting under them, and studying in the law there. So one of the Rabbins says (p), he went up into his mustard tree, as one goes up to the top of a fig tree; and it is said (q), he that prays on the top of an olive tree, or on the top of a fig tree must come down, and pray below; and again (r), R. Jacob and his companions were fasting, studying in the law, under a certain fig tree; and sometimes they speak of all these together, of sitting under olives, and under vines, and under fig trees, and studying in the words of the law (s); see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-48.htm">John 1:48</a>. This is to be understood, as Aben Ezra and Kimchi explain it, of all men; not of the Israelites only, but of all nations, since there will be no more war any where; hence it follows: <p>and none shall make them afraid; the enemies of God's people will be no more, neither Turk nor pope, eastern or western antichrist, beast or, false prophet; wherefore, in those days of the Messiah, Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely, even all the spiritual Israel of God, Jews and Gentiles; there shall be none to hurt in the holy mountain of the Lord, or any violence and oppression, wasting and destruction, anywhere; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5</a>; <p>for the mouth of the Lord of hosts hath spoken it; who speaks nothing but truth, and who is able and faithful to perform what he has spoken; and therefore all this may be depended on. <p>(p) T.

The old agricultural ideal. The depression of the peasantry, owing to the growing concentration of wealth, naturally made a peasant-prophet like Micah look forward with hope to a reaction, when each family should have its own allotment of land.

That this attempt to drive Amos out of Bethel was occasioned by his prophecy in <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/7-7.htm">Amos 7:7-11</a>, is evident from what Amaziah says to the king concerning the words of Amos. "The priest of Bethel" (Ko&#772;he&#772;n Be&#772;th-e&#772;l) is the high priest at the sanctuary of the golden calf at Bethel. He accused the prophet to the king of having made a conspiracy (qa&#770;shar; cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-27.htm">1 Kings 15:27</a>, etc.) against the king, and that "in the midst of the house of Israel," i.e., in the centre of the kingdom of Israel - namely at Bethel, the religious centre of the kingdom - through all his sayings, which the land could not bear. To establish this charge, he states (in <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/7-11.htm">Amos 7:11</a>) that Amos has foretold the death of Jeroboam by the sword, and the carrying away of the people out of the land. Amos had really said this. The fact that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/7-9.htm">Amos 7:9</a> Jeroboam is named, and not the house of Jeroboam, makes no difference; for the head of the house if naturally included in the house itself. And the carrying away of the people out of the land was not only implied in the announcement of the devastation of the sanctuaries of the kingdom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/7-9.htm">Amos 7:9</a>), which presupposes the conquest of the land by foes; but Amos had actually predicted it in so many words (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-27.htm">Amos 5:27</a>). And Amaziah naturally gave the substance of all the prophet's addresses, instead of simply confining himself to the last. There is no reason, therefore, to think of intentional slander. </body></html>
