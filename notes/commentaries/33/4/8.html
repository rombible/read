There shall be a glorious church for God set up in the world, in the last days, in the days of the Messiah. Christ himself will build it upon a rock. The Gentiles worshipped their idol gods; but in the period spoken of, the people will cleave to the Lord with full purpose of heart, and delight in doing his will.

The collecting the captives from Babylon was an earnest of healing, purifying, and prospering the church; and the reign of Christ shall continue till succeeded by the everlasting kingdom of heaven.

There Jacob fed his sheep <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/35-21.htm">Genesis 35:21</a>, and there (since it was hard by Bethlehem) the shepherds, keeping watch over their flocks by night, saw and heard the Angels singing, "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men." The Jews inferred from this place that the Messiah should be revealed there .<p>Stronghold - (Ophel ) of the daughter of Zion Ophel was a strong place in the South of Jerusalem, the last which the wall, enclosing Zion, reached, before, or as, it touched on the Eastern porch of the temple , with whose service it was connected.<p>We know that, after the captivity, the Nethinim, who did the laborious service of the temple, dwelt there <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-26.htm">Nehemiah 3:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-21.htm">Nehemiah 11:21</a>. It lay very near to the priests' district <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-28.htm">Nehemiah 3:28</a>. It was probably, a lower acclivity, "swelling out," (as its name seems to mean ,) from the mountain of the temple. In the last war, it was held together with  "the temple, and the adjoining parts to no slight extent, and the valley of Kedron." It was burnt  before the upper city was taken. It had been encircled by a wall of old; for Jotham "built greatly upon its wall" <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/27-3.htm">2 Chronicles 27:3</a>, Manasseh "encircled it" <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-14.htm">2 Chronicles 33:14</a>, (probably with an outer wall) "and raised it exceedingly," that is, apparently raised artificially the whole level.<p>Yet, as a symbol of all Jerusalem, Ophel is as remarkable, as the "tower of the flock" is as to Bethlehem. For Ophel, although fortified, is no where spoken of, as of any account . It is not even mentioned in the circuit of the walls, at their dedication, under Nehemiah Neh 12:31-40, probably as an outlying, spot. It was probably of moment chiefly, as giving, an advantage to an enemy who might occupy it.<p>Both then are images of lowliness. The lonely Shepherd tower, for Bethlehem, the birthplace of David; Ophel for Jerusalem, of which it was yet but an outlying part, and deriving its value probably as an outwork of the temple. Both symbols anticipate the fuller prophecy of the littleness, which shall become great in God. Before the mention of the greatness of the "dominion to come," is set forth the future poverty to which it should come. In lowliness Christ came, yet is indeed a Tower protecting and defending the sheep of His pasture, founded on earth in His Human Nature, reaching to Heaven in His divine; "a strong Tower; the righteous runneth into it, and is safe" <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/18-10.htm">Proverbs 18:10</a>.<p>Unto thee shall it come - (Literally, "unto thee shall it come , and there shall arrive etc.") He saith not at first what shall come, and so raises the soul to think of the greatness of that which should come. The soul is left to fill up what is more than thought can utter. "Unto thee," (literally, quite up to thee) No hindrances should withhold it from coming. Seemingly it was a great way off, and they in a very hopeless state. He suggests the difficulty even by his strength of assurance. One could not say, "it shall come quite up to thee," of that which in the way of nature would readily come to any one. But amid all hindrances God's Might makes its way, and brings His gifts and promises to their end. "And there shall arrive." He twice repeats the assurance, in equivalent words, for their fuller assurance , "to make the good tidings the gladder by repeating and enforcing them."<p>The "first or former, dominion." The word often stands, as our "former" , in contrast with the "later." It is not necessarily "the first," strictly; and so here, not the "dominion" of David and Solomon exclusively. Rather the prophet is placed in spirit in the later times when the kingdom should be suspended, and foretells that "the former dominion," that is, that of the line of David, should come to her, not in its temporal greatness, but the line itself. So the Angel said, "He shall be great and shall be called the Son of the Highest, and the Lord God shall give unto Him the throne of His father David, and He shall reign over the house of Jacob forever" <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-32.htm">Luke 1:32-33</a>.<p>The (A) kingdom to the daughter of Jerusalem - that is, a kingdom, which should not be of her, but which should come to her; not her's by right, but by His right, who should merit it for her, and, being King of kings, makes His own, "kings and priests unto God and His Father" <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-6.htm">Revelation 1:6</a>.<p>The Jews themselves seem to have taken these words into their own mouths, just before they rejected Him, when they hoped that He would be a king, such as they wished for.

Jerusalem is called the "tower," from which the King and Shepherd observes and guards His flock: both the spiritual Jerusalem, the Church now whose tower-like elevation is that of doctrine and practice (So 4:4, "Thy neck is like the tower of David"), and the literal hereafter (Jer 3:17). In large pastures it was usual to erect a high wooden tower, so as to oversee the flock. Jerome takes the Hebrew for "flock," Eder or Edar, as a proper name, namely, a village near Beth-lehem, for which it is put, Beth-lehem being taken to represent the royal stock of David (Mic 5:2; compare Ge 35:21).

The words "Migdal Eder" are left by some untranslated, and think that place to be intended so called, which was near to Bethlehem, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-19.htm">Genesis 35:19</a>; and perhaps is the same which Jerom (t) calls the tower of Ader, about a mile from Bethlehem: this is supposed to be the place where the shepherds were watching over their flocks at the time of Christ's birth, the tidings of which were first brought to them here; and the Jewish (u) doctors speak of it as near Jerusalem, and as a place of pasture; for they say, that cattle between Jerusalem and Migdal Eder, and in an equal space to every wind; the males were used for burnt offerings, and the females for peace offerings; and this place is thought to be referred to in the latter clause of this verse: others think that Bethlehem itself is meant, to which the dominion came; but rather, as in the next chapter, the ruler came out of that; others think that the gate in Jerusalem called the sheep gate is meant, <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-32.htm">Nehemiah 3:32</a>; and the tower at it, through which Christ is supposed to pass when he entered into Jerusalem as King, amidst the Hosannahs of the people; others take it to be the same with the tower of David, and put for Jerusalem itself, whither the tribes were gathered together three times a year, like sheep in a fold, so Kimchi and Ben Melech; here others interpret it spiritually of the church of Christ; but though that is sometimes spoken of as a strong city, and a fortified place, yet is never called a tower, or a strong hold; which phrases, when figuratively used, are always spoken of a divine person; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a>; and here of the Messiah; and so the Targum interprets it, <p>"O Christ of Israel:'' <p>the church indeed is the "flock": the people of God are often compared to sheep for their harmlessness and innocence, and the church to a flock of them, which is Christ's flock he feeds like a shepherd; the flock of slaughter, a little one, consisting of persons separated from the world, and under his peculiar care; and he is the tower of this flock, in allusion to a shepherd's cottage, called a tower, as a cottage in a vineyard is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-2.htm">Isaiah 5:2</a>; where the shepherds watch, and into which they bring the sick and lame, and take care of them; Christ is a high tower, where his people are safe out of the reach of their enemies; and a strong one, being the mighty God and mighty Saviour, who has all power and strength to defend his church and people, and may be well called their tower: and <p>the strong hold of the daughter of Zion; "the daughter of Zion" is the church, particularly the church of the converted Jews; Christ is the strong hold of it, into which, as prisoners of hope, they will be directed to turn, <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/9-12.htm">Zechariah 9:12</a>; a strong refuge he is to flee unto from the avenger of blood, the justice of God; from the curses of the law; from the storm of divine wrath; from the temptations of Satan, and from the persecutions of men; a strong hold is he to dwell in, and where the saints dwell safely, pleasantly, at ease and peace, and very comfortably, and in great plenty; a strong hold for shelter from every enemy: <p>unto thee shall it come; not the kingdom, as follows, which our version leads to, and is the sense of Aben Ezra; for there is a considerable accent on the word "come", which makes a large stop; and that it refers, as Jarchi observes, to "her that halteth", &amp;c. "it" or "she" that halteth shall come, being assembled and gathered, or converted by the grace of God unto the Messiah; as to her, or their tower and strong hold, where all blessings of grace, and the supplies of it, and all salvation and safety, are to be had and enjoyed. The promise respects the Jews coming to Christ upon their conversion, even such who have been the halt, the maimed, the lame, and the blind: <p>even the first dominion; the kingdom shall come to the daughter of Jerusalem; or rather, "and the first dominion shall come, the kingdom to the daughter of Jerusalem": meaning, not the first notice of the Messiah's kingdom, given by John the Baptist, Christ, and his apostles, to the Jews, in the first times of the Gospel; or the preaching of the Gospel of the kingdom first to them; but rather he who has the first or principal dominion, and to whom the kingdom belongs, he shall come to the daughter of Zion, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/9-9.htm">Zechariah 9:9</a>; though it rather respects here his coming to them at the time of their conversion, when they shall come to him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-26.htm">Romans 11:26</a>; and when the first, chief, and principal kingdom in the world, and which is preferable to all others, will come unto, and be placed among them, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-7.htm">Micah 4:7</a>; and when it shall be, as some interpret it, as at the beginning, in the days of David and Solomon, and much more abundantly. <p>(t) De locis Hebr. fol. 89.

The revival of the Kingdom of David; misery of the preceding period<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">8</span>. <span class="ital">And thou, O tower of the flock</span>, &c.] It is clear that the prophet intends Jerusalem, which he addresses by an enigmatical title, to arrest attention and stimulate reflexion. (Other instances of this, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-5.htm" title="For it is a day of trouble, and of treading down, and of perplexity by the Lord GOD of hosts in the valley of vision, breaking down the walls, and of crying to the mountains.">Isaiah 22:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-1.htm" title="Woe to Ariel, to Ariel, the city where David dwelled! add you year to year; let them kill sacrifices.">Isaiah 29:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-13.htm" title="Behold, I am against you, O inhabitant of the valley, and rock of the plain, said the LORD; which say, Who shall come down against us? or who shall enter into our habitations?">Jeremiah 21:13</a>.) But why does he select this particular title? Two answers may be given. It was either (1) suggested by the figurative description of Israel as a flock (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-6.htm" title="In that day, said the LORD, will I assemble her that halts, and I will gather her that is driven out, and her that I have afflicted;">Micah 4:6</a></span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/2-12.htm" title="I will surely assemble, O Jacob, all of you; I will surely gather the remnant of Israel; I will put them together as the sheep of Bozrah, as the flock in the middle of their fold: they shall make great noise by reason of the multitude of men.">Micah 2:12</a>), or (2) by the situation of a tower called ‘the tower of the flock’ between Jerusalem and Bethlehem—Bethlehem, which was appointed to be the birthplace of the Messianic King (<a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/5-2.htm" title="But you, Bethlehem Ephratah, though you be little among the thousands of Judah, yet out of you shall he come forth to me that is to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting.">Micah 5:2</a>). The existence of such a town in the situation described is deduced from <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-21.htm" title="And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Edar.">Genesis 35:21</a>, where Auth. Vers. inaccurately renders ‘the tower of Edar’). It may be doubted however whether this particular tower is sufficiently near Jerusalem to suit the context, for the prophet clearly indicates that it was either upon or close to the hill or hill-side called Ophel (see next note): Isaiah, too, in a prophecy parallel in more ways than one with Micah’s prophecy (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/3-12.htm" title="Therefore shall Zion for your sake be plowed as a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of the forest.">Micah 3:12</a>), mentions in combination ‘Ophel and watch-tower’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-14.htm" title="Because the palaces shall be forsaken; the multitude of the city shall be left; the forts and towers shall be for dens for ever, a joy of wild asses, a pasture of flocks;">Isaiah 32:14</a>, literally rendered) in a description of the desolation of Jerusalem. The ‘tower of the flock’ mentioned in Genesis was probably a different one. There may have been many towers with this name (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-8.htm" title="He smote the Philistines, even to Gaza, and the borders thereof, from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city.">2 Kings 18:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-10.htm" title="Also he built towers in the desert, and dig many wells: for he had much cattle, both in the low country, and in the plains: farmers also, and vine dressers in the mountains, and in Carmel: for he loved husbandry.">2 Chronicles 26:10</a>), just as there was more than one hill called Ophel (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/5-24.htm" title="And when he came to the tower, he took them from their hand, and bestowed them in the house: and he let the men go, and they departed.">2 Kings 5:24</a>, where Auth. Vers. renders ‘Ophel’ loosely ‘tower’). The phrase ‘tower of the flock’ simply means that the tower was designed as a shepherd’s refuge against robbers.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the strong hold of the daughter of Zion</span>] Literally, <span class="bld">the height</span>, &c. It is a particular fortified hill which is meant, the so-called Ophel—according to most, the southern end of the hill Moriah between the Temple and Siloam, bounded on the east by the Kedron, and on the west by the Tyropæon valley. (But this view is uncertain.) This ‘Ophel’ had its fortifications strengthened by Jotham (2 Chron. 37:3), and here becomes the representative of the power of Jerusalem.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the first dominion</span>] i.e. the kingdom of Israel in its widest extent. So most commentators; but the expression is peculiar.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/micah/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8-10.</span> - &sect; 6. <span class="accented">After a certain period of calamity and captivity the kingdom of David shall be revived.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And thou, O tower of the flock</span> (<span class="accented">migdal-edar</span>). There was a village with a tower so called near Bethlehem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-21.htm">Genesis 35:21</a>), and it is thought that Micah refers to it as the home of David and as destined to be the birthplace of Messiah. But the context compels us to consider the expression as a periphrasis for Jerusalem, which the prophet here addressee, declaring that the royal power shall be restored to her. It is evidently the same place as <span class="cmt_word">the stronghold</span> (<span class="accented">ophel</span>, "the hill") <span class="cmt_word">of the daughter of Zion.</span> The name "Ophel" is affixed to the southern spur of Moriah, opposite to the Mount Zion, from which it was separated by the Tyropoeon Valley. It was fortified by Jotham (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/27-3.htm">2 Chronicles 27:3</a>) and Manasseh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-14.htm">2 Chronicles 33:14</a>), and on it were the king's house, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the old palace of David, and "the tower that lieth out," or the upper tower (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-26.htm">Nehemiah 3:26, 27</a>). This is probably the "flock tower" mentioned in the text (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-14.htm">Isaiah 32:14</a>, where Ophel and the watch tower are named together); and it is so called as having been originally a place of refuge for flocks, or of observation for shepherds. Micah uses the two expressions to represent the power and dominion of Jerusalem. The propriety of the usa of the term "flock tower" is seen when we remember that David was a shepherd before he was king, and that the Israelites are the sheep of the Lord's pasture. The reference to a flock in the prceeding  verses may also have influenced the prophet's thought. Owing to a slight variation in the reading, the LXX. renders <span class="accented">Ophel</span> by <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c7;&#x3bc;&#x1f7d;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, "dark;" so Jerome, "nebulosa;" Aquila, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f7d;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>: Symmachus, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. These translators would refer the term to the ruinous condition of the tower. The first dominion shall come, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the former, original empire, such as it was in the days of David and Solomon, and which had been lost in later times. The LXX. adds, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x392;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>: and hence the Greek expositors explain the passage as referring to the siege of Jerusalem by the Chaldeans. The kingdom shall come to the daughter of Jerusalem. The verb "shall come" is better taken with "the first dominion," and this clause in apposition to the former, "the kingdom of" or "the reign over the daughter of Jerusalem." Sovereignty over Jerusalem, or, as others take it, that appertains to Jerusalem, represents rule over the whole country. In Messiah the glory and power are restored to the throne of David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-32.htm">Luke 1:32, 33</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/amos/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Amos first of all repudiates the insinuation that he practises prophesying as a calling or profession, by which he gets his living. "I am no prophet," sc. by profession, "and no prophet's son," i.e., not a pupil or member of the prophets' schools, one who has been trained to prophesy (on these schools, see the comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-24.htm">1 Samuel 19:24</a>); but (according to my proper calling) a bo&#772;qe&#772;r, lit., a herdsman of oxen (from ba&#770;qa&#770;r); then in a broader sense, a herdsman who tends the sheep (&#1510;&#1488;&#1503;), a shepherd; and a bo&#772;le&#772;s shiqm&#305;&#772;m, i.e., one who plucks sycamores or mulberry-figs, and lives upon them. The &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;. bo&#772;le&#772;s is a denom. from the Arabic name for the mulberry-fig, and signifies to gather mulberry-figs and live upon them; like &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; and &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, i.e., according to Hesych. &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3ba;&#x3b1; &#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, to eat figs. The rendering of the lxx &#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;, Vulg. vellicans, points to the fact that it was a common custom to nip or scratch the mulberry-figs, in order to make them ripen (see Theophr. Hist. plant. iv. 2; Plin. Hist. nat. 13, 14; and Bochart, Hieroz. i. 384, or p. 406 ed. Ros.); but this cannot be shown to be the true meaning of bo&#772;le&#772;s. And even if the idea of nipping were implied in the word bo&#772;le&#772;s, it would by no means follow that the possession of a mulberry plantation was what was intended, as many commentators have inferred; for "the words contain an allusion to the 'eating of bread' referred to in <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/7-12.htm">Amos 7:12</a>, and the fruit is mentioned here as the ordinary food of the shepherds, who lived at the pasture grounds, and to whom bread may have been a rarity" (Hitzig). From this calling, which afforded him a livelihood, the Lord had called him away to prophesy to His people Israel; so that whoever forbade him to do so, set himself in opposition to the Lord God. </body></html>
