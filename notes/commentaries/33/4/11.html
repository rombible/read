Or, it may be understood of the heathen nations round about Jerusalem, who should take occasion to insult the Jews in their calamity, should please themselves with seeing the temple profaned, and should gratify their spite with viewing Jerusalem in a forlorn condition.

They would not understand that the Lord had collected them as sheaves are gathered to be threshed; and that Zion would be strengthened to beat them to pieces. Nothing has yet taken place in the history of the Jewish church agreeing with this prediction. When God has conquering work for his people to do, he will furnish them with strength and ability for it. Believers should cry aloud under distresses, with the prayer of faith, not with despondency.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/micah/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Now also - (And now.) The prophet had already spoken of the future before them, with this word Now. Then, he distinctly prophesied the captivity to Babylon. Twice more he begins anew; as Holy Scripture, so often, in a mystery, whether speaking of evil or of good, of deliverance or of punishment, uses a threefold form. In these two, no mention is made of the enemy, and so there is some uncertainty. But the course must apparently be either backward or forward. They must either be two nearer futures before the Captivity, or two more distant after it. This second gathering might, in itself, either be that of the Assyrian hosts under Sennacherib out of all the nations subject to him; or that of the many petty nations in the time of the Maccabees, who took advantage of the Syrians' oppression, to combine to eradicate the Jews (1 Macc. 5:1, 2). If understood of Sennacherib, the prophet, having foretold the entire captivity of the whole people to Babylon, would have prophesied the sudden destruction of a nearer enemy, whose miraculous and instantaneous overthrow should be the earnest of the destruction of Babylon and of their deliverance from it. This would suit well with the description, "He shall gather them as sheaves to the floor," and would correspond well with the descriptions in Isaiah. On the other hand, whereas this description would suit any other event, in which man gathered his strength against God and was overthrown, the following words, "Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion," etc., fit better with the victories of the Maccabees, in which Israel was active, than with the overthrow of Sennacherib, in which they were wholly passive, and God did all for them, as Isaiah and Nahum foretell the same overthrow <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-24.htm">Isaiah 10:24-34</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-24.htm">Isaiah 14:24</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-5.htm">Isaiah 14:5</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/17-12.htm">Isaiah 17:12-14</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-7.htm">Isaiah 29:7-8</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/nahum/1-10.htm">Nahum 1:10-13</a>. Then also, if the course of the description was backward:<p>1) the captivity in Babylon<p>2) the destruction of Sennacherib<p>There is no earlier event to correspond with "the smiting of the judge of Israel on the cheek" (<a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/5-1.htm">Micah 5:1-4</a> in Hebrew). The malice also of the nations gathered against Zion suits better with the abiding character of the petty nations, and of their hereditary envy against Israel and its high claims. To Nineveh and Babylon, Israel was but one little corner of ground, which rounded their territory and connected them with Egypt. They disdained them, even while they sought to subdue them. Micah describes the exultation of petty gratified rivalry.<p>That say, let her be defiled - The bad have a keen eye for the haltings and inconsistencies and falls of God's people, for which they are ever on the watch. Like Satan, they are first tempters, then the accusers; first desecrators, then sanctimonious justiciaries. God, in His judgment, leaves what has been inwardly defiled to be outwardly profaned. "If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple are ye" <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-17.htm">1 Corinthians 3:17</a>.

Now it was to be polluted by the enemy. Its seducers ask for the judgment of God.

Which is to be understood, not of Sennacherib's army invading Judea, and besieging Jerusalem, in Hezekiah's time; for that was not threshed, as the phrase is afterwards used, or destroyed by the daughter of Zion, but by an angel from heaven: nor of the Babylonians or Chaldeans, since they succeeded in their attempt, and were the conquerors, and not conquered: rather this respects the times of the Maccabees, as the series of prophecy and history agreeing together shows; in which times many of the neighbouring nations of the Jews gave them a great deal of trouble, and especially Antiochus king of Syria; and many and mighty armies sent by him. The Jews, as Kimchi, Aben Ezra, and Abarbinel (z), interpret this of the armies of Gog and Magog, in the times of their vainly expected Messiah. Some Christian interpreters, with much more probability, understand this passage of the first times of the Gospel, and the opposition made to that and the Christian church, which yet in the issue prevailed; and perhaps it may have reference to the last times, and receive its full accomplishment in the battle at Armageddon, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/16-14.htm">Revelation 16:14</a>; <p>that say, let her be defiled, and let our eye look upon Zion; either defiled with sin; so the Targum, <p>"that say, when will she sin, and our eye shall behold the fall of Zion?'' <p>as the effect of her sin: or, as others, "let her play the hypocrite" (a); and be condemned as such: or rather, be defiled with slaughter and bloodshed, that they might be delighted with so pleasing a sight, and their eyes might feed with pleasure on an object so agreeable to their wishes. <p>(z) Mashmiah Jeshuah, fol. 62. 1.((a) "hypocrita fuit", Tigurine version; velut hypocrita damnatur", Tarnovius; "hypocrisi contaminabitur, Cocceius. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/micah/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Now also many nations are gathered against thee, that say, Let her be defiled, and let our eye look upon Zion.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/micah/4.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">11–13</span>.

And I said, A basket of ripe fruit. Then Jehovah said to me, The end is come to my people Israel; I will not pass by them any more. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-3.htm">Amos 8:3</a>. And the songs of the palace will yell in that day, is the saying of the Lord Jehovah: corpses in multitude; in every place hath He cast them forth: Hush!" &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489; from &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1498;, to lay hold of, to grasp, lit., a receiver, here a basket (of basket-work), in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-27.htm">Jeremiah 5:27</a> a bird-cage. &#1511;&#1497;&#1509;: summer-fruit (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-1.htm">2 Samuel 16:1</a>); in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-9.htm">Isaiah 16:9</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-4.htm">Isaiah 28:4</a>, the gathering of fruit, hence ripe fruit. The basket of ripe fruit (qayits) is thus explained by the Lord: the end (qe&#772;ts) is come to my people (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-6.htm">Ezekiel 7:6</a>). Consequently the basket of ripe fruit is a figurative representation of the nation that is now ripe for judgment, although qe&#772;ts, the end, does not denote its ripeness for judgment, but its destruction, and the word qe&#772;ts is simply chosen to form a paronomasia with qayits. &#1500;&#1488; &#1488;&#1493;&#1505;&#1497;&#1507; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/7-8.htm">Amos 7:8</a>. All the joy shall be turned into mourning. the thought is not that the temple-singing to the praise of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-23.htm">Amos 5:23</a>) would be turned into yelling, but that the songs of joy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-5.htm">Amos 6:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-36.htm">2 Samuel 19:36</a>) would be turned into yells, i.e., into sounds of lamentation (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-10.htm">Amos 8:10</a> and 1 Maccabees 9:41), namely, because of the multitude of the dead which lay upon the ground on every side. &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1497;&#1498; is not impersonal, in the sense of "which men are no longer able to bury on account of their great number, and therefore cast away in quiet places on every side;" but Jehovah is to be regarded as the subject, viz., which God has laid prostrate, or cast to the ground on every side. For the adverbial use of &#1492;&#1505; cannot be established. The word is an interjection here, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-10.htm">Amos 6:10</a>; and the exclamation, Hush! is not a sign of gloomy despair, but an admonition to bow beneath the overwhelming severity of the judgment of God, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-7.htm">Zephaniah 1:7</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-20.htm">Habakkuk 2:20</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/2-13.htm">Zechariah 2:13</a>). </body></html>
