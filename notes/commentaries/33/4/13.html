The expressions made use of are figurative, alluding to the manner of separating the corn from the chaff in Judea, which was done chiefly by treading it with the feet of oxen. The purport of the passage is, that the Jews are here called upon to arise and tread down their enemies. <span class="ital">For I will make thy horn iron, and thy hoofs brass — </span>Thou shalt be enabled to do this with ease and safety. <span class="ital">And thou shalt beat in pieces — </span>Or, <span class="ital">shalt bruise, many people — </span>This might be spoken of the victories which the Jewish people, some time after their return, were to gain over the neighbouring nations, especially under the Maccabees and their successors. But the prophecy does not appear to have had a full accomplishment in these victories: nor has any event yet occurred in the history of the Jewish people which fully answers to it. This consideration has induced some commentators to expound the passage in a spiritual sense, namely, of bringing the Gentiles into subjection to Christ and his gospel, and of the victory which the Christian Church should obtain over her persecuting enemies after the conversion of the Roman emperor Constantine to the faith of Christ. Thus Dr. Pocock, Lowth, and many others understand it. The nations thought to have ruined Christianity in its infancy, but it proved victorious over them; those that persisted in their enmity were broken to pieces, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-44.htm" title="And whoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.">Matthew 21:44</a>; particularly the Jewish nation: but multitudes, by divine grace, were gained to the church, and, as is signified in the next clause, they and their substance were consecrated to the Lord Jesus, the Lord of the whole earth. We have reason to believe, however, that this prophecy will have a still more eminent and evident accomplishment, when all the enemies of the church shall be subdued, and the saints reigning with Christ <span class="ital">shall have </span>complete <span class="ital">power over the nations, and shall rule </span>the refractory <span class="ital">with a rod of iron, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/2-26.htm" title="And he that overcomes, and keeps my works to the end, to him will I give power over the nations:...">Revelation 2:26-27</a> : compare this text with <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/micah/5-8.htm" title="And the remnant of Jacob shall be among the Gentiles in the middle of many people as a lion among the beasts of the forest, as a young lion among the flocks of sheep: who, if he go through, both treads down, and tears in pieces, and none can deliver....">Micah 5:8-15</a> of this prophecy, and with <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-2.htm" title="And the people shall take them, and bring them to their place: and the house of Israel shall possess them in the land of the LORD for servants and handmaids: and they shall take them captives, whose captives they were; and they shall rule over their oppressors.">Isaiah 14:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-15.htm" title="Behold, I will make you a new sharp threshing instrument having teeth: you shall thresh the mountains, and beat them small, and shall make the hills as chaff.">Isaiah 41:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-12.htm" title="For the nation and kingdom that will not serve you shall perish; yes, those nations shall be utterly wasted.">Isaiah 60:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/61-5.htm" title="And strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, and the sons of the alien shall be your plowmen and your vinedressers.">Isaiah 61:5</a>; on which places see the notes. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/micah/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:9-13 Many nations would assemble against Zion to rejoice in her calamities. They would not understand that the Lord had collected them as sheaves are gathered to be threshed; and that Zion would be strengthened to beat them to pieces. Nothing has yet taken place in the history of the Jewish church agreeing with this prediction. When God has conquering work for his people to do, he will furnish them with strength and ability for it. Believers should cry aloud under distresses, with the prayer of faith, not with despondency.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/micah/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Arise - (It may be,) from the dust in which they were lying, "I will make thine horn iron, and I will make thy hoofs brass." Threshing in the East is partly with oxen, partly with wheels of iron, or with planks set with sharp flints on an open place made hard to this end. The prophet joins another image, with this and represents Judah as being by God endued with strength, first as with a "horn of iron" <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-11.htm">1 Kings 22:11</a> to cast the enemy to the ground, and then with "hoofs of brass," wherewith to trample them to dust, as the stubble and chaff. "And I will consecrate their gain unto the Lord," that is, to Myself; the Lord gathered them into the floor by His Providence; the Lord gave His people strength to subdue them; and now, in His own Person, He says, I will complete My own work.<p>The very image of the "threshing" implies that this is no mere destruction. While the stubble is "beaten" or bruised to small pieces, and the chaff is far more than the wheat, and is carried out of the floor, there yet remains the seed-corn. So in the great judgments of God, while most is refuse, there yet remains over, what is severed from the lost heap and wholly "consecrated" to Him. Whatever things were the object of the &#1495;&#1512;&#1501;  che&#770;rem <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/27-28.htm">Leviticus 27:28</a> or "thing devoted to the Lord," could not be redeemed, but must remain wholly the Lord's. If it had life, it was to be put to death <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/29.htm">Leviticus 29</a>. And so the use of the word here may the rather shew, how those converted to God, and who became gain, hallowed to Him, were to pass through death to life, to die to themselves that they might live to Him: what was evil was to be slain in them, that they themselves might live.<p>The Israelites and God's dealings with them are "ensamples of us upon whom the ends of the world are come" <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-11.htm">1 Corinthians 10:11</a>. And so the whole section fits wonderfully with the condition of the single soul. "She who halteth" (Rib.) "the soul, who would serve God, yet not so as wholly to give up the service of the world, which it had in Baptism renounced, who, after it had gone astray like a lost sheep, and been scattered amid the manifoldness of earthly things, was gathered again into the fold, to love One only, long for One only, give itself to One," its Good Shepherd, and over it the Lord reigneth forever, if, taught by experience the deceitfulness of Satan's promises, and stung by the sense of its own thanklessness and vileness, and conscious of the peril of self confidence, it abideth more closely than others with God. He shall gather her that is driven out, that is, , "He shall restore her, from whom He had, for the time, withdrawn His grace," and her that was afflicted, trouble being God's most effectual instrument, in recalling the soul to Himself. "For the Lord raiseth them that are bowed down" <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/146-8.htm">Psalm 146:8</a>.<p>And will make her that halteth, a remnant, placing her among the elect and holy, and her that was cast off strong; for Christ giveth oft to such souls great richness of divine graces, so that "where sin abounded, grace" should "much more abound" <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-20.htm">Romans 5:20</a>. Rib.: "To it, when enlightened and purified by affliction and by repentance, it is promised, that its Lord, the Great King, shall come to it, and again reign in it, which is the great bliss of souls in grace. For then doth the soul really reign, when it submits wholly to Christ, whom to serve is to reign, and so, under Him, receives power to command its wrong desires, and rule itself;" that great and wonderful power which the Evangelist expresses in words so brief, "To them gave He power to become the sons of God" <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-12.htm">John 1:12</a>. Thus He maketh it strong, so that "neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, can separate it from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord" <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/8-38.htm">Romans 8:38-39</a>.<p>Then, "he describes the condition of the soul fluctuating between good and evil, called one way by God through inward inspirations, and another way by the enticements and habits of sin. And, wishing to follow God, yet not to be without its sinful pleasures, and knowing this to be impossible, it is in anguish and hesitates. Her the prophet justly rebukes, 'why thus cry aloud, as though thou must be led captive by the Devil, not knowing or unable to extricate thyself? Hast thou no King, aided by whose power, thou mayest fight against all enticements, habit, the flesh?' Paul felt this and cried aloud, "I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members. O wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death?" <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/7-23.htm">Romans 7:23-24</a>. You see his grief. But he despairs not. He knows that he has a King. I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. Or why grievest thou, as if thou hadst no "counsellor," by whose counsels to free thee from these snares? "Thy Counsellor" indeed "perished" on the Cross, but for thy sake, that thou mayest live.<p>He died, to destroy him who hath the power of death. But He rose the third day and is still with thee; at the Right Hand of the Father He still reigns Immortal forever. See how many counsels He has left thee in the Gospel, how many admonitions, whereby thou mayest lead a happy and tranquil life. Now "pain seizes thee like a woman in travail." For such a soul travails, having conceived inspirations from God, which it wishes to obey, but that the flesh, overcome by concupiscence, resists, and so it never brings forth, nor experiences that joy, whereof the Lord speaketh, "When she is delivered of the child, she remembereth no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world" <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-21.htm">John 16:21</a>. Wherefore he adds; be in pain, for thou art indeed in travail; thou wilt not cease to be in pain, until thou bring forth. Thou wilt go forth, etc. "God, by a provision of His great mercy, allows lukewarm souls, who will be at no pains to gain grace, to fall into foulest sins, in order that, owning at last their misery, they may cease to be lukewarm, and with great ardor of soul may embrace virtue. For, warned by the result, they understand that they themselves emboldened the tempter, (for he chiefly attacks the lukewarm and remiss,) and they become ardent in the conflict and in well-doing."<p>Wherefore he says, thou shalt go forth out of the city, that City of God, whereof He is the Builder and Maker <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-10.htm">Hebrews 11:10</a>, which is gladdened by the river of His spirit; "and it dwells in the open field, unprotected, ready to be a prey, in the broad way of its own concupiscences, out of the narrow road which leadeth to life, and goeth even to Babylon, the city of 'confusion,' in tumult and din and unrest, and the distractions of this life." Yet even there shall it be delivered, like the poor Prodigal, who came to himself in a far country, when worn out by its hard service. Even there it must not despair, but remember, with him, its Father's house, its former home, the Heavenly Jerusalem. Its pains within or without, whereby it is brought back, are travail-pains. Though all is dark, it must not say, I have no Counsellor. For its Redeemer's Name is "Counsellor" <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>, "one Counsellor of a thousand" (Ecclesiasticus 6:6). : "Thine Intercessor never dies."<p>Out of the very depth of misery will the Divine Mercy draw thee. Though thou seem held by the strong hand of the enemy, and he seems to triumph over thee and to jeer thee, "There, there so would we have it, we have devoured him" <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/35-25.htm">Psalm 35:25</a>, and hosts of devils seek thy utter destruction, and thou seem to be "delivered over" <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-5.htm">1 Corinthians 5:5</a> to them to the destruction of the flesh; yet is it only that the spirit may be saved in the Day of the Lord. Even Satan, when he is tormenting souls, knows not the thoughts of the Lord, nor understands His counsels, how, by the very pain which he inflicts, God is bidding: them, Rise and (Rib.) "look up to heaven and long for heavenly things and trample on all which they had hitherto foully served, honor or vain glory or covetousness or lust;" how He will exalt their horn in the Lord, make it strong as iron that they should do all things through Christ in strengthening them, and conquer all through the might of Christ; how He should bruise Satan under their feet shortly, and they consecrate wholly to God their whole strength, every power of soul and body which hitherto had been the adversary's. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/micah/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13. thresh&#8212;destroy thy foes "gathered" by Jehovah as "sheaves" (Isa 41:15, 16).<p>thine horn&#8212;Zion being compared to an ox treading corn, and an ox's strength lying in the horns, her strength is implied by giving her a horn of iron (compare 1Ki 22:11).<p>beat in pieces many&#8212;(Da 2:44).<p>I will consecrate their gain unto the Lord&#8212;God subjects the nations to Zion, not for her own selfish aggrandizement, but for His glory (Isa 60:6, 9; Zec 14:20, with which compare Isa 23:18) and for their ultimate good; therefore He is here called, not merely God of Israel, but "Lord of the whole earth."   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/micah/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Arise:</span> this imperative may be read in the future tense, and so be an express promise; it is, however, an implicit promise made to the daughter of Zion, the Jewish church, type of the gospel catholic church, that she shall be raised out of a captive, low, and oppressed state, and this shall be by the reviving power of her God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Thresh; </span> so in a decorum to the metaphor, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-12.htm" title="But they know not the thoughts of the LORD, neither understand they his counsel: for he shall gather them as the sheaves into the floor.">Micah 4:12</a></span>, used to express the gathering of the enemy into the floor to be broken: the future strength of the church, employed successfully (more by the arm of her Redeemer than her own) in the subduing and breaking her enemies, is here foretold and promised, as it is also <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-15.htm" title="Behold, I will make you a new sharp threshing instrument having teeth: you shall thresh the mountains, and beat them small, and shall make the hills as chaff.">Isaiah 41:15</a></span>.

And this power he hath sometimes evidently exercised already, in the various deliverances he hath wrought for his people, which stand recorded in the church histories.

The nations gathered against her, and now laid together on the floor as sheaves to be threshed. Here the people of God are aroused, and called out of a low and weak estate, and are animated and encouraged to exert themselves, and fall upon their enemies, and destroy them; alluding to the threshing of grain on the floor, the metaphor being here carried on from <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-12.htm">Micah 4:12</a>. The Targum is, <p>"arise, and kill, O congregation of Zion;'' <p>for I will make thine horn iron, and I will make thy hoofs brass; signifying that the Lord would give them strength sufficient to such work, and such power their enemies should not be able to resist and overcome; and that they should into their hands, and be crushed, trod, and trampled on by them, and utterly subdued. The allusion is to oxen that have horns and hoofs; and it suggests that they should be as strong as they; have horns like them, that is, power to push down their enemies and hoofs to trample upon them: or as these creatures have a horny substance on their feet, or hoofs, which are strong, and fit for the purposes of treading out corn, for which they were used in the eastern countries, drawing after them iron wheels, or planks stuck with flints; so horses and oxen that have strong feet, and hard hoofs, are said to have feet of brass (b); thus the Lord's people should have such courage, force, and power, as not only to withstand their enemies, but to obtain a conquest over them The Targum is, <p>"I will make the people in them strong as iron, and their remnant firm as brass;'' <p>which was true of, and accomplished in, Judas Maccabeus and his brethren; and will be more clearly fulfilled in the Christian kings and princes in the latter day, when engaged with the antichristian states; <p>and thou shalt beat in pieces many people; as the Maccabees did subdue many people and nations, as all Palestine, Moab, Idumea, Samaria, and Iturea, as Josephus (c) relates; and as the Christian princes will beat in pieces, and utterly destroy, all the antichristian kings of the earth, their states and kingdoms, and bring them into subjection to them: <p>and I will consecrate their gain unto the Lord, and their substance unto the Lord of the whole earth; that is, to Christ, who in the last day will appear to be King and Lord of the whole earth; and all the riches of the antichristian nations, Pagan, Papal, and Mahometan, will be devolved to, and employed in, his interest and service; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-24.htm">Revelation 21:24</a>; these are the words of God the Father, with respect to his Son Jesus Christ; who will now have a dominion, glory, and kingdom given him, by the ancient of days, that so all people, nations, and languages, shall serve him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-14.htm">Daniel 7:14</a>; of which there might be some type and shadow in the times of the Maccabees. <p>(b)   "aeripedes equos", Homer.

"Thus did the Lord Jehovah show me: and behold a basket with ripe fruit. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-2.htm">Amos 8:2</a>. And He said, What seest thou, Amos? And I said, A basket of ripe fruit. Then Jehovah said to me, The end is come to my people Israel; I will not pass by them any more. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-3.htm">Amos 8:3</a>. And the songs of the palace will yell in that day, is the saying of the Lord Jehovah: corpses in multitude; in every place hath He cast them forth: Hush!" &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489; from &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1498;, to lay hold of, to grasp, lit., a receiver, here a basket (of basket-work), in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-27.htm">Jeremiah 5:27</a> a bird-cage. &#1511;&#1497;&#1509;: summer-fruit (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-1.htm">2 Samuel 16:1</a>); in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-9.htm">Isaiah 16:9</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-4.htm">Isaiah 28:4</a>, the gathering of fruit, hence ripe fruit. The basket of ripe fruit (qayits) is thus explained by the Lord: the end (qe&#772;ts) is come to my people (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-6.htm">Ezekiel 7:6</a>). Consequently the basket of ripe fruit is a figurative representation of the nation that is now ripe for judgment, although qe&#772;ts, the end, does not denote its ripeness for judgment, but its destruction, and the word qe&#772;ts is simply chosen to form a paronomasia with qayits. &#1500;&#1488; &#1488;&#1493;&#1505;&#1497;&#1507; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/7-8.htm">Amos 7:8</a>. All the joy shall be turned into mourning. the thought is not that the temple-singing to the praise of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-23.htm">Amos 5:23</a>) would be turned into yelling, but that the songs of joy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-5.htm">Amos 6:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-36.htm">2 Samuel 19:36</a>) would be turned into yells, i.e., into sounds of lamentation (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-10.htm">Amos 8:10</a> and 1 Maccabees 9:41), namely, because of the multitude of the dead which lay upon the ground on every side. &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1497;&#1498; is not impersonal, in the sense of "which men are no longer able to bury on account of their great number, and therefore cast away in quiet places on every side;" but Jehovah is to be regarded as the subject, viz., which God has laid prostrate, or cast to the ground on every side. For the adverbial use of &#1492;&#1505; cannot be established. The word is an interjection here, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-10.htm">Amos 6:10</a>; and the exclamation, Hush! is not a sign of gloomy despair, but an admonition to bow beneath the overwhelming severity of the judgment of God, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-7.htm">Zephaniah 1:7</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-20.htm">Habakkuk 2:20</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/2-13.htm">Zechariah 2:13</a>). </body></html>
