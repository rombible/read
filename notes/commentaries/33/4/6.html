The promise immediately refers to the return when God would re-establish the Jews, and eventually come Himself to the restored Temple. And, further, His own promise sanctions the words of Micah as to the abiding character of His rule, that legacy which He left to the Church—“Lo, I am with yon alway, even unto the end of the world.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/micah/4.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/micah/4-6.htm" title="In that day, said the LORD, will I assemble her that halts, and I will gather her that is driven out, and her that I have afflicted;...">Micah 4:6-7</a></span>. <span class="ital">In that day — </span>At that time; <span class="ital">will I assemble her that halteth —</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Or, her that is weak, or bowed down; namely, the Jewish people, weakened with the hard usage of oppressing conquerors. <span class="ital">And I will gather her that is driven out — </span>Captive Judah, driven out from their own land. <span class="ital">And her that I have afflicted — </span>That I have subjected to great calamities.

But very precious promises these are, relating to the gospel church, which will be more and more fulfilled, for He is faithful that has promised. There shall be a glorious church for God set up in the world, in the last days, in the days of the Messiah. Christ himself will build it upon a rock. The Gentiles worshipped their idol gods; but in the period spoken of, the people will cleave to the Lord with full purpose of heart, and delight in doing his will. The word halteth, describes those who walk not according to the Divine word. The collecting the captives from Babylon was an earnest of healing, purifying, and prospering the church; and the reign of Christ shall continue till succeeded by the everlasting kingdom of heaven. Let us stir up each other to attend the ordinances of God, that we may learn his holy ways, and walk in them, receiving the law from his hands, which, being written in our hearts by his Spirit, may show our interest in the Redeemer's righteousness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/micah/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In that day - that is, in that day of Christ and of His Gospel, of grace and salvation, the last days of which he had been speaking. Hitherto he had prophesied the glory of Zion, chiefly through the coming-in of the Gentiles. Now he adds, how the Jews should, with them, be gathered by grace into the one fold, in that long last day of the Gospel, at the beginning, in the course of it, and completely at the end <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-26.htm">Romans 11:26</a>.<p>Her that halteth - The prophet resumes the image of the scattered flock, under which he had before <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/2-12.htm">Micah 2:12-13</a> foretold their restoration. This was no hope of his own, but His word who cannot fail. The course of events, upon which he is entering, would be, at times, for their greatness and their difficulty, past human belief. So he adds straightway, at the outset, "saith the Lord." To "halt" is used of bodily lameness <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-32.htm">Genesis 32:32</a>, and that, of a flock, worn out by its wanderings <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-19.htm">Zephaniah 3:19</a>.

Now the bounty and favour which God moved in the Persian kings toward the Jews was such, that these poor were encouraged to set forward on the journey. This word is to this day fulfilled, in that Christ doth by the power of his Word and Spirit make his people a willing people, determines their resolution, and enables them to perform it, and to give up themselves to God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I will gather her that is driven out:</span> in this phrase, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I will gather, </span> does God by Ezekiel, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-25.htm" title="Thus said the Lord GOD; When I shall have gathered the house of Israel from the people among whom they are scattered, and shall be sanctified in them in the sight of the heathen, then shall they dwell in their land that I have given to my servant Jacob.">Ezekiel 28:25</a></span>, promise the recovery of his people from captivity; and so does Jeremiah, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-8.htm" title="Behold, I will bring them from the north country, and gather them from the coasts of the earth, and with them the blind and the lame, the woman with child and her that travails with child together: a great company shall return thither.">Jeremiah 31:8</a></span>, almost in the same manner promise the restoring of captive Judah.

The Jews or Israelites so described; not from the halting of Jacob their father, as Abarbinel thinks; nor because of their halting between two opinions, worshipping both the true God and idols, as in the times of Elijah; for this will not suit with the Jews in their present state; but because they were like lame and maimed sheep, to which the allusion is; or because they were guilty of sins, which are sometimes expressed by halting, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-10.htm">Jeremiah 20:10</a>. The word signifies such that go sideways, and not uprightly; and fitly describes such who deviate from the ways of God, and walk not according to the divine word: now "in that day" or time before referred to, the last days of the Gospel dispensation, the Lord will convert the Jews; or "heal" these lame and maimed ones, so Jarchi interprets the word; or will gather them by his Spirit and grace to the Messiah, and assemble them into his church, and among his people, and bring them into the sheepfold, under the care of the one Shepherd, the Lord Jesus Christ: <p>and I will gather her that is driven out; out of the land of Israel, and scattered among the nations of the world; even driven out by the Lord himself, because of their transgressions against him; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-15.htm">Jeremiah 16:15</a>; <p>and her that I have afflicted; with various calamities, with famine and sword, with captivity and poverty; the Targum adds, <p>"for the sins of my people;'' <p>the Israelites for their idolatry, and the Jews for the rejection of the Messiah, and other sins. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/micah/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">In that day, saith the LORD, will I assemble her that halteth, and I will gather her that is driven out, and her that I have afflicted;</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/micah/4.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">6, 7</span>.

"Seer, go, and flee into the land of Judah." &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1495;&#1470;&#1500;&#1498;, i.e., withdraw thyself by flight from the punishment which threatens thee. "There eat thy bread, and there mayst thou prophesy:" i.e., in Judah thou mayst earn thy bread by prophesying without any interruption. It is evident from the answer given by Amos in <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/7-14.htm">Amos 7:14</a>, that this is the meaning of the words: "But in Bethel thou shalt no longer prophesy, for it is a king's sanctuary (i.e., a sanctuary founded by the king; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28</a>), and be&#772;th mamla&#770;kha&#770;h," house of the kingdom, i.e., a royal capital (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/27-5.htm">1 Samuel 27:5</a>), - namely, as being the principal seat of the worship which the king has established for his kingdom.
