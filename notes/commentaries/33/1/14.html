Gratify not those that make merry with the sins or with the sorrows of God's Israel. Roll thyself in the dust, as mourners used to do; let every house in Jerusalem become a house of Aphrah, a house of dust. When God makes the house dust it becomes us to humble ourselves to the dust under his mighty hand. Many places should share this mourning. The names have meanings which pointed out the miseries coming upon them; thereby to awaken the people to a holy fear of Divine wrath. All refuges but Christ, must be refuges of lies to those who trust in them; other heirs will succeed to every inheritance but that of heaven; and all glory will be turned into shame, except that honour which cometh from God only.

The bridal presents, literally the dismissals, were the dowry <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-16.htm">1 Kings 9:16</a> with which the father sent away <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/12-9.htm">Judges 12:9</a> his daughter, to belong to another, her lord or husband, never more to return. Moresheth, (literally, inheritance,) the inheritance which God gave her, was to be parted with; she was to be laden with gifts to the enemy. Judah should part with her, and her own treasure also.<p>The houses of Achzib shall be a lie - Achzib, so called probably from a winter brook, achzab, was to become what its name imported, a resource which should fail just in the time of need, as the winter brooks in the drought of summer. "Wilt Thou be unto me as a failing brook, waters which are not sure?" <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-18.htm">Jeremiah 15:18</a>. This Achzib, which is recounted between Keilah and Mareshah <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/15-44.htm">Joshua 15:44</a>, was probably one of, the oldest towns of Palestine being mentioned in the history of the Patriarch Judah. After having survived about 1,000 years, it should, in time of need, fail. The kings of Israel are here the kings of Judah. When this prophecy was to be accomplished, the ten tribes would have ceased to have any political existence, the remnant in their own lanai would have no head to look to, except the line of David, whose good kings had a care for them. Micah then, having prophesied the utter destruction of Samaria, speaks in accordance with the state of things which he foresaw and foretold. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/micah/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14. shalt thou give presents to Moresheth-gath&#8212;that its inhabitants may send thee help. Maurer explains it, "thou shalt give a writing of renunciation to Moresheth-gath," that is, thou shalt renounce all claim to it, being compelled to yield it up to the foe. "Thou," that is, Judah. "Israel" in this verse is used for the kingdom of Judah, which was the chief representative of the whole nation of Israel. Moresheth-gath is so called because it had fallen for a time under the power of the neighboring Philistines of Gath. It was the native town of Micah (Mic 1:1).<p>Achzib&#8212;meaning "lying." Achzib, as its name implies, shall prove a "lie to &#8230; Israel," that is, shall disappoint Israel's hopes of succor from her (compare Job 6:15-20; Jer 15:18). Achzib was in Judah between Keilah and Mareshah (Jos 15:44).

Since Lachish was the cause of leading Judah into idolatry, and was a city so very wicked; therefore it should be reduced to such distress as to send messengers with presents to the Philistines at Moreshethgath, a place near to Gath of the Philistines, and may include that and other cities of theirs, to come and help them against the Assyrians: <p>the houses of Achzib shall be a lie to the kings of Israel; a city of Judah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-44.htm">Joshua 15:44</a>; or of Asher, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-29.htm">Joshua 19:29</a>; the same with Chezib, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/38-5.htm">Genesis 38:5</a>; and called Ecdippa by Josephus (h), Pliny (i), and Ptolemy (k). The Jewish writers commonly call it Cezib, of which they (l) say many things about that, and the land unto it, being subject to tithes, the laws of the seventh year, and the like. Maimonides and Bartenora say (m) it is the name of a place which divided between the land of Israel, which they possessed who came out of Babylon, and that land which they enjoyed who came out of Egypt; but the Jews are not agreed about the situation of it. One of their writers (n) places it to the northeast of the land of Israel; but another (o) observes, and proves from one that resided in those parts some time, and diligently inquired into and made his observation on places, that Cezib, and also Aco and Amana, frequently mentioned with it, were all on the western sea of the land of Israel, that is, the Mediterranean sea; in which he was right, without all doubt: the place is now called Zib by contraction, of which Mr. Maundrell (p) gives this account; <p>"having travelled about one hour in the plain of Acra, we passed by an old town called Zib, situate on an ascent close by the seaside; this may probably be the old Achzib, mentioned <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-29.htm">Joshua 19:29</a>; called afterwards Ecdippa; for St. Jerom (q) places Achzib nine miles distant from Ptolemais (or Aco), towards Tyre, to which account we found the situation of Zib exactly agreeing.'' <p>Now the houses or families that dwelt in this place, or the idols' temples there, as some, and the idolatry exercised therein, should be a lie unto, or disappoint the expectations of, the kings of Israel; which, according to Kimchi, is put for Judah, who placed confidence in them, and had dependence on them: there is an elegant play on words between Achzib and a "lie" (r).

The meaning of the whole clause is that Judah will have to give up Moresheth-gath.

The word is used (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-16.htm">1 Kings 9:16</a>) for the dowry given to a daughter when she is married. The meaning, therefore, is that Judah must relinquish all claim to Moresheth. The paronomasia is explained in two ways. As <span class="accented">Moresheth</span> may mean "possession," the prophet may be understood to say, "Thou shalt give up possession of Gath's possession." Or the play of words may depend upon the similarity of sound between <span class="accented">Moresheth</span> and <span class="accented">Meorasah</span>, "Betrothed" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-29.htm">Deuteronomy 22:29</a>), "Thou shalt give dismissal (bill of divorcement) to the city once betrothed to thee." Moresheth-Gath, Micah's birthplace, is placed just south of Beit Jibrin, or Eleutheropolis, about twenty-five miles from Gaza (see Introduction, &sect; II.). The addition of Gath to the name of the town is meant to mark its situation in the immediate neighbourhood of that well known city. So we have Bethlehem-Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/17-7.htm">Judges 17:7</a>), Abel-Maim or Maachah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-20.htm">1 Kings 15:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-4.htm">2 Chronicles 16:4</a>).

The Lord has no pleasure in the feasts which they celebrate. Their outward, heartless worship, does not make them into the people of God, who can count upon His grace. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-21.htm">Amos 5:21</a>. "I hate, I despise your feasts, and do not like to smell your holy days. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-22.htm">Amos 5:22</a>. For if ye offer me burnt-offerings, and your meat-offerings, I have no pleasure therein; and the thank-offering of your fatted calves I do not regard. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-23.htm">Amos 5:23</a>. Put away from me the noise of thy songs; and I do not like to hear the playing of thy harps. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-24.htm">Amos 5:24</a>. And let judgment roll like water, and righteousness like an inexhaustible stream." By the rejection of the opus operatum of the feasts and sacrifices, the roots are cut away from the false reliance of the Israelites upon their connection with the people of God. The combination of the words &#1513;&#1474;&#1504;&#1488;&#1514;&#1497; &#1502;&#1488;&#1505;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; expresses in the strongest terms the dislike of God to the feasts of those who were at enmity with Him. Chagg&#305;&#772;m are the great annual feasts; &#8219;a&#774;tsa&#770;ro&#772;th, the meetings for worship at those feasts, inasmuch as a holy meeting took place at the &#8219;a&#774;tsereth of the feast of Passover and feast of Tabernacles (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-36.htm">Leviticus 23:36</a>). R&#305;&#772;a&#774;ch, to smell, is an expression of satisfaction, with an allusion to the &#1512;&#1497;&#1495; &#1504;&#1497;&#1495;&#1493;&#1495;, which ascended to God from the burning sacrifice (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-31.htm">Leviticus 26:31</a>). K&#305;&#772;, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/5-22.htm">Amos 5:22</a>, is explanatory: "for," not "yea." The observance of the feast culminated in the sacrificers. God did not like the feasts, because He had no pleasure in the sacrifices. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-23.htm">Amos 5:23</a> the two kinds of sacrifice, &#8219;o&#772;la&#770;h and mincha&#770;h, are divided between the protasis and apodosis, which gives rise to a certain incongruity. The sentences, if written fully, would read thus: When ye offer me burnt-offerings and meat-offerings, I have no pleasure in your burnt-offerings and meat-offerings. To these two kinds the shelem, the health-offering or peace-offering, is added as a third class in <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-22.htm">Amos 5:22</a>. &#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501;, fattened things, generally mentioned along with ba&#770;qa&#770;r as one particular species, for fattened calves (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11</a>). In &#1492;&#1505;&#1512; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-23.htm">Amos 5:23</a>) Israel is addressed as a whole. &#1492;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503; &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1498;, the noise of thy songs, answers to the strong expression &#1492;&#1505;&#1512;. The singing of their psalms is nothing more to God than a wearisome noise, which is to be brought to an end. Singing and playing upon harps formed part of the temple worship (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-40.htm">1 Chronicles 16:40</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-5.htm">1 Chronicles 23:5</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-25.htm">1 Chronicles 23:25</a>). Isaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11</a>.) also refuses the heartless sacrifice and worship of the people, who have fallen away from God in their hearts. It is very clear from the sentence which Amos pronounces here, that the worship at Bethel was an imitation of the temple service at Jerusalem. If, therefore, with <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-1.htm">Amos 6:1</a> in view, where the careless upon Mount Zion and in Samaria are addressed, we are warranted in assuming that here also the prophet has the worship in Judah in his mind as well; the words apply primarily and chiefly to the worship of the kingdom of the ten tribes, and therefore even in that case they prove that, with regard to ritual, it was based upon the model of the temple service at Jerusalem. Because the Lord has no pleasure in this hypocritical worship, the judgment shall pour like a flood over the land. The meaning of <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-24.htm">Amos 5:24</a> is not, "Let justice and righteousness take the place of your sacrifices." Mishpa&#770;t is not the justice to be practised by men; for "although Jehovah might promise that He would create righteousness in the nation, so that it would fill the land as it were like a flood (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-9.htm">Isaiah 11:9</a>), He only demands righteousness generally, and not actually in floods" (Hitzig). Still less can mishpa&#770;t u&#772;tseda&#770;qa&#770;h be understood as relating to the righteousness of the gospel which Christ has revealed. This thought is a very far-fetched one here, and is only founded upon the rendering given to &#1493;&#1497;&#1490;&#1468;&#1500;, et revelabitur (Targ., Jerome,  equals  &#1493;&#1497;&#1490;&#1468;&#1500;), whereas &#1497;&#1490;&#1468;&#1500; comes from &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1500;, to roll, to roll along. The verse is to be explained according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-22.htm">Isaiah 10:22</a>, and threatens the flooding of the land with judgment and the punitive righteousness of God (Theod. Mops., Theodoret, Cyr., Kimchi, and others). </body></html>
