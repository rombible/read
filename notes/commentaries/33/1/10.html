The word <span class="ital">Aphrah </span>signifies <span class="ital">dust; </span>and the prophet, it is likely, puts it here for <span class="ital">Ophrah, </span>a town in the tribe of Benjamin, that the name might better suit their present condition. <span class="ital">Pass ye away, thou inhabitant of Saphir — </span>Houbigant says that Eusebius places this city, the name of which signifies <span class="ital">fair, </span>or <span class="ital">elegant, </span>in the tribe of Judah, between Eleutheropolis and Askelon. Some think, however, that Saphir is not a proper name, and that there was no place so called in Judea; but that the clause ought to be rendered, <span class="ital">Pass away, thou inhabitant of a delightful place, </span>that is, Samaria, which was very pleasantly situated. The prophet here threatens the inhabitants of that place that they should go into captivity, in a way very unsuitable to their former softness and luxury, even stripped by the conquering enemy, and without so much as a covering to hide their nakedness. <span class="ital">The inhabitant of Zaanan — </span>A place in the tribe of Judah, called <span class="ital">Zenan, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-37.htm" title="Zenan, and Hadashah, and Migdalgad,">Joshua 15:37</a>; <span class="ital">came not forth in the mourning of Beth-ezel — </span>“There was no burial of her dead with solemn mourning out of the precincts of her city, but she was besieged and put to the sword.” — Newcome. Or, the meaning may be, the inhabitants of Zaanan were so much concerned to provide for their own safety, that they took no notice of the mournful condition of their near neighbour Beth-ezel, which seems to have been a place near Jerusalem, termed <span class="ital">Azal, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-5.htm" title="And you shall flee to the valley of the mountains; for the valley of the mountains shall reach to Azal: yes, you shall flee, like as you fled from before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah: and the LORD my God shall come, and all the saints with you.">Zechariah 14:5</a>.

Gratify not those that make merry with the sins or with the sorrows of God's Israel. Roll thyself in the dust, as mourners used to do; let every house in Jerusalem become a house of Aphrah, a house of dust. When God makes the house dust it becomes us to humble ourselves to the dust under his mighty hand. Many places should share this mourning. The names have meanings which pointed out the miseries coming upon them; thereby to awaken the people to a holy fear of Divine wrath. All refuges but Christ, must be refuges of lies to those who trust in them; other heirs will succeed to every inheritance but that of heaven; and all glory will be turned into shame, except that honour which cometh from God only. Sinners may now disregard their neighbours' sufferings, yet their turn to be punished will some come.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/micah/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Tell it not in Gath - Gath had probably now ceased to be; at least, to be of any account . It shows how David's elegy lived in the hearts of Judah, that his words are used as a proverb, (just as we do now, in whose ears it is yearly read), when, as with us, its original application was probably lost. True, Gath, reduced itself, might rejoice the more maliciously over the sufferings of Judah. But David mentions it as a chief seat of Philistine strength ; now its strength was gone.<p>The blaspheming of the enemies of God is the sorest part of His chastisements. Whence David prays "let not mine enemies exult over me" <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-2.htm">Psalm 25:2</a>; and the sons of Korah, "With a sword in my bones, mine enemies reproach me, while they say daily unto me, where is thy God?" <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-10.htm">Psalm 42:10</a>; and Ethan; "Thou hast made all his enemies to rejoice. Remember, Lord, the reproach of Thy servant" <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/89-42.htm">Psalm 89:42</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-50.htm">Psalm 89:50</a> - wherewith Thine enemies have reproached, O Lord, wherewith they have reproached the footsteps of Thine anointed. It is hard to part with home, with country, to see all desolate, which one ever loved. But far, far above all, is it, if, in the disgrace and desolation, God's honor seems to be injured. The Jewish people was then God's only home on earth. If it could be extinguished, who remained to honor Him? Victories over them seemed to their pagan neighbors to be victories over Him. He seemed to be dishonored without, because they had first dishonored Him within. Sore is it to the Christian, to see God's cause hindered, His kingdom narrowed, the empire of infidelity advanced. Sorer in one way, because he knows the price of souls, for whom Jesus died. But the world is now the Church's home. "The holy church throughout all the world doth acknowledge Thee!" Then, it was girt in within a few miles of territory, and sad indeed it must have been to the prophet, to see this too hemmed in. Tell it not in Gath, to the sons of those who, of old, defied God.<p>Weep not at all - (Literally, weeping, weep not). Weeping is the stillest expression of grief. We speak of "weeping in silence." Yet this also was too visible a token of grief. Their weeping would be the joy and laughter of God's enemies.<p>In the house of Aphrah - (probably, In Beth-leaphrah) roll thyself in the dust (Better, as the text, I roll myself in dust). The prophet chose unusual names, such as would associate themselves with the meanings which he wished to convey, so that thence forth the name itself might recall the prophecy. As if we were to say, "In Ashe I roll myself in ashes." - There was an Aphrah near Jerusalem . It is more likely that Micah should refer to this, than to the Ophrah in Benjamin <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-23.htm">Joshua 18:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-17.htm">1 Samuel 13:17</a>. He showed them, in his own person, how they should mourn, retired out of sight and hidden, as it were, in the dust. Jer. Rup.: "Whatever grief your heart may have, let your face have no tears; go not forth, but, in the house of dust, sprinkle thyself with the ashes of its ruins."<p>All the places thenceforth spoken of were in Judah, whose sorrow and desolation are repeated in all. It is one varied history of sorrow: The names of her cities, whether in themselves called from some gifts of God, as Shaphir, (beautiful; we have Fairford, Fairfield, Fairburn, Fairlight,) or contrariwise from some defect, Maroth, Bitterness (probably from brackish water) Achzib, lying, (doubtless from a winter-torrent which in summer failed) suggest, either in contrast or by themselves, some note of evil and woe. It is Judah's history in all, given in different traits; her "beauty" turned into shame; herself free neither to go forth nor to "abide;" looking for good and finding evil; the strong (Lachish) strong only to flee; like a brook that fails and deceives; her inheritance (Mareshah) inherited; herself, taking refuge in dens and caves of the earth, yet even there found, and bereft of her glory. Whence, in the end, without naming Judah, the prophet sums up her sorrows with one call to mourning. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/micah/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. Declare ye it not at Gath&#8212;on the borders of Judea, one of the five cities of the Philistines, who would exult at the calamity of the Hebrews (2Sa 1:20). Gratify not those who exult over the falls of the Israel of God.<p>weep ye not at all&#8212;Do not betray your inward sorrow by outward weeping, within the cognizance of the enemy, lest they should exult at it. Reland translates, "Weep not in Acco," that is, Ptolemais, now St. Jean d'Acre, near the foot of Mount Carmel; allotted to Asher, but never occupied by that tribe (Jud 1:31); Acco's inhabitants would, therefore, like Gath's, rejoice at Israel's disaster. Thus the parallelism is best carried out in all the three clauses of the verse, and there is a similar play on sounds in each, in the Hebrew Gath, resembling in sound the Hebrew for "declare"; Acco, resembling the Hebrew for "weep"; and Aphrah, meaning "dust." While the Hebrews were not to expose their misery to foreigners, they ought to bewail it in their own cities, for example, Aphrah or Ophrah (Jos 18:23; 1Sa 13:17), in the tribe of Benjamin. To "roll in the dust" marked deep sorrow (Jer 6:26; Eze 27:30).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/micah/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Declare ye it not at Gath; </span> do what you can to keep your griefs to yourselves, let them not be public, that the Philistines, your bitter enemies, should know how sad it is with you and rejoice at it.

A city of the Philistines, put for all the rest: the phrase is borrowed from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-20.htm">2 Samuel 1:20</a>; where the reason is given, and holds good here as there; and the sense is, not that the destruction of Israel, or the invasion of Judea, or the besieging of Jerusalem, could be hid from the Philistines; but that it was a thing desirable, was it possible, since it would be matter of rejoicing to them, and that would be an aggravation of the distress of Israel and Judah: <p>weep ye not at all; that is, before the Philistines, or such like enemies, lest they should laugh and scoff at you; though they had reason to weep, and did and ought to weep in secret; yet, as much as in them lay, it would be right to forbear it openly, because of the insults and reproach of the enemy. The learned Reland (f) suspects that it should be read, "weep not in Acco": which was another city in Palestine, to the north from the enemy, as Gath was to the south; and observes, that there is a like play on words (g) in the words, as in the places after mentioned. Acco is the same with Ptolemais, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-7.htm">Acts 21:7</a>; See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-7.htm">Acts 21:7</a>. It had this name from Ptolemy Lagus king of Egypt, who enlarged it, and called it after his own name; but Mr, Maundrell (h) observes, <p>"now, since it hath been in the possession of the Turks, it has, according to the example of many other cities in Turkey, cast off its Greek, and recovered some semblance of its old Hebrew name again, being called Acca, or Acra. As to its situation (he says) it enjoys all possible advantages, both of sea and land; on its north and east sides it is compassed with a spacious and fertile plain; on the west it is washed by the Mediterranean sea; and on the south by a large bay, extending from the city as far as Mount Carmel;'' <p>in the house of Aphrah roll thyself in the dust; as mourners used to do, sit in the dust, or cover their heads with it, or wallow in it; this is allowed to be done privately, in houses or in towns distinct from the Philistines, as Aphrah or Ophrah was, which was in the tribe of Benjamin, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-23.htm">Joshua 18:23</a>; called here "Aphrah", to make it better agree with "Aphar", dust, to which the allusion is: and it may be rendered, "in the house of dust roll thyself in the dust"; having respect to the condition houses would be in at this time, mere heaps of dust and rubbish, so that they would find enough easily to roll themselves in. Here is a double reading; the "Keri", or marginal reading, which the Masora directs to, and we follow, is, "roll thyself": but the "Cetib", or writing, is, "I have rolled myself" (i); and so are the words of the prophet, who before says he wailed and howled, and went stripped and naked; here he says, as a further token of his sorrow, that he rolled himself in dust, and as an example for Israel to do the like.

Most of them refer to Judæan towns in the prophet’s own neighbourhood. He could not possibly jest about the fate of his friends! No; he is in sober earnest, and sees (like Isaiah in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-30.htm" title="Lift up your voice, O daughter of Gallim: cause it to be heard to Laish, O poor Anathoth.">Isaiah 10:30</a>) a pre-ordained correspondence between names and fortunes (comp. the familiar phrase ‘his name shall be called’ = ‘he shall be’). It is not always easy to catch his allusions, nor to reproduce them when caught. Some idea of the general effect is given by M. Reuss in the following imitation, ‘N’allez pas le dire à Dijon!

The substance of the power of Gath had passed away (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-2.htm" title="Pass you to Calneh, and see; and from there go you to Hamath the great: then go down to Gath of the Philistines: be they better than these kingdoms? or their border greater than your border?">Amos 6:2</a>).

Thus Acco (the later Ptolemais) would be the representative of the Canaanites or Phœnicians of the north. The choice of the town would be dictated (as the Hebrew suggests) by the love of paronomasia.

There was a town of the tribe of Benjamin called Ophrah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-23.htm" title="And Avim, and Pharah, and Ophrah,">Joshua 18:23</a>. Most, if not all, however, of the other eight towns appear to lie in the Shephélah, i.e. the ‘low country’ between Joppa and Gaza; probably therefore the Benjamite Ophrah is not here intended. It may be asked, Why does the prophet single out the Shephélah? Isaiah, in a strictly parallel passage (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/10-28.htm" title="He is come to Aiath, he is passed to Migron; at Michmash he has laid up his carriages:...">Isaiah 10:28-32</a>), mentions an altogether different region as suffering from the invasion? The answer is, that the prophet has the feelings (if we may say so) of a provincial. The ‘low country’ was even less able than Aiath, Migron, Michmash, &c., to oppose the rapid movements of the Assyrians.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">roll thyself in</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">besprinkle thyself with</span>.

Gath is mentioned as the seat of the Philistines, the constant and powerful enemy  of Judah. (For its situation, see note on Amos 6:2.) The paronomasias in this passage, which seem to modern ears artificial and puerile, are paralleled in many writings both Hebrew and classic, and were natural to a people who looked for mystical meaning in words and names. Thus Gath is taken to signify "Tell town," and the clause is, "In Tell town tell it not." <span class="cmt_word">Weep ye not at all;</span> Vulgate, <span class="accented">lacrymis ne ploretis</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "weep in silence," or "hide your tears," that the enemy may not know your grief. As in cash of the other clauses a town is mentioned, some editors would here read, "In Acco ('Weep town') weep not!" - Acco being the later Ptolemais, the modern St. Jean d'Acre, and taken here to represent another foreign city which would rejoice at Judah's misfortunes (see, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-31.htm">Judges 1:31</a>).

Keil notes that the word is pointed with <span class="accented">pathach</span> here for the sake of the paronomasia. <span class="cmt_word">Roll thyself in the dust;</span> <span class="accented">sprinkle dust upon thyself</span>. This was a common sign of mourning (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-19.htm">2 Samuel 13:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-26.htm">Jeremiah 6:26</a>). The Hebrew text (in contradistinction to the margin, Keri) gives, "I roll myself," or "I have besprinkled myself," the prophet identifying himself with the people. But as in all the subsequent passages, not what the prophet does, but what the inhabitants do, is the point impressed, the reading of the Keri is hem to be preferred. Vulgate, <span class="accented">pulvere vos conspergite.</span> The Septuagint has an inexplicable rendering, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>, "against laughter sprinkle earth," which Brenton translates, "sprinkle dust in the place of your laughter." With this section (vers. 10-15) should be compared <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-28.htm">Isaiah 10:28-32</a>, which describes the alarm occasioned by Sennacherib's invasion of Judah from the northeast, as Micah represents his progress to the southwest. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/amos/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>This judgment is announced in <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/5-16.htm">Amos 5:16</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-17.htm">Amos 5:17</a>. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-16.htm">Amos 5:16</a>. "Therefore thus saith Jehovah the God of hosts, the Lord: In all roads lamentation! and in all streets will men say, Alas! alas! and they call the husbandman to mourning, and lamentation to those skilled in lamenting. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-17.htm">Amos 5:17</a>. And in all vineyards lamentation, because I go through the midst of thee, saith Jehovah." La&#770;khe&#772;n (therefore) is not connected with the admonitions in <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/5-14.htm">Amos 5:14</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/5-15.htm">Amos 5:15</a>, nor can it point back to the reproaches in <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/5-7.htm">Amos 5:7</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/5-10.htm">Amos 5:10-12</a>, since they are too far off: it rather links on to the substance of <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/5-13.htm">Amos 5:13</a>, which involves the thought that all admonition to return is fruitless, and the ungodly still persist in their unrighteousness, - a thought which also forms the background of <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/5-14.htm">Amos 5:14</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-15.htm">Amos 5:15</a>. The meaning of <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/5-16.htm">Amos 5:16</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-17.htm">Amos 5:17</a> is, that mourning and lamentation for the dead will fill both city and land. On every hand will there be dead to weep for, because Jehovah will go judging through the land. The roads and streets are not merely those of the capital, although these are primarily to be thought of, but those of all the towns in the kingdom. Mispe&#772;d is the death-wail. This is evident from the parallel 'a&#770;mar ho&#772; ho&#772;, saying, Alas, alas! i.e., striking up the death-wail (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-18.htm">Jeremiah 22:18</a>). And this death-wail will not be heard in all the streets of the towns only, but the husbandman will also be called from the field to mourn, i.e., to seep for one who has died in his house. The verb &#1511;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;, they call, belongs to &#1502;&#1505;&#1508;&#1468;&#1491; &#1488;&#1500; &#1497;, they call lamentation to those skilled in mourning: for they call out the word mispe&#772;d to the professional mourners; in other words, they send for them to strike up their wailing for the dead. &#1497;&#1491;&#1506;&#1497; &#1504;&#1492;&#1497; (those skilled in mourning) are the public wailing women, who were hired when a death occurred to sing mourning songs (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-16.htm">Jeremiah 9:16</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/9-23.htm">Matthew 9:23</a>, and my Bibl. Archologie, ii. p. 105). Even in all the vineyards, the places where rejoicing is generally looked for (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-11.htm">Amos 5:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-10.htm">Isaiah 16:10</a>), the death-wail will be heard. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-17.htm">Amos 5:17</a> mentions the event which occasions the lamentation everywhere. &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, for (not "if") I go through the midst of thee. These words are easily explained from <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-12.htm">Exodus 12:12</a>, from which Amos has taken them. Jehovah there says to Moses, "I pass through the land of Egypt, and smite all the first-born." And just as the Lord once passed through Egypt, so will He now pass judicially through Israel, and slay the ungodly. For Israel is no longer the nation of the covenant, which He passes over and spares (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/7-8.htm">Amos 7:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-2.htm">Amos 8:2</a>), but has become an Egypt, which He will pass through as a judge to punish it. This threat is carried out still further in the next two sections, commencing with ho&#772;i. </body></html>
