Gratify not those that make merry with the sins or with the sorrows of God's Israel. Roll thyself in the dust, as mourners used to do; let every house in Jerusalem become a house of Aphrah, a house of dust. When God makes the house dust it becomes us to humble ourselves to the dust under his mighty hand. Many places should share this mourning. The names have meanings which pointed out the miseries coming upon them; thereby to awaken the people to a holy fear of Divine wrath. All refuges but Christ, must be refuges of lies to those who trust in them; other heirs will succeed to every inheritance but that of heaven; and all glory will be turned into shame, except that honour which cometh from God only.

All shearing of the hair was not forbidden ; indeed to the Nazarite it was commanded, at the close of his vow. The removal of that chief ornament of the countenance wasa natural expression of grief, which revolts at all personal appearance. It belonged, not to idolatry, but to nature . "Thy delicate children." The change was the more bitter for those tended and brought up delicately. Moses from the first spoke of special miseries which should fall on the tender and very delicate. "Enlarge thy baldness;" outdo in grief what others do; for the cause of thy grief is more than that of others. The point of comparison in the Eagle might either be the actual baldness of the head, or its moulting. If it were the baldness of the head, the word translated eagle  Unless nesher be the golden Eagle there is no Hebrew name for it, whereas it is still a bird of Palestine, and smaller eagles are mentioned in the same verse, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-13.htm">Leviticus 11:13</a>; namely, the ossifrage, &#1508;&#1512;&#1505;, and the black eagle, &#1506;&#1494;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492;, so called from its strength, like the valeria, of which Pliny says, "the melanaetos or valeria, least in size, remarkable for strength, blackish in color." x. 3. The same lint of unclean birds contains also the vulture, &#1491;&#1497;&#1492;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-13.htm">Deuteronomy 14:13</a>, (as it must be, being a gregarious bird, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-15.htm">Isaiah 34:15</a>) in its different species <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-13.htm">Deuteronomy 14:13</a> the gier-eagle, (that is, Geyer) (vulture) eagle gypaetos, or vultur percnopterus, (Hasselquist, Forskal, Shaw, Bruce in Savigny p. 77.) partaking of the character of both, (&#1512;&#1492;&#1501; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-18.htm">Leviticus 11:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-17.htm">Deuteronomy 14:17</a> together with the falcon (&#1491;&#1488;&#1492; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-14.htm">Leviticus 11:14</a> and hawk, with its subordinate species, (&#1500;&#1502;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492;&#1493; &#1504;&#1509;) <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-18.htm">Leviticus 11:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-15.htm">Deuteronomy 14:15</a>.), although mostly used of the Eagle itself, might here comprehend the Vulture . For entire baldness is so marked a feature in the vulture, whereas the "bald-headed Eagle" was probably not a bird of Palestine . On the other hand, David, who lived so long among the rocks of Palestine, and Isaiah seem to have known of effects of moulting upon the Eagle in producing, (although in a less degree than in other birds,) a temporary diminution of strength, which have not in modern times been commonly observed.<p>For David says, "Thou shalt renew, like the eagle, thy youth, which speaks of fresh strength after temporary weakness" <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-5.htm">Psalm 103:5</a>; and Isaiah, "They that trust in the Lord shall put forth fresh strength; they shall put forth pinion-feathers like eagles" <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-31.htm">Isaiah 40:31</a>, comparing the fresh strength which should succeed to that which was gone, to the eagle's recovering its strong pinion-feathers. Bochart however says unhesitatingly , "At the beginning of spring, the rapacious birds are subject to shedding of their feathers which we call moulting." If this be so, the comparison is yet more vivid, For the baldness of the vulture belongs to its matured strength, and could only be an external likeness. The moulting of the eagle involves some degree of weakness, with which he compares Judah's mournful and weak condition amid the loss of their children, gone into captivity .<p>Thus closes the first general portion of the prophecy. The people had east aside its own Glory, God; now its sons, its pride and its trust, shall go away from it.<p>Lap.: "The eagle, laying aside its old feathers and taking new, is a symbol of penitence and of the penitents who lay aside their former evil habits, and become other and new men. True, but rare form of penitence!" Gregory the Great thus applies this to the siege of Rome by the Lombards. : "That happened to her which we know to have been foretold of Judea by the prophet, enlarge thy baldness like the eagle. For baldness befalls man in the head only, but the eagle in its whole body; for, when it is very old, its feathers and pinions fall from all its body. She lost her feathers, who lost her people. Her pinions too fell out, with which she was accustomed to fly to the prey; for all her mighty men, through whom she plundered others, perished. But this which we speak of, the breaking to pieces of the city of Rome, we know has been done in all the cities of the world. Some were desolated by pestilence, others devoured by the sword, others racked by famine, others swallowed by earthquakes. Despise we them with our whole heart, at least, when brought to nought; at least with the end of the world, let us end our eagerness after the world. Follow we, wherein we can, the deeds of the good." One whose commentaries Jerome had read, thus applies this verse to the whole human race. "O soul of man! O city, once the mother of saints, which wast formerly in Paradise, and didst enjoy the delights of different trees, and wast adorned most beautifully, now being east down from thy place aloft, and brought down unto Babylon, and come into a place of captivity, and having lost thy glory, make thee bald and take the habit of a penitent; and thou who didst fly aloft like an eagle, mourn thy sons, thy offspring, which from thee is led captive." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/micah/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16.

Which is said, either with respect to Mareshah, or to Adullam, or to the whole land, as Kimchi observes; rather to the latter; and that either to Israel, or to Judah, or both; the prophecy in general being concerning them both, <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-1.htm">Micah 1:1</a>; making baldness, whether by plucking off the hair, or by shaving it, was used in token of mourning, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-20.htm">Job 1:20</a>; and so it is designed to express it here: the inhabitants of the land are called to lamentation and weeping for their children taken from them, whom they dearly loved, and brought up in a delicate manner. The Targum is, <p>"pluck off thy hair, and cast it upon the children of thy delight;'' <p>and Sanctius observes; that it was a custom with the Gentiles to cut off their hair, and cast it into the graves of their kindred and friends at their interment, to which be thinks the prophet alludes: <p>enlarge thy baldness as the eagle; when it moults, and cast off all its feathers, as it does in old age, and so renews its youth; to which the allusion seems to be in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-5.htm">Psalm 103:5</a>; or every year, as birds of prey usually do at the beginning of the spring. The Jewish writers (y) say this happens to it every ten years; when, finding its feathers heavy and unfit for flying, it makes a tour to the sun with all its force it can, to get as near it as possible; and, having heated its plumage excessively, it casts itself into the sea for cooling, and then its feathers fall off, and new ones succeed; and this it does until it is a hundred years old; and to its then state of baldness, while it is moulting, is the allusion here; unless it can be thought any respect is had to that kind of eagle which is called the bald one. In Virginia (z) there are three sorts of eagles; one is the grey eagle, about the size of a kite; another the black eagle, resembling those in England; and a third the bald eagle, so called because the upper part of the neck and head are covered with a sort of white down: but the former sort of baldness seems to be intended, which is at certain stated times, and not what always is, and is only partial; for it denotes such an universal baldness to be made, as to take in all the parts of the body where any hair grows; as expressive of the general devastation that should be made, which would be the cause of this great mourning: <p>for they are gone into captivity from thee; that is, the delicate children of Israel and Judah, and so were as dead unto them, or worse: this was accomplished in Israel or the ten tribes, partly by Tiglathpileser, and more completely by Shalmaneser, king of Assyria, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-29.htm">2 Kings 15:29</a>; and in Judah or the two tribes, when Sennacherib came and took their fenced cities; and doubtless some of the inhabitants and their children were carried captive by him, though not Jerusalem; and therefore cannot be addressed here, as some do interpret the words, unless the prophecy is to be extended to the destruction of Jerusalem by the Babylonians. <p>(y) Saadiah Gaon apud Kimchi &amp; Ben Melech in Psal. ciii. 5. &amp; lsa. xl. 31.

The Lord has no pleasure in the feasts which they celebrate. Their outward, heartless worship, does not make them into the people of God, who can count upon His grace. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-21.htm">Amos 5:21</a>. "I hate, I despise your feasts, and do not like to smell your holy days. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-22.htm">Amos 5:22</a>.

And let judgment roll like water, and righteousness like an inexhaustible stream." By the rejection of the opus operatum of the feasts and sacrifices, the roots are cut away from the false reliance of the Israelites upon their connection with the people of God. The combination of the words &#1513;&#1474;&#1504;&#1488;&#1514;&#1497; &#1502;&#1488;&#1505;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; expresses in the strongest terms the dislike of God to the feasts of those who were at enmity with Him. Chagg&#305;&#772;m are the great annual feasts; &#8219;a&#774;tsa&#770;ro&#772;th, the meetings for worship at those feasts, inasmuch as a holy meeting took place at the &#8219;a&#774;tsereth of the feast of Passover and feast of Tabernacles (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-36.htm">Leviticus 23:36</a>). R&#305;&#772;a&#774;ch, to smell, is an expression of satisfaction, with an allusion to the &#1512;&#1497;&#1495; &#1504;&#1497;&#1495;&#1493;&#1495;, which ascended to God from the burning sacrifice (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-31.htm">Leviticus 26:31</a>). K&#305;&#772;, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/5-22.htm">Amos 5:22</a>, is explanatory: "for," not "yea." The observance of the feast culminated in the sacrificers. God did not like the feasts, because He had no pleasure in the sacrifices. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-23.htm">Amos 5:23</a> the two kinds of sacrifice, &#8219;o&#772;la&#770;h and mincha&#770;h, are divided between the protasis and apodosis, which gives rise to a certain incongruity. The sentences, if written fully, would read thus: When ye offer me burnt-offerings and meat-offerings, I have no pleasure in your burnt-offerings and meat-offerings. To these two kinds the shelem, the health-offering or peace-offering, is added as a third class in <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-22.htm">Amos 5:22</a>. &#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501;, fattened things, generally mentioned along with ba&#770;qa&#770;r as one particular species, for fattened calves (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11</a>). In &#1492;&#1505;&#1512; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-23.htm">Amos 5:23</a>) Israel is addressed as a whole. &#1492;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503; &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1498;, the noise of thy songs, answers to the strong expression &#1492;&#1505;&#1512;. The singing of their psalms is nothing more to God than a wearisome noise, which is to be brought to an end. Singing and playing upon harps formed part of the temple worship (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-40.htm">1 Chronicles 16:40</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-5.htm">1 Chronicles 23:5</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-25.htm">1 Chronicles 23:25</a>). Isaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11</a>.) also refuses the heartless sacrifice and worship of the people, who have fallen away from God in their hearts. It is very clear from the sentence which Amos pronounces here, that the worship at Bethel was an imitation of the temple service at Jerusalem. If, therefore, with <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-1.htm">Amos 6:1</a> in view, where the careless upon Mount Zion and in Samaria are addressed, we are warranted in assuming that here also the prophet has the worship in Judah in his mind as well; the words apply primarily and chiefly to the worship of the kingdom of the ten tribes, and therefore even in that case they prove that, with regard to ritual, it was based upon the model of the temple service at Jerusalem. Because the Lord has no pleasure in this hypocritical worship, the judgment shall pour like a flood over the land. The meaning of <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-24.htm">Amos 5:24</a> is not, "Let justice and righteousness take the place of your sacrifices." Mishpa&#770;t is not the justice to be practised by men; for "although Jehovah might promise that He would create righteousness in the nation, so that it would fill the land as it were like a flood (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-9.htm">Isaiah 11:9</a>), He only demands righteousness generally, and not actually in floods" (Hitzig). Still less can mishpa&#770;t u&#772;tseda&#770;qa&#770;h be understood as relating to the righteousness of the gospel which Christ has revealed. This thought is a very far-fetched one here, and is only founded upon the rendering given to &#1493;&#1497;&#1490;&#1468;&#1500;, et revelabitur (Targ., Jerome,  equals  &#1493;&#1497;&#1490;&#1468;&#1500;), whereas &#1497;&#1490;&#1468;&#1500; comes from &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1500;, to roll, to roll along. The verse is to be explained according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-22.htm">Isaiah 10:22</a>, and threatens the flooding of the land with judgment and the punitive righteousness of God (Theod. Mops., Theodoret, Cyr., Kimchi, and others). </body></html>
