God's holy temple will not protect false professors. Neither men of high degree, as the mountains, nor men of low degree, as the valleys, can secure themselves or the land from the judgments of God. If sin be found in God's people he will not spare them; and their sins are most provoking to him, for they are most reproaching. When we feel the smart of sin, it behoves us to seek what is the sin we smart for. Persons and places most exalted, are most exposed to spiritual diseases. The vices of leaders and rulers shall be surely and sorely punished. The punishment answers the sin. What they gave to idols, never shall prosper, nor do them any good. What is got by one lust, is wasted on another.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/micah/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For, behold, the Lord comth forth - that is, (as we now say,) "is coming forth." Each day of judgment, and the last also, are ever drawing nigh, noiselessly as the nightfall, but unceasingly. "Out of His Place." Dionysius: "God is hidden from us, except when He sheweth Himself by His Wisdom or Power of Justice or Grace, as Isaiah saith, 'Verily, Thou art a God who hidest Thyself' <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-15.htm">Isaiah 45:15</a>." He seemeth to be absent, when He doth not visibly work either in the heart within, or in judgments without; to the ungodly and unbelieving He is absent, "far above out of their sight" <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/10-5.htm">Psalm 10:5</a>, when He does not avenge their scoffs, their sins, their irreverence. Again He seemeth to go forth, when His Power is felt. Dionysius: "Whence it is said, 'Bow Thy heavens, O Lord, and come down' <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/144-5.htm">Psalm 144:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/64-1.htm">Isaiah 64:1</a>; and the Lord saith of Sodom, 'I will go down now and see, whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto Me' <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-21.htm">Genesis 18:21</a>. Or, the Place of the Infinite God is God Himself. For the Infinite sustaineth Itself, nor doth anything out of Itself contain It. God dwelleth also in light unapproachable <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-16.htm">1 Timothy 6:16</a>. When then Almighty God doth not manifest Himself, He abideth, as it were, in 'His own Place.' When He manifests His Power or Wisdom or Justice by their effects, He is said 'to go forth out of His Place,' that is, out of His hiddenness. Again, since the Nature of God is Goodness, it is proper and co-natural to Him, to be propitious, have mercy and spare. In this way, the Place of God is His mercy. When then He passeth from the sweetness of pity to the rigor of equity, and, on account of our sins, sheweth Himself severe (which is, as it were, alien from Him) He goeth forth out of His Place." Jerome: "For He who is gentle and gracious, and whose Nature it is to have mercy, is constrained, on your account, to take the seeming of hardness, which is not His."<p>He comes invisibly now, in that it is He who punisheth, through whatever power or will of man He useth; He shews forth His Holiness through the punishment of unholiness. But the words, which are image-language now, shall be most exactly fulfilled in the end, when, in the Person of our Lord, He shall come visibly to judge the world. Jerome, Theoph.: "In the Day of Judgment, Christ 'shall come down,' according to that Nature which He took, 'from His Place,' the highest heavens, and shall cast down the proud things of this world."<p>And will come down - Not by change of place, or in Himself, but as felt in the punishment of sin; and tread upon the high places of the earth; to bring down the pride of those (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/4-13.htm">Amos 4:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-8.htm">Job 9:8</a>) who  "being lifted up in their own conceit and lofty, sinning through pride and proud through sin, were yet created out of earth. For why is earth and ashes proud?" (Ecclesiasticus 10:9). What seems mightiest and most firm, is unto God less than is to man the dust under his feet. The high places were also the special scenes of an unceasing idolatry. "God treadeth in the good and humble, in that He dwelleth, walketh, feasteth in their hearts <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-16.htm">2 Corinthians 6:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-20.htm">Revelation 3:20</a>.

Your sins will procure this to you, O Samaria and Jerusalem, of which God is my witness I have plainly told you. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/micah/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For, behold, the Lord cometh out of his place,.... Out of heaven, the place of the house of his Shechinah or Majesty, as the Targum; where his throne is prepared; where he keeps his court, and displays his glory; from whence he removes, not by local motion, since he is everywhere; but by some manifest exertion of his power, either on the behalf of his people, or in taking vengeance on his and their enemies; or on them sinning against him, in which sense it is probably to be understood. It signifies not change of place, but of his dispensations; going out of his former customary method into another; removing, as Jarchi has it, from the throne of mercies to the throne of judgment; doing not acts of mercy, in which he delights, but exercising judgment, his strange work. So the Cabalistic writers (q) observe on the passage, that <p>"it cannot be understood of place properly taken, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-12.htm">Isaiah 40:12</a>; for God is the place of the world, not the world his place; hence our wise men so expound the text, he cometh forth out of the measure of mercy, and goes into the measure of justice;'' <p>or property of it. Some understand this of his leaving the temple at Jerusalem, and giving it up into the hands of the Chaldeans; but the former sense is best: <p>and will come down, and tread upon the high places of the earth; which are his footstool; Samaria and Jerusalem, built on mountains, and all other high towers and fortified places, together with men of high looks and haughty countenances, who exalt themselves like mountains, and swell with pride: these the Lord can easily subdue and humble, bring low and tread down like the mire of the street; perhaps there may be an allusion to the high places where idols were worshipped; and which were the cause of the Lord's wrath and vengeance, and of his coming forth, in this unusual way, in his providences. <p>(q) Kabala Denudata, par. 1. p. 408. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/micah/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For, behold, the LORD cometh forth out of his place, and will come <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> down, and tread upon the high places of the earth.</span><p>(c) Meaning by this that God will come to judgment against the strong cities and strongholds.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/micah/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">3</span>. <span class="ital">cometh forth out of his place</span>] Two persons may use the same expressions in very different senses. Heathen poets imagined that divine beings ‘came forth’ and mingled in the strife of mortals; the prophets adopt the same language as the symbol of the working of a spiritual Deity.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/micah/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - Here follows a grand description, in figurative language, of the course of Divine judgment, and of God's awful majesty and resistless power. <span class="cmt_word">Out of his place.</span> It is as though the sins of Israel had roused him to action. God is hidden except when he displays his power in judgment and mercy (see note on Zechariah 14:3). <span class="cmt_word">Will come down.</span> An anthropomorphic expression, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-21.htm">Genesis 18:21</a>. <span class="cmt_word">The high places.</span> As though descending from heaven, God first came upon the tops of the mountains (see note on Amos 4:13; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-13.htm">Deuteronomy 32:13</a>). The phrase would imply God's absolute sovereignty over the universe. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/amos/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"They hate the monitor in the gate, and abhor him that speaketh uprightly. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-11.htm">Amos 5:11</a>. Therefore, because ye tread upon the poor, and take the distribution of corn from him, ye have built houses of square stones, and will not dwell therein; planted pleasant vineyards, and will not drink their wine. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-12.htm">Amos 5:12</a>. For I know how many are your transgressions, and how great your sins; oppressing the righteous, taking atonement money; and ye bow down the poor in the gate." However natural it may seem to take &#1502;&#1493;&#1499;&#1497;&#1495; and &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-10.htm">Amos 5:10</a> as referring to prophets, who charge the ungodly with their acts of unrighteousness, as Jerome does, this explanation is precluded not only by bassha&#8219;ar (in the gate), since the gate was not the meeting-place of the people where the prophets were accustomed to stand, but the place where courts of judgment were held, and all the public affairs of the community discussed (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-19.htm">Deuteronomy 21:19</a>); but also by the first half of <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/5-11.htm">Amos 5:11</a>, which presupposes judicial proceedings. Mo&#772;kh&#305;&#772;a&#774;ch is not merely the judge who puts down unjust accusers, but any one who lifts up his voice in a court of justice against acts of injustice (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-21.htm">Isaiah 29:21</a>). &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, he who says what is blameless, i.e., what is right and true: this is to be taken generally, and not to be restricted to the accused who seeks to defend his innocence. &#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1489; is a stronger expression than &#1513;&#1474;&#1504;&#1488;. The punishment for this unjust oppression of the poor will be the withdrawal of their possessions. The &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;. bo&#772;she&#772;s is a dialectically different form for &#1489;&#1493;&#1505;&#1505;, from &#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;, to trample down (Rashi, Kimchi), analogous to the interchange of &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503; and &#1505;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503;, a coat of mail, although as a rule &#1513;&#1473; passes into &#1505;, and not &#1505; into &#1513;&#1473;. For the derivation from &#1489;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;, according to which &#1489;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1505; would stand for &#1489;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1513;&#1473; (Hitzig and Tuch on Genesis p. 85), is opposed both to the construction with &#1506;&#1500;, and also to the circumstance that &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1513;&#1473; means to delay (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-1.htm">Exodus 32:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-28.htm">Judges 5:28</a>); and the derivation suggested by Hitzig from an Arabic verb, signifying to carry one's self haughtily towards others, is a mere loophole. Taking a gift of corn from the poor refers to unjust extortion on the part of the judge, who will only do justice to a poor man when he is paid for it. The main clause, which was introduced with la&#770;khe&#772;n, is continued with &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; &#1490;&#1494;&#1497;&#1514;: "thus have ye built houses of square stones, and shall not dwell therein;" for "ye shall not dwell in the houses of square stones which ye have built." The threat is taken from <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-30.htm">Deuteronomy 28:30</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-39.htm">Deuteronomy 28:39</a>, and sets before them the plundering of the land and the banishment of the people. Houses built of square stones are splendid buildings (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-9.htm">Isaiah 9:9</a>). The reason for this threat is given in <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/5-12.htm">Amos 5:12</a>, where reference is made to the multitude and magnitude of the sins, of which injustice in the administration of justice is again held up as the chief sin. The participles &#1510;&#1512;&#1512;&#1497; and &#1500;&#1511;&#1495;&#1497; are attached to the suffixes of &#1508;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501; and &#1495;&#1496;&#1468;&#1488;&#1514;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501;: your sins, who oppress the righteous, attack him, and take atonement money, contrary to the express command of the law in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/35-31.htm">Numbers 35:31</a>, to take no ko&#772;pher for the soul of a murderer. The judges allowed the rich murderer to purchase exemption from capital punishment by the payment of atonement money, whilst they bowed down the right of the poor. Observe the transition from the participle to the third person fem., by which the prophet turns away with disgust from these ungodly judges. Bowing down the poor is a concise expression for bowing down the right of the poor: compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/2-7.htm">Amos 2:7</a> and the warnings against this sin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-6.htm">Exodus 23:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-19.htm">Deuteronomy 16:19</a>). </body></html>
