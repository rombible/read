It is justly observed by Mr. Scott here, that though the reformation of the Jews, after their return from Babylon, might be alluded to in this passage, yet the purification of the Christian Church from all antichristian corruptions of faith and worship, and all idolatry and superstition, seems more immediately to be predicted. “The reliance on human merits for justification, the external pomp used in worship, and the oppressive exercise of human authority in mere matters of conscience, will be entirely destroyed by the clear light of divine truth, and the power of divine grace; and simplicity and purity in doctrine, worship, and practice, will prevail, when the enemies of the church shall be destroyed.” <span class="ital">And I will execute vengeance in anger, </span>&c. — When I have purged my people from their corruptions, I will severely vindicate their cause, to the utter destruction of all their unbelieving enemies. <span class="ital">Such as they have not heard — </span>In an unprecedented manner.

But to those who neglected or opposed this salvation, they would, as lions, cause terror, their doctrine condemning them. The Lord also declares that he would cause not only the reformation of the Jews, but the purification of the Christian church.

The Church shall not need the temptation of human defense; for God shall fence her in on every side. Great cities too, as the abode of luxury and sin, of power and pride, and, mostly, of cruelty, are chiefly denounced as the objects of God's anger. Babylon stands as the emblem of the whole city of the world or of the devil, as opposed to God. Rup.: "The first city was built by Cain; Abel and the other saints heed no continuing city" <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-14.htm">Hebrews 13:14</a> here. Cities then will include (Rup.) "all the tumults and evil passions and ambition and strife and bloodshed, which Cain brought in among men. Cities are collectively called and are Babylon, with whom, (as in the Revelations we hear a voice from heaven saying), "the kings of the earth committed fornication and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies" <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/18-3.htm">Revelation 18:3</a>; and of which it is written, "And a mighty Angel took up a stone like a great millstone, and cast it into the sea, saying, Thus with violence shall that great city, Babylon, be thrown down, and shall be found no more at all." <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/18-21.htm">Revelation 18:21</a>. "Great rest then is promised to holy Zion that is, the Church, when the cities or strongholds of the land (strongholds, as they are, of earthliness) shall be destroyed. For together with them are included all objects of desire in them, with the sight whereof the citizens of the kingdom of God, while pilgrims here, are tempted; whereof the wise man saith, Vanity of vanities, all is vanity."<p>The fulfillment reaches on to the Day of Judgment, when the Church shall finally receive glory from the Lord, and be "without spot and wrinkle" <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-27.htm">Ephesians 5:27</a>. All looks on to that Day. The very largeness of the promise, which speaks, in its fullest sense, of the destruction of things, without which we can hardly do in this life, (as cities  or things very useful to the needs of man, (as horses,) carries us on yet more to that Day when there will be no more need of any outward things; Rup.: "when the heavy body shall be changed, and shall have the swiftness of angels, and shall be transported whither it willeth, without chariots and horses; and all things which tempt the eye shall cease; and no evil shall enter; and there shall be no need of divining, amid the presence and full knowledge of God, and where the ever-present Face of God, who is Truth, shall shine on all, and nothing be uncertain or unknown; nor shall they need to form in their souls images of Him whom His own shall see as He Is; nor shall they esteem anything of self, or the work of their own hands; but God shall be All in all." In like way, the woe on those who obey not the truth, also looks on to the end. It too is final. There is nothing to soften it. Punishments in the course of life are medicinal. Here no mention is made of Mercy, but only of executing vengeance; and that, with wrath and fury; and that, such as they have not heard. For as eye hath not seen, nor heart conceived the good things laid up in store for those who love God, so neither the evil things prepared for those who, in act, shew that they hate Him. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/micah/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. witchcrafts out of thine hand&#8212;that is, which thou now usest.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/micah/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> In this verse the Lord foretells the downfall of all unlawful arts which had been in use, though forbidden by the law of God, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-27.htm" title="A man also or woman that has a familiar spirit, or that is a wizard, shall surely be put to death: they shall stone them with stones: their blood shall be on them.">Leviticus 20:27</a></span>.

The correct and full interpretation not only of this verse, but of the whole chapter, depends upon the answer to be given to the question, what altar we are to understand by hammizbe&#772;a&#774;ch. Ewald, Hitzig, Hofmann, and Baur follow Cyril in thinking of the temple at Bethel, because, as Hitzig says, this vision attaches itself in an explanatory manner to the close of <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/8-14.htm">Amos 8:14</a>, and because, according to Hofmann, "if the word of the prophet in general was directed against the kingdom, the royal house and the sanctuary of the ten tribes, the article before hammizbe&#772;a&#774;ch points to the altar of the sanctuary in the kingdom of Israel, to the altar at Bethel, against which he has already prophesied in a perfectly similar manner in <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/3-14.htm">Amos 3:14</a>." But there is no ground whatever for the assertion that our vision contains simply an explanation of <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-14.htm">Amos 8:14</a>. The connection with <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/8-1.htm">Amos 8:1-14</a> is altogether not so close, that the object of the prophecy in the one chapter must of necessity cover that of the other. And it is quite incorrect to say that the word of the prophet throughout is directed simply against the kingdom of the ten tribes, or that, although Amos does indeed reprove the sins of Judah as well as those of Israel, he proclaims destruction to the kingdom of Jeroboam alone. As early as <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/2-5.htm">Amos 2:5</a> he announces desolation to Judah by fire, and the burning of the palaces of Jerusalem; and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/6-1.htm">Amos 6:1</a>, again, he gives utterance to a woe upon the self-secure in Zion, as well as upon the careless ones in Samaria. And lastly, it is evident from <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/9-8.htm">Amos 9:8-10</a> of the present chapter, that the sinful kingdom which is to be destroyed from the face of the earth is not merely the kingdom of the ten tribes, but the kingdoms of Judah and Israel, which are embraced in one. For although it is stated immediately afterwards that the Lord will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob, but will shake the house of Israel among all nations, the house of Jacob cannot mean the kingdom of Judah, and the house of Israel the kingdom of the ten tribes, because such a contrast between Judah and Israel makes the thought too lame, and the antithesis between the destruction of the sinful kingdom and the utter destruction of the nation is quite obliterated. Amos does not generally draw such a distinction between the house of Jacob and the house of Israel, as that the first represents Judah, and the second the ten tribes; but he uses the two epithets as synonymous, as we may see from a comparison of <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-8.htm">Amos 6:8</a> with <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/6-14.htm">Amos 6:14</a>, where the rejection of the pride of Israel and the hating of its palaces (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/9-8.htm">Amos 9:8</a>) are practically interpreted by the raising up of a nation which oppresses the house of Israel in all its borders (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/9-14.htm">Amos 9:14</a>). And so also in the chapter before us, the "house of Israel" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/9-9.htm">Amos 9:9</a>) is identical with "Israel" and the "children of Israel" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/9-7.htm">Amos 9:7</a>), whom God brought up out of Egypt. But God brought up out of Egypt not the ten tribes, but the twelve. And consequently it is decidedly incorrect to restrict the contents of <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/9-1.htm">Amos 9:1-10</a> to the kingdom of the ten tribes. And if this be the case, we cannot possibly understand by hammizbe&#772;a&#774;ch in <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/9-1.htm">Amos 9:1</a> the altar of Bethel, especially seeing that not only does Amos foretel the visitation or destruction of the altars of Bethel in <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/3-14.htm">Amos 3:14</a>, and therefore recognises not one altar only in Bethel, but a plurality of altars, but that he also speaks in <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/7-9.htm">Amos 7:9</a> of the desolation of the high places and sanctuaries in Israel, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-14.htm">Amos 8:14</a> places the sanctuary at Daniel on a par with that at Bethel; so that there was not any one altar in the kingdom of the ten tribes, which could be called hammizbe&#772;a&#774;ch, the altar par excellence, inasmuch as it possessed from the very beginning two sanctuaries of equal dignity (viz., at Bethel and Dan). Hammizbe&#772;a&#774;ch, therefore, both here and at <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/9-2.htm">Ezekiel 9:2</a>, is the altar of burnt-offering in the temple, at Jerusalem, the sanctuary of the whole of the covenant nation, to which even the ten bribes still belonged, in spite of their having fallen away from the house of David. So long as the Lord still continued to send prophets to the ten tribes, so long did they pass as still forming part of the people of God, and so long also was the temple at Jerusalem the divinely appointed sanctuary and the throne of Jehovah, from which both blessings and punishment issued from the. The Lord roars from Zion, and from Zion He utters His voice (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-2.htm">Amos 1:2</a>), not only upon the nations who have shown hostility to Judah or Israel, but also upon Judah and Israel, on account of their departure from His law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/2-4.htm">Amos 2:4</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/2-6.htm">Amos 2:6</a>.).<p>The vision in this verse is founded upon the idea that the whole nation is assembled before the Lord at the threshold of the temple, so that it is buried under the ruins of the falling building, in consequence of the blow upon the top, which shatters the temple to its very foundations. The Lord appears at the altar, because here at the sacrificial place of the nation the sins of Israel are heaped up, that He may execute judgment upon the nation there. &#1504;&#1510;&#1468;&#1489; &#1506;&#1500;, standing at (not upon) the altar, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-1.htm">1 Kings 13:1</a>. He gives commandment to smite the top. The person who is to do this is not mentioned; but it was no doubt an angel, probably the &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488;&#1498; &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1497;&#1514;, who brought the pestilence as a punishment at the numbering of the people in the time of David (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-15.htm">2 Samuel 24:15-16</a>), who smote the army of the Assyrian king Sennacherib before Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-35.htm">2 Kings 19:35</a>), and who also slew the first-born of Egypt (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-13.htm">Exodus 12:13</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-23.htm">Exodus 12:23</a>); whereas in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/9-2.htm">Ezekiel 9:2</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/9-7.htm">Ezekiel 9:7</a>, He is represented as accomplishing the judgment of destruction by means of six angels. Hakkaphto&#772;r, the knob or top; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/25-31.htm">Exodus 25:31</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/25-33.htm">Exodus 25:33</a>, ff., an ornament upon the shaft and branches of the golden candlestick. Here it is an ornament at the top of the columns, and not "the lintel of the door," or "the pinnacle of the temple with its ornaments." For the latter explanation of kaphto&#772;r, which cannot be philologically sustained, by no means follows from the fact that the antithesis to the kaphto&#772;r is formed by the sipp&#305;&#772;m, or thresholds of the door. The knob and threshold simply express the contrast between the loftiest summit and the lowest base, without at all warranting the conclusion that the saph denotes the base of the pillar which culminated in a knob, or kaphto&#772;r, the top of the door which rested upon a threshold. The description is not architectural, but rhetorical, the separate portions of the whole being individualized, for the purpose of expressing the thought that the building was to be shattered to pieces in summo usque ad imum, a capite ad calcem. Would we bring out more clearly the idea which lies at the foundation of the rhetorical mode of expression, we have only to think of the capital of the pillars Jachin and Boaz, and that with special reference to their significance, as symbolizing the stability of the temple. The smiting of these pillars, so that they fall to the ground, individualizes the destruction of the temple, without there being any necessity in consequence to think of these pillars as supporting the roof of the temple hall. The rhetorical character of the expression comes out clearly again in what follows, "and smash them to pieces, i.e., lay them in ruins upon the head of all,"<p>(Note: Luther's rendering, "for their avarice shall come upon the head of all of them," in which he follows the Vulgate, arose from &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1506;&#1501; being confounded with &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1506;&#1501;.)<p>where the plural suffix attached to &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1506;&#1501; (with the toneless suffix for &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1506;&#1501;; see Ewald, 253, a) cannot possibly be taken as referring to the singular hakkaphto&#772;r, nor even to hassipp&#305;&#772;m alone, but must refer to the two nouns hakkaphto&#772;r and hassipp&#305;&#772;m. the reference to hassipp&#305;&#772;m could no doubt be grammatically sustained; but so far as the sense is concerned, it is inadmissible, inasmuch as when a building falls to the ground in consequence of its having been laid in ruins by a blow from above, the thresholds of the entrance could not possibly fall upon the heads of the men who were standing in front of it. The command has throughout a symbolical meaning, ad has no literal reference to the destruction of the temple. The temple symbolizes the kingdom of God, which the Lord had founded in Israel; and as being the centre of that kingdom, it stands here for the kingdom itself. In the temple, as the dwelling-place of the name of Jehovah, i.e., of the gracious presence of God, the idolatrous nation beheld an indestructible pledge of the lasting continuance of the kingdom. But this support to their false trust is taken away from it by the announcement that the Lord will lay the temple in ruins. The destruction of the temple represents the destruction of the kingdom of God embodied in the temple, with which indeed the earthly temple would of necessity fall to the ground. No one will escape this judgment. This is affirmed in the words which follow: And their last, their remnant ('acha&#774;r&#305;&#772;th, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/4-2.htm">Amos 4:2</a>), I will slay with the sword; as to the meaning of which Cocceius has correctly observed, that the magnitude of the slaughter is increased exclusione fugientium et eorum, qui videbantur effugisse. The apparent discrepancy in the statement, that they will all be crushed to pieces by the ruins, and yet there will be fugitives and persons who have escaped, is removed at once if we bear in mind that the intention of the prophet is to cut off every loophole for carnal security, and that the meaning of the words is simply this: "And even if any should succeed in fleeing and escaping, God will pursue them with the sword, and slay them" (see Hengstenberg, Christology, on this passage). </body></html>
