But to those who neglected or opposed this salvation, they would, as lions, cause terror, their doctrine condemning them. The Lord also declares that he would cause not only the reformation of the Jews, but the purification of the Christian church. In like manner shall we be assured of victory in our personal conflicts, as we simply depend upon the Lord our salvation, worship him, and serve him with diligence.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/micah/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I will cut off the cities of thy land - So God promised by Zechariah, "Jerusalem shall be inhabited as towns without walls; for I will be unto her a wall of fire round about" <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/2-4.htm">Zechariah 2:4-5</a>. The Church shall not need the temptation of human defense; for God shall fence her in on every side. Great cities too, as the abode of luxury and sin, of power and pride, and, mostly, of cruelty, are chiefly denounced as the objects of God's anger. Babylon stands as the emblem of the whole city of the world or of the devil, as opposed to God. Rup.: "The first city was built by Cain; Abel and the other saints heed no continuing city" <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-14.htm">Hebrews 13:14</a> here. Cities then will include (Rup.) "all the tumults and evil passions and ambition and strife and bloodshed, which Cain brought in among men. Cities are collectively called and are Babylon, with whom, (as in the Revelations we hear a voice from heaven saying), "the kings of the earth committed fornication and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies" <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/18-3.htm">Revelation 18:3</a>; and of which it is written, "And a mighty Angel took up a stone like a great millstone, and cast it into the sea, saying, Thus with violence shall that great city, Babylon, be thrown down, and shall be found no more at all." <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/18-21.htm">Revelation 18:21</a>. "Great rest then is promised to holy Zion that is, the Church, when the cities or strongholds of the land (strongholds, as they are, of earthliness) shall be destroyed. For together with them are included all objects of desire in them, with the sight whereof the citizens of the kingdom of God, while pilgrims here, are tempted; whereof the wise man saith, Vanity of vanities, all is vanity."<p>The fulfillment reaches on to the Day of Judgment, when the Church shall finally receive glory from the Lord, and be "without spot and wrinkle" <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-27.htm">Ephesians 5:27</a>. All looks on to that Day. The very largeness of the promise, which speaks, in its fullest sense, of the destruction of things, without which we can hardly do in this life, (as cities  or things very useful to the needs of man, (as horses,) carries us on yet more to that Day when there will be no more need of any outward things; Rup.: "when the heavy body shall be changed, and shall have the swiftness of angels, and shall be transported whither it willeth, without chariots and horses; and all things which tempt the eye shall cease; and no evil shall enter; and there shall be no need of divining, amid the presence and full knowledge of God, and where the ever-present Face of God, who is Truth, shall shine on all, and nothing be uncertain or unknown; nor shall they need to form in their souls images of Him whom His own shall see as He Is; nor shall they esteem anything of self, or the work of their own hands; but God shall be All in all." In like way, the woe on those who obey not the truth, also looks on to the end. It too is final. There is nothing to soften it. Punishments in the course of life are medicinal. Here no mention is made of Mercy, but only of executing vengeance; and that, with wrath and fury; and that, such as they have not heard. For as eye hath not seen, nor heart conceived the good things laid up in store for those who love God, so neither the evil things prepared for those who, in act, shew that they hate Him. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/micah/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15. vengeance &#8230; such as they have not heard&#8212;or, as the Hebrew order favors, "the nations that have not hearkened to My warnings."

He is supreme Judge, to whom vengeance belongeth, and when he hath passed the sentence, and his instruments execute it, he takes it to himself: so when the Babylonians avenged the wrongs by the Assyrian done to the Jews, and when Cyrus with his Persians and Medes avenged the injuries of Babylon, this prophecy was partly fulfilled, and in succeeding times it was further fulfilled, and is now fulfilling, and so will be, until the final destruction of the wicked. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">In anger and fury:</span> this spoken after the manner of man; it includes the greatness of God’s just displeasure, and the effects of it, which are resembled to what we do when furiously angry, act with utmost strength, and in the most terrible manner we can; so God will, with as great severity and terror as flesh and blood can bear, proceed against these heathens. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Upon the heathen; </span> literally, the nations under the Assyrian monarchy first, next the nations under the Babylonish kingdom: in the full import of the words, all the nations that are enemies to the Lord, to his Christ, and to his peculiar people, who know not God, nor obey the gospel. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Such as they have not heard; </span> with unparalleled terror; and so they shall be made warning-pieces to others. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/micah/5.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And I will execute vengeance in anger, and fury upon the Heathen,....

"If they break through into hell, my hand will take them thence; and if they climb up to heaven, thence will I fetch them down. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/9-3.htm">Amos 9:3</a>. And if they hide themselves upon the top of Carmel, I will trace them, and fetch them thence; and if they conceal themselves from before mine eyes in the bottom of the sea, thence do I command the serpent, and it biteth them. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/9-4.htm">Amos 9:4</a>. And if they go into captivity before their enemies, I will command the sword thence, and it slayeth them; and I direct my eye upon them for evil, and not for good." The imperfects, with &#1488;&#1501;, are to be taken as futures. They do not assume what is impossible as merely hypothetical, in the sense of "if they should hide themselves;" but set forth what was no doubt in actual fact an impossible case, as though it were possible, in order to cut off every escape. For the cases mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/9-3.htm">Amos 9:3</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/9-4.htm">Amos 9:4</a> might really occur. Hiding upon Carmel and going into captivity belong to the sphere of possibility and of actual occurrence. In order to individualize the thought, that escape from the punishing arm of the Almighty is impossible, the prophet opposes the most extreme spaces of the world to one another, starting from heaven and hell, as the loftiest height and deepest depth of the universe, in doing which he has in all probability <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/139-7.htm">Psalm 139:7-8</a> floating before his mind. He commences with the height, which a man cannot possibly climb, and the depth, to which he cannot descend, to show that escape is impossible. &#1495;&#1514;&#1512;, to break through, with &#1489;, to make a hole into anything (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-8.htm">Ezekiel 8:8</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-5.htm">Ezekiel 12:5</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-7.htm">Ezekiel 12:7</a>). According to the Hebrew view, Sheol was deep in the interior of the earth. The head of Carmel is mentioned (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-26.htm">Joshua 19:26</a>). The reference is not to the many caves in this promontory, which afford shelter to fugitives; for they are not found upon the head of Carmel, but for the most part on the western side (see v. Raumer, Pal. p. 44). The emphasis lies rather upon the head, as a height overgrown with trees, which, even if not very high (about 1800 feet; see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-19.htm">1 Kings 18:19</a>), yet, in comparison with the sea over which it rises, might appear to be of a very considerable height; in addition to which, the situation of Carmel, on the extreme western border of the kingdom of Israel, might also be taken into consideration. "Whoever hides himself there, must assuredly know of no other place of security in the whole of the land besides. And if there is no longer any security there, there is nothing left but the sea." But even the deep sea-bottom will not shelter from the vengeance of God. God commands the serpent, or summons the serpent to bite him. Na&#770;cha&#770;sh, here the water-serpent, called elsewhere livya&#772;tha&#772;n or tann&#305;&#772;n (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/27-1.htm">Isaiah 27:1</a>), a sea-monster, which was popularly supposed to be extremely dangerous, but which cannot be more exactly defined. Even by going into captivity, they will not be protected from the sword. &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1489;&#1497;, not into captivity, but in statu captivitatis: even if they should be among those who were wandering into captivity, where men are generally sure of their lives (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/1-5.htm">Lamentations 1:5</a>). For God has fixed His eye upon them, i.e., has taken them under His special superintendence (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-12.htm">Jeremiah 39:12</a>); not, however, to shelter, to protect, and to bless, but &#1500;&#1512;&#1506;&#1492;, for evil, i.e., to punish them. "The people of the Lord remain, under all circumstances, the object of special attention. They are more richly blessed than the world, but they are also more severely punished" (Hengstenberg). </body></html>
