But to those who neglected or opposed this salvation, they would, as lions, cause terror, their doctrine condemning them. The Lord also declares that he would cause not only the reformation of the Jews, but the purification of the Christian church. In like manner shall we be assured of victory in our personal conflicts, as we simply depend upon the Lord our salvation, worship him, and serve him with diligence.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/micah/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Their hand shall be lifted up upon their adversaries - The might of the Church is the Might of Christ in her, and the glory of the Church is His from whom it comes and to whom it returns. It is all one, whether this be said to Christ or to the "remnant of Jacob, that is, His Church. Her "enemies" are His, and her's only because they are His, and hate her as belonging to Him. They "shall be cut off," either ceasing to be His enemies, or ceasing to be, as Julian or Arius or antichrist, "whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of His Mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of His Coming" <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-8.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:8</a>.

Thine hand shall be lifted up&#8212;In Isa 26:11 it is Jehovah's hand that is lifted up; here Israel's as Mic 5:8 implies, just as "Zion" is addressed and directed to "beat in pieces many people" (Mic 4:13; compare Isa 54:15, 17). For Israel's foes are Jehovah's foes. When her hand is said to be lifted up, it is Jehovah's hand that strikes the foe by her (compare Ex 13:9, with Ex 14:8).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/micah/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Thine; </span> Messiah, or a people of God, nay both, forasmuch as whatever these can do, they do it, not in their own power, but in Christ’s power. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Thine hand; </span> thy strength and power, for so does the Scripture usually express strength or might. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Shall be lifted up upon thine adversaries; </span> shall be greatly exalted, and shall be wonderfully successful against enemies, who in great multitudes did set upon the people of God; such were those who fought the Maccabees, and were defeated by them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">All thine enemies, </span> who do obstinately hold on in the enmity of their natures, ways, and doings, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">shall be cut off; </span> finally, certainly, eternally, and dreadfully perish.

"Behold, days come, is the saying of the Lord Jehovah, that I send a hungering into the land, not a hungering for bread nor a thirst for water, but to hear the words of Jehovah. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-12.htm">Amos 8:12</a>. And they will reel from sea to sea; and from the north, and even to the east, they sweep round to seek the word of Jehovah, and will not find it." The bitterness of the time of punishment is increased by the fact that the Lord will then withdrawn His word from them, i.e., the light of His revelation. They who will not now hear His word, as proclaimed by the prophets, will then cherish the greatest longing for it. Such hunger and thirst will be awakened by the distress and affliction that will come upon them. The intensity of this desire is depicted in <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-12.htm">Amos 8:12</a>. They reel (&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/4-8.htm">Amos 4:8</a>) from the sea to the sea; that is to say, not "from the Dead Sea in the east to the Mediterranean in the west," for <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-20.htm">Joel 2:20</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-8.htm">Zechariah 14:8</a> are not cases in point, as the two seas are defined there by distinct epithets; but as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-8.htm">Psalm 72:8</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/9-10.htm">Zechariah 9:10</a>, according to which the meaning is, from the sea to where the sea occurs again, at the other end of the world, "the sea being taken as the boundary of the earth" (Hupfeld). The other clause, "from the north even to the east," contains an abridged expression for "from north to south and from west to east," i.e., to every quarter of the globe. </body></html>
