The sin of man works not the righteousness of God. Even when men do that which in itself is good, but do it for filthy lucre, it becomes abomination both to God and man. Faith rests in the Lord as the soul's foundation: presumption only leans upon the Lord as a prop, and would use him to serve a turn. If men's having the Lord among them will not keep them from doing evil, it never can secure them from suffering evil for so doing. See the doom of wicked Jacob; Therefore shall Zion for your sake be ploughed as a field. This was exactly fulfilled at the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans, and is so at this day. If sacred places are polluted by sin, they will be wasted and ruined by the judgments of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/micah/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They build up - (literally, building, sing.) Zion with blood This may be taken literally on both sides, that, the rich built their palaces, "with wealth gotten by bloodshed , by rapine of the poor, by slaughter of the saints," as Ezekiel says, 'her princes in the midst thereof are like wolves, to shed blood, to destroy souls, to get dishonest gain' <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-27.htm">Ezekiel 22:27</a>. Or by blood he may mean that they indirectly took away life, in that, through wrong judgments, extortion, usury, fraud, oppression, reducing wages or detaining them, they took away what was necessary to support life. So it is said; 'The bread of the needy is their life, he that defraudeth him thereof is a man of blood. He that taketh away his neighbor's living slayeth him, and he that defraudeth the laborer of his hire is a bloodshedder' (Ecclus. 34:21, 22). Or it may be, that as David prayed to God, 'Build Thou the walls of Jerusalem, asking Him thereby to maintain or increase its well-being' <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/51-18.htm">Psalm 51:18</a>, so these men thought to promote the temporal prosperity of Jerusalem by doings which were unjust, oppressive, crushing to their inferiors.<p>So Solomon, in His degenerate days, made the yoke upon his people and his service grievious <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-4.htm">1 Kings 12:4</a>. So ambitious monarchs by large standing-armies or filling their exchequers drain the life-blood of their people. The physical condition and stature of the poorer population in much of France was lowered permanently by the conscriptions under the first Emperor. In our wealthy nation, the term poverty describes a condition of other days. We have had to coin a new name to designate the misery, offspring of our material prosperity. From our wealthy towns, (as from those of Flanders,) ascends to heaven against us , "the cry of 'pauperism' that is, the cry of distress, arrived at a condition of system and of power, and, by an unexpected curse, issuing from the very development of wealth. The political economy of unbelief has been crushed by facts on all the theaters of human activity and industry."<p>Truly we "build up Zion with blood," when we cheapen luxuries and comforts at the price of souls, use Christian toil like brute strength, tempt men to dishonesty and women to other sin, to eke out the scanty wages which alone our selfish thirst for cheapness allows, heedless of every thing save of our individual gratification, or the commercial prosperity, which we have made our god. Most awfully was "Zion built with blood," when the Jews shed the innocent Blood, that <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-48.htm">John 11:48</a> the Romans might not take away their place and nation. But since He has said, "Inasmuch as ye did it not unto one of the least of these My brethren, ye did it not unto Me" <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/25-45.htm">Matthew 25:45</a>, and, "Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou Me?" <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/9-4.htm">Acts 9:4</a>, when Saul was persecuting Christ's members, then, in this waste of lives and of souls, we are not only wasting the Price of His Blood in ourselves and others, but are slaying Christ anew, and that, from the same motives as those who crucified Him <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-12.htm">1 Corinthians 8:12</a>. When ye sin (against the members, ye sin against Christ. Our commercial greatness is the Price of His Blood <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-6.htm">Matthew 27:6</a>. In the judgments on the Jews, we may read our own national future; in the woe on those through whom the weak brother perishes for whom Christ died <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-11.htm">1 Corinthians 8:11</a>, we, if we partake or connive at it, may read our own. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/micah/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10.

Or, "O thou that buildest up" (g), &amp;c. or "everyone of them that buildeth up" (h), &amp;c. for the word is in the singular number; but, be fire words rendered either of these ways, they respect the heads and princes of the people; who either repaired the temple on Zion, or ornamented the king's palace, or built themselves fine stately houses in Jerusalem, or large streets there, by money they took of murderers to save them, as Kimchi; or by money got by rapine and oppression, by spoiling the poor of their goods and their livelihood, for them and their families, which was all one as shedding innocent blood; and by money obtained by bribes, for the perversion of justice, and such like illegal proceedings, truly called iniquity.

Cheyne thinks this to be a too dark view of the state of public morals, and would therefore consider "blood" to be used for violent conduct leading to ruin of others, comparing <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-15.htm">Isaiah 1:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-3.htm">Isaiah 59:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-11.htm">Proverbs 1:11</a>. In these passages, however, actual bloodshed may be meant; and we know too little of the moral condition of Judaea at this time to be able to decide against the darker view. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/amos/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Devouring Fire. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/7-4.htm">Amos 7:4</a>. "Thus the Lord Jehovah showed me: and, behold, the Lord Jehovah called to punish with fire; and it devoured the great flood, and devoured the portion. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/7-5.htm">Amos 7:5</a>. And I said, Lord Jehovah, leave off, I:pray: how can Jacob stand? for it is small. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/7-6.htm">Amos 7:6</a>. Jehovah repented of this; this also shall not take place, said the Lord Jehovah." That the all-devouring fire represents a much severer judgment than that depicted under the figure of the locusts, is generally acknowledged, and needs no proof. But the more precise meaning of this judgment is open to dispute, and depends upon the explanation of the fourth verse. The object to &#1511;&#1512;&#1488; is &#1500;&#1512;&#1497;&#1489; &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;, and &#1512;&#1497;&#1489; is to be taken as an infinitive, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-13.htm">Isaiah 3:13</a> : He called to strive (i.e., to judge or punish) with fire. There is no necessity to supply ministros suos here. The expression is a concise one, for "He called to the fire to punish with fire" (for the expression and the fact, compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-16.htm">Isaiah 66:16</a>). This fire devoured the great flood. Teho&#772;m rabba&#770;h is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/7-11.htm">Genesis 7:11</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-10.htm">Isaiah 51:10</a>, etc., to denote the unfathomable ocean; and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a> teho&#772;m is the term applied to the immense flood which surrounded and covered the globe at the beginning of the creation. &#1493;&#1488;&#1499;&#1500;&#1492;, as distinguished from &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1499;&#1500;, signifies an action in progress, or still incomplete (Hitzig). The meaning therefore is, "it also devoured (began to devour) 'eth-hache&#772;leq;" i.e., not the field, for a field does not form at all a fitting antithesis to the ocean; and still less "the land," for che&#772;leq never bears this meaning; but the inheritance or portion, namely, that of Jehovah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-9.htm">Deuteronomy 32:9</a>), i.e., Israel. Consequently teho&#772;m rabba&#770;h cannot, of course, signify the ocean as such. For the idea of the fire falling upon the ocean, and consuming it, and then beginning to consume the land of Israel, by which the ocean was bounded (Hitzig), would be too monstrous; nor is it justified by the simple remark, that "it was as if the last great conflagration (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-10.htm">2 Peter 3:10</a>) had begun" (Schmieder). As the fire is to earthly fire, but the fire of the wrath of God, and therefore a figurative representation of the judgment of destruction; and as hache&#772;leq (the portion) is not the land of Israel, but according to Deuteronomy (l.c.) Israel, or the people of Jehovah; so teho&#772;m rabba&#770;h is not the ocean, but the heathen world, the great sea of nations, in their rebellion against the kingdom of God. The world of nature in a state of agitation is a frequent symbol in the Scriptures for the agitated heathen world (e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/46-3.htm">Psalm 46:3</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/93-3.htm">Psalm 93:3-4</a>). On the latter passage, Delitzsch has the following apt remark: "The stormy sea is a figurative representation of the whole heathen world, in its estrangement from God, and enmity against Him, or the human race outside the true church of God; and the rivers are figurative representations of the kingdoms of the world, e.g., the Nile of the Egyptian (<a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-7.htm">Jeremiah 46:7-8</a>), the Euphrates of the Assyrian (<a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-7.htm">Isaiah 8:7-8</a>), or more precisely still, the arrow-swift Tigris of the Assyrian, and the winding Euphrates of the Babylonian (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/27-1.htm">Isaiah 27:1</a>)." This symbolism lies at the foundation of the vision seen by the prophet. The world of nations, in its rebellion against Jehovah, the Lord and King of the world, appears as a great flood, like the chaos at the beginning of the creation, or the flood which poured out its waves upon the globe in the time of Noah. Upon this flood of nations does fire from the Lord fall down and consume them; and after consuming them, it begins to devour the inheritance of Jehovah, the nation of Israel also. The prophet then prays to the Lord to spare it, because Jacob would inevitably perish in this conflagration; and the Lord gives the promise that "this shall not take place," so that Israel is plucked like a firebrand out of the fire (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/4-11.htm">Amos 4:11</a>).<p>If we inquire now into the historical bearing of these two visions, so much is  priori clear, - namely, that both of them not only indicate judgments already past, but also refer to the future, since no fire had hitherto burned upon the surface of the globe, which had consumed the world of nations and threatened to annihilate Israel. If therefore there is an element of truth in the explanation given by Grotius to the first vision, "After the fields had been shorn by Benhadad (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-3.htm">2 Kings 13:3</a>), and after the damage which was then sustained, the condition of Israel began to flourish once more during the reign of Jeroboam the son of Joash, as we see from <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-15.htm">2 Kings 14:15</a>," according to which the locusts would refer to the invasion on the part of the Assyrians in the time of Pul; this application is much too limited, neither exhausting the contents of the first vision, nor suiting in the smallest degree the figure of the fire. The "mowing of the king" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/7-1.htm">Amos 7:1</a>) denotes rather all the judgments which the Lord had hitherto poured out upon Israel, embracing everything that the prophet mentions in <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/4-6.htm">Amos 4:6-10</a>. The locusts are a figurative representation of the judgments that still await the covenant nation, and will destroy it even to a small remnant, which will be saved through the prayers of the righteous. The vision of the fire has a similar scope, embracing all the past and all the future; but this also indicates the judgments that fall upon the heathen world, and will only receive its ultimate fulfilment in the destruction of everything that is ungodly upon the face of the earth, when the Lord comes in fire to strive with all flesh (<a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-15.htm">Isaiah 66:15-16</a>), and to burn up the earth and all that is therein, on the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-7.htm">2 Peter 3:7</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-10.htm">2 Peter 3:10-13</a>). The removal of the two judgments, however, by Jehovah in consequence of the intercession of the prophet, shows that these judgments are not intended to effect the utter annihilation of the nation of God, but simply its refinement and the rooting out of the sinners from the midst of it, and that, in consequence of the sparing mercy of God, a holy remnant of the nation of God will be left. The next two visions refer simply to the judgment which awaits the kingdom of the ten tribes in the immediate future. </body></html>
