Then shall it be too late to knock when the door shall be shut, and too late to cry for mercy when it is the time of justice” (Commination Service). So also Isaiah declared (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-15.htm" title="And when you spread forth your hands, I will hide my eyes from you: yes, when you make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood.">Isaiah 1:15</a>): “When ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you; yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood.”<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/micah/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:1-8 Men cannot expect to do ill, and fare well; but to find that done to them which they did to others. How seldom do wholesome truths reach the ears of those in high stations or in authority! Those who deceive others are preparing confusion for their own faces. The prophet had ardent love to God and to the souls of men; deep concern for his glory and their salvation, and zeal against sin. The difficulties he met with did not drive him from his work. He had this strength; not from and of himself, but he was full of power by the Spirit of the Lord. Those who act honestly, may act boldly. And those who come to hear the word of God, must be willing to be told of their faults, must take it kindly, and be thankful.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/micah/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Then shall they cry unto the Lord - "Then." The prophet looks on to the Day of the Lord, which is always before his mind. So the Psalmist, speaking of a time or place not expressed, says, "There were they in great fear" <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/53-5.htm">Psalm 53:5</a>. He sees it, points to it, as seeing what those to whom he spoke, saw not, and the more awfully, because he saw, with superhuman (certain) vision, what was "hidden from their eyes." The then was not then, "in the time of grace," but when the Day of grace should be over, and the Day of Judgment should be come. So of that day, when judgment should set in, God says in Jeremiah, "Behold I will bring evil upon them which they shall not be able to go forth of, and they will cry unto Me, and I will not hearken unto them" <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-11.htm">Jeremiah 11:11</a>. And David, "They cried and there was none to save; unto the Lord, and He answered them not" <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-41.htm">Psalm 18:41</a>. And Solomon; "Whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor, he shall cry himself and shall not be heard" <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-13.htm">Proverbs 21:13</a>. And James, "He shall have judgment without mercy, that hath shewed no mercy" <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-13.htm">James 2:13</a>. The prayer is never too late, until judgment comes ; the day of grace is over, when the time of judgment has arrived. "They shall cry unto the Lord, and shall not be heard, because they too did not hear those who asked them, and the Lord shall turn His Face from them, because they too turned their face from those who prayed them."<p>He will even hide His Face - He will not look in mercy on those who would not receive His look of grace. Your sins, He says by Isaiah, "have hid His face from you, that He heareth not." O what will that turning away of the Face be, on which hangs eternity!<p>As - There is a proportion between the sin and the punishment . As I have done, so God hath requited me. "They have behaved themselves ill in their doings. literally have made their deeds evil." The word rendered doings is almost always used in a bad sense, mighty deeds, and so deeds with a high hand. Not ignorantly or negligently, nor through human frailty, but with set purpose they applied themselves, not to amend but to corrupt their doings, and make them worse. God called to them by all His prophets, make good your doings <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-15.htm">Jeremiah 35:15</a>; and they, reversing it, used diligence to make their doings evil. Jerome: "All this they shall suffer, because they were not rulers, but tyrants; not Prefects, but lions; not masters of disciples, but wolves of sheep; and they sated themselves with flesh and were fattened, and, as sacrifices for the slaughter, were made ready for the punishment of the Lord. Thus far against evil rulers; then he turns to the false prophets and evil teachers, who by flatteries subvert the people of God, promising them the knowledge of His word." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/micah/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. Then&#8212;at the time of judgment, which Micah takes for granted, so certain is it (compare Mic 2:3).<p>they cry &#8230; but he will not hear&#8212;just as those oppressed by them had formerly cried, and they would not hear. Their prayer shall be rejected, because it is the mere cry of nature for deliverance from pain, not that of repentance for deliverance from sin.<p>ill in their doings&#8212;Men cannot expect to do ill and fare well.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/micah/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Then; </span> when that time and those miseries which Micah foretells shall come upon them, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/micah/1-6.htm" title="Therefore I will make Samaria as an heap of the field, and as plantings of a vineyard: and I will pour down the stones thereof into the valley, and I will discover the foundations thereof....">Micah 1:6-8</a> 2:3</span>, when God shall retaliate and pay these great ones in their own coin.

"Do horses indeed run upon the rock, or do men plough (there) with oxen, that ye turn justice into poison, and the fruit of the righteousness into wormwood? <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-13.htm">Amos 6:13</a>. They who rejoice over what is worthless, who say: with our strength we make ourselves horns! <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-14.htm">Amos 6:14</a>. For, behold, I raise over you, O house of Israel, is the saying of Jehovah, the God of hosts, a nation; and they will oppress you from the territory of Hamath to the brook of the desert." To explain the threat in <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/6-11.htm">Amos 6:11</a>, Amos now calls attention in <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/6-12.htm">Amos 6:12</a>, under two different similes, to the perversity with which the haughty magnates of Israel, who turn right into bitter wrong, imagine that they can offer a successful resistance, or bid defiance with their own strength to the enemy, whom the Lord will raise up as the executor of His judgment. The perversion of right into its opposite can no more bring salvation than horses can run upon rocks, or any one plough upon such a soil with oxen. In the second question &#1489;&#1468;&#1505;&#1468;&#1500;&#1506; (on the rock) is to be repeated from the first, as the majority of commentators suppose. But the two questions are not to be taken in connection with the previous verse in the sense of "Ye will no more be able to avert this destruction than horses can run upon rocks," etc. (Chr. B. Mich.). They belong to what follows, and are meant to expose the moral perversity of the unrighteous conduct of the wicked. For &#1492;&#1508;&#1499;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-7.htm">Amos 5:7</a>; and for &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/10-4.htm">Hosea 10:4</a>. The impartial administration of justice is called the "fruit of righteousness," on account of the figurative use of the terms darnel and wormwood. These great men, however, rejoice thereby in &#1500;&#1488; &#1491;&#1489;&#1512;, "a nothing," or a thing which has no existence. What the prophet refers to may be seen from the parallel clause, viz., their imaginary strength (cho&#772;zeq). They rested this hope upon the might with which Jeroboam had smitten the Syrians, and restored the ancient boundaries of the kingdom. From this might they would take to themselves (la&#770;qach, to take, not now for the first time to create, or ask of God) the horns, to thrust down all their foes. Horns are signs and symbols of power (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-17.htm">Deuteronomy 33:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-11.htm">1 Kings 22:11</a>); here they stand for the military resources, with which they fancied that they could conquer every foe. These delusions of God-forgetting pride the prophet casts down, by saying that Jehovah the God of hosts will raise up a nation against them, which will crush them down in the whole length and breadth of the kingdom. This nation was Assyria. K&#305;&#772; hinne&#772;h (for behold) is repeated from <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-11.htm">Amos 6:11</a>; and the threat in <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-14.htm">Amos 6:14</a> is thereby described as the resumption and confirmation of the threat expressed in <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/6-11.htm">Amos 6:11</a>, although the k&#305;&#772; is connected with the perversity condemned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/6-12.htm">Amos 6:12</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/6-13.htm">Amos 6:13</a>, of trusting in their own power. La&#770;chats, to oppress, to crush down. On the expression &#1500;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488; &#1495;&#1502;&#1514;, as a standing epithet for the northern boundary of the kingdom of Israel, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/34-8.htm">Numbers 34:8</a>. As the southern boundary we have &#1504;&#1495;&#1500; &#1492;&#1506;&#1512;&#1489;&#1492; instead of &#1497;&#1501; &#1492;&#1506;&#1512;&#1489;&#1492; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-25.htm">2 Kings 14:25</a>). This is not the willow-brook mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/15-7.htm">Isaiah 15:7</a>, the present Wady Sufsaf, or northern arm of the Wady el-Kerek (see Delitzsch on Isaiah, l.c.), nor the Rhinokorura, the present el-Arish, which formed the southern boundary of Canaan, because this is constantly called "the brook of Egypt" (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/34-5.htm">Numbers 34:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-4.htm">Joshua 15:4</a>), but the present el-Ahsy (Ahsa), the southern border river which separated Moab from Edom (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-25.htm">2 Kings 14:25</a>). </body></html>
