How seldom do wholesome truths reach the ears of those in high stations or in authority! Those who deceive others are preparing confusion for their own faces. The prophet had ardent love to God and to the souls of men; deep concern for his glory and their salvation, and zeal against sin. The difficulties he met with did not drive him from his work. He had this strength; not from and of himself, but he was full of power by the Spirit of the Lord. Those who act honestly, may act boldly. And those who come to hear the word of God, must be willing to be told of their faults, must take it kindly, and be thankful.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/micah/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The prophets that make My people err - Flattering them in their sins and rebellions, promising that they shall go unpunished, that God is not so strict, will not put in force the judgments tie threatens. So Isaiah saith <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-12.htm">Isaiah 3:12</a>; O my? people, they which lead thee, mislead thee; and (<a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-16.htm">Isaiah 9:16</a>, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-15.htm">Isaiah 9:15</a> in Hebrew)), the leaders of this people are its misleaders, and they that are led of them are destroyed. And Jeremiah, "The prophets have seen for thee vanity and folly; and they have not discovered thine iniquity to turn away thy captivity, and have seen for thee false burdens and causes of banishment" <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-14.htm">Lamentations 2:14</a>. No error is hopeless, save what is taught in the Name of God.<p>That bite with their mouths - The word  is used of no other biting than the biting of serpents. They were doing real, secret evil "while they cry, that is, proclaim peace;" they bit, as serpents, treacherously, deadlily. They fed, not so much on the gifts, for which they hired themselves to <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-10.htm">Ezekiel 13:10</a> speak peace when there was no peace, as on the souls of the givers. So God says by Ezekiel, "Will ye pollute Me among My people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread, to slay the souls that should not die, and to save the souls live that should not live, by your lying to My people that hear your lies? Because with lies ye have made the heart of the righteous sad, whom I have not made sad; and strengthened the hands of the wicked, that he should not return from his wicked way, by promising him life - therefore ye shall see no more vanity nor divine divinations" <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/19-1.htm">Ezekiel 19:1-14</a>, 22-23. It was with a show of peace that Joab slew Abner and Amasa, and with a kiss of peace Judas betrayed our Lord.<p>And he that putteth not into their mouths, they prepare war against him - Literally, and (that is, immediately; it was all one; bribes refused, war proclaimed,) "they sanctify war against him." Like those of whom Joel prophesied , they proclaim war against him in the Name of God, by the authority of God which they had taken to themselves, speaking in His Name who had not sent them. So when our Lord fed the multitude, they would take Him by force and make Him a king; when their hopes were gone and they saw that His Kingdom was not of this world, they said, Crucify him, crucify Him. Much more the Pharisees, who, because He rebuked their covetousness, their devouring widows' houses, their extortion and excess, their making their proselytes more children of hell than themselves, said, Thou blasphemest. So, when the masters of the possessed damsel whom Paul freed <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-19.htm">Acts 16:19-21</a>, saw that the hope of their gains was gone, they accused him, that he exceedingly troubled their city, teaching customs not lawful to be received.<p>So Christians were persecuted by the pagan as  "hating the human race," because they would not partake of their sins; as  "atheists," because they worshiped not their gods; as  "disloyal" and "public enemies," because they joined not in unholy festivals; as "unprofitable," because they neglected things not profitable but harmful. So men are now called "illiberal," who will not make free with the truth of God; "intolerant," who will not allow that all faith is matter of opinion, and that there is no certain truth; "precise," "censorious," who will not connive at sin, or allow the levity which plays, mothlike, around it and jests at it. The Church and the Gospel are against the world, and so the world which they condemn must be against them; and such is the force of truth and holiness, that it must carry on the war against them in their own name. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/micah/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5.

To ‘bite with the teeth’ is a quaint, rough expression in harmony with the foregoing image from cannibalism. Choice language would have been thrown away on such seared consciences. Comp. the description of the priests, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/2-13.htm" title="And the priest's custom with the people was, that, when any man offered sacrifice, the priest's servant came, while the flesh was in seething, with a meat hook of three teeth in his hand;...">1 Samuel 2:13-16</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">they even prepare war against him</span>] Lit., <span class="bld">they consecrate war, a</span> prophetic formula (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-4.htm" title="Circumcise yourselves to the LORD, and take away the foreskins of your heart, you men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem: lest my fury come forth like fire, and burn that none can quench it, because of the evil of your doings.">Jeremiah 4:4</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-9.htm" title="Proclaim you this among the Gentiles; Prepare war, wake up the mighty men, let all the men of war draw near; let them come up:">Joel 3:9</a>, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-3.htm" title="I have commanded my sanctified ones, I have also called my mighty ones for my anger, even them that rejoice in my highness.">Isaiah 13:3</a>, ‘my consecrated ones’). The meaning is, that if at any time the rulers of the people are behindhand with the accustomed fee to these mercenary prophets, the tone of the latter at once begins to change. Instead of announcing peace, they declare that Jehovah is wroth with his people, and will send war. Strictly speaking, to ‘consecrate war’ is to open a campaign (with sacred rites), but here the antithesis with ‘that cry, Peace’ requires us to take it in a modified sense.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/micah/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5-8.</span> ? &sect; 2. <span class="accented">Sins of the false prophets who led the people astray.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Concerning the prophets</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/2-11.htm">Micah 2:11</a>). These are the lying prophets of whom Jeremiah complains (<a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-14.htm">Lamentations 2:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That bite with their teeth, and cry, Peace.</span> Very many commentators take the phrase, "bite with the teeth," to mean "eat," so that the clause signifies that the prophets when bribed with food predict peace and happiness to people. The antithesis of the following clause seems to require this explanation, which is further supported by the Chaldee. But it is quite unprecedented to find the word translated "bite" (<span class="accented">nashakh</span>) in the sense of "eat," or as it is taken here, "to have something to eat;" wherever it occurs it means "to bite like a serpent," to wound (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-17.htm">Genesis 49:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-8.htm">Numbers 21:8, 9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-19.htm">Amos 5:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/9-3.htm">Amos 9:3</a>). The parallelism of the succeeding member does not compel us to put a forced interpretation upon the word. These venal seers do vital harm, inflict gravest injury, when they proclaim peace where there is no peace; by such false comfort they are really infusing poison and death. <span class="cmt_word">He that putteth not into their mouths.</span> If any one does not bribe them, and so stop their evil mouths. <span class="cmt_word">They even prepare war against him.</span> The Hebrew expression is, "they consecrate" or  "sanctify war." There may be allusion to the religious rites accompanying a declaration of war (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-4.htm">Jeremiah 6:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-9.htm">Joel 3:9</a>); but Micah seems to mean that, if the customary bribes are withheld, these prophets announce war and calamity as inevitable; they proclaim them in God's name, as speaking with his sanction and under his Inspiration (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-16.htm">Jeremiah 23:16</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-19.htm">Ezekiel 13:19</a>; see note on Zephaniah 1:7). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/amos/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>This judgment also, they, with their perversion of all right, will be unable to avert by their foolish trust in their own power. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-12.htm">Amos 6:12</a>. "Do horses indeed run upon the rock, or do men plough (there) with oxen, that ye turn justice into poison, and the fruit of the righteousness into wormwood? <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-13.htm">Amos 6:13</a>. They who rejoice over what is worthless, who say: with our strength we make ourselves horns! <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-14.htm">Amos 6:14</a>. For, behold, I raise over you, O house of Israel, is the saying of Jehovah, the God of hosts, a nation; and they will oppress you from the territory of Hamath to the brook of the desert." To explain the threat in <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/6-11.htm">Amos 6:11</a>, Amos now calls attention in <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/6-12.htm">Amos 6:12</a>, under two different similes, to the perversity with which the haughty magnates of Israel, who turn right into bitter wrong, imagine that they can offer a successful resistance, or bid defiance with their own strength to the enemy, whom the Lord will raise up as the executor of His judgment. The perversion of right into its opposite can no more bring salvation than horses can run upon rocks, or any one plough upon such a soil with oxen. In the second question &#1489;&#1468;&#1505;&#1468;&#1500;&#1506; (on the rock) is to be repeated from the first, as the majority of commentators suppose. But the two questions are not to be taken in connection with the previous verse in the sense of "Ye will no more be able to avert this destruction than horses can run upon rocks," etc. (Chr. B. Mich.). They belong to what follows, and are meant to expose the moral perversity of the unrighteous conduct of the wicked. For &#1492;&#1508;&#1499;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-7.htm">Amos 5:7</a>; and for &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/10-4.htm">Hosea 10:4</a>. The impartial administration of justice is called the "fruit of righteousness," on account of the figurative use of the terms darnel and wormwood. These great men, however, rejoice thereby in &#1500;&#1488; &#1491;&#1489;&#1512;, "a nothing," or a thing which has no existence. What the prophet refers to may be seen from the parallel clause, viz., their imaginary strength (cho&#772;zeq). They rested this hope upon the might with which Jeroboam had smitten the Syrians, and restored the ancient boundaries of the kingdom. From this might they would take to themselves (la&#770;qach, to take, not now for the first time to create, or ask of God) the horns, to thrust down all their foes. Horns are signs and symbols of power (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-17.htm">Deuteronomy 33:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-11.htm">1 Kings 22:11</a>); here they stand for the military resources, with which they fancied that they could conquer every foe. These delusions of God-forgetting pride the prophet casts down, by saying that Jehovah the God of hosts will raise up a nation against them, which will crush them down in the whole length and breadth of the kingdom. This nation was Assyria. K&#305;&#772; hinne&#772;h (for behold) is repeated from <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-11.htm">Amos 6:11</a>; and the threat in <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-14.htm">Amos 6:14</a> is thereby described as the resumption and confirmation of the threat expressed in <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/6-11.htm">Amos 6:11</a>, although the k&#305;&#772; is connected with the perversity condemned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/6-12.htm">Amos 6:12</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/6-13.htm">Amos 6:13</a>, of trusting in their own power. La&#770;chats, to oppress, to crush down. On the expression &#1500;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488; &#1495;&#1502;&#1514;, as a standing epithet for the northern boundary of the kingdom of Israel, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/34-8.htm">Numbers 34:8</a>. As the southern boundary we have &#1504;&#1495;&#1500; &#1492;&#1506;&#1512;&#1489;&#1492; instead of &#1497;&#1501; &#1492;&#1506;&#1512;&#1489;&#1492; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-25.htm">2 Kings 14:25</a>).
