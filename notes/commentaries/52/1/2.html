And in his entrance upon this design he gives vent to what lay most upon his heart, thanking God for their conversion from idolatry to Christianity amidst so many discouraging circumstances; and praying that they might continue in the faith they had embraced, in which he takes all occasions of speaking well of the Thessalonians, as indeed he does through all the epistle, in which there is a peculiar sweetness, unmixed with any sharpness or reproof; those evils which the apostle afterward reproved, having not yet crept into the churches: <span class="ital">remembering without ceasing </span>— Or constantly in all our prayers; <span class="ital">your work of faith </span>— Your active, ever-working faith; <span class="ital">and labour of love </span>— Your love to God and man, which induces you to labour continually to promote the glory of God, and do good to the bodies or souls of men; <span class="ital">and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ </span>— Your patience under all your persecutions and other sufferings, the fruit of that blessed hope of eternal life, which is grounded on the death and resurrection of Christ, and is wrought in you by his saving grace; <span class="ital">in the sight of God, even our Father — </span>Whose eye is continually upon you, who observes, and will not fail to reward, the graces wrought in you by his blessed Spirit.

And the best good may be expected from God, as our Father, for the sake of Christ. We should pray, not only for ourselves, but for others also; remembering them without ceasing. Wherever there is a true faith, it will work; it will affect both the heart and life. Faith works by love; it shows itself in love to God, and love to our neighbour. And wherever there is a well-grounded hope of eternal life, this will appear by the exercise of patience; and it is a sign of sincerity, when in all we do, we seek to approve ourselves to God. By this we may know our election, if we not only speak of the things of God with out lips, but feel their power in our hearts, mortifying our lusts, weaning us from the world, and raising us up to heavenly things. Unless the Spirit of God comes with the word of God, it will be to us a dead letter. Thus they entertained it by the power of the Holy Ghost. They were fully convinced of the truth of it, so as not to be shaken in mind by objections and doubts; and they were willing to leave all for Christ, and to venture their souls and everlasting condition upon the truth of the gospel revelation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_thessalonians/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>We give thanks to God always for you all - see the notes, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-9.htm">Romans 1:9</a>.<p>Making mention of you in our prayers - See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-16.htm">Ephesians 1:16</a>. It may be observed here:<p>(1) that the apostle was in the habit of constant prayer.<p>(2) that he was accustomed to extemporary prayer, and not to written prayer. It is not credible that "forms" of prayer had been framed for the churches at Thessalonica and Ephesus, and the other churches for which Paul says he prayed, nor would it have been possible to have adapted such forms to the varying circumstances attending the organization of new churches. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_thessalonians/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. (Ro 1:9; 2Ti 1:3.)

Ro 1:9 supports Alford in translating, "making mention of you in our prayers without ceasing" (1Th 1:3).

In lxx only in Apocr. See Judith 8:25; 2 Macc. 1:11; 10:7; 3 Macc. 7:16. In the N.T. Epistles, Po. Originally to do a good turn; hence, to return a favor. The meaning to give thanks is late. The kindred noun &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; giving of thanks, is found often in Paul. As a designation of the Lord's Supper (Eucharist) it is not found in the N.T. Perhaps the earliest instance of its use in that sense is in Ignatius. See Philad. iv.; Smyrn. iv., viii.; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/8.htm">Ephesians 8</a>. Comp. Just. Mart. Apol. i., 64, 65.<p>In we give thanks, it is not easy to decide whether Paul uses we as plural, or in the sense of I. Rom 3:9 seems to be a clear case of the latter usage. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-1.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:1</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:2</a>, &#x3b7;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; we thought it good, and &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; we sent, can, apparently, refer only to Paul; and similarly, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:6</a>, &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c2; unto us, can hardly include Silvanus who came with Timothy (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-5.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:5</a>). But it is significant that, in the Epistles which are written in Paul's name alone (Romans, Galatians, Ephesians), only I is used, unless we except <a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/1-8.htm">Galatians 1:8</a>, which is doubtful. Paul and Timothy appear jointly as correspondents in Philippians, but the first person predominates throughout the letter. The same is true of 1st Corinthians, where Paul and Sosthenes are associated in the address, but the singular pronoun is used almost throughout. (See <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-10.htm">1 Corinthians 4:10-13</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-4.htm">1 Corinthians 9:4</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-5.htm">1 Corinthians 9:5</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-25.htm">1 Corinthians 9:25</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-26.htm">1 Corinthians 9:26</a>). In Colossians Paul and Timothy appear in the address. The plural prevails to <a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/1-23.htm">Colossians 1:23</a>, and alternates with the singular throughout the remainder. The alternations in 2nd Corinthians are very bewildering.<p>On the whole, I think that occasional instances of the epistolary plural must be granted. It is not, however, Paul's habitual usage. We is often employed as in ordinary correspondence or argument, where the writer or speaker associates himself with his readers or hearers. Abundant illustrations of this may be seen in <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/6.htm">Romans 6</a> and 8; but in other cases, when Paul speaks in the plural, he usually associates his fellow-ministers, mentally, with himself.<p>Making mention (&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;)<p>For the phrase see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-9.htm">Romans 1:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-16.htm">Ephesians 1:16</a>; Plm 1:4.

In classical Greek the word does not occur in the sense of prayer. It is found in later Greek, meaning a place for prayer, in which sense it appears in <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-13.htm">Acts 16:13</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-16.htm">Acts 16:16</a>. It signified either a synagogue, or an open praying-place outside of a city. </body></html>
