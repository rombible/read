So that both the <span class="ital">full assurance of faith, </span>and <span class="ital">the full assurance of hope, </span>accompanied with <span class="ital">perfect love casting out fear, </span>(all which graces are expressly mentioned by the apostles in their epistles, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-11.htm" title="And we desire that every one of you do show the same diligence to the full assurance of hope to the end:">Hebrews 6:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-22.htm" title="Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water.">Hebrews 10:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-17.htm" title="Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world.">1 John 4:17</a> :) are implied in the <span class="ital">much assurance </span>here spoken of.

And the best good may be expected from God, as our Father, for the sake of Christ. We should pray, not only for ourselves, but for others also; remembering them without ceasing. Wherever there is a true faith, it will work; it will affect both the heart and life. Faith works by love; it shows itself in love to God, and love to our neighbour. And wherever there is a well-grounded hope of eternal life, this will appear by the exercise of patience; and it is a sign of sincerity, when in all we do, we seek to approve ourselves to God. By this we may know our election, if we not only speak of the things of God with out lips, but feel their power in our hearts, mortifying our lusts, weaning us from the world, and raising us up to heavenly things. Unless the Spirit of God comes with the word of God, it will be to us a dead letter. Thus they entertained it by the power of the Holy Ghost. They were fully convinced of the truth of it, so as not to be shaken in mind by objections and doubts; and they were willing to leave all for Christ, and to venture their souls and everlasting condition upon the truth of the gospel revelation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_thessalonians/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For our gospel came not unto you - When first preached; <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/17-1.htm">Acts 17:1-3</a>. Paul speaks of it as "our gospel," because it was the gospel preached by him and Silas and Timothy; comp <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-14.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-8.htm">2 Timothy 2:8</a>. He did not mean to say that the gospel had been originated by him, but only that he had delivered the good news of salvation to them. He is here stating the evidence which had been given that they were a church "chosen by God." He refers, first, to the manner in which the gospel was received by them <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-5.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:5-7</a>, and, secondly, to the spirit which they themselves manifested in sending it abroad; yet.1 Thessalonians 1:8.<p>In word only - Was not merely spoken; or was not merely heard. It produced a powerful effect on the heart and life. It was not a mere empty sound that produced no other effect than to entertain or amuse; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-32.htm">Ezekiel 33:32</a>.<p>But also in power - That is, in such power as to convert the soul. The apostle evidently refers not to any miracles that were performed there, but to the effect of the gospel on those who heard it. It is possible that there were miracles performed there, as there were in other places, but there is no mention of such a fact, and it is not necessary to suppose it, in order to see the full meaning of this language. There was great power manifested in the gospel in its leading them to break off from their sins, to abandon their idols, and to give their hearts to God; see this more fully explained in the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-4.htm">1 Corinthians 2:4</a>.<p>And in the Holy Ghost - Compare the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-4.htm">1 Corinthians 2:4</a>. It is there called the "demonstration of the Spirit."<p>And in much assurance - That is, with firm conviction, or full persuasion of its truth. It was not embraced as a doubtful thing, and it did not produce the effect on the mind which is caused by anything that is uncertain in its character. Many seem to embrace the gospel as if they only half believed it, or as if it were a matter of very doubtful truth and importance; but this was not the case with the Thessalonians. There was the firmest conviction of its truth, and they embraced it "heart and soul;" compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-2.htm">Colossians 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-11.htm">Hebrews 6:11</a>. From all that is said in this verse, it is evident that the power of God was remarkably manifested in the conversion of the Thessalonians, and that they embraced the gospel with an uncommonly strong conviction of its truth and value. This fact will account for the subsequent zeal which the apostle so much commends in them - for it is usually true that the character of piety in a church, as it is in an individual, is determined by the views with which the gospel is first embraced, and the purposes which are formed at the beginning of the Christian life.<p>As ye know what manner of men, ... - Paul often appeals to those among whom he had labored as competent witnesses with respect to his own conduct and character; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-9.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:9-10</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/20-33.htm">Acts 20:33-35</a>. He means here that he and his fellow-laborers had set them an example, or had shown what Christianity was by their manner of living, and that the Thessalonians had become convinced that the religion which they taught was real. The holy life of a preacher goes far to confirm the truth of the religion which he preaches, and is among the most efficacious means of inducing them to embrace the gospel. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_thessalonians/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. our gospel&#8212;namely, the Gospel which we preached.<p>came&#8212;Greek, "was made," namely, by God, its Author and Sender. God's having made our preaching among you to be attended with such "power," is the proof that you are "elect of God" (1Th 1:4).<p>in power&#8212;in the efficacy of the Holy Spirit clothing us with power (see end of verse; Ac 1:8; 4:33; 6:5, 8) in preaching the Gospel, and making it in you the power of God unto salvation (Ro 1:16). As "power" produces faith; so "the Holy Ghost," love; and "much assurance" (Col 2:2, full persuasion), hope (Heb 6:11), resting on faith (Heb 10:22). So faith, love, and hope (1Th 1:3).<p>as ye know&#8212;answering to the "knowing," that is, as WE know (1Th 1:4) your character as the elect of God, so YE know ours as preachers.<p>for your sake&#8212;The purpose herein indicated is not so much that of the apostles, as that of God. "You know what God enabled us to be &#8230; how mighty in preaching the word &#8230; for your sakes &#8230; thereby proving that He had chosen (1Th 1:4) you for His own" [Alford]. I think, from 1Th 2:10-12, that, in "what manner of men we were among you," besides the power in preaching, there is included also Paul's and his fellow missionaries' whole conduct which confirmed their preaching; and in this sense, the "for your sake" will mean "in order to win you." This, though not the sole, yet would be a strong, motive to holy circumspection, namely, so as to win those without (Col 4:5; compare 1Co 9:19-23).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_thessalonians/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The former part of the verse asserts the reasons on which the apostle built the knowledge of their election, which is the manner of the gospel’s coming to them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Our gospel</span> because preached by him and others to them; or intrusted with them egenhyh eiv umav. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Came not unto you in word only, but also in power; </span> confirmed by miracles, and had powerful operation upon your hearts.

The former sense is best. And there is an allusion in the word to a ship riding upon the sea with a full gale, and not turned out of its course by a contrary wind. Your faith triumphed over the waves of all objections, disputes, or hesitations of mind. For doubtings of mind do much hinder the power of the word upon the heart. And this assurance they had from the Holy Ghost. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">As ye know what manner of men we were among you for your sake; </span> we did not carry ourselves among you like ordinary men, but by our laboriousness and zeal in preaching, our patient suffering for the gospel we preached, by our holy conversation, by our denial of ourselves in labouring with our hands amongst you, and by our great tenderness and affection to you, you might perceive that we were men sent of God, and our ministry was from heaven, and that we sought not yours, but you; whereby you had an advantage to entertain the gospel preached by us with greater assurance. And in all these things we had respect to your salvation. And for the truth of all this, he appeals to their own knowledge, and that mighty presence and assistance of God in their ministry among them; as they could not but perceive it, so it was all for their sake. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">And ye became followers of us; </span> as you received our gospel in the power of it into your hearts, so you showed it forth in your conversation, becoming followers or imitators of us in our patient and cheerful sufferings, and our holy and self-denying carriage.

The glad tidings of the gospel did more comfort them, than all their sufferings did cast them down. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_thessalonians/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For our Gospel came not unto you,.... The apostle calls the Gospel "our Gospel", not because he and his fellow ministers were the authors of it; for in this respect it is solely of God, being the produce of his wisdom and grace, and by the revelation of Jesus Christ, hence he calls it the Gospel of God in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:2</a> nor because they were the subject of it, for they preached not themselves, but a crucified Christ, and him only, though it was a stumblingblock to some, and foolishness to others; but because it was committed to their trust, and they were the preachers of it, and agreed in the ministration of it; and it is opposed to, and is distinct from, that which was preached by the false teachers; and here intends not barely the Gospel itself, but chiefly their preaching of it: and this came unto them being sent of God, for wherever the Gospel comes, it comes with a mission and commission from God; and being brought unto them by the apostles, who were bringers and publishers of the good tidings of good things, it came unthought of, unsought and unasked for by them; and that not only externally, which to have is a great blessing, but internally, , "into you"; it came not barely into their ears vocally, and into their heads notionally; but into their hearts, and worked effectually there; it was mixed with faith, and was profitable; it became the ingrafted word, and dwelt richly in them: for it came to them not <p>in word only; it did come in word, it could not come without words, there is no interpreting of Scripture, no preaching of the Gospel, nor hearing of it without words, without articulate sounds; but not only with these, nor with wisdom of words, with enticing words of man's wisdom, with words which man's wisdom teacheth; as also not in the mere notion and letter of the Gospel, which when it comes in that manner is a dead letter, and the savour of death unto death: <p>but in power; not merely preached in a powerful way, or attended with miraculous operations, though doubtless both were true; for the apostle was a powerful preacher, and his ministry was confirmed by signs and wonders and mighty deeds; but from neither of these could he conclude the election of these people: but the preaching of the Gospel was accompanied with the powerful efficacy of the grace of God, working by it upon them; so that it became the power of God unto salvation to them; it came to them in the demonstration of the Spirit of God, and of power, quickening them who were dead in trespasses, and sin, enlightening their dark understandings, unstopping their deaf ears, softening their hard hearts, and delivering them from the slavery of sin and Satan; from whence it clearly appeared that they were the chosen of God, and precious: <p>and in the Holy Ghost; the Gospel was not only preached under the influence, and by the assistance of the Holy Spirit, and attended with his extraordinary gifts for the confirmation of it, which it might be, and be no proof of the election of these persons to eternal life; but it came by the power of the Holy Spirit to their souls, working and implanting his graces in them, as faith, hope, and love, and every other; and he himself was received along with it, as a spirit of illumination and conviction, of regeneration, conversion, and sanctification, and of faith and adoption; all which gave full evidence of their election: <p>and in much assurance; not on the preacher's side, as if the Gospel was preached by him with great assurance, boldness, and confidence; or with great strength of evidence, giving clear and full proof of what was delivered sufficient to ascertain it, and persuade anyone to the belief of it; or with "much fulness", as some render the words, that is, of the Gospel of Christ, and of the gifts of the Spirit, and to a multitude of persons; all which might be, and yet be no proof of the choice of these persons in Christ to eternal salvation; but the Gospel preached to them was blessed to produce in them much assurance, or a large assurance, if not a full one, of the grace of faith in Christ, and of hope of eternal life by him, and of understanding of the doctrines of the Gospel, and of interest in the blessings of grace held forth in them; and this being a fruit, was an evidence of electing grace: <p>as ye know what manner of men we were among you for your sake. The apostle appeals to themselves for the truth of what he had said; who must have observed, and could not but remember, with what meanness they appeared, with what fear and trembling, with what plainness and simplicity, without the enticing words of man's wisdom; what a contemptible figure they made, how they wrought with their own hands, and endured reproach and persecution for their sakes, that they might obtain salvation by Christ with eternal glory; and had nothing to recommend them to them, to win upon them, and engage their attention, and strike their affection; or persuade them to receive their persons, and believe their doctrines; wherefore the effects their ministry had upon them were not owing to the charms of words, the force of language, and power of oratory; or to any external thing in them, or done by them; but must be ascribed to the Spirit of God, and to the power and efficacy of his grace. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_thessalonians/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{3}</span> For our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> much assurance; as ye know what manner of men we were among you for your sake.</span><p>(3) Another reason why they ought in no way start back but continue to the end, because they cannot doubt this doctrine which has been so many ways confirmed to them, even from heaven, as they themselves well knew.<p>(b) Paul shows by two things that there followed very great fruit from his preaching, that is, by these gifts of the Holy Spirit, and that certain assurance which was thoroughly settled in their minds, as appeared by their willingly bearing the cross.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/1_thessalonians/1.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-5.htm" title="For our gospel came not to you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance; as you know what manner of men we were among you for your sake.">1 Thessalonians 1:5</a>.

But the apostle says <span class="greekheb">οὐ μόνον</span>, because human speech was the necessary <span class="ital">instrument of communication</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἀλλὰ καὶ ἐν δυνάμει κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.] By <span class="greekheb">δύναμις</span> is not to be understood <span class="ital">miracles</span> by which the power of the preached gospel was attested (Theodoret, Oecumenius, Theophylact, Erasmus, Cornelius a Lapide, Grotius, Natalis Alexander, Turretine, etc.); for if so, the plural would have been necessary. Nor is the gospel denoted as a miraculous <span class="ital">power</span> (Benson), which meaning in itself is possible. Nor is the efficacy of the preached word among the Thessalonians indicated (Bullinger: Per virtutem intellexit efficaciam et vim agentem in cordibus fidelium). But it forms simply the contrast to <span class="greekheb">λόγος</span>, and denotes the <span class="ital">impressive power</span> accompanying the entrance of Paul and his followers.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐν πνεύματι ἁγίῳ</span>] Theodoret, Musculus, Cornelius a Lapide, Fromond, B. a Piconius, Natalis Alexander, Benson, Macknight interpret this of the communication of the Holy Spirit to the readers. But the communication of the Holy Spirit is beyond the power of the apostles, as being only possible on the part of God. Besides, <span class="greekheb">ἐν πνεύματι</span> can only contain a statement of the manner in which Paul and his assistants preached the gospel. Accordingly, the meaning is: our preaching of the gospel was carried on among you in the Holy Ghost, that is, in a manner which could only be ascribed to the operation of the Holy Ghost. <span class="greekheb">ἐν πνεύματι ἁγίῳ</span> serves, therefore, not only for the further amplification, but also for the intensification of the idea <span class="greekheb">ἐν δυνάμει</span>. It is therefore incompetent to consider <span class="greekheb">ἐν δυνάμει καὶ ἐν πνεύμ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἁγίῳ</span> as a <span class="greekheb">ἓν διὰ δυοῖν</span> instead of <span class="greekheb">ἐν δυνάμει πνεύμ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἁγίου</span> (Calvin, Piscator, Turretine, Bloomfield, and others).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">πληροφορία</span>] (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-2.htm" title=" That their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and to all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the acknowledgment of the mystery of God, and of the Father, and of Christ;">Colossians 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-21.htm" title="And being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to perform.">Romans 4:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-5.htm" title="One man esteems one day above another: another esteems every day alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind.">Romans 14:5</a>) denotes neither the fulness of spiritual gifts which were imparted to the Thessalonians (Lombard, Cornelius a Lapide, Turretine), nor the completeness of the apostolic instruction (Thomasius), nor the completeness with which Paul performed his duty (Estius), nor the proofs combined with his instructions, giving complete certainty (Fromond, Michaelis), nor generally “certitudo, qua Thessalonicenses certi de veritate evangelii ac salute sua redditi fuerant” (Musculus, Benson, Macknight); but the fulness and certainty of conviction, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> the inward confidence of faith with which Paul and his assistants appeared preaching at Thessalonica.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καθὼς οἴδατε κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.] a strengthening of <span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span> … <span class="greekheb">πολλῇ</span> by an appeal to the knowledge of his readers (Oecum.: <span class="greekheb">καὶ τί</span>, <span class="greekheb">φησι</span>, <span class="greekheb">μακρηγορῶ</span>; <span class="greekheb">αὐτοὶ ὑμεῖς μάρτυρές ἐστε</span>, <span class="greekheb">οἷοι ἐγενήθημεν πρὸς ὑμᾶς</span>). Pelt, entirely perverting the meaning, thinks that the apostle in these concluding words would hold forth his example for the emulation of his readers. This view could only claim indulgence if Koppe’s connection, which, however, Pelt rejects, were correct. Koppe begins a new sentence with <span class="greekheb">καθώς</span>, considering <span class="greekheb">καθὼς οἴδατε</span> as the protasis and <span class="greekheb">καὶ ὑμεῖς</span> as the apodosis, and gives the sense: qualem me vidistis, quum apud vos essem … tales etiam vos nunc estis. But this connection is impossible—(1) Because <span class="greekheb">οἴδατε</span> cannot mean <span class="ital">me vidistis</span>, but has a purely present signification—ye know. (2) Because if there were such an emphatic contrast of persons (qualem <span class="ital">me</span> … tales etiam <span class="ital">vos</span>), then, instead of the simple <span class="greekheb">ἐγενήθημεν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἡμεῖς ἐγενήθημεν</span> would necessarily be put. (3) Because <span class="greekheb">ἐγενήθητε</span> does not mean <span class="ital">nunc estis</span>, but <span class="ital">facti estis.</span> (4) Instead of the <span class="ital">asyndeton</span> <span class="greekheb">καθὼς οἴδατε</span>, we would expect a connection with the preceding by some particle added to <span class="greekheb">καθώς</span>. (5) And lastly, the apodosis would not be introduced by <span class="greekheb">καὶ ὑμεῖς</span>, but by <span class="greekheb">οὕτως ὑμεῖς</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-5.htm" title="For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also abounds by Christ.">2 Corinthians 1:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-6.htm" title="So that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also finish in you the same grace also.">2 Corinthians 8:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-7.htm" title="Do you look on things after the outward appearance? If any man trust to himself that he is Christ's, let him of himself think this again, that, as he is Christ's, even so are we Christ's.">2 Corinthians 10:7</a>). Pelt’s assertion is also erroneous, that instead of <span class="greekheb">καθὼς οἴδατε οἷοι ἐγενήθημεν</span>, the more correct Greek phrase would have been <span class="greekheb">οἵους οἴδατε ἡμᾶς γεγονότας</span>. For the greatest emphasis is put on <span class="greekheb">οἷοι ἐγενήθημεν</span>, but this emphasis would have been lost by the substitution of the above construction.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">οἷοι ἐγενήθημεν</span>] recapitulates the preceding <span class="greekheb">τὸ εὐαγγ</span>.… <span class="greekheb">πολλῇ</span>, but with this difference, that what was before said of the <span class="ital">act</span> of preaching is here predicated of the preachers. <span class="greekheb">οἷοι ἐγενήθημεν</span> does not denote the privations which Paul imposed upon himself when he preached the gospel, as Pelagius, Estius, Macknight, Pelt, and others think, making an arbitrary comparison of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-7.htm" title="But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherishes her children:">1 Thessalonians 2:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-9.htm" title="For you remember, brothers, our labor and travail: for laboring night and day, because we would not be chargeable to any of you, we preached to you the gospel of God.">1 Thessalonians 2:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_thessalonians/3-8.htm" title="Neither did we eat any man's bread for nothing; but worked with labor and travail night and day, that we might not be chargeable to any of you:...">2 Thessalonians 3:8-9</a>; also not <span class="greekheb">κινδύνους</span>, <span class="greekheb">οὓς ὑπὲρ αὐτῶν ὑπέστησαν</span>, <span class="greekheb">τὸ σωτήριον αὐτοῖς προσφέροντες κήρυγμα</span> (Theodoret), nor both together (Natal. Alexander). It also does not mean <span class="ital">quales fuerimus</span> (so de Wette, Hofmann, and others), but can only denote the <span class="ital">being made</span> for some purpose. It thus contains the indication that the emphatic element in the preaching of the gospel at Thessalonica was a work of divine appointment—of divine <span class="ital">grace</span>. Accordingly, <span class="greekheb">διʼ ὑμᾶς</span>, <span class="ital">for your sake</span>, that is, in order to gain you for the kingdom of Christ, is to be understood not of the purpose of the apostle and his assistants, but of the purpose of God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/1_thessalonians/1.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-5.htm" title="For our gospel came not to you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance; as you know what manner of men we were among you for your sake.">1 Thessalonians 1:5</a>. <span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span> = “inasmuch as”.—<span class="greekheb">τὸ εὐαγγ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἡμῶν</span>, the gospel of which the apostles, and by which their hearers, were convinced. As the <span class="greekheb">καθὼς</span> clause indicates, <span class="greekheb">πληροφ</span>. must here denote personal conviction and unfaltering confidence on the part of the preachers. The omission of the <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span> before <span class="greekheb">πληρ</span>. throws that word and <span class="greekheb">πνεύματι</span> together into a single conception, complementary to <span class="greekheb">δυνάμει</span>, which here has no specific reference to miracles, but to the apostles’ courage (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-2.htm" title="But even after that we had suffered before, and were shamefully entreated, as you know, at Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak to you the gospel of God with much contention.">1 Thessalonians 2:2</a>), honesty and sincerity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_thessalonians/1-4.htm" title="Knowing, brothers beloved, your election of God....">1 Thessalonians 1:4-5</a>), devotion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_thessalonians/1-7.htm" title="So that you were ensamples to all that believe in Macedonia and Achaia....">1 Thessalonians 1:7-8</a>), earnestness (9), and consistency (10). The effect of the Spirit on the preachers is followed up (in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-6.htm" title="And you became followers of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Ghost.">1 Thessalonians 1:6</a>) by its effect on the hearers; and this dual aspect recurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-9.htm" title="For they themselves show of us what manner of entering in we had to you, and how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God;">1 Thessalonians 1:9</a> (we and you). <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span> (om.

Paul and Silas were conscious in declaring their message of a power beyond all words attending it, which made them sure at the time that it would not be in vain. It was evident to them that God “had much people in this city.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">our gospel</span> is God’s good news about Jesus Christ, proclaimed by His servants.

Hence it is both God’s gospel (ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-2.htm" title="But even after that we had suffered before, and were shamefully entreated, as you know, at Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak to you the gospel of God with much contention.">1 Thessalonians 2:2</a>, &c.), and “our” gospel.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and in the Holy Ghost</span>] The peculiar “power” in which St Paul and his helpers spoke at Thessalonica was not their own: their message <span class="bld">came in the Holy Spirit</span>, accompanied by the supernatural energy of the Spirit of God and of Christ. To this, as the N. T. teaches, the efficacy of the Gospel is always due. “He,” said Jesus, “the Spirit of truth, shall testify of Me; and ye also do testify” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/15-26.htm" title="But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send to you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceeds from the Father, he shall testify of me:...">John 15:26-27</a>). <span class="ital">Power</span> is an idea constantly associated with <span class="ital">the Holy Spirit</span>, according to the words of Christ in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-8.htm" title="But you shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come on you: and you shall be witnesses to me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and to the uttermost part of the earth.">Acts 1:8</a>, “Ye shall receive power, when the Holy Spirit has come upon you;” so in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-4.htm" title="And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power:">1 Corinthians 2:4</a>, “My message was not in persuasive words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power,” &c.,—<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“that mighty Breath<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>From heaven’s eternal shores.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">in the Holy Spirit, and, much fulness</span> (R.

The preposition “in” is not repeated in the Greek, so that the third adjunct is closely identified with the second (Holy Spirit).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The same Greek word is used in the phrase “<span class="ital">full-assurance</span> of the understanding” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-2.htm" title=" That their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and to all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the acknowledgment of the mystery of God, and of the Father, and of Christ;">Colossians 2:2</a>; “of hope,” “of faith” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-11.htm" title="And we desire that every one of you do show the same diligence to the full assurance of hope to the end:">Hebrews 6:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-22.htm" title="Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water.">Hebrews 10:22</a>). But the “fulness” of this passage is ascribed to the “gospel” as it “came to” its Thessalonian hearers. It had its <span class="ital">full effect</span> upon them. Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-17.htm" title="Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me; that by me the preaching might be fully known, and that all the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.">2 Timothy 4:17</a>, where the corresponding verb is used,—“that through me the message might be fulfilled” (R.
