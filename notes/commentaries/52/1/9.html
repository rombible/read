The believers under the Old Testament waited for the coming of the Messiah, and believers now wait for his second coming. He is yet to come. And God had raised him from the dead, which is a full assurance unto all men that he will come to judgment. He came to purchase salvation, and will, when he comes again, bring salvation with him, full and final deliverance from that wrath which is yet to come.

The apostle seems to refer to all whom he had met or had heard of "in all places," who said anything about the Thessalonians They were unanimous in bearing testimony to their fidelity and piety.<p>Show of us what manner of entering in we had unto you - The testimony which they bear of you is, in fact, testimony of the manner in which we preached the gospel, and demeaned ourselves when we were with you. It shows that we were intent on our Master's work, and that we were not actuated by selfish or sinister motives The argument is, that such effects could not have been produced among them if Paul, Silas, and their fellow laborers had been impostors. Their sound conversion to God; their change from idolatry to the true religion, and the zeal which had been the result of their conversion, was an argument to which Paul and his fellow-laborers might appeal in proof of their sincerity and their being sent from God. Paul often makes a similar appeal; compare notes on <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-2.htm">2 Corinthians 3:2-3</a>. It is certain that many of the Jews in Thessalonica, when Paul and his fellow-laborers were there, regarded them as impostors <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/17-6.htm">Acts 17:6</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/17-8.htm">Acts 17:8</a>, and there is every reason to suppose that after they left the city, they would endeavor to keep up this impression among the people. To meet this, Paul now says that their own undoubted conversion to a life of holiness and zeal under their ministry, was an unanswerable argument that this was not so. How could impostors and deceivers have been the means of producing such effects?<p>And how ye turned to God from idols - That is, under our preaching. This proves that the church was to a considerable extent composed of those who were converted from idolatry under the preaching of Paul; compare Intro. 4. The meaning here is, that they who came from them, or they who had visited them, bore abundant testimony to the fact that they had turned from idols to the worship of the true God; compare notes <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-2.htm">1 Corinthians 12:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-8.htm">Galatians 1:8</a>.<p>To serve the living and true God - He is called the "living God" in opposition to idols - who are represented as dead, dumb, deaf, and blind; compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/135-15.htm">Psalm 135:15-17</a>; notes, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-10.htm">Isaiah 44:10-17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-16.htm">Matthew 16:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-26.htm">John 5:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-15.htm">Acts 14:15</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_thessalonians/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. Strictly there should follow, "For they themselves show of you," &c.; but, instead, he substitutes that which was the instrumental cause of the Thessalonians' conversion and faith, "for they themselves show of us what manner of entering in we had unto you"; compare 1Th 1:5, which corresponds to this former clause, as 1Th 1:6 corresponds to the latter clause. "And how ye turned from idols to serve the living &#8230; God," &c. Instead of our having "to speak any thing" to them (in Macedonia and Achaia) in your praise (1Th 1:8), "they themselves (have the start of us in speaking of you, and) announce concerning (so the Greek of 'show of' means) us, what manner of (how effectual an) entrance we had unto you" (1Th 1:5; 2:1).<p>the living and true God&#8212;as opposed to the dead and false gods from which they had "turned." In the English Version reading, Ac 17:4, "of the devout Greeks a great multitude," no mention is made, as here, of the conversion of idolatrous Gentiles at Thessalonica; but the reading of some of the oldest manuscripts and Vulgate singularly coincides with the statement here: "Of the devout AND of Greeks (namely, idolaters) a great multitude"; so in Ac 17:17, "the devout persons," that is, Gentile proselytes to Judaism, form a separate class. Paley and Lachmann, by distinct lines of argument, support the "AND."<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_thessalonians/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">For they themselves show of us, what manner of entering in we had unto you:</span> the believers of Macedonia and Achaia do speak of these things apaggellousin, openly, whereby it is evident the word of the Lord sounded forth to them from you, and they, without any information from us, declare the great entertainment you gave us and our gospel at our first entrance among you. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And how ye turned to God from idols; </span> particularly your forsaking your former idolatry, when you worshipped idols, that were either the images or shapes of the true God, formed by men; or men whom they deified, and set up as gods, and worshipped them and their images; or inanimate creatures, as sun, moon, and stars, or whatever creature they found beneficial to them, the heathens made idols of them.

Comp. Lord Bacon’s <span class="ital">idola tribus, specus, fori, theatri</span>, in the <span class="ital">Novum Organum</span>. This word is the equivalent in the Septuagint Version of Hebrew designations for heathen gods and their images of like significance—<span class="ital">vapours, vanities, nothings</span>. To all these the Name of the God of Israel—Who “is the true God, and the living God” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-10.htm" title="But the LORD is the true God, he is the living God, and an everlasting king: at his wrath the earth shall tremble, and the nations shall not be able to abide his indignation.">Jeremiah 10:10</a>)—is the constant, tacit antithesis: “I am Jehovah” (more strictly <span class="ital">Jahveh</span>, or <span class="ital">Yahweh</span>, commonly “the Lord” in the English O. T.)—the HE IS (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/3-13.htm" title="And Moses said to God, Behold, when I come to the children of Israel, and shall say to them, The God of your fathers has sent me to you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? what shall I say to them?...">Exodus 3:13-14</a> for its interpretation; and for its use in argument against idolatry, such passages as <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-8.htm" title="I am the LORD: that is my name: and my glory will I not give to another, neither my praise to graven images.">Isaiah 42:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/45-5.htm" title="I am the LORD, and there is none else, there is no God beside me: I girded you, though you have not known me:...">Isaiah 45:5-6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-18.htm" title="For thus said the LORD that created the heavens; God himself that formed the earth and made it; he has established it, he created it not in vain, he formed it to be inhabited: I am the LORD; and there is none else.">Isaiah 45:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/45-21.htm" title="Tell you, and bring them near; yes, let them take counsel together: who has declared this from ancient time? who has told it from that time? have not I the LORD? and there is no God else beside me; a just God and a Savior; there is none beside me....">Isaiah 45:21-22</a>). Like the Prophets and Psalmists (e.g. in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/115-4.htm" title="Their idols are silver and gold, the work of men's hands....">Psalm 115:4-8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/44-9.htm" title="They that make a graven image are all of them vanity; and their delectable things shall not profit; and they are their own witnesses; they see not, nor know; that they may be ashamed....">Isaiah 44:9-20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/10-1.htm" title="Hear you the word which the LORD speaks to you, O house of Israel:...">Jeremiah 10:1-10</a>), St Paul was powerfully impressed with the illusion and unreality of heathen religions. He defines idolatry in two passages, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-4.htm" title="As concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is none other God but one.">1 Corinthians 8:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/10-19.htm" title="What say I then? that the idol is any thing, or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is any thing?...">1 Corinthians 10:19-20</a>, as being <span class="ital">half lies, half devilry</span>; and in the horrible immorality then existing in the Gentile world he saw its natural consequence and judicial punishment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/1-18.htm" title="For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;...">Romans 1:18-25</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“True” signifies <span class="ital">truth of fact</span>, not word: “true God” is the “very God” of the Nicene Creed, <span class="ital">the real God</span>: comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-3.htm" title="And this is life eternal, that they might know you the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.">John 17:3</a>,—“that they should know Thee, the only true God;” and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-20.htm" title="And we know that the Son of God is come, and has given us an understanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life.">1 John 5:20</a>, “This is the true God, and life eternal.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The service to this “living and true God” which the Thessalonians had embraced, was that of <span class="ital">bondmen</span>, acknowledging themselves His property and at His absolute disposal. St Paul habitually calls himself “Christ’s” (once “God’s,” <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-1.htm" title="Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness;">Titus 1:1</a>) “bondman.” In <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-8.htm" title="However, then, when you knew not God, you did service to them which by nature are no gods.">Galatians 4:8</a> he speaks of heathenism as <span class="ital">bondage to false gods</span>; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/6-15.htm" title="What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid....">Romans 6:15-23</a> he shows that to become a Christian is to exchange the <span class="ital">bondage of sin</span> for <span class="ital">bondage to righteousness</span> and <span class="ital">to God, bondage under grace</span>. The full conception of the Christian relationship to God is formed by the combination of the idea of <span class="ital">sonship</span> (in respect of affection and privilege) with that of <span class="ital">bond-service</span> (in respect of duty and submission), to Him “Whose service is perfect freedom.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>On the relation of this passage to St Paul’s general teaching see <span class="ital">Introd.</span> pp. 17, 18. So far, in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_thessalonians/1-8.htm" title="For from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith to God-ward is spread abroad; so that we need not to speak any thing....">1 Thessalonians 1:8-9</a></span>, St Paul has related the conversion of the Thessalonians in the language and spirit of the O. T., and as an acceptance of Hebrew faith. In the next verse he advances to that which was distinctively Christian in their new creed:—<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/1_thessalonians/1.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-9.htm" title="For they themselves show of us what manner of entering in we had to you, and how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God;">1 Thessalonians 1:9</a>. <span class="greekheb">Περὶ ἡμῶν</span>, <span class="ital">concerning us</span>) both teachers and believers [both us who taught, and you who believed].—<span class="greekheb">δουλεύειν Θεῳ</span>, <span class="ital">to serve God</span>) The Thessalonians are thus distinguished from the Gentiles; so also from the Jews, in the following verse.—<span class="greekheb">καὶ ἀληθινῷ</span> <span class="ital">and true</span>) This denotes the truth of [His] nature.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_thessalonians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For they themselves</span>; that is, the reporters, those in Macedonia, Achaia, and every other place. <span class="cmt_word">Show of us</span>; or, <span class="accented">report concerning us</span> (R.V.) in regard to our preaching or entrance among you.
