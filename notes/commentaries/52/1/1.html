And the best good may be expected from God, as our Father, for the sake of Christ. We should pray, not only for ourselves, but for others also; remembering them without ceasing. Wherever there is a true faith, it will work; it will affect both the heart and life. Faith works by love; it shows itself in love to God, and love to our neighbour. And wherever there is a well-grounded hope of eternal life, this will appear by the exercise of patience; and it is a sign of sincerity, when in all we do, we seek to approve ourselves to God. By this we may know our election, if we not only speak of the things of God with out lips, but feel their power in our hearts, mortifying our lusts, weaning us from the world, and raising us up to heavenly things. Unless the Spirit of God comes with the word of God, it will be to us a dead letter. Thus they entertained it by the power of the Holy Ghost. They were fully convinced of the truth of it, so as not to be shaken in mind by objections and doubts; and they were willing to leave all for Christ, and to venture their souls and everlasting condition upon the truth of the gospel revelation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_thessalonians/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus - On the reasons why Paul associated other names with his in his epistles, see the <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-1.htm">1 Corinthians 1:1</a> note, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-1.htm">2 Corinthians 2:1</a> note.

R. Faussett   <p>INTRODUCTION<p>The AUTHENTICITY of this Epistle is attested by Iren&aelig;us [Against Heresies, 5.6.1], quoting 1Th 5:23; Clement of Alexandria [The Instructor, 1.88], quoting 1Th 2:7; Tertullian [On the Resurrection of the Flesh, 24], quoting 1Th 5:1; Caius in Eusebius' Ecclesiastical History [6.20]; Origen [Against Celsus, 3].<p>The OBJECT OF THE EPISTLE.&#8212;Thessalonica was at this time capital of the Roman second district of Macedonia [Livy, Histories, 45.29]. It lay on the bay of Therme, and has always been, and still is, under its modern name Saloniki, a place of considerable commerce. After his imprisonment and scourging at Philippi, Paul (1Th 2:2) passed on to Thessalonica; and in company with Silas (Ac 17:1-9) and Timotheus (Ac 16:3; 17:14, compare with 1Th 1:1; 3:1-6; 2Th 1:1) founded the Church there. The Jews, as a body, rejected the Gospel when preached for three successive sabbaths (Ac 17:2); but some few "believed and consorted with Paul and Silas, and of the devout (that is, proselytes to Judaism) Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief women not a few." The believers received the word joyfully, notwithstanding trials and persecutions (1Th 1:6; 2:13) from their own countrymen and from the Jews (1Th 2:14-16). His stay at Thessalonica was doubtless not limited to the three weeks in which were the three sabbaths specified in Ac 17:2; for his laboring there with his hands for his support (1Th 2:9; 2Th 3:8), his receiving supplies there more than once from Philippi (Php 4:16), his making many converts from the Gentiles (1Th 1:9; and as two oldest manuscripts read, Ac 17:4, "of the devout and of the Greeks a great multitude," Ac 17:4), and his appointing ministers&#8212;all imply a longer residence. Probably as at Pisidian Antioch (Ac 13:46), at Corinth (Ac 18:6, 7), and at Ephesus (Ac 19:8, 9), having preached the Gospel to the Jews, when they rejected it, he turned to the Gentiles. He probably thenceforth held the Christian meetings in the house of Jason (Ac 17:5), perhaps "the kinsman" of Paul mentioned in Ro 16:21. His great subject of teaching to them seems to have been the coming and kingdom of Christ, as we may infer from 1Th 1:10; 2:12, 19; 3:13; 4:13-18; 5:1-11, 23, 24; and that they should walk worthy of it (1Th 2:12; 4:1). And it is an undesigned coincidence between the two Epistles and Ac 17:5, 9, that the very charge which the assailants of Jason's house brought against him and other brethren was, "These do contrary to the decrees of C&aelig;sar, saying that there is another king, one Jesus." As in the case of the Lord Jesus Himself (Joh 18:33-37; 19:12; compare Mt 26:64), they perverted the doctrine of the coming kingdom of Christ into a ground for the charge of treason against C&aelig;sar. The result was, Paul and Silas were obliged to flee under the cover of night to Berea; Timothy had probably preceded him (Ac 17:10, 14). But the Church had been planted, and ministers appointed; nay, more, they virtually became missionaries themselves for which they possessed facilities in the extensive commerce of their city, and both by word and example were extending the Gospel in Macedonia, Achaia, and elsewhere (1Th 1:7, 8). From Berea, also. Paul, after having planted a Scripture-loving Church, was obliged to flee by the Thessalonian Jews who followed him thither. Timothy (who seems to have come to Berea separately from Paul and Silas, compare Ac 17:10, with Ac 17:14) and Silas remained there still, when Paul proceeded by sea to Athens. While there he more than once longed to visit the Thessalonians again, and see personally their spiritual state, and "perfect that which was lacking in their faith" (1Th 3:10); but (probably using the Thessalonian Jews as his instruments, Joh 13:27) "Satan hindered" him (1Th 2:18; compare Ac 17:13). He therefore sent Timotheus, who seems to have followed him to Athens from Berea (Ac 17:15), immediately on his arrival to Thessalonica (1Th 3:1); glad as he would have been of Timothy's help in the midst of the cavils of Athenian opponents, he felt he must forego that help for the sake of the Thessalonian Church. Silas does not seem to have come to Paul at Athens at all, though Paul had desired him and Timothy to "come to him with all speed" (Ac 17:15); but seems with Timothy (who from Thessalonica called for him at Berea) to have joined Paul at Corinth first; compare Ac 18:1, 5, "When Silas and Timothy were come from Macedonia." The Epistle makes no mention of Silas at Athens, as it does of Timothy (1Th 3:1).<p>Timothy's account of the Thessalonian Church was highly favorable. They abounded in faith and charity and reciprocated his desire to see them (1Th 3:6-10). Still, as nothing human on earth is perfect, there were some defects. Some had too exclusively dwelt on the doctrine of Christ's coming kingdom, so as to neglect the sober-minded discharge of present duties (1Th 4:11, 12). Some who had lost relatives by death, needed comfort and instruction in their doubts as to whether they who died before Christ's coming would have a share with those found alive in His kingdom then to be revealed. Moreover, also, there had been committed among them sins against chastity and sobriety (1Th 5:5-7), as also against charity (1Th 4:3-10; 5:13, 15). There were, too, symptoms in some of want of respectful love and subordination to their ministers; others treated slightingly the manifestations of the Spirit in those possessing His gifts (1Th 5:19). To give spiritual admonition on these subjects, and at the same time commend what deserved commendation, and to testify his love to them, was the object of the Epistle.<p>The PLACE OF WRITING IT was doubtless Corinth, where Timothy and Silas rejoined him (Ac 18:5) soon after he arrived there (compare 1Th 2:17) in the autumn of A.D. 52.<p>The TIME OF WRITING was evidently immediately after having received from Timothy the tidings of their state (1Th 3:6) in the winter of A.D. 52, or early in 53. For it was written not long after the conversion of the Thessalonians (1Th 1:8, 9), while Paul could speak of himself as only taken from them for a short season (1Th 2:17). Thus this Epistle was first in date of all Paul's extant Epistles. The Epistle is written in the joint names of Paul, Silas, and Timothy, the three founders of the Thessalonian Church. The plural first person "we," is used everywhere, except in 1Th 2:18; 3:5; 5:27. "We" is the true reading, 1Th 4:13. The English Version "I," in 1Th 4:9 1Th 5:1, 23, is not supported by the original [Edmunds].<p>The STYLE is calm and equable, in accordance with the subject matter, which deals only with Christian duties in general, taking for granted the great doctrinal truths which were not as yet disputed. There was no deadly error as yet to call forth his more vehement bursts of feeling and impassioned argument. The earlier Epistles, as we should expect, are moral and practical. It was not until Judaistic and legalizing errors arose at a later period that he wrote those Epistles (for example, Romans and Galatians) which unfold the cardinal doctrines of grace and justification by faith. Still, later the Epistles from his Roman prison confirm the same truths. And last of all, the Pastoral Epistles are suited to the more developed ecclesiastical constitution of the Church, and give directions as to bishops and deacons, and correct abuses and errors of later growth.<p>The prevalence of the Gentile element in this Church is shown by the fact that these two Epistles are among the very few of Paul's writings in which no quotation occurs from the Old Testament.   <p>CHAPTER 1<p>1Th 1:1-10. Address: Salutation: His Prayerful Thanksgiving for Their Faith, Hope, and Love. Their First Reception of the Gospel, and Their Good Influence on All Around.<p>1. Paul&#8212;He does not add "an apostle," because in their case, as in that of the Philippians (see on [2438]Php 1:1), his apostolic authority needs not any substantiation. He writes familiarly as to faithful friends, not but that his apostleship was recognized among them (1Th 2:6). On the other hand, in writing to the Galatians, among whom some had called in question his apostleship, he strongly asserts it in the superscription. An undesigned propriety in the Epistles, evincing genuineness.<p>Silvanus&#8212;a "chief man among the brethren" (Ac 15:22), and a "prophet" (Ac 15:32), and one of the deputies who carried the decree of the Jerusalem council to Antioch. His age and position cause him to be placed before "Timothy," then a youth (Ac 16:1; 1Ti 4:12). Silvanus (the Gentile expanded form of "Silas") is called in 1Pe 5:12, "a faithful brother" (compare 2Co 1:19). They both aided in planting the Thessalonian Church, and are therefore included in the address. This, the first of Paul's Epistles, as being written before various evils crept into the churches, is without the censures found in other Epistles. So realizing was their Christian faith, that they were able hourly to look for the Lord Jesus.<p>unto the church&#8212;not merely as in the Epistles to Romans, Ephesians, Colossians, Philippians, "to the saints," or "the faithful at Thessalonica." Though as yet they do not seem to have had the final Church organization under permanent "bishops" and deacons, which appears in the later Epistles (See on [2439]Php 1:1; [2440]1 and [2441]2 Timothy). Yet he designates them by the honorable term "Church," implying their status as not merely isolated believers, but a corporate body with spiritual rulers (1Th 5:12; 2Co 1:1; Ga 1:2).<p>in&#8212;implying vital union.<p>God the Father&#8212;This marks that they were no longer heathen.<p>the Lord Jesus Christ&#8212;This marks that they were not Jews, but Christians.<p>Grace be unto you, and peace&#8212;that ye may have in God that favor and peace which men withhold [Anselm]. This is the salutation in all the Epistles of Paul, except the three pastoral ones, which have "grace, mercy, and peace." Some of the oldest manuscripts support, others omit the clause following, "from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ." It may have crept in from 1Co 1:3; 2Co 1:2.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_thessalonians/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div><span class="bld">1 Thessalonians Chapter 1</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">1Th 1:1</span> The salutation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">1Th 1:2-4</span> Paul showeth his thankful remembrance of the<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Thessalonians in his prayers on account of their<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>faith, charity, and patience,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">1Th 1:5-10</span> applauding them for their exemplary reception of the<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>gospel, and improvement under it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Paul and Silvanus:</span> why not Paul the apostle, as in some other Epistles? Because his apostleship was not doubted of by them, they had such an eminent seal of it upon their hearts; and there was no false apostles among them to question or deny it. And he joins <span class="ital">Silvanus</span> with him; whom Peter calls <span class="ital">a faithful brother, </span> <span class="bld">1Pe 5:12</span>, and was a minister of the gospel joining with himself in that work among the Corinthians, <span class="bld">2Co 1:19</span>, as also among these Thessalonians, as appears, <span class="bld">Act 17:4</span>, though there called by contraction of his name, or by another name, <span class="ital">Silas; </span> who is also mentioned, <span class="bld">Act 15:22</span>, as one <span class="ital">chief among the brethren, </span> and sent by the church of Jerusalem to accompany Paul and Barnabas to Antioch; and styled a prophet, <span class="bld">Act 15:32</span>; and chosen by Paul to accompany him rather than Mark, <span class="bld">Act 15:40</span>. And being an instrument with himself in converting these Thessalonians, and being also in their love and esteem, he joins his name with his own in the Epistle. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And Timotheus; </span> his name is Greek, for <span class="ital">his father was a Greek, </span> but his mother <span class="ital">a Jewess, </span><span class="bld"> Act 16:1</span>, whose name was <span class="ital">Eunice, </span> <span class="bld">2Ti 1:5</span>. He was brought up in the Jewish religion, instructed from a child by his parents in the Holy Scriptures of the Old Testament, but instructed by Paul in the faith of Christ, whom therefore he calls his <span class="ital">Song of Solomon in the faith, </span><span class="bld"> 1Ti 1:2</span>, <span class="ital">well reported of by the brethren, </span><span class="bld"> Act 16:2</span>; whom Paul laid hands upon with other elders to separate him to the work of the ministry, and the office of an evangelist, and thereby had a <span class="ital">gift of God</span> bestowed upon him, <span class="bld">2Ti 1:6</span>; called by Paul his sunergov, or <span class="ital">work-fellow, </span><span class="bld"> Rom 16:21</span>, and particularly in the conversion of these Thessalonians, together with Silvanus, as appears, <span class="bld">Act 17:14</span>. He abode with them when Paul was persecuted from them, as there we find; and was sent to them from Athens afterwards by Paul to know their state, and strengthen their faith, <span class="bld">1Th 3:1,2</span>. And thereupon, that his Epistle might obtain the greater respect, he joins his name also in it; as he doth also in his Second Epistle to the Corinthians, in his Epistle to the Philippians, and to the Colossians. He being Paul's companion in his ministry among the Gentiles in their first conversion, and a man of great name in the churches, he therefore so frequently joins his name with his own. And also that he might show their consent in the truth they delivered to the churches, which might the more confirm their faith in theirs. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Unto the church of the Thessalonians; </span> the church inhabiting Thessalonica, which was a chief city in Macedonia, a metropolis, famous for antiquity, largeness, pleasant situation, and commerce. <span class="ital">Plin.</span> lib. <span class="bld">1Th 4:10</span>. First called Thessalia, and being conquered by king Philip, was called Thessalonica. Philippi was also another great city of Macedonia, where was planted another church, to whom the apostle writes; whereby we may see that God had a great work for Paul here, when he called him in a vision to go to Macedonia. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Which is in God the Father; </span> not as the Son of God is in the Father, to be one substance and essence with him; nor as the human nature is in the Divine nature of Christ, to be one person with the Father; but it imports either their forsaking false gods and joining themselves to the worship of the true God, as in <span class="bld">1Th 1:9</span>, <span class="ital">ye turned from idols to serve the living and true God; </span> called therefore in a distinction from them: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">God the Father:</span> or else their worshipping God according to the revelation made of him in the gospel, where he is called Father. But in a sense differing from what Plato or Homer, and other heathens, understood when they called the chief God, Father; either with respect to their inferior deities, of whom they styled him Father, or the works of creation proceeding from him as his offspring. And their being in him may yet imply more than this; which is their being joined to God in covenant, as their God and Father; and so believing in him, established upon him as their foundation, and as their centre resting in him. It may also further imply their union and communion with God through the Spirit, whereby the saints are said to abide in God, and to dwell in him, and he in them, <span class="bld">1Jo 2:27,28</span>, yea, to be <span class="ital">in him</span> who is <span class="ital">the true God, </span><span class="bld"> 1Jo 5:20</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And in the Lord Jesus Christ; </span> these two are put together, because there is no access to God the Father, no true worship of him, no union or communion with him, and so no being in him, but through Jesus Christ. And by both they might see the blessed state they were now brought to by the gospel; being before strangers to God the Father and Jesus Christ, but now in them. And though being in God the Father is first mentioned, yet in the order of nature we are first in Christ, and through him in God the Father. And the apostle the rather asserts this of them, because the gospel came to them not in word only, but in power. And hereby he gives them the character of a true church of Christ, what it is, at least what it ought to be; for to be in God the Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ, imports more than literal knowledge, dogmatical faith, or outward profession. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Grace be unto you, and peace; </span> this the apostle calls his salutation with his own hand, <span class="ital">which is my token, </span> saith he, <span class="ital">in every epistle, so I write, </span><span class="bld"> 2Th 3:17</span>. Read <span class="bld">1Co 1:3 2Co 1:2</span>, &c. And under the Old Testament the Jew's usual salutation was: <span class="ital">Peace be to you; </span> under the New it is: <span class="ital">Grace and peace.</span> Peace comprehends all blessings; and grace or favour, the spring out of which they flow. The grace of God is now said to have appeared and to shine forth, <span class="bld">Tit 2:2</span>, and the church of God to be blest with all spiritual blessings, <span class="bld">Eph 1:3</span>; so that now the apostle Paul salutes the churches with <span class="ital">grace and peace; </span> and the apostle Peter adds: <span class="ital">Grace and peace be multiplied unto you, </span><span class="bld"> 2Pe 1:2</span>. <span class="ital">Mercy unto you, and peace, and love, be multiplied</span>, <span class="bld">Jud 1:2</span>. Or if we take <span class="ital">grace</span> for grace inherent in us, as sometimes it is taken; and <span class="ital">peace</span> for the inward tranquillity of mind, heart, and conscience; the text may bear it. Yet the former rather meant <span class="ital">to you, </span> to you that are in God the Father, and in Jesus Christ: not to infidels out of the church; grace to <span class="ital">you, </span> and peace. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">From God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ; </span> wherein are showed grace and peace in their original, <span class="ital">from God; </span> and not from God absolutely considered, but as <span class="ital">our Father:</span> as a Father he conveys the blessings of grace and peace to his children; but yet not immediately, but through <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Jesus Christ, </span> as merited by his blood, and procured by his intercession. The Holy Ghost is not mentioned, though he must be understood; but he is rather considered as the actual conveyer of these blessings, than the original or procurer of them. And the three Persons work in the same order in the work of redemption as of creation, though more distinctly. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_thessalonians/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus,.... These are the persons concerned in this epistle, and who send their greetings and salutations to this church; Paul was the inspired writer of it, and who is called by his bare name, without any additional epithet to it, as elsewhere in his other epistles; where he is either styled the servant, or apostle, or prisoner of Christ, but here only Paul: the reason for it is variously conjectured; either because he was well known by this church, having been lately with them; or lest these young converts should be offended and stumble at any pompous title, which they might imagine carried an appearance of arrogance and pride; or because there were as yet no false apostles among them, who had insinuated anything to the disadvantage of Paul, as in other places, which obliged him to assert his character and magnify his office; or rather because this was the first epistle he wrote, and he being conscious to himself of his own meanness, and that he was the least of the apostles, and unworthy to be called one, chose not to use the title. Silvanus is the same with Silas, who was with the apostle at Thessalonica and at Corinth, when he wrote this epistle; he was originally a member of the church at Jerusalem, and was one of the chief of the brethren there, and a prophet; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/17-4.htm">Acts 17:4</a>, Timothy was also with the apostle at the same place, and was sent back by him from Athens to know their state, and returned to Corinth to him with Silas; he stands last, as being the younger, and perhaps was the apostle's amanuensis, and therefore in modesty writes his name last: the reason of their being mentioned was because, having been with the apostle at this place, they were well known by the church, who would be glad to hear of their welfare; as also to show their continued harmony and consent in the doctrines of the Gospel; they stand in the same order in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-19.htm">2 Corinthians 1:19</a>, <p>unto the church of the Thessalonians: which consisted of several of the inhabitants of Thessalonica, both Jews and Gentiles; See Gill on <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/17-4.htm">Acts 17:4</a>, who were called under the ministry of the word by the grace of God, out of darkness into marvellous light, and were separated from the rest of the world, and incorporated into a Gospel church state. This was a particular congregated church of Christ. Some have thought it was not as yet organized, or had proper officers in it; since no mention is made of pastors and deacons, but the contrary is evident from <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-12.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:12</a>, where they are exhorted to know, own, and acknowledge them that laboured among them, and were over them in the Lord, and esteem them highly for their works' sake. This church is said to be <p>in God the Father; were interested in his love and free favour, as appears by their election of God, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-4.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:4</a>, and they were in the faith of God the Father, as the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, and in the profession of it, and so were distinguished from an assembly of Heathens that were in the faith of idols, and not of the one true and living God, and especially as the Father of Christ; they were in fellowship with God the Father, and they were drawn by the efficacy of his grace to himself and to his Son, and were gathered together and embodied in a church state under his direction and influence; he was the author of them as a church, and they were plants of Christ's heavenly Father's planting, not to be plucked up; and they were, as the Arabic version renders it, "addicted" to God the Father; they were devoted to his service; they had his word among them, which they had received not as the word of men, but as the word of God; and his ordinances were duly and faithfully administered among them, and attended on by them: <p>and in the Lord Jesus Christ; they were chosen in him before the foundation of the world; they were chosen in him as their head and representative; they were in him as members of his body, and as branches in the vine; they were openly in him by the effectual calling and conversion, were in the faith of him, and in the observance of his commands, an in communion with him; and so were distinguished from a Jewish synagogue or congregation: all this being true, at least of the far greater part of them, is said of them all, in a judgment of charity, they being under a profession of the Christian religion: <p>grace be unto you, and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ. This is the apostle's usual salutation and wish in all his epistles to the churches; See Gill on <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/1-7.htm">Romans 1:7</a>, the words "from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ" are left out in the Vulgate Latin and Syriac versions; and the Arabic version omits the last clause, "and the Lord Jesus Christ"; and the Ethiopic version only reads, "peace be unto you and his grace". <p>(a) Nat.

It is a mark of the very early composition of the Epistle, and consequently of its authenticity, that Paul does not call himself <span class="greekheb">ἀπόστολος</span>. For it was very natural that Paul, in regard to the first Christian churches to whom he wrote, whom he had recently left, and who had attached themselves with devoted love to him and his preaching, did not feel constrained to indicate himself more definitely by an official title, as the simple mention of his name must have been perfectly sufficient. It was otherwise in his later life. With reference to the Galatians and Corinthians, in consequence of the actual opposition to his apostolic authority in these churches, Paul felt himself constrained to vindicate his full official dignity at the commencement of his Epistles. And so the addition <span class="greekheb">ἀπόστολος</span>, occasioned at first by imperative circumstances, became at a later period a usual designation, especially to those churches which were personally unknown to the apostle (Epistles to Rom. Col. Eph.), among whom, even without any existing opposition, such a designation was necessary in reference to the future. An exception was only natural where, as with the Philippians and with Philemon, the closest and most tried love and attachment united the apostle with the recipients of his Epistles. The supposition of Chrysostom, whom Oecumenius and Theophylact follow, is accordingly to be rejected, that the apostolic title was suppressed <span class="greekheb">διὰ τὸ νεοκατηχήτους εἶναι τοὺς ἄνδρας καὶ μηδέπω αὐτοῦ πεῖραν εἰληφέναι</span>, for then it ought not to be found in the Epistles to the Colossians and Ephesians. Further, the view of Zwingli, Estius, Pelt, and others is to be rejected, that Paul omitted his apostolic title <span class="ital">out of modesty</span>, as the same title could not be assigned to Silvanus (and Timotheus); for, not to mention that this reason is founded on a distorted view of the Pauline character, and that the two companions of the apostle would hardly lay claim to his apostolic rank, such a supposition is contradicted by <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-1.htm" title="Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, to the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints which are in all Achaia:">2 Corinthians 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-1.htm" title=" Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timotheus our brother,">Colossians 1:1</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καὶ Σιλουνανὸς καὶ Τιμόθεος</span>] Both are associated with Paul in the address, not to testify their agreement in the contents of the Epistle, and thereby to confer on it <span class="ital">so much greater authority</span> (Zanchius, Hunnius, Piscator, Pelt), or to testify that the contents were communicated to the apostle by <span class="ital">the Holy Ghost</span> (Macknight), but simply because they had assisted the apostle in preaching the gospel at Thessalonica. The simple mention of their names, without any addition, was sufficient on account of their being personally known. By being included in the address, they are represented as <span class="ital">joint-authors</span> of the Epistle, although they were so only in name. It is possible, but not certain, that Paul dictated the Epistle to one of them. (According to Berthold, they translated the letter conceived in Aramaic into Greek, and <span class="ital">shared</span> in the work.)<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Silvanus (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-19.htm" title="For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, even by me and Silvanus and Timotheus, was not yes and no, but in him was yes.">2 Corinthians 1:19</a>) is placed before Timotheus, not perhaps because Timotheus was the amanuensis, and from modesty placed his name last (Zanchius), but because Silvanus was older and had been longer with Paul.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">Ἐν Θεῷ πατρὶ</span> … <span class="greekheb">Χριστῷ</span> is to be closely united with <span class="greekheb">τῇ ἐκκλησίᾳ Θεσσαλονικέων</span>: <span class="ital">to the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ</span>,—that is, whose being, whose characteristic peculiarity, consists in fellowship with God the Father (by which they are distinguished from <span class="ital">heathen</span> <span class="greekheb">ἐκκλησίαι</span>) and with the Lord Jesus Christ (by which they are distinguished from the <span class="ital">Jewish</span> <span class="greekheb">ἐκκλησία</span>). Erroneously, Grotius: quae exstitit, id agente Deo Patre et Christo. The article <span class="greekheb">τῇ</span> is neither to be repeated before <span class="greekheb">ἐν Θεῷ</span>, nor is <span class="greekheb">τῇ οὔσῃ</span> to be supplied (Olshausen, de Wette, and Bloomfield erroneously supply <span class="greekheb">οὔσῃ</span> by itself, without the article; this could not be the construction, as it would contain a causal statement), because the words are blended together in the <span class="ital">unity</span> of the idea of the <span class="ital">Christian</span> church (see Winer’s <span class="ital">Grammar</span>, p. 128 [E. T. 170]). Schott arbitrarily refers <span class="greekheb">ἐν Θεῷ κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. to <span class="greekheb">χαίρειν λέγουσιν</span>, to be supplied before <span class="greekheb">χάρις ὑμῖν</span>; for <span class="greekheb">χάρις ὑμῖν καὶ εἰρ</span>. takes the place of the usual Greek salutation <span class="greekheb">χαίρειν λέγουσιν</span>. Hofmann’s view (<span class="ital">Die h. Schrift neuen Testaments zusammenhängend untersucht</span>, Part I. Nördl. 1862) amounts to the same as Schott’s, when he finds in <span class="greekheb">ἐν Θεῷ κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. “a Christian extension of the usual epistolary address,” importing that it is in God the Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ that the writers address themselves by letter to the churches. Still more arbitrarily Ambrosiaster (not Theophylact) and Koppe, who erase the concluding words: <span class="greekheb">ἀπὸ Θεοῦ κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. (see critical note), have placed a point after <span class="greekheb">Θεσσαλονικέων</span>, and united <span class="greekheb">ἐν Θεῷ</span> … <span class="greekheb">Χριστῷ</span> with <span class="greekheb">χάρις ὑμῖν καὶ εἰρήνη</span>.

As a Christian transformation of the heathen form of salutation, the words, grammatically considered, should properly be conjoined with the preceding in a single sentence: <span class="greekheb">Παῦλος καὶ Σ</span> … <span class="greekheb">τῇ ἐκκλησίᾳ Θ</span> … <span class="greekheb">χάριν καὶ εἰρήνην</span> (<span class="ital">sc.</span> <span class="greekheb">λέγουσιν</span>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/1_thessalonians/1.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-1.htm" title="Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, to the church of the Thessalonians which is in God the Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace be to you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.">1 Thessalonians 1:1</a>. <span class="ital">Greeting</span>.—As any trouble at Thessalonica had arisen over Paul’s character more than his authority, or rather as his authority had been struck through his character, he does not introduce his own apostolic rank or that of his colleagues (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-6.htm" title="Nor of men sought we glory, neither of you, nor yet of others, when we might have been burdensome, as the apostles of Christ.">1 Thessalonians 2:6</a>) in the forefront of this letter, which is intimate and unofficial throughout. Silvanus is put before Timothy as an older man and colleague, and also as Paul’s special coadjutor in the local mission. Acts never mentions Timothy in the Macedonian mission till <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-14.htm" title="And then immediately the brothers sent away Paul to go as it were to the sea: but Silas and Timotheus stayed there still.">Acts 17:14</a>, where he appears beside Silvanus. This does not mean (Bleek) that Timothy took no part in the work at Thessalonica; his intimate relations with the church forbid this supposition. Probably he is left unnoticed as being a junior subordinate, till the time comes when he can act as an useful agent of his leaders.—<span class="greekheb">ἐκκλ</span>. a pagan term appropriated by Christianity. An implicit contrast lies in the following words (so in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-14.htm" title="For you, brothers, became followers of the churches of God which in Judaea are in Christ Jesus: for you also have suffered like things of your own countrymen, even as they have of the Jews:">1 Thessalonians 2:14</a>): there were <span class="greekheb">ἐκκλησίαι</span> at Thessalonica and elsewhere (<span class="ital">cf.</span> Chrysostom and Orig., <span class="ital">Cels</span>. III. xxix.–xxx.) which had not their basis and being <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span> … <span class="greekheb">Χριστῷ</span>. The latter phrase is a suggestive and characteristic periphrasis for “Christian,” and the omission of the <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span> before <span class="greekheb">κυρίῳ</span>, as of <span class="greekheb">τῇ</span> before <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span>, is enough to show that the seven words form a unity instead of a double antithesis to “pagan” and “Jewish” respectively.—<span class="greekheb">κυρίῳ Ἰησοῦ Χριστῷ</span>, a new <span class="greekheb">κύριος</span> (= dominus) for people like the Thessalonians who were hitherto familiar with the title as applied to Claudius (<span class="ital">cf.</span> Wilcken’s <span class="ital">Griechische Ostraka</span>, 1899, s.v.) the emperor, or to the God of the Jews (<span class="ital">cf.</span> Knowling’s <span class="ital">Witness of the Epistles</span>, 260 f.).

But his greetings were enlarged as time went on, and varied with every variation in the circumstances of his readers and in his relations to them.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The ordinary address of an ancient letter ran thus: “X. to Y. greeting.” The greeting was, in Latin, a wish of “Health”; in Greek, of “Joy”; in Hebrew, “Peace to thee!” The Apostle’s salutation, adopted by the Church, combined the Hebrew and Greek (Jewish and Gentile, Eastern and Western) forms of courtesy, transforming the latter by a verbal change (<span class="ital">chairein</span> becoming <span class="ital">charis</span>)—slight indeed to the ear, but great in its significance—into the devout and Christian “Grace to you!” On <span class="ital">grace</span> and <span class="ital">peace</span> see note below.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Address is usually followed by an Act of Thanksgiving (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-3.htm" title="Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labor of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God and our Father;">1 Thessalonians 1:3</a></span> ff.)<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">1</span>. <span class="ital">Paul</span>] Here and in 2Th St Paul introduces himself without the title <span class="ital">Apostle</span>, or any personal designation. Similarly in his much later Epistles to the Philippians, and to his friend Philemon. For in these cases he has no need to stand on his dignity. He is “gentle among them, as a nurse with her children” (ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_thessalonians/2-6.htm" title="Nor of men sought we glory, neither of you, nor yet of others, when we might have been burdensome, as the apostles of Christ....">1 Thessalonians 2:6-8</a>); and prefers, as in writing to Philemon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-9.htm" title="For they themselves show of us what manner of entering in we had to you, and how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God;">1 Thessalonians 1:9</a>), to merge the Apostle in the friend.

The name (English, <span class="ital">Sylvan</span>: comp. our surname <span class="ital">Wood</span>, or <span class="ital">Woods</span>) is Latin, like that of Paul himself (<span class="ital">Paulus</span>). Both were Roman citizens, as we learn from <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-37.htm" title="But Paul said to them, They have beaten us openly uncondemned, being Romans, and have cast us into prison; and now do they thrust us out privately? no truly; but let them come themselves and fetch us out.">Acts 16:37</a>. Silas was notwithstanding a Jew—a leading member of the Church at Jerusalem, and an inspired man (a “prophet”: <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/15-22.htm" title="Then pleased it the apostles and elders with the whole church, to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; namely, Judas surnamed Barsabas and Silas, chief men among the brothers:...">Acts 15:22-23</a>). Silas shared with the Apostle Paul the honour of planting the gospel and first suffering for Christ in Europe; and his name worthily stands at the head of these earliest books of the N. T. The association of St Silas with St Paul terminated with the Second Missionary Journey of the Apostle. But he is probably the “Silvanus” of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-12.htm" title="By Silvanus, a faithful brother to you, as I suppose, I have written briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God wherein you stand.">1 Peter 5:12</a>, and his name is, along with that of Mark, a link between the Apostles Peter and Paul.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Timotheus</span> (on whom see further ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_thessalonians/3-1.htm" title="Why when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good to be left at Athens alone;...">1 Thessalonians 3:1-2</a>) is our familiar <span class="bld">Timothy</span>, as the name is uniformly given in the R. V. He shares In the addresses of 2 Corinthians, Philippians, Colossians , , 1 and 2 Thessalonians; and St Paul toward the close of his life wrote two inspired letters to this most constant and beloved of his companions, his “dear child Timothy.” He joined the Apostle in the course of this Second Missionary Expedition (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/16-1.htm" title="Then came he to Derbe and Lystra: and, behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timotheus, the son of a certain woman, which was a Jewess, and believed; but his father was a Greek:...">Acts 16:1-3</a>), and remained in his service to the end of St Paul’s life. At this time Timothy must have been very young; for he is referred to as a “young man” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-12.htm" title="Let no man despise your youth; but be you an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.">1 Timothy 4:12</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-22.htm" title="Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.">2 Timothy 2:22</a>, twelve years later. In the narrative of the Acts at this time he stands quite in the background; while Silas took a leading part in the common work, Timothy acted as their youthful attendant and apprentice, just as John Mark was “minister” (or “attendant,” R. V.) to Barnabas and Paul at an earlier period (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-5.htm" title="And when they were at Salamis, they preached the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews: and they had also John to their minister.">Acts 13:5</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>These three names—<span class="ital">paul, Silas, Timothy</span>—are typical of the mixed state of society in Apostolic times, and the varied material of which the Church was at first composed. It was built on a Jewish basis, with a Græco-Roman superstructure. Paul and Silvanus were <span class="ital">Jews</span>, with <span class="ital">Roman</span> name and citizenship. Timotheus had a <span class="ital">Greek</span> name and father, with a <span class="ital">Jewish</span> mother (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/16-1.htm" title="Then came he to Derbe and Lystra: and, behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timotheus, the son of a certain woman, which was a Jewess, and believed; but his father was a Greek:...">Acts 16:1-3</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>So much for the authors of the letter: the readers are designated <span class="bld">the Church of Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ</span> (R. V.). This remarkable form of address, used in both Epistles, the Apostle does not employ again. We may expand it thus: “To the assembly of Thessalonians, gathered in the twofold Name, confessing God as Father and Jesus Christ as Lord.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Observe the two parts of this description: (1) the <span class="ital">local</span> qualification, “church of <span class="ital">Thessalonians</span>.” Nearest to this is the phrase “churches of Galatia” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-2.htm" title="And all the brothers which are with me, to the churches of Galatia:">Galatians 1:2</a>), named however from the district, not the people. In 1 and 2 Corinthians the address runs, “To the church of God that is in Corinth”; afterwards, “To the saints that are in Ephesus, Philippi,” &c. The change from “church <span class="ital">of</span> Thessalonians” to “church <span class="ital">in</span> Corinth” is significant; it indicates an enlargement during the four years intervening of the conception of the Church, now no longer constituted by the local assembly, but thought of as one and the same Church here or there, in Corinth, Rome, or Jerusalem. Comp. note on ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-14.htm" title="For you, brothers, became followers of the churches of God which in Judaea are in Christ Jesus: for you also have suffered like things of your own countrymen, even as they have of the Jews:">1 Thessalonians 2:14</a>, “churches of God which are in Judæa.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(2) The <span class="ital">spiritual</span> definition: “the assembly … <span class="ital">in God the Father</span>,” &c. <span class="ital">Church</span> is in the N. T. <span class="ital">ecclesia</span> (French <span class="ital">église</span>), the common Greek word for “assembly,” or legal meeting of citizens, “called out” by the herald; which in the LXX (the Greek rendering of the O. T.) is applied frequently to the solemn religious assemblies of the people of Israel. The Apostle distinguishes this “assembly of Thessalonians” from both those, gatherings. The Christian <span class="ital">ecclesia</span> is “in God the Father,”—therefore a religions assembly marked off from all that is pagan, having “one God, the Father”; also “in the Lord Jesus Christ,” and thus distinguished from everything Jewish and Pagan alike, by its confession of “one Lord Jesus Christ” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/8-5.htm" title="For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or in earth, (as there be gods many, and lords many,)...">1 Corinthians 8:5-6</a>). The creed of the Thessalonian Church is here contained in brief. Its members had been “baptized into the name of the Father, and of the Son”; and all that they believed in and lived for as a Church centred in these two names—two, yet one (“in God the Father and the Lord,” not “and <span class="ital">in</span> the Lord”). “In God as <span class="ital">Father</span>,” they knew and owned themselves His children, “In the <span class="ital">Lord</span>,” they discerned their Saviour’s Divine Sonship and glory (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-10.htm" title="And to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, even Jesus, which delivered us from the wrath to come.">1 Thessalonians 1:10</a>); “in <span class="ital">Jesus</span>,” His human birth and history (ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-15.htm" title="Who both killed the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets, and have persecuted us; and they please not God, and are contrary to all men:">1 Thessalonians 2:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-14.htm" title="For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.">1 Thessalonians 4:14</a>, &c.); and “in <span class="ital">Christ</span>,” the living Head and Redeemer of His people. This is His full style and title, “The Lord Jesus Christ.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Grace</span> be <span class="ital">unto you, and peace</span>] In this earliest Epistle the salutation has its shortest form. The qualifying words, “from God our Father,” &c. (see R. V.), are not authentic here; they first appear in 2Th The usage of St Paul’s other Epistles naturally led copyists to make the addition here. But the “church” that is “in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ,” needs not to be told from Whom these gifts come.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Grace</span> is the sum of all blessings that God bestows through Christ. <span class="ital">Peace</span> is the sum of all spiritual blessing that man receives and experiences; it is Grace in its fruit and realisation, In the wide sense of its Hebrew original (<span class="ital">Shalóm</span>), Peace is more than the absence of hostility and disorder; it denotes health and harmony of nature, inward tranquillity and wellbeing. And Grace, which in the first instance is God s love and favour to the undeserving, becomes also the inward possession of those who receive it, manifesting itself as the spirit and habit of their lives. The supreme exhibition of God’s grace is <span class="ital">the death of Christ</span> for sinful men, and the great instrument of peace is <span class="ital">the sacrifice of the cross</span>: Jesus “by God’s grace tasted death for every man,” “making peace through the blood of His cross” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-9.htm" title="But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.">Hebrews 2:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-20.htm" title=" And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things to himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven.">Colossians 1:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/2-14.htm" title="For he is our peace, who has made both one, and has broken down the middle wall of partition between us;...">Ephesians 2:14-18</a>; &c.).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>St Paul’s whole gospel is in these two words.

The expectation of the coming of Christ among the Thessalonians was unclouded. So exalted was their condition, and so clear of impediments and encumbrances (unencumbered) was the state of Christianity among them, that they were able hourly to look for the Lord Jesus. The epistles to them were written before the others; afterwards various evils crept into the churches.—<span class="greekheb">Θεσσαλονικέων</span>, <span class="ital">of the Thessalonians</span>) Jac. Mehrningius says, “In the memory of our fathers, there were two Greeks, first among the Moravian brethren, afterwards in Belgium, who asserted, that even now both of St. Paul’s epistles to the Thessalonians are well preserved by them in autograph.”—Hist. baptismi, A. 1647, Germanice edita, p. 739.—<span class="greekheb">ἐν</span>, <span class="ital">in</span>) Union with God is indicated.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_thessalonians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Paul</span>. He does not call himself "an apostle," not because the Thessalonians were newly converted (Chrysostom), or from tenderness to Silvanus who was not an apostle (Estius), or because his apostolic authority was not yet recognized (Jowett), or because he had merely commenced his apostolic labors (Wordsworth); but because his apostleship had never been called in question by the Thessalonians. For the same reason he omits this title in the Epistle to the Philippians; whereas he strongly insists upon it in his Epistles to the Corinthians and Galatians, because among them there were many opposed to his authority. <span class="cmt_word">And Silvanus.</span> The same as the Silas of the Acts. He is mentioned as a chief man among the brethren, and a prophet or inspired teacher (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-22.htm">Acts 15:22, 32</a>). His Latin name renders it probable that he was a Hellenistic Jew, and, like Paul, he was a Roman citizen (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-37.htm">Acts 16:37</a>). He was sent with Judas Barsabas from Jerusalem, to convey the apostolic decrees to Antioch; and he accompanied Paul instead of Barnabas on his second missionary journey (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-40.htm">Acts 15:40</a>). He suffered imprisonment with Paul at Philippi; and was engaged with him in preaching the gospel in Thessalonica, Beraea, and Corinth. His ministry at Corinth is honorably mentioned by Paul in his Second Epistle to the Corinthians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-9.htm">2 Corinthians 1:9</a>). After this there is no more mention of Silvanus in the Acts, and it is doubtful whether he was the Silvanus by whom the First Epistle of Peter was conveyed to the Churches of Asia (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-12.htm">1 Peter 5:12</a>). Ancient tradition, erroneously supposing that Silas and Silvanus were different persons, makes Silas the Bishop of Corinth, and Silvanus the Bishop of Thessalonica. <span class="cmt_word">And Timotheus.</span> The well-known disciple of Paul. He was a native of Lystra, having a Greek father and a Jewish mother (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-1.htm">Acts 16:1</a>). He joined Paul and Silas on their second missionary journey at Lystra, and was with them in Philippi, Thessalonica, and Corinth. He was with Paul on his third missionary journey, and was sent by him on a mission to Macedonia and Corinth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-22.htm">Acts 19:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-10.htm">1 Corinthians 16:10</a>), and accompanied him into Asia on his last journey to Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-4.htm">Acts 20:4</a>). He was also with Paul during his first Roman imprisonment, when he wrote the Epistles to the Philippians and Colossians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-1.htm">Philippians 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-1.htm">Colossians 1:1</a>). Afterwards he resided at Ephesus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-3.htm">1 Timothy 1:3</a>); from which he was recalled to Rome by Paul shortly before his martyrdom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-21.htm">2 Timothy 4:21</a>). The last mention of Timothy is in the Epistle to the Hebrews: "Know ye that our brother Timothy is set at liberty; with whom, if he come shortly, I will see you" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-23.htm">Hebrews 13:23</a>). According to ecclesiastical tradition, he became Bishop of Ephesus, and there suffered martyrdom.  Silvanus and Timotheus are associated with Paul in his address to the Thessalonians, not to give weight and authority to his Epistle, but because they assisted him in the planting of the Church at Thessalonica, and were now with him at Corinth, when he was writing this Epistle. Silvanus is placed first, because he was the older and had been longer with the apostle, and, as is evident from the Acts, was at this time the more important of the two (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-19.htm">Acts 16:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-4.htm">Acts 17:4</a>). By being included in the address, they are represented as joint authors of the Epistle with Paul, although they were only so in name. It is possible that Paul employed one of them as his amanuensis in writing the Epistle. <span class="cmt_word">Unto the Church.</span> The word "Church" denotes a select assembly; here, Christians selected from the world. It does not denote in the New Testament, as with us, a building, but the congregation. In Paul's later Epistles, those addressed are called, not the Church, but saints. <span class="cmt_word">Of the Thessalonians.</span> In other Epistles the address is to the city, as Rome, Philippi, Colosse; here it is to the inhabitants. The Church of the Thessalonians was chiefly composed of converted Gentiles, with a small number of converted Jews (see Introduction). <span class="accented">Which is</span>; to be omitted, as not being in the original. <span class="cmt_word">In God the Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ.</span> The characteristic peculiarity of the Church: they are in God and Christ, that is, in fellowship with them, united to them. "In God the Father" characterizes them as not being heathens; "in the Lord Jesus Christ" characterizes them as not being Jews. <span class="cmt_word">Grace be unto you, and peace.</span> The usual apostolic benediction. "Grace" is the Greek and" peace" is the Jewish form of salutation. The Greeks commenced their epistles with wishing grace for those to whom they wrote; and the usual form of salutation among the Jews was <span class="accented">Shalom</span> or "peace;" the apostle combines them, thus intimating that both Greeks and Jews are one in Christ Jesus. In the Pastoral Epistles and in the Second Epistle of John the form is "Grace, mercy, and peace" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_john/1-3.htm">2 John 1:3</a>.), and in the Epistle of Jude it is "Mercy, peace, and love" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-2.htm">Jude 1:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">From God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.</span> These words are wanting in some important manuscripts, and are omitted in the R.V. The preponderance, however, of external authority is in their favor. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/1_thessalonians/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>The address of the first Epistle is shorter than that of any of the Pauline letters. In the other Epistles Paul either indicates the contents of the letter, or adds details concerning the writer or his correspondents, or amplifies the apostolic greeting. The names of Silvanus and Timothy are added to that of Paul as the senders of the letter. They were with him at Corinth when it was written (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-5.htm">Acts 18:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-19.htm">2 Corinthians 1:19</a>). They had assisted him in the foundation of the Thessalonian Church (<a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-1.htm">Acts 16:1-3</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/17-4.htm">Acts 17:4</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/17-10.htm">Acts 17:10</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-14.htm">Acts 17:14</a>). Paul's official title; "Apostle" is omitted in the addresses of both Epistles, although in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:6</a> he uses &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; apostles, including Silvanus and Timothy under that title. The title appears in all the other Epistles except Philippians and Philemon. The reason for its omission in every case appears to have been the intimate and affectionate character of his relations with the parties addressed, which rendered an appeal to his apostolic authority unnecessary. Paul does not confine the name of apostle to the twelve.<p>Silvanus<p>The Silas of the Acts, where alone the form &#x3a3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; occurs. By Paul always &#x3a3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;, of which &#x3a3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; is a contraction, as &#x39b;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c2; from &#x39b;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;. Similar contractions occur in Class., as &#x391;&#788;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c2; for &#x391;&#788;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; for &#x391;&#788;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, and that for &#x391;&#788;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;. Silas first appears in <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/15-22.htm">Acts 15:22</a>, as one of the bearers of the letter to the Gentile Christians at Antioch. He accompanied Paul on his second missionary tour, and was left behind with Timothy when Paul departed from Macedonia after his first visit. He was probably a Jewish Christian (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-20.htm">Acts 16:20</a>), and was, like Paul, a Roman citizen (<a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-37.htm">Acts 16:37</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-38.htm">Acts 16:38</a>).

He accompanied Paul on his second missionary tour (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-3.htm">Acts 16:3</a>), and was one of the founders of the churches in Thessalonica and Philippi. He is often styled by Paul "the brother" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-1.htm">2 Corinthians 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-1.htm">Colossians 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:2</a>; Plm 1:1); with Paul himself "a bondservant of Jesus Christ" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-1.htm">Philippians 1:1</a>); comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-18.htm">1 Timothy 1:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-2.htm">2 Timothy 1:2</a>. Paul's confidence in him appears in <a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-19.htm">Philippians 2:19-22</a>, and is implied in his sending him from Athens to the Thessalonian church to establish and comfort its members (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:2</a>). Paul sent him again to Macedonia in company with Erastus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-22.htm">Acts 19:22</a>), and also to Corinth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-17.htm">1 Corinthians 4:17</a>). To the Corinthians he writes of Timothy as "his beloved and faithful child in the Lord" who shall remind them of his ways in Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-17.htm">1 Corinthians 4:17</a>), and as one who worketh the work of the Lord as he himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-10.htm">1 Corinthians 16:10</a>). He joined Paul at Rome, and his name is associated with Paul's in the addresses of the letters to the Colossians and Philemon. In every case where he is mentioned by name with Silvanus, the name of Silvanus precedes.<p>To the church of the Thessalonians<p>This form of address appears in 1st and 2nd Corinthians, Galatians, 2nd Thessalonians. The other letters are addressed to "the saints, " "the brethren, " "the saints and faithful brethren." The use of the genitive of the national name is peculiar.

The verbs &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; and &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; to summon formally, which do not occur in N.T., are found in lxx with &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; gathering, &#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd; people, and &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2; elders. &#x3a3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#768; is constantly used in lxx of the children of Israel as a body (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-6.htm">Exodus 12:6</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-19.htm">Exodus 12:19</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-47.htm">Exodus 12:47</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-13.htm">Leviticus 4:13</a>, etc.), and is the more common word in N.T. for a Jewish as distinguished from a Christian assembly; sometimes with the addition of the Jews (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-5.htm">Acts 8:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-1.htm">Acts 14:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-1.htm">Acts 17:1</a>). It is once used of a Christian assembly (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-2.htm">James 2:2</a>). &#x395;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#768; gathering together, occurs <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-1.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-25.htm">Hebrews 10:25</a>. The Ebionites retained &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#768; in preference to &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;. The lxx translators found two Hebrew words for "assembly" or "congregation,": &#1506;&#1461;&#1491;&#1464;&#1492; and &#1511;&#1464;&#1492;&#1464;&#1500;, and rendered the former by &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#768; in the great majority of instances. &#x395;&#788;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; does not appear as the rendering of &#1506;&#1461;&#1491;&#1464;&#1492;. They were not as consistent in rendering &#1511;&#1464;&#1492;&#1464;&#1500;, since they used both &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#768; and &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;, though the latter was the more frequent: see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-13.htm">Leviticus 4:13</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-22.htm">Deuteronomy 5:22</a>, etc. The A.V. renders both words by "congregation" and "assembly" indiscriminately. &#x395;&#788;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; is only once used in N.T. of a Jewish congregation, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-38.htm">Acts 7:38</a>; yet there are cases where there is an apparent attempt to guard its distinctively Christian sense against being confounded with the unconverted Jewish communities. Hence the addition; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3a7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#837;&#834; in Christ, <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-22.htm">Galatians 1:22</a>; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#837;&#834; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, &#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#837; &#x399;&#788;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3a7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#837;&#834; in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-1.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:1</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/1-1.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:1</a>. In both Hebrew and N.T. usage, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; implies a community based on a special religious idea, and established in a special way. In N.T. it is also used in a narrower sense, of a single church, or of a church confined to a single place. So <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/16-5.htm">Romans 16:5</a>, etc.<p>In God the Father, etc.<p>Const. with the church, and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/1-1.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:1</a>. The phrase "the church in God" is peculiar to the Thessalonian Epistles. Elsewhere "of God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-32.htm">1 Corinthians 10:32</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-16.htm">1 Corinthians 11:16</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-22.htm">1 Corinthians 11:22</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-9.htm">1 Corinthians 15:9</a>, etc.); "of the saints" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-33.htm">1 Corinthians 14:33</a>). Lightfoot suggests that the word &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; can scarcely have been stamped with so definite a Christian meaning in the minds of these recent and early converts as to render the addition "in God the Father," etc., superfluous.<p>Grace to you and peace (&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;)<p>In Romans, 1st and 2nd Corinthians, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, the salutation is, Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Colossians omits the last five words of this: 2 Thessalonians mits our before Father. On the union of the Greek and Jewish forms of salutation, see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-3.htm">1 Corinthians 1:3</a>. </body></html>
