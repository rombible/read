This is the way to win people. We should not only be faithful to our calling as Christians, but in our particular callings and relations. Our great gospel privilege is, that God has called us to his kingdom and glory. The great gospel duty is, that we walk worthy of God. We should live as becomes those called with such a high and holy calling. Our great business is to honour, serve, and please God, and to seek to be worthy of him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Ye are witnesses - They had a full opportunity of knowing his manner of life.<p>And God also - See the notes on ver 5.<p>How holily - Piously - observing all the duties of religion.<p>And justly - In our contact with people.

Every duty was faithfully performed. This is not a claim to absolute perfection, but it is a claim to consistency of character, and to faithfulness in duty, which every Christian should be enabled to make. Every man professing religion should so live as to be able to appeal to all who have had an opportunity of knowing him, as witnesses that he was consistent and faithful, and that there was nothing which could be laid to his charge. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10.

He appeals to them as witnesses about their external actions, and to God about the integrity of their hearts; and he doth this not in a way of boasting, but to be an example to them, and as a further reason of the great success of his ministry.

Not so much to what goes before as to what follows after, relating to their holy walk and conversation among them, the more open part of which they were witness of; and for the more secret part God is appealed to, who is acquainted with the springs of actions, as well as with actions themselves: <p>how holily, and justly, and unblamably we behaved ourselves among you that believe. The Syriac version joins the last clause of the preceding verse with this, and reads the whole thus, "ye are witnesses, and God also, how purely and justly we preached unto you the Gospel of God, and how unblamable we were among all that believed"; referring the former part to the purity and integrity in which they preached the Gospel, and the latter to their unblemished conduct among the saints; but the whole of it refers to their conversation, which was holy, externally holy, arising from internal principles of holiness in their hearts, and free from that impurity and filthiness with which the false teachers were polluted; and confirms what is before said, that their exhortation was not of uncleanness: and it was likewise "just", they were righteous in the sight of God through the justifying righteousness of Christ, and in consequence of this lived righteously before men, and were injurious to no man's person nor property: and their conversation was also "unblamable"; not that they were, without sin, and so without blame in themselves, or without the commission of sin by them, or that they passed without censure in the world, for they went through honour and dishonour, through good report and bad report, and had all manner of evil spoken of them falsely for Christ's name's sake; but by the grace of God, they had their conversation among them that believed so, that there was nothing material to be alleged against them, or any just cause of blame to be laid either on their persons or their ministry; and which is mentioned for imitation. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{8}</span> Ye <i>are</i> witnesses, and God <i>also</i>, how holily and justly and unblameably we behaved ourselves among you that believe:</span><p>(8) To excel others in the example of a godly life.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-10.htm" title="You are witnesses, and God also, how piously and justly and blamelessly we behaved ourselves among you that believe:">1 Thessalonians 2:10</a>. This verse is designed to represent in a <span class="ital">summary</span> manner the conduct of the apostle among the Thessalonians, which was hitherto only represented by <span class="ital">special</span> features; but as thereby not merely what was patent to external observation, that is, the visible action on which man can pronounce a judgment, but likewise the internal disposition, which is the source of that action, was to be emphasized; so Paul naturally appeals for the truth of his assertion not only to his readers, but to God. The apostle, however, proceeds without a particle of transition, on account of the warmth of emotion with which he speaks.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὡς</span>] <span class="ital">how very</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὁσίως καὶ δικαίως</span>] (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-24.htm" title="And that you put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.">Ephesians 4:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-75.htm" title="In holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of our life.">Luke 1:75</a>; <a href="http://apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/9-3.htm" title="And order the world according to equity and righteousness, and execute judgment with an upright heart:">Wis 9:3</a>, <span class="greekheb">ὁσιότης</span> and <span class="greekheb">δικαιοσύνη</span>) is put entirely in accordance with classical usage; the first denotes dutiful conduct toward <span class="ital">God</span>, and the latter toward our <span class="ital">neighbour</span>. Comp. Plat. <span class="ital">Gorg.</span> p. 507: <span class="greekheb">καὶ μὴν περὶ μὲν ἀνθρώπους τὰ προσήκοντα πράττων δίκαιʼ ἂν πράττοι</span>, <span class="greekheb">περὶ δὲ θεοὺς ὅσια</span>; Polyb. xxxiii. 10. 8; <span class="ital">Schol. ad Eurip. Hec.</span> 788.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἀμέμπτως</span>] <span class="ital">unblameably</span>. Turretin, Bengel, Moldenhauer interpret this of dutiful conduct <span class="ital">toward oneself</span>, evidently from the desire of a logical division of love, in order to obtain a sharply marked threefold division of the idea. Flacius refers it to the <span class="ital">reliqui mores</span> besides <span class="ital">justitia</span>, that is, to <span class="ital">castitas, sobrietas</span>, and <span class="ital">moderatio in omnibus</span>; but this is without any reason. It is the <span class="ital">general negative</span> designation, comprehending the two preceding more special and positive expressions, thus to be understood of a dutiful conduct toward God and man. Too narrowly Olshausen: that it is the negative expression of the positive <span class="greekheb">δικαίως</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὑμῖν τοῖς πιστεύουσιν</span>] belongs not only to <span class="greekheb">ἀμέμπτως</span>, but to the whole sentence: <span class="greekheb">ὡς ὁσίως καὶ δικ</span>. <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἀμ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐγενήθ</span>. It is not <span class="ital">dat. commodi</span>: “to your, the believers’, behoof;” so that it would be identical with <span class="greekheb">διʼ ὑμᾶς τοὺς πιστεύοντας</span>. Nor does it mean <span class="ital">toward</span> you believers (de Wette: “This, his conduct, had <span class="ital">believers</span> for its object with whom he came into contact;” Hofmann, Auberlen), for (1) <span class="greekheb">ὁσίως</span> does not suit this meaning; (2) as <span class="greekheb">ὑμῖν τοῖς πιστεύουσιν</span> is not without emphasis, the unsuitable contrast would arise, that in reference to <span class="ital">others</span> the apostle did not esteem the upright conduct necessary. For, with Hammond, to apply <span class="greekheb">ὑμῖν τοῖς πιστεύουσιν</span>, in contrast to the <span class="ital">time</span> when those addressed had not yet been brought to the faith, is grammatically impossible, as then the participle of the aorist without the article must be used; (3) <span class="greekheb">ἐγενήθημεν</span> does not obtain its due force, as the passive form cannot denote pure self-activity. <span class="greekheb">ὑμῖν τοῖς πιστεύουσιν</span> is, as already Oecumenius and Theophylact (and recently Alford) explain it, the <span class="ital">dative of opinion</span> or judgment (see Winer, p. 190 [E. T. 265]; Bernhardy, <span class="ital">Syntax</span>, p. 83): <span class="ital">for you, believers</span>, so that this was the character, the light in which we appeared <span class="ital">to you</span>. Thus an appropriate limitation arises by this addition. For the hostility raised against the apostle, and his expulsion from Thessalonica, clearly showed how far from being <span class="ital">general</span> was the recognition that God had enabled the apostle to behave <span class="greekheb">ὁσίως καὶ δικαίως καὶ ἀμέμπτως</span>. Moreover, <span class="greekheb">ὡς ὁσίως κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐγεν</span>. is not equivalent to <span class="greekheb">ὡς ὅσιοι κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐγεν</span>. (Schott). The adverbs bring prominently forward the mode and manner, the condition of <span class="greekheb">γενηθῆναι</span>. See Winer, p. 413 [E. T. 582]; Bernhardy, <span class="ital">Syntax</span>, p. 337 ff.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-10.htm" title="You are witnesses, and God also, how piously and justly and blamelessly we behaved ourselves among you that believe:">1 Thessalonians 2:10</a>. “We made ourselves yours” (<span class="ital">cf.</span> 8), the dative going closely (as <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-3.htm" title="So then if, while her husband lives, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if her husband be dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be married to another man.">Romans 7:3</a>) with the verb, which is qualified (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-10.htm" title="Now if Timotheus come, see that he may be with you without fear: for he works the work of the Lord, as I also do.">1 Corinthians 16:10</a>) by the adverbs; so Born., Findlay.—<span class="greekheb">ὑμῖν κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.

The Greek adverb does not represent the ordinary N.T. word for “holy” (<span class="ital">hagios</span>, i.e. <span class="ital">saint</span>), but another adjective (<span class="ital">hosios</span>), which is frequent in the O.T. and in common Greek. The former denotes Holiness as a relationship to God; the latter, as a condition or disposition of the man: they differ as <span class="ital">consecrated</span> from <span class="ital">religious</span> or <span class="ital">pious</span>. For the combination of Holiness (in this latter sense) with Righteousness, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-24.htm" title="And that you put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.">Ephesians 4:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-8.htm" title="But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, holy, temperate;">Titus 1:8</a>; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-75.htm" title="In holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of our life.">Luke 1:75</a>; in the O.T., <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-4.htm" title="He is the Rock, his work is perfect: for all his ways are judgment: a God of truth and without iniquity, just and right is he.">Deuteronomy 32:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/145-17.htm" title="The LORD is righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his works.">Psalm 145:17</a> (applied to God), &c. The terms are not mutually exclusive, but may apply to the same acts and persons. The “holy” man has regard to the sanctities, the “righteous” man to the duties of life; but duty is sacred, and piety is duty.
