This is the more carefully to be observed, because the <span class="ital">passions </span>occasionally exercising themselves, and flowing like a torrent, in the apostle, are observable to every reader; whereas it requires a nicer attention to discern those calm, standing tempers, that fixed posture of his soul, from whence the others only flow out, and which more peculiarly distinguish his character. <span class="ital">Being taken from you </span>— Greek, <span class="greekheb">απορφανισθεντες</span>, <span class="ital">separated from you. </span>The expression is commonly applied to children who are deprived of their parents: here, as the apostle, under God, was the spiritual father of the believers in Thessalonica, it is used in allusion to parents who are deprived of their children: <span class="ital">for a short time </span>— <span class="greekheb">Προς καιρον ωρας</span>, <span class="ital">for an hour’s time; </span>that is, for a very little season. Perhaps the apostle meant, that when he fled from Thessalonica to Berea, he proposed to be absent only a few days, till the rage of the Jews was abated; after which he intended to return. Accordingly he tells them, he the more earnestly, on that account, endeavoured to return, and actually made two attempts for that purpose. But the coming of the Jews from Thessalonica, to stir up the people in Berea against him, frustrated his design, and obliged him to leave Macedonia. <span class="ital">We would have come </span>(<span class="ital">even I, Paul,</span>) <span class="ital">once and again, </span>&c. — This parenthesis, Macknight thinks, shows, that what follows is to be understood of Paul alone, though he continues to use the plural form of expression; and that therefore in other passages, where he uses the plural number, he may be speaking of himself only. <span class="ital">But Satan hindered us </span>— By the persecuting Jews. Because the devil employs himself continually in obstructing the good purposes, endeavours, and actions of mankind, and is the chief enemy of God and man, he hath the name of <span class="ital">Satan, </span>or <span class="ital">adversary, </span>given him by way of eminence. And they who assist him in his malicious attempts are called <span class="ital">ministers of Satan, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-15.htm" title="Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.">2 Corinthians 11:15</a>. The persecution raised against the apostle and his fellow-labourers, in Berea, is here ascribed to Satan, to teach us that persecution for conscience’ sake is the genuine work of the devil. <span class="ital">For what is our hope </span>— The source of my hope; <span class="ital">or joy </span>— That wherein I take comfort; <span class="ital">or crown of rejoicing? </span>— The honour of my ministry, and the chief cause of my rejoicing. <span class="ital">Are not even ye </span>— As well as our other children; <span class="ital">in the presence of our Lord — </span>When I shall behold you, at the last day, owned of him, and made happy by him. “In this passage, the apostle compares the return of Christ to heaven, after the judgment, to the solemnity of a triumph, in which the apostle himself is to appear crowned in token of his victory over the false religions of the world, and over the abetters of those religions,” as well as over the errors and vices of mankind, and all the enemies of God and his people, visible and invisible; “and attended by his converts, who are, in that manner, to honour him as their spiritual father.” And because these converts were the fruits of his preaching, and the evidences of the success of his labours, and therefore one grand “cause of his being thus crowned, they are, by a beautiful figure of speech, called <span class="ital">his crown of glorying.” </span>That some peculiar honour or reward will be conferred on them who have been instrumental in the conversion of sinners, is evident from <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/12-3.htm" title="And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever.">Daniel 12:3</a>. <span class="ital">For ye are our glory and joy </span>— The manner in which the apostle here speaks of the Thessalonians, “shows that he expected to know his converts at the day of judgment. If so, we may hope to know our relations and friends then. And as there is no reason to think that in the future life we shall lose those natural and social affections which constitute so great a part of our present enjoyment, may we not expect that these affections, purified from every thing animal and terrestrial, will be a source of our happiness in that life likewise? It must be remembered, however, that in the other world we shall love one another not so much on account of the relation and friendship which formerly subsisted between us, as on account of the knowledge and virtue which we possess. For among rational beings, whose affections will all be suited to the high state of moral and intellectual perfection to which they shall be raised, the most endearing relations and warmest friendships will be those which are formed on excellence of character. What a powerful consideration this to excite us to cultivate, in our relations and friends, the noble and lasting qualities of knowledge and virtue, which will prove such a source of happiness to them and to us through the endless ages of eternity!” — Macknight. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:17-20 This world is not a place where we are to be always, or long together.

It properly has relation to the condition of an orphan (compare notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-18.htm">John 14:18</a>), or one who is bereaved of parents, or one who is bereaved of parents}}. Then it is used in a more general sense, denoting to be bereaved of; and in this place it does not mean merely that he was "taken from them," but there is included the idea that it was like a painful bereavement. It was such a state as that of one who had lost a parent. No word, perhaps, could have expressed stranger attachment for them.<p>For a short time - Greek, "For the time of an hour;" that is, for a brief period. The meaning is, that when he left them he supposed it would be only for a short time. The fact seems to have been <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/17-10.htm">Acts 17:10</a>, that it was supposed, when Paul was sent to Berea, that things would soon be in such a state that he could safely return to Thessalonica. He was "sent" there by those who thought it was necessary for the safety of some of his friends at Thessalonica, and he evidently purposed to return as soon as it could properly be done. It had, in fact, however, turned out to be a long and painful absence.<p>In presence, not in heart - My heart was still with you. This is an elegant and touching expression, which we still use to denote affection for an absent friend.<p>Endeavoured the more abundantly to see your face - Made every endeavor possible. It was from no want of affection that I have not done it, but from causes beyond my control.<p>With great desire - Compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-15.htm">Luke 22:15</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17.

So "I will not leave you comfortless," Greek, "orphanized" (Joh 14:18).<p>for a short time&#8212;literally, "for the space of an hour." "When we had been severed from you but a very short time (perhaps alluding to the suddenness of his unexpected departure), we the more abundantly (the shorter was our separation; for the desire of meeting again is the more vivid, the more recent has been the parting) endeavored," &c. (Compare 2Ti 1:4). He does not hereby, as many explain, anticipate a short separation from them, which would be a false anticipation; for he did not soon revisit them. The Greek past participle also forbids their view.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The apostle here makes his apology, for his so soon departing from them, and his continued absence. They were under great sufferings for receiving the gospel he had preached, and for him therefore to leave them so soon as he did, (as appears in the story, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/17-1.htm" title="Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the Jews:...">Acts 17:1-34</a></span>), and not presently to return, might discourage their hearts and make them question his love. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. For his leaving them, he tells them it was not voluntary, but forced by the persecution of the Jews, he being sent away in the night by the brethren to Berea, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-10.htm" title="And the brothers immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night to Berea: who coming thither went into the synagogue of the Jews.">Acts 17:10</a></span>; and therefore he calls it a taking away, rather than a going away from them. And (as the Greek word imports) it was: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. A thing grievous to him, as children that are bereft of father and mother, and left orphans, are greatly troubled. And he was afflicted as a father bereft of children; so were these Thessalonians to him, having begotten them to Christ by the gospel. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. It was but <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">for a short time, </span> for the time of an hour; when he left them, he intended but a short stay from them, only to avoid the present storm: others think he means by the words his sudden leaving them before he took solemn leave of them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>4. He left them <span class="bld">in presence</span>, <span class="ital">quoad faciem, </span> as to outward sight, not in heart: the proper genius of true lovers, who are present with each other in soul when separated in body. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>5. He tells them of his endeavours to see their face; and that the more abundantly, because he came away so suddenly from them. And lastly, he did this with great desire, his endeavours herein were acted with great affection. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But we, brethren, being taken from you,.... Here more properly should begin the third chapter, in which the apostle having before observed the manner of his entrance among these people, the nature of his ministry, the reception the word of God met with among them, and the powerful effect it had upon them, insomuch that they patiently and cheerfully bore persecution for the sake of it; he excuses his not having been with them again as yet, which he knew was proper and necessary, as he was their apostle and spiritual father; and expresses an affectionate concern at his parting with them in the manner he did, which was not his own choice and voluntary act, but was obliged to it, being hurried away at once, at an unawares in the night, by reason of the uproar made in the city by the baser sort of people, instigated by the unbelieving Jews; so that he and his fellow ministers had not the opportunity of taking their leave of them, as they would have done: hence he says, <p>we being taken from you; they were, as it were, passive in it; they were forced away on a sudden, they did not go of themselves; the word used is very uncommon and emphatical, and may be literally rendered, "we being orphanized from you"; which represents this parting to be like the separation made by death, between parents and children; when either parents are deprived of their children, or children of their parents, and are left orphans or fatherless; and just in such a destitute and desolate condition were the apostle and his companions in, in their account; nor need it to be wondered at, when they are before compared to a nursing mother and a tender father, as they were to these their spiritual children: and he further observes, that this removal from them, was <p>for a short time, or "for the time of an hour"; which may either denote the suddenness of it, being as it were at an hour's warning, having no more notice of it than for the space of an hour; or it may express the great affection he and his fellow ministers had for them, insomuch that they could not bear an absence from them, though but for an hour; or it may be said by way of comfort, that this parting was but for a short time, and that in a little while they might hope to see them again; and if not in this life, yet in the future state, when they should meet and never part more, and which would be but in a short time at longest: moreover, this separation was only <p>in presence; in person, in face, in sight, in body, it was but a corporeal one: not in heart; the apostle's heart was with them, as much as if present; they were always in his mind, and remembered by him, at the throne; he had as it were the images of them continually before him, as parents have of their children when at a distance from them; his heart was after them, and his affections moved strongly towards them: and the effect this distance had on him, and those that were with him, was this, that they <p>endeavoured the more abundantly, he observes, <p>to see your face with great desire; it made them but the more desirous of seeing them face to face again, and put them upon attempting with more abundant earnestness and diligence to come and see them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{15}</span> But we, brethren, <span class="cverse3">{m}</span> being taken from you for a short time in presence, not in heart, endeavoured the more abundantly to see your face with great desire.</span><p>(15) He meets with an objection, why he did not come to them immediately, being in such great misery: I often desired to, he says, and I was not able, but Satan hindered my endeavours, and therefore I sent Timothy my faithful companion to you, because you are most dear to me.<p>(m) Were kept apart from you, and as it were orphans.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-17.htm" title="But we, brothers, being taken from you for a short time in presence, not in heart, endeavored the more abundantly to see your face with great desire.">1 Thessalonians 2:17</a> begins a new section of the Epistle.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">Ἡμεῖς δέ</span>] is not in contrast to <span class="greekheb">ὑμεῖς</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-14.htm" title="For you, brothers, became followers of the churches of God which in Judaea are in Christ Jesus: for you also have suffered like things of your own countrymen, even as they have of the Jews:">1 Thessalonians 2:14</a> (de Wette, Koch, Hofmann);

It is therefore best to assume that <span class="greekheb">ἡμεῖς δέ</span>, whilst it contrasts the writer to the Jews whose machinations have just been described, and accordingly <span class="ital">breaks off</span> the polemic against the Jews, refers to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-13.htm" title="For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when you received the word of God which you heard of us, you received it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectually works also in you that believe.">1 Thessalonians 2:13</a> as the preceding <span class="ital">main thought</span>, and accordingly <span class="ital">resumes</span> the <span class="greekheb">ἡμεῖς</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-13.htm" title="For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when you received the word of God which you heard of us, you received it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectually works also in you that believe.">1 Thessalonians 2:13</a>. To the attestation of his <span class="ital">thanksgiving</span> to God on account of the earnest acceptance of the gospel on the part of the Thessalonians, the apostle joins the attestation of his <span class="ital">longing</span> for his readers, and his repeatedly formed resolution to return to them. The view of Calvin, which Musculus, Zanchius, Hunnius, Piscator, Vorstius, Gomarus, Benson, Macknight, Pelt, Hofmann, and Auberlen maintain, is erroneous, that <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-17.htm" title="But we, brothers, being taken from you for a short time in presence, not in heart, endeavored the more abundantly to see your face with great desire.">1 Thessalonians 2:17</a> ff. were added by Paul as an <span class="ital">excusatio</span> “ne se a Paulo desertos esse putarent Thessalonicenses, quum tanta necessitas ejus praesentiam flagitaret.” For evidently in the circumstances that constrained the apostle to depart from Thessalonica, such a suspicion could not arise, especially as, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-10.htm" title="And the brothers immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night to Berea: who coming thither went into the synagogue of the Jews.">Acts 17:10</a>, the <span class="ital">Thessalonians themselves</span> had arranged the departure of the apostle. Accordingly no justification was requisite. The explanation has rather its origin only in the fulness of the apostolic Christian love, which cared and laboured for the salvation of these recent disciples of Christ.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἀπορφανισθέντες</span>] <span class="ital">bereaved</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὀρφανίζεσθαι</span> is originally used of children who are deprived of their parents by death. It is however used, even by the classics, in a wider sense, expressing in a figurative and vivid manner the deprivation of an object, or the distance, the separation from a person or thing. Thus the adjective <span class="greekheb">ὀρφανός</span> occurs in Pindar (see Passow) in a wider sense (<span class="ital">e.g.</span> <span class="greekheb">ὀρφ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἑταίρων</span>, <span class="ital">Isthm.</span> vii. 16); also of parents, <span class="greekheb">ὀρφανοὶ γενεᾶς</span>, childless, <span class="ital">Ol.</span> ix. 92; comp. Hesych.: <span class="greekheb">ὀρφανὸς ὁ γονέων ἐστερημένος καὶ τέκνων</span>. Here also <span class="greekheb">ἀπορφανισθέντες</span> expresses the idea of distance, of separation, but is not exhausted by this idea. We would accordingly err, if we were to find nothing further in it than is expressed by <span class="greekheb">χωρισθέντες</span>; for the verb, in union with the feeling of tender love which pervades the whole passage, vividly describes the feeling of emptiness and solitude which by the separation came over the apostle—a feeling of solitude, such as befalls children when they are placed in a condition of orphanage.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἀφʼ ὑμῶν</span>] <span class="ital">away from you</span>. The apostle repeats the preposition <span class="greekheb">ἀπό</span>, instead of putting the simple genitive <span class="greekheb">ὑμῶν</span> after the participle, in order to give prominence to the idea of local severance, which was already expressed in <span class="greekheb">ἀπορφανισθέντες</span>, here once more specified <span class="ital">by itself</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">πρὸς καιρὸν ὥρας</span>] not <span class="ital">subito</span> (Balduin, Turretin), literally, for the space of an hour; but as an hour is relatively only a short space, generally “for the space of an instant,” <span class="ital">i.e. for a very short period</span>.[39] It is a more definite expression for the simple <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΡῸς ὭΡΑΝ</span></span></span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-5.htm" title="To whom we gave place by subjection, no, not for an hour; that the truth of the gospel might continue with you.">Galatians 2:5</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-8.htm" title="For though I made you sorry with a letter, I do not repent, though I did repent: for I perceive that the same letter has made you sorry, though it were but for a season.">2 Corinthians 7:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-15.htm" title="For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that you should receive him for ever;">Philemon 1:15</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-35.htm" title="He was a burning and a shining light: and you were willing for a season to rejoice in his light.">John 5:35</a>, or <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΡῸς ΚΑΙΡΌΝ</span></span></span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-5.htm" title="Defraud you not one the other, except it be with consent for a time, that you may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again, that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency.">1 Corinthians 7:5</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-13.htm" title="They on the rock are they, which, when they hear, receive the word with joy; and these have no root, which for a while believe, and in time of temptation fall away.">Luke 8:13</a>, and corresponds to the Latin <span class="ital">horae momentum</span>.
