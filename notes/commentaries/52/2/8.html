This is the way to win people. We should not only be faithful to our calling as Christians, but in our particular callings and relations. Our great gospel privilege is, that God has called us to his kingdom and glory. The great gospel duty is, that we walk worthy of God. We should live as becomes those called with such a high and holy calling.

It means to "long after, to have a strong affection for." The sense here is, that Paul was so strongly attached to them that he would have been willing to lay down his life for them.<p>We were willing to have imparted unto you - To have given or communicated; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-11.htm">Romans 1:11</a>.<p>Not the gospel of God only - To be willing to communicate the knowledge of the gospel was in itself a strong proof of love, even if it were attended with no self-denial or hazard in doing it. We evince a decided love for a man when we tell him of the way of salvation, and urge him to accept of it. We show strong interest for one who is in danger, when we tell him of a way of escape, or for one who is sick, when we tell him of a medicine that will restore him; but we manifest a much higher love when we tell a lost and ruined sinner of the way in which he may be saved. There is no method in which we can show so strong an interest in our fellow-men, and so much true benevolence for them, as to go to them and tell them of the way by which they may be rescued from everlasting ruin.<p>But also our own souls - Or rather "lives" -  &#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3c2;  psuchas; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-25.htm">Matthew 6:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-28.htm">Matthew 20:28</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/12-22.htm">Luke 12:22</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-13.htm">Luke 12:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-4.htm">Mark 3:4</a>. This does not mean that the apostle was willing to be damned, or to lose his soul in order to save them, but that if it had been necessary he would have been ready to lay down his life; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-16.htm">1 John 3:16</a>. "We ought to lay down our lives for the brethren;" compare notes, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-13.htm">John 15:13</a>. His object seems to be to assure them that he did not leave them from any want of love to them, or from the fear of being put to death. It was done from the strong conviction of duty. He appears to have left them because he could not longer remain without exposing others to danger, and without the certainty that there would be continued disturbances; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/17-9.htm">Acts 17:9-10</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8.

"even our own lives" (so the Greek for "souls" ought to be translated); as we showed in the sufferings we endured in giving you the Gospel (Ac 17:1-34). As a nursing mother is ready to impart not only her milk to them, but her life for them, so we not only imparted gladly the spiritual milk of the word to you, but risked our own lives for your spiritual nourishment, imitating Him who laid down His life for His friends, the greatest proof of love (Joh 15:13).<p>ye were&#8212;Greek, "ye were become," as having become our spiritual children.<p>dear&#8212;Greek, "dearly beloved."<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> A further account of their behaviour among them. The former verse showed their great gentleness, this their great love; expressed, first: In their affectionate desire of them; as the Latin phrase, <span class="ital">cupidissimus fui, </span> imports love to the person. And it was the desire of their salvation, first in their believing, and then perseverance and progress in faith. It was themselves, not their goods, they desired; as Paul elsewhere saith: <span class="ital">We seek not yours, but you.</span> Secondly, In the effect of it, which was imparting the gospel to them, whereby they might be saved; which is amplified by two things: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. That they did this willingly, not out of mere necessity, with a backward mind; the word is eudokoumen, we were well pleased to preach, and with complacence of mind. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. That they were willing to impart their souls to them; that is, to hazard their lives for them in preaching to them, as <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/16-1.htm" title="Then came he to Derbe and Lystra: and, behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timotheus, the son of a certain woman, which was a Jewess, and believed; but his father was a Greek:...">Acts 16:1-40</a></span>; the same word signifying both the soul and life, and he that dies for another gives his life to them.

Others understand the words only as an expression of their great affection to them; a man imparts his soul to the person whom he entirely loves, as <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-10.htm" title="And if you draw out your soul to the hungry, and satisfy the afflicted soul; then shall your light rise in obscurity, and your darkness be as the noon day:">Isaiah 58:10</a></span>; when a man gives relief to a person in want out of love and compassion, he imparts his soul in what he gives. So did they in the gospel thus preached.

Not of theirs but them; not of glory from them, nor a maintenance by them, but of their spiritual and eternal welfare; were as fond of them as a nursing mother is of her children, who, when absent from them but ever so little a while, longs to see them; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-17.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:17</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-1.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:1</a>, <p>we were willing: took the utmost pleasure, delight, and complacency: <p>to have imparted unto you, not the Gospel of God only; the sincere milk of the word, which they did freely, fully, and for their spiritual good and profit, without any regard to any advantage of their own: <p>but also our own souls, or "lives"; which is the highest expression and strongest proof of love that can be given; and respect is still had to the similitude of the nursing mother, who may be said to impart her blood, for such it her milk diversified, for the nourishment of her children: and such was the great concern of the apostles for the interest of Christ, the spread of the Gospel, and the good of souls, that their lives were not dear unto them, so that these ends might he answered: because ye were dear unto us; both because they were loved by God, redeemed by Christ, regenerated by the Spirit of Christ, and had the image of Christ stamped upon them; and also because that they were their spiritual children; and as children are dear to their parents, so were these to them, even to such a degree, as that, were there a necessity for it, they could freely have laid down their lives for them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{6}</span> So being affectionately desirous of you, we were willing to have imparted unto you, not the gospel of God only, but also our own souls, because ye were dear unto us.</span><p>(6) To consider the flock that is committed to him as more important than his own life.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-8.htm" title="So being affectionately desirous of you, we were willing to have imparted to you, not the gospel of God only, but also our own souls, because you were dear to us.">1 Thessalonians 2:8</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ὁμείρεσθαι</span>] occurs, besides LXX. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-21.htm" title="Which long for death, but it comes not; and dig for it more than for hid treasures;">Job 3:21</a>, and Symmachus, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/62-2.htm" title="He only is my rock and my salvation; he is my defense; I shall not be greatly moved.">Psalm 62:2</a> (yet even in these two places MSS. differ), only in the glossaries.

Theophylact derives it from <span class="greekheb">ὁμοῦ</span> and <span class="greekheb">εἴρειν</span>; and corresponding to this, Photius explains it by <span class="greekheb">ὁμοῦ ἡρμόσθαι</span>. Accordingly, <span class="greekheb">ὁμειρόμενοι ὑμῶν</span> would denote bound with you, attached to you. Fritzsche, <span class="ital">ad Marc.</span> p. 792 f., Schott, and others agree. But this is questionable—(1) Because the verb is here construed with the genitive, and not with the dative; (2) because there is no instance of a similar verb compounded with <span class="greekheb">ὁμοῦ</span> or <span class="greekheb">ὁμός</span>; see Winer, p. 92 [E. T. 125]. Now, as in Nicander (<span class="ital">Theriaca</span>, ver. 2:402) the simple form <span class="greekheb">μείρεσθαι</span> occurs in the sense of <span class="greekheb">ἱμείρεσθαι</span>, it can hardly be doubted that <span class="greekheb">μείρεσθαι</span> is the original root to which <span class="greekheb">ἱμείρεσθαι</span> and <span class="greekheb">ὁμείρεσθαι</span> (having the same meaning) are related, having a syllable prefixed for euphony. Compare the analogous forms of <span class="greekheb">κέλλω</span> and <span class="greekheb">ὀκέλλω</span>, <span class="greekheb">δύρομαι</span> and <span class="greekheb">ὀδύρομαι</span>, <span class="greekheb">φλέω</span> and <span class="greekheb">ὀφλέω</span>, <span class="greekheb">αὔω</span> and <span class="greekheb">ἰαύω</span>, and see Kühner, I. p. 27. Accordingly, as <span class="greekheb">ἱμείρεσθαι τινός</span> denotes primarily the yearning love, the yearning desire for union with an <span class="ital">absent</span> friend, and secondarily is, according to the testimony of Hesychius, synonymous with <span class="greekheb">ἐρᾶν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὁμειρόμενοι ὑμῶν</span> receives here the suitable meaning of <span class="ital">filled with love to you</span>.

(Erroneously Bengel: anima nostra cupiebat quasi <span class="ital">immeare</span> in animam vestram. Hofmann: In the word preached, which Paul and his companions imparted to the Thessalonians even to the exhaustion of their vital power, this as it were passed over to them, just as the vital power of the mother passes over to the child, whom she is not content with nourishing generally, but, from the longings of love to it, desires to nourish it by suckling.) From the compound verb <span class="greekheb">μεταδοῦναι</span> the idea of the simple verb <span class="greekheb">δοῦναι</span> is accordingly to be extracted (a zeugma; see Kühner, II. 606).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The thought contained in <span class="greekheb">ὡς</span> … <span class="greekheb">οὕτως</span> is accordingly: As a mother not only nourishes her new-born child with her milk, but also cherishes and shelters it, yea, is ready to sacrifice her life for its preservation, so has the apostle not merely nourished his spiritual child, the Thessalonian church, with the milk of the gospel, but has been also ready, in order to preserve it in the newly begun life, to sacrifice his own life.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The <span class="ital">inducement</span> to such a conduct was love, which the apostle, although he had already mentioned it, again definitely states in the words <span class="greekheb">διότι ἀγαπητοὶ ἡμῖν ἐγενήθητε</span>, <span class="ital">because ye were dear and valuable to us</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-8.htm" title="So being affectionately desirous of you, we were willing to have imparted to you, not the gospel of God only, but also our own souls, because you were dear to us.">1 Thessalonians 2:8</a>. <span class="greekheb">ὁμειρόμενοι</span> (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-21.htm" title="Which long for death, but it comes not; and dig for it more than for hid treasures;">Job 3:21</a>, LXX; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/62-2.htm" title="He only is my rock and my salvation; he is my defense; I shall not be greatly moved.">Psalm 62:2</a>, Symm.) = “yearning for, or, over”. <span class="greekheb">εὐδοκ</span>., for absence of augment <span class="ital">cf.</span> W.

The apostles were not merely <span class="ital">willing</span> (A.V.) to bestow themselves on the Thessalonians, they actually <span class="ital">did so</span>, and with the glad consent of a mother nourishing the babe from her own life. The same verb is rendered “thought-good” in ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-1.htm" title="Why when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good to be left at Athens alone;">1 Thessalonians 3:1</a>; and the corresponding noun is “good-pleasure” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/1-2.htm" title="Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.">2 Thessalonians 1:2</a> (see note).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>For “souls” we might read “lives” (<span class="ital">psyché</span> is never the soul in general, but the individual soul, the personality)—<span class="bld">our lives, our very selves</span>.

This is the true way to “impart the gospel of God,” to give our own heart and soul with it. For it is to impart the Gospel in the spirit in which it came from God, “Who spared not His own Son, but gave Him up for us all” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-32.htm" title="He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?">Romans 8:32</a>); and in the spirit of Christ, “Who gave Himself up for us” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-4.htm" title="Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father:">Galatians 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-20.htm" title="I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ lives in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.">Galatians 2:20</a>), Who “poured out His soul unto death” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-12.htm" title="Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he has poured out his soul to death: and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bore the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.">Isaiah 53:12</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">because ye were dear unto us</span>] More adequately, <span class="bld">ye became very dear</span> (R.

The thought is - As a nursing mother not only nourishes tier children, but is also ready to sacrifice her life for them; so the apostle not only nourished his spiritual children with the pure milk of the gospel, but was ready to sacrifice his own life for their spiritual maintenance; thus expressing in the strongest manner the womanly tenderness of the apostle toward his converts. <span class="cmt_word">Because ye were dear unto us.</span> <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Being affectionately desirous (&#x3bf;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;)<p>N.T.o.
