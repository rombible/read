The apostle here gives a reason why they were so concerned at parting with the Thessalonians, and were so desirous of seeing them again, and attempted it so often, cause they were their "hope"; not the foundation of it, which was Christ; nor the thing hoped for, which was eternal life; nor the ground of their hope, which was the blood, righteousness, and sacrifice of Christ; but they were persons whom they hoped well of, and of whom their hope was steadfast; as of their election of God, of their redemption by Christ, of their effectual calling, of their perseverance in faith and holiness, notwithstanding all reproach and persecution; and of meeting the Lord, and being together with him for ever: and they were also their "joy"; their conversion was a matter of joy to them, because of the glory of God, Father, Son, and Spirit, displayed therein; because of the abundant grace bestowed on these persons; and because that hereby the kingdom of Satan was weakened, and the kingdom of Christ enlarged and his churches increased and beautified; and their own ministry was blessed and confirmed, and their hearts and hands strengthened, and they encouraged to go on in it: and they continued to be their joy, inasmuch as they stood fast in the Lord, walked on in the truth, and had their conversations as became the Gospel of Christ; and they were persuaded would be their joy hereafter, at the second coming of Christ; when they should give up their account of them with joy, and not with grief: and it is added, <p>or crown of rejoicing; or of "glorying", or "boasting"; not that they gloried in them, for they gloried not in men, but in the Lord, in his righteousness, riches, wisdom, strength, and grace, in the person, blood, and cross of Christ; but they gloried of them, as trophies of divine grace, as a prey taken out of the hand of the mighty, and as lawful captives delivered from the power of Satan, and of darkness, and translated into the kingdom of Christ. The Alexandrian copy reads, as we render it, <p>crown of rejoicing: which is but a stronger phrase, to press the joy they had in their conversion and perseverance, in allusion to crowns wore at times of rejoicing, as at marriage feasts, and the like: hence we read (i) of the crowns of the bridegrooms, and of the brides, which were forbidden the use of in the war of Vespasian; the latter were made of gold, in the form of the city of Jerusalem, and from thence called golden cities (k); and the former, some say, were made of salt and sulphur, to put them in mind of the destruction of the Sodomites, for their unnatural lusts (l); others of a salt stone as clear as crystal, or of the stone Bdellium, painted in the colour of sulphur (m); and some were made of myrtles and roses, but in the war of Vespasian only those made of reeds were used (n); these crowns at weddings seem to be the "beautiful crowns" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-42.htm">Ezekiel 23:42</a> where the Septuagint use the same phrase as here, , "a crown of rejoicing", or "glorying": the Hebrew phrase , may be rendered "a crown of glory", as the phrase here is by the Vulgate Latin and Arabic versions; but does not mean the crown of glory, life, righteousness, and immortality, the apostle expected at the hands of Christ another day; nor that his being an instrument of the conversion of these persons was the ground of such an expectation, or was what entitled him to such a crown; since he knew that conversion work was owing to the powerful grace of God, and the crown of eternal life was his free gift; but that it would be an honour to him, and give him abundant joy and pleasure at the coming of Christ, to be encircled with such a number of souls he had been useful to, and who were his spiritual children; just as children's children are the crown of old men, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-6.htm">Proverbs 17:6</a> all this is put by way of question, which strongly affirms, <p>are not even ye; or "ye also", as well as others, as the Corinthians and Philippians; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-7.htm">2 Corinthians 1:7</a>. <p>In the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming? to judge the quick and dead, when both they and these should meet him, and stand before him with confidence, being clothed with his righteousness, and clad with robes of immortality and glory. <p>(i) Misna Sota. c. 9. sect. 14.

Are not even you in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming?">1 Thessalonians 2:19</a>. A reason not for <span class="greekheb">περισσοτέρως ἐσπουδάσαμεν τὸ πρόσωπον ὑμῶν ἰδεῖν</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-17.htm" title="But we, brothers, being taken from you for a short time in presence, not in heart, endeavored the more abundantly to see your face with great desire.">1 Thessalonians 2:17</a> (Hofmann), but of the twice formed resolution of the apostle to return to Thessalonica, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-18.htm" title="Why we would have come to you, even I Paul, once and again; but Satan hindered us.">1 Thessalonians 2:18</a>. This earnest desire to return is founded on the <span class="ital">esteem</span> of the apostle for his readers, on account of their promising Christian qualities. Grotius: Construi haec sic debent: <span class="greekheb">τίς γὰρ ἡμῶν ἐλπὶς</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἔμπροσθεν τοῦ κυρίου</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἢ οὐχὶ καὶ ὑμεῖς</span>; Certainly correct as regards the <span class="ital">matter</span> and the <span class="ital">thought</span>, as <span class="greekheb">ἔμπροσθεν</span> … <span class="greekheb">παρουσίᾳ</span> is to be referred to the preceding predicates, but ought not to be connected with <span class="greekheb">ἢ οὐχὶ καὶ ὑμεῖς</span>, as a second independent question. So also Olshausen, who renders it thus: “or do not ye also (as I myself and all the rest of the faithful) appear before Christ at His coming, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> without hesitation, without any doubt, ye will surely be also recognised by Christ as His, and therefore will not fall away again at any time from the faith.” But the <span class="ital">reason</span> and <span class="ital">justification</span> for this strange position of the words consist in this, that Paul originally conjoined the words <span class="greekheb">τίς γὰρ</span> … <span class="greekheb">ὑμεῖς</span> in thought, and originally wrote them by <span class="ital">themselves</span>; but then to present the predicates already put down as considered not in a worldly, but in a <span class="ital">specifically Christian</span> sense, he introduces, as a closer definition and explanation of the whole clause <span class="greekheb">τίς</span> … <span class="greekheb">ὑμεῖς</span>, the words <span class="greekheb">ἔμπροσθεν</span> … <span class="greekheb">παρουσίᾳ</span>. There is, accordingly, no need for the supposition of Laurent (<span class="ital">Neutestam. Studien</span>, Gotha 1866, p. 28 f.), that Paul only at a later period, after he had read through the whole Epistle once, placed these words in the margin, or ordered them to be inserted. Accordingly, the apostle says: <span class="ital">For who is our hope or joy or crown of rejoicing, or are not even ye this? before our Lord Jesus at His coming; i.e.</span>, if any one deserves to be called our hope, etc., ye deserve it. As the addition <span class="greekheb">ἔμπροσθεν κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. proves that the apostle thinks on the <span class="ital">judgment</span> connected with the coming of Christ.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Paul, however, calls the Thessalonians <span class="greekheb">ἐλπὶς ἡμῶν</span> (comp. Liv. xxviii. 39), not because he anticipates a <span class="ital">reward for himself</span> on account of the conversion of the Thessalonians effected by him (Estius, Fromond., Joachim Lange, Hofmann, and most critics), or at least a <span class="ital">remission of the punishment</span> for his early persecution of the Christian church (for the emphasis rests not on <span class="greekheb">ἡμῶν</span>, but on the predicates <span class="greekheb">ἐλπὶς κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.), but because he has the confident hope that the Thessalonians will not be put to shame at the trial to be expected at the advent, but will rather be found pure and blameless, as those who embraced the faith with eagerness, and heroically persevered in it in spite of all contentions.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἢ χαρά</span>] or <span class="ital">joy</span>, as by the conversion and Christian conduct of the Thessalonians the kingdom of God has been promoted.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἢ στέφανος καυχήσεως</span>] <span class="ital">or crown of glory</span> (comp. <span class="greekheb">עֲטֶרֶת תִּפְּאֶרֶת</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-12.htm" title="And I put a jewel on your forehead, and earrings in your ears, and a beautiful crown on your head.">Ezekiel 16:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-42.htm" title="And a voice of a multitude being at ease was with her: and with the men of the common sort were brought Sabeans from the wilderness, which put bracelets on their hands, and beautiful crowns on their heads.">Ezekiel 23:42</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-31.htm" title="The hoary head is a crown of glory, if it be found in the way of righteousness.">Proverbs 16:31</a>, and also the LXX.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-1.htm" title="Therefore, my brothers dearly beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand fast in the Lord, my dearly beloved.">Php 4:1</a>; Soph.

But just because <span class="greekheb">ἢ ὑμεῖς</span> imports too much, why should not the apostle have designed to put <span class="greekheb">ἢ οὐχὶ καὶ ὑμεῖς</span> from the very first!<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐν τῇ αὐτοῦ παρουσίᾳ</span>] at his coming (return) to establish the Messianic kingdom (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-13.htm" title="To the end he may establish your hearts blameless in holiness before God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints.">1 Thessalonians 3:13</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-15.htm" title="For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain to the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep.">1 Thessalonians 4:15</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-23.htm" title="And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.">1 Thessalonians 5:23</a>, et al.; Usteri, Lehrbegr. p. 341 ff.); an epexegesis to <span class="greekheb">ἔμπροσθεν τοῦ κυρίου ἡμῶν Ἰησοῦ</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-19.htm" title="For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing?

Of course we wanted to come back, for (<span class="greekheb">γάρ</span>), etc. The touch of fine exaggeration which follows is true to the situation.

The metaphor occurs often in the inscriptions (<span class="ital">cf.</span> also Pirke Aboth, iv. 9). Paul coveted no higher distinction at the arrival of the Lord than the glory of having won over the Thessalonian church. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> Crashaw’s lines to St. Teresa in heaven:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“Thou shalt look round about, and see Thousands of crown’d souls throng to be Themselves thy crown”.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">Παρουσία</span> = royal visit (<span class="ital">cf.</span> Wilcken’s <span class="ital">Griech.

This is the first time the term is used by Paul, but it was evidently familiar to the readers.

From the three writings we lean nearly all that he has to teach on this mysterious subject.

The apostle calls the Thessalonians his "hope," not because he anticipates any reward from their conversion, or because their conversion would counterbalance his former persecution of the Christians, but because he hoped to meet them in glory; he calls them his "joy," because he would rejoice with them in their final salvation; and he calls them his "crown of rejoicing," because he regards them as trophies of the victory of the gospel which he preached. Similarly he calls the Philippians "his joy and crown" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-1.htm">Philippians 4:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Are not even ye</span>; or rather, <span class="accented">are not ye also?</span> - ye as well as other Christians? <span class="cmt_word">In the presence of</span> - before - <span class="cmt_word">our Lord Jesus</span> <span class="cmt_word">Christ at his coming</span>; at the restoration of his Messianic kingdom. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Hope<p>Used of the object of hope, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-5.htm">Colossians 1:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-1.htm">1 Timothy 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-18.htm">Hebrews 6:18</a>.<p>Joy - crown (&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#768;  - &#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;)<p>Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-1.htm">Philippians 4:1</a>.
