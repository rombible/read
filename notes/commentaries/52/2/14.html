The words of men are frail and perishing, like themselves, and sometimes false, foolish, and fickle; but God's word is holy, wise, just, and faithful. Let us receive and regard it accordingly. The word wrought in them, to make them examples to others in faith and good works, and in patience under sufferings, and in trials for the sake of the gospel. Murder and persecution are hateful to God, and no zeal for any thing in religion can excuse it. Nothing tends more to any person or people's filling up the measure of their sins, than opposing the gospel, and hindering the salvation of souls. The pure gospel of Christ is abhorred by many, and the faithful preaching of it is hindered in many ways. But those who forbid the preaching it to sinners, to men dead in sin, do not by this please God. Those have cruel hearts, and are enemies to the glory of God, and to the salvation of his people, who deny them the Bible.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For ye, brethren, became followers of the churches of God which in Judea are in Christ Jesus - Which are united to the Lord Jesus, or which are founded on his truth: that is, which are true churches. Of those churches they became "imitators" - &#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768;  mime&#772;tai - to wit, in their sufferings. This does not mean that they were founded on the same model; or that they professed to be the followers of those churches, but that they had been treated in the same way, and thus were like them. They had been persecuted in the same manner, and by the same people - the Jews; and they had borne their persecutions with the same spirit. The object of this is to comfort and encourage them, by showing them that others had been treated in the same manner, and that it was to be expected that a true church would be persecuted by the Jews. They ought not, therefore, to consider it as any evidence that they were not a true church that they had been persecuted by those who claimed to be the people of God, and who made extraordinary pretensions to piety.<p>For ye also have suffered like things of your own countrymen - Literally, "of those who are of your fellow-tribe, or fellowclansmen " -  &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;  sumphuleto&#772;n. The Greek word means "one of the same tribe," and then a fellow-citizen, or fellowcountryman. It is not elsewhere used in the New Testament. The particular reference here seems not to be to the pagan who were the agents or actors in the scenes of tumult and persecutions, but to the Jews by whom they were led on, or who were the prime movers in the persecutions which they had endured. It is necessary to suppose that they were principally Jews who were the cause of the persecution which had been excited against them, in order to make the parallelism between the church there and the churches in Palestine exact. At the same time there was a propriety in saying that, though the parallelism was exact, it was by the "hands of their own countrymen" that it was done; that is, they were the visible agents or actors by whom it was done - the instruments in the hands of others.<p>In Palestine. the Jews persecuted the churches directly; out of Palestine, they did it by means of others. They were the real authors of it, as they were in Judea, but they usually accomplished it by producing an excitement among the pagan, and by the plea that the apostles were making war on civil institutions. This was the case in Thessalonica. "The Jews which believed not, moved with envy, set all the city on an uproar." "They drew Jason and certain brethren unto the rulers of the city, crying, 'Those that have turned the world up side down have come hither also;'" <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/17-5.htm">Acts 17:5-6</a>. The same thing occurred a short time after at Berea. "When the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was preached of Paul at Berea, they came thither also and stirred up the people;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-13.htm">Acts 17:13</a>; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-2.htm">Acts 14:2</a>. "The unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles, and made their minds evil-affected against the brethren." "The Epistle, therefore, represents the case accurately as the history states it. It was the Jews always who set on foot the persecutions against the apostles and their followers;" Paley, Hor. Paul. in loc. It was, therefore, strictly true, as the apostle here states it:<p>(1) that they were subjected to the same treatment from the Jews as the churches in Judea were, since they were the authors of the excitement against them; and,<p>(2) that it was carried on, as the apostle states, "by their own countrymen;" that is, that they were the agents or instruments by which it was done. This kind of undesigned coincidence between the Epistle and the history in the Acts of the Apostles, is one of the arguments from which Paley (Hor. Paul.) infers the genuineness of both.<p>As they have of the Jews - Directly. In Palestine there were no others but Jews who could be excited against Christians, and they were obliged to appear as the persecutors themselves. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14. followers&#8212;Greek, "imitators." Divine working is most of all seen and felt in affliction.<p>in Judea&#8212;The churches of Judea were naturally the patterns to other churches, as having been the first founded, and that on the very scene of Christ's own ministry. Reference to them is specially appropriate here, as the Thessalonians, with Paul and Silas, had experienced from Jews in their city persecutions (Ac 17:5-9) similar to those which "the churches in Judea" experienced from Jews in that country.<p>in Christ Jesus&#8212;not merely "in God"; for the synagogues of the Jews (one of which the Thessalonians were familiar with, Ac 17:1) were also in God. But the Christian churches alone were not only in God, as the Jews in contrast to the Thessalonian idolaters were, but also in Christ, which the Jews were not.<p>of your own countrymen&#8212;including primarily the Jews settled at Thessalonica, from whom the persecution originated, and also the Gentiles there, instigated by the Jews; thus, "fellow countrymen" (the Greek term, according to Herodian, implies, not the enduring relation of fellow citizenship, but sameness of country for the time being), including naturalized Jews and native Thessalonians, stand in contrast to the pure "Jews" in Judea (Mt 10:36). It is an undesigned coincidence, that Paul at this time was suffering persecutions of the Jews at Corinth, whence he writes (Ac 18:5, 6, 12); naturally his letter would the more vividly dwell on Jewish bitterness against Christians.<p>even as they&#8212;(Heb 10:32-34). There was a likeness in respect to the nation from which both suffered, namely, Jews, and those their own countrymen; in the cause for which, and in the evils which, they suffered, and also in the steadfast manner in which they suffered them. Such sameness of fruits, afflictions, and experimental characteristics of believers, in all places and at all times, is a subsidiary evidence of the truth of the Gospel.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This proves the assertion of the foregoing verse, as the illative <span class="ital">for</span> doth show.

That Paul compares the conduct of the Thessalonians with that of the Palestinian churches is, according to Calvin, whom Calixtus follows, designed to remove the <span class="ital">objection</span> which might easily arise to his readers. As the Jews were the only worshippers of the true God outside of Christianity, so the attack on Christianity by the Jews might give rise to a doubt whether it were actually the true religion. For the removal of this doubt, the apostle, in the first place, shows that the same fate which had at an earlier period befallen the Palestinian churches had happened to the Thessalonians; and then, that the Jews were the hardened enemies of God and of all sound doctrine. But evidently such a design of the apostle is indicated by nothing, and its supposition is entirely superfluous, as every Christian must with admiration recognise the heroism of Christian resistance to persecution with which the Palestinian churches had distinguished themselves. Accordingly, it was a great commendation of the Thessalonians if the same heroic Christian stedfastness could be predicated of <span class="ital">them</span>. This holds good against the much more arbitrary and visionary opinion of Hofmann, that Paul, by the mention of the Palestinian churches, and the expression concerning the Jews therewith connected, designed to meet the erroneous notion or representation of what happened to the readers. As the conversion of the Thessalonians might in an intelligible manner appear in the eyes of their countrymen as a capture of them in the net of a Jewish doctrine, and hence on that side the reproach might be raised that, on account of this strange matter, they had become hostile to their own people; so it was entirely in keeping to show that the apostolic doctrine was anything but an affair of the Jewish people, that, on the contrary, the Jews were its bitterest enemies! Grotius would understand the present participle <span class="greekheb">τῶν σὐσῶν</span> in the sense of the participle of the preterite; whilst, appealing to <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-4.htm" title="Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word.">Acts 8:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-19.htm" title="Now they which were scattered abroad on the persecution that arose about Stephen traveled as far as Phenice, and Cyprus, and Antioch, preaching the word to none but to the Jews only.">Acts 11:19</a>, he thinks that the Palestinian churches had by persecutions ceased to exist as such, only a few members remaining. But neither do the Acts justify such an opinion, nor is it in accordance with the words of Paul in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-22.htm" title="And was unknown by face to the churches of Judaea which were in Christ:">Galatians 1:22</a>. The further supposition which Grotius adds is strange and unhistorical, that some Christians expelled from Palestine had betaken themselves to Thessalonica, and that to them mainly a reference in our passage is made.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ</span>] Oecumenius: <span class="greekheb">εὐφυῶς διεῖλεν</span>· <span class="greekheb">ἐπειδὴ γὰρ καὶ αἱ συναγωγαὶ τῶν Ἰουδαίων ἐν Θεῷ εἶναι δοκοῦσι</span>, <span class="greekheb">τὰς τῶν πιστῶν ἐκκλησίας καὶ ἐν τῷ Θεῷ καὶ ἐν τῷ υἱῷ αὐτοῦ λέγει εἶναι</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span>] for.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τὰ αὐτά</span>] <span class="ital">the like things</span>, denotes the general similarity of the sufferings endured.

Comp. Lobeck, <span class="ital">ad Phryn.</span> p. 172, 471. By <span class="greekheb">συμφυλέται</span> we are naturally not to understand the Jews (Cornelius a Lapide, Hammond, Joachim Lange); for that the expression is best suited to them, as Braun (with Wolf) thinks, whilst possibly Jews of a particular tribe (perhaps of the tribe of Juda or Benjamin) were resident in Thessalonica, only merits to be mentioned on account of its curiosity. Also <span class="greekheb">συμφυλέται</span> is not, with Calvin, Piscator, Bengel, and others, to be understood both of Jews and Gentiles, but <span class="ital">can</span> only be understood of Gentiles. To this we are forced—(1) by the sharp contrast of <span class="greekheb">συμφυλετῶν</span> and <span class="greekheb">Ἰουδαίων</span>, which must be considered as excluding each other; (2) by the addition of <span class="greekheb">ἰδιών</span> to <span class="greekheb">συμφυλετῶν</span>, as the great majority of the Thessalonian church consisted of Gentiles; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-9.htm" title="For they themselves show of us what manner of entering in we had to you, and how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God;">1 Thessalonians 1:9</a>. However, although Paul in the expression <span class="greekheb">συμφυλετῶν</span> speaks <span class="ital">only</span> of Gentiles as persecutors, yet the strong invective against the Jews which immediately follows (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_thessalonians/2-15.htm" title="Who both killed the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets, and have persecuted us; and they please not God, and are contrary to all men:...">1 Thessalonians 2:15-16</a>) constrains us to assume that the apostle in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-14.htm" title="For you, brothers, became followers of the churches of God which in Judaea are in Christ Jesus: for you also have suffered like things of your own countrymen, even as they have of the Jews:">1 Thessalonians 2:14</a> had more <span class="ital">in his mind</span> than he expressed <span class="ital">in words</span>. As we learn from the Acts, it was, indeed, the heathen magistrates by whose authority the persecutions against the Christian church at Thessalonica proceeded, but the proper originators and instigators were <span class="ital">here also</span> the Jews; only they could not excite the persecution of the Christians directly, as the Jews in Palestine, but, hemmed in by the existing laws, could only do so indirectly, namely, by stirring up the heathen mob. This circumstance, united with the repeated experience of the inveterate spirit of opposition of the Jews, which Paul had in Asia at a period directly preceding this Epistle (perhaps also shortly before its composition at Corinth), is the natural and easily psychologically explanatory occasion of the polemic in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_thessalonians/2-15.htm" title="Who both killed the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets, and have persecuted us; and they please not God, and are contrary to all men:...">1 Thessalonians 2:15-16</a>. Erroneously Olshausen gives the reason; he thinks it added in order to turn the attention of the Christians in Thessalonica to the intrigues of those men with whom the Judaizing Christians stood on a level, as it was to be foreseen that they would not leave this church also undisturbed; against which view de Wette correctly remarks, that there is no trace of such a warning, and that the Thessalonians did not require it, as they had learned sufficiently to know the enmity of the Jews against the gospel.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καθώς</span>] Instead of this, properly <span class="greekheb">ἅ</span> or <span class="greekheb">ἅπερ</span> should have been put, corresponding to <span class="greekheb">τὰ αὐτά</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-30.htm" title="Having the same conflict which you saw in me, and now hear to be in me.">Php 1:30</a>, <span class="greekheb">τὸν αὐτὸν</span> … <span class="greekheb">οἷον</span>).

This latter phrase—an expression characteristic of St Paul and frequent in subsequent Epistles—signifies “in union and communion with Him, incorporated with Him who is the Head” of His Body the Church (Ellicott). It distinguishes the Christian from other Judæan communities which also claimed to be “Churches (assemblies) of God.” Comp. note on “Church … in God the Father,” &c., ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-1.htm" title="Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, to the church of the Thessalonians which is in God the Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace be to you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.">1 Thessalonians 1:1</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Observe the order <span class="ital">Christ Jesus</span>, a combination almost confined to St Paul, and which he employs when he thinks of Him in His actual Person and official character, as the present Head and Life of His people on earth; whereas <span class="ital">Jesus Christ</span> is the historical order, and points to His earthly course and exaltation to Messiahship (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-36.htm" title="Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God has made the same Jesus, whom you have crucified, both Lord and Christ.">Acts 2:36</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“Church of God” is an O.T. expression, found in the Greek rendering of <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-1.htm" title="On that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of the people; and therein was found written, that the Ammonite and the Moabite should not come into the congregation of God for ever;">Nehemiah 13:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/23-1.htm" title="He that is wounded in the stones, or has his privy member cut off, shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD....">Deuteronomy 23:1-3</a> (church of the Lord: <span class="ital">congregation</span>, A.V.); it denotes that the Church <span class="ital">belongs to God</span>, while it suggests, according to the derivation of <span class="ital">ek-klesia</span>, that its members are <span class="ital">called out</span> (of the world) <span class="ital">by God</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-12.htm" title="That you would walk worthy of God, who has called you to his kingdom and glory.">1 Thessalonians 2:12</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-22.htm" title="And was unknown by face to the churches of Judaea which were in Christ:">Galatians 1:22</a> the Apostle writes, more simply, “the Churches of Judæa which are in Christ.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This reference to the Home Churches creates a link between far-off Thessalonica and Judæa.

The Apostle tells them that it was the same with the primitive Churches in Judæa—that, indeed, the murder of the Lord Jesus and of the old prophets, and the expulsion of the apostles, were due to feelings precisely similar to those aroused in their own city against themselves. This was a proof that they were in the true succession. Christ had said, “A man’s foes shall be they of his own household.” Such comfort has often to be given to young missionary churches.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But the Apostle has now to add words of awful severity respecting those whom his readers knew to be the prime instigators of persecution, both against themselves and him—<span class="ital">the Jews</span>:—<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-14.htm" title="For you, brothers, became followers of the churches of God which in Judaea are in Christ Jesus: for you also have suffered like things of your own countrymen, even as they have of the Jews:">1 Thessalonians 2:14</a>. <span class="greekheb">Γὰρ</span>, <span class="ital">for</span>) Divine <span class="ital">working</span> is most of all seen and felt in affliction.—<span class="greekheb">ἐν τῇ Ἰονδαίᾳ</span>, <span class="ital">in Judea</span>) The Jewish churches were distinguished examples to all the others.—<span class="greekheb">τὰ αὐτὰ</span>, <span class="ital">the same things</span>) So, <span class="greekheb">αὐτὸν</span>, <span class="ital">the same</span> [conflict], <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-30.htm" title="Having the same conflict which you saw in me, and now hear to be in me.">Php 1:30</a>.
