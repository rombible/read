The original expression, however, <span class="greekheb">ου κενη γεγονεν</span>, is rendered by Dr. Waterland, <span class="ital">was not vain; </span>and by Dr. Macknight, <span class="ital">was not false, </span>or <span class="ital">destitute of truth, </span>judging the apostle’s meaning to be, “that his entrance among the Thessalonians was not the entrance of a deceiver, who, with a view to draw money from his hearers, or to acquire power, or to live in pleasure among them, told them stories which he himself knew to be false. To this interpretation, the reason assigned in the following verse agrees: his sufferings for the gospel being the strongest proof that he himself believed it; whereas, of his not having preached <span class="ital">in vain </span>to the Thessalonians his sufferings were no proof. Besides, if the apostle had meant to say that his <span class="ital">entrance was not in vain, </span>the expression would have been <span class="greekheb">εις κενον</span>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-16.htm" title="Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither labored in vain.">Php 2:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-5.htm" title="For this cause, when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know your faith, lest by some means the tempter have tempted you, and our labor be in vain.">1 Thessalonians 3:5</a>.” <span class="ital">But after we had suffered </span>— In several places; <span class="ital">and were shamefully entreated at Philippi </span>— Being there stripped and scourged by the common beadle, and thrust into prison, where our feet were made fast in the stocks.

Suffering in a good cause should sharpen holy resolution. The gospel of Christ at first met with much opposition; and it was preached with contention, with striving in preaching, and against opposition. And as the matter of the apostle's exhortation was true and pure, the manner of his speaking was without guile. The gospel of Christ is designed for mortifying corrupt affections, and that men may be brought under the power of faith. This is the great motive to sincerity, to consider that God not only sees all we do, but knows our thoughts afar off, and searches the heart. And it is from this God who trieth our hearts, that we must receive our reward. The evidences of the apostle's sincerity were, that he avoided flattery and covetousness. He avoided ambition and vain-glory.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For yourselves, brethren, know our entrance in unto you - notes, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-9.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:9</a>. Paul appeals to themselves for proof that they had not come among them as impostors. They had had a full opportunity to see them, and to know what influenced them. Paul frequently appeals to his own life, and to what they, among whom he labored, knew of it, as a full refutation of the slanderous accusations of his enemies; compare notes, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-10.htm">1 Corinthians 4:10-16</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-19.htm">1 Corinthians 9:19-27</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-3.htm">2 Corinthians 6:3-10</a>.

The apostle having observed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-9.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:9</a> that those persons to whom the report of the Gospel being preached at Thessalonica, and the success of it there was made, showed everywhere both what manner of entrance he and his fellow ministers had in that place, and the conversion of many souls there; he enlarges upon the latter, and here reassumes the former, and appeals to the Thessalonians themselves, who must know full well, and better than others, what an entrance it was; and which is to be understood not merely of a corporeal entrance into their city and synagogue, but of their coming among them, by the preaching of the Gospel, as the ministers of the word and ambassadors of Christ: <p>that it was not in vain; it was not a vain show with outward pomp and splendour, as the public entrances of ambassadors into cities usually are; but with great meanness, poverty, reproach, and persecution, having been lately beaten and ill used at Philippi; nor was it with great swelling words of vanity, with the enticing words of man's wisdom, to tickle the ear, please the fancy, and work upon the passions of natural men, in which manner the false teachers came: but the apostle came not with deceit and guile, with flattering words or a cloak of covetousness, or with a view to vain glory and worldly advantage; nor was the message they came with, from the King of kings, a vain, light, empty, and trifling one; but solid and substantial, and of the greatest importance; the doctrine they taught was not comparable to chaff and wind; it was not corrupt philosophy and vain deceit, the traditions and commandments of men, but sound doctrine, the wholesome words of our Lord Jesus Christ: nor was it fruitless and without effect; the word did not return void and empty; but was powerful and efficacious to the conversion of many souls. Christ was with them both to assist them in their ministry, and to bless it to the salvation of men; nor was their coming to Thessalonica an human scheme, a rash enterprise, engaged in on their own heads, on a slight and empty foundation; but upon good and solid grounds, by divine direction and counsel; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-9.htm">Acts 16:9</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For <span class="cverse3">{1}</span> yourselves, brethren, know our entrance in unto you, that it was not in vain:</span><p>(1) That which he mentioned before briefly concerning his apostleship, he handles now more at large, and to that end and purpose which we spoke of.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-1.htm" title="For yourselves, brothers, know our entrance in to you, that it was not in vain:">1 Thessalonians 2:1</a> is referred by Grotius to a thought to be supplied after <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-10.htm" title="And to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, even Jesus, which delivered us from the wrath to come.">1 Thessalonians 1:10</a> : Merito illam spem vitae aeternae retinetis.

The <span class="ital">relation</span> of this reference is as follows: in chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-1.htm" title="For yourselves, brothers, know our entrance in to you, that it was not in vain:">1 Thessalonians 2:1</a> the apostle refers to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-9.htm" title="For they themselves show of us what manner of entering in we had to you, and how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God;">1 Thessalonians 1:9</a>, in order to develope the thought expressed there—which certainly was already contained in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_thessalonians/1-5.htm" title="For our gospel came not to you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance; as you know what manner of men we were among you for your sake....">1 Thessalonians 1:5-6</a>—by an appeal to the consciousness of the readers. But the thought expressed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-9.htm" title="For they themselves show of us what manner of entering in we had to you, and how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God;">1 Thessalonians 1:9</a> was twofold—(1) a statement concerning Paul and his assistants, namely, with what energy they preached the gospel at Thessalonica (<span class="greekheb">ὁποίαν εἴσοδον ἔσχομεν πρὸς ὑμᾶς</span>); and (2) a statement concerning the Thessalonians, namely, with what eagerness they received the gospel (<span class="greekheb">καὶ πῶς κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.). Both circumstances the apostle further developes in chap. 2.: first, and most circumstantially, the manner in which he and his assistants appeared in Thessalonica (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_thessalonians/2-1.htm" title="For yourselves, brothers, know our entrance in to you, that it was not in vain:...">1 Thessalonians 2:1-12</a>); and, secondly, the corresponding conduct of his readers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_thessalonians/2-13.htm" title="For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when you received the word of God which you heard of us, you received it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectually works also in you that believe....">1 Thessalonians 2:13-16</a>). But the description of himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_thessalonians/2-1.htm" title="For yourselves, brothers, know our entrance in to you, that it was not in vain:...">1 Thessalonians 2:1-12</a>) was not <span class="ital">occasioned</span> by the <span class="ital">calumniations</span> of the apostle, and a <span class="ital">diminution of confidence</span> in him occasioned thereby (Benson, Ritschl, <span class="ital">Hall. A. Lit. Z.</span> 1847, No. 125; Auberlen); also, not so much by the heartfelt gratitude for the great blessings which God had conferred on his ministry at Thessalonica, as by the definite design of <span class="ital">strengthening and confirming</span>, in the way of life on which they had entered, the Christian church at Thessalonica,—which, notwithstanding their exemplary faith, yet consisted only of novices,—by a vivid representation of the circumstances of their conversion. How entirely appropriate was the courageous, unselfish, self-sacrificing, and unwearied preaching of the apostle to exhibit the high value of <span class="ital">the gospel itself</span>, seeing it was capable of inspiring such a conduct as Paul and his companions had exhibited!<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">γάρ</span>] <span class="ital">yea</span>, or <span class="ital">indeed</span>. See Hartung, <span class="ital">Partikellehre</span>, I. p. 463 ff.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The construction: <span class="greekheb">οἴδατε τὴν εἴσοδον</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span>—where <span class="ital">we</span>, according to our idiom, would expect <span class="greekheb">οἴδατε</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὅτι ἡ εἴσοδος κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.—is not only, as Schott and others say, “not unknown” to classical writers, but is a <span class="ital">regular</span> construction among the Greeks. See Bernhardy, <span class="ital">Syntax</span>, p. 466.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἡ εἴσοδος ἡ πρὸς ὑμᾶς</span>] denotes here nothing more than <span class="ital">our entrance among you</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">κενός</span>] is the opposite of <span class="greekheb">πλήρης</span>, and denotes empty, void of contents, null.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">οὐ κενὴ γέγονεν</span>] Grotius (whom Hammond follows) translates this by <span class="ital">mendax, fallax</span> (<span class="greekheb">שָׁוְא</span>), and gives the sense: non decepturi ad vos venimus. But although <span class="greekheb">κενὸς</span> often forms the contrast to <span class="greekheb">ἀληθὴς</span> (see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-6.htm" title="Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things comes the wrath of God on the children of disobedience.">Ephesians 5:6</a>), yet it obtains only thereby the meaning falsus, never the meaning fallax; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-2.htm" title="But even after that we had suffered before, and were shamefully entreated, as you know, at Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak to you the gospel of God with much contention.">1 Thessalonians 2:2</a> would not suit to the meaning fallax, because then the idea of uprightness would be expected as a contrast. Oecumenius finds in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_thessalonians/2-1.htm" title="For yourselves, brothers, know our entrance in to you, that it was not in vain:...">1 Thessalonians 2:1-2</a> the contrast of truth and falsehood: <span class="greekheb">οὐ κενὴ γέγονεν</span>· <span class="greekheb">τουτέστιν οὐ ματαία οὐ μῦθοι γὰρ ψευδεῖς καὶ λῆροι τὰ ἡμέτερα κηρύγματα</span>. But he obtains this meaning only by incorrectly laying the chief stress in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-2.htm" title="But even after that we had suffered before, and were shamefully entreated, as you know, at Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak to you the gospel of God with much contention.">1 Thessalonians 2:2</a> on <span class="greekheb">τὸ εὐαγγέλιον τοῦ Θεοῦ</span> (<span class="greekheb">οὐδὲ ἡμεῖς ἀνθρώπινόν τι ἐκηρύξαμεν εἰς ὑμᾶς ἀλλὰ Θεοῦ λόγους</span>). Similarly to Grotius, but equally erroneously, Koppe (veni ad vos eo consilio et studio, ut vobis prodessem, non ut otiose inter vos viverem) and Rosenmüller (vani honoris vel opum acquirendarum studio) refer <span class="greekheb">οὐ κενὴ γέγονεν</span> to the design of the apostle, interpretations which are rendered impossible by the perfect <span class="greekheb">γέγονεν</span>. With a more correct appreciation of <span class="greekheb">γέγονεν</span>, Estius, Piscator, Vorstius, Turretin, Flatt, and others give the meaning inutilis, fructu carens, appealing to the Hebrew <span class="greekheb">רִיק</span>. This meaning is in itself not untenable, but it becomes so in our passage by the contrast in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-2.htm" title="But even after that we had suffered before, and were shamefully entreated, as you know, at Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak to you the gospel of God with much contention.">1 Thessalonians 2:2</a>; for <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-2.htm" title="But even after that we had suffered before, and were shamefully entreated, as you know, at Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak to you the gospel of God with much contention.">1 Thessalonians 2:2</a> does not speak of the result or effect of the apostle’s preaching at Thessalonica, but of the character of that preaching itself. For the sake of this contrast, therefore, <span class="greekheb">οὐ κενή</span> is equivalent to <span class="greekheb">δυνατή</span>, <span class="greekheb">δεινή</span> (Chrys.: <span class="greekheb">οὐκ ἀνθρωπίνη οὐδὲ ἡ τυχοῦσα</span>), and the meaning is: the apostle’s <span class="greekheb">εἴσοδος</span>, entrance, among the Thessalonians was not weak, powerless, but mighty and energetic. Pelt, Schott, Olshausen, de Wette, and Bloomfield erroneously unite with this idea of <span class="greekheb">οὐ κενὴ</span> the idea of the success of the apostle’s <span class="greekheb">εἴσοδος</span>, which is first spoken of in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-13.htm" title="For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when you received the word of God which you heard of us, you received it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectually works also in you that believe.">1 Thessalonians 2:13</a> ff.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_thessalonians/2-1.htm" title="For yourselves, brothers, know our entrance in to you, that it was not in vain:...">1 Thessalonians 2:1-12</a>.

The ministry of Paul and his colleagues at Thessalonica had been unmistakably genuine, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-1.htm" title="For yourselves, brothers, know our entrance in to you, that it was not in vain:">1 Thessalonians 2:1</a>.

Four words resume the whole: <span class="ital">courage, purity, love, fidelity</span>. Here is a mirror for ministers of Christ, and an ideal for all His servants. The service of Christ called into exercise in Paul and his companions the highest and finest qualities of mainly character. And this is still the case, especially on missionary fields of labour, where similar dangers are encountered and the same powers of leadership required.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This section is of the nature of a <span class="ital">self-defence</span>, called forth (see <span class="ital">Introd</span>. pp. 23, 24) by the calumnies of St Paul’s enemies at Thessalonica.
