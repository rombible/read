The following exhortation shows that it was a matter of each man’s free will whether he would sustain his character as a “child of light” or not.<p><span class= "bld">Children of light.</span>—The expression is an enthusiastic Hebrew poetical turn for intimate vital connection with anything; thus, <span class= "ital">e.g., </span>“children of this world” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-8.htm" title="And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely: for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light.">Luke 16:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/20-34.htm" title="And Jesus answering said to them, The children of this world marry, and are given in marriage:">Luke 20:34</a>) = “mere products of this age,” with a family likeness for other worldly people; “the son of peace” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-6.htm" title="And if the son of peace be there, your peace shall rest on it: if not, it shall turn to you again.">Luke 10:6</a>)=a person with whom peace has a natural affinity, to whom the “peace” pronounced will cleave naturally. So “children of the light” are persons to whom darkness is an alien thing, whose natures have a kinship, an intuitive responsiveness for whatever may be called “light.” To such persons the “light,” the “day,” can never come as an unwelcome, startling apparition.<p><span class= "bld">We.</span>—Notice St. Paul’s courtesy again: he suddenly includes himself in his exhortation.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_thessalonians/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:1-5 It is needless or useless to ask about the particular time of Christ's coming. Christ did not reveal this to the apostles. There are times and seasons for us to work in, and these are our duty and interest to know and observe; but as to the time when we must give up our account, we know it not, nor is it needful that we should. The coming of Christ will be a great surprise to men. Our Lord himself said so. As the hour of death is the same to each person that the judgment will be to mankind in general, so the same remarks answer for both. Christ's coming will be terrible to the ungodly. Their destruction will overtake them while they dream of happiness, and please themselves with vain amusements. There will be no means to escape the terror or the punishment of that day. This day will be a happy day to the righteous. They are not in darkness; they are the children of the light. It is the happy condition of all true Christians. But how many are speaking peace and safety to themselves, over whose heads utter destruction is hovering! Let us endeavour to awaken ourselves and each other, and guard against our spiritual enemies.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_thessalonians/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Ye are all the children of light - All who are Christians. The phrase" children of light" is a Hebraism, meaning that they were the enlightened children of God.<p>And the children of the day - Who live as if light always shone round about them. The meaning is, that in reference to the coming of the Lord they are as people would be in reference to the coming of a thief, if there were no night and no necessity of slumber. They would always be wakeful and active, and it would be impossible to come upon them by surprise. Christians are always to be wakeful and vigilant; they are so to expect the coming of the Redeemer, that he will not find them off their guard, and will not come upon them by surprise. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_thessalonians/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5.

St John employs it still more frequently; in his Gospel, Christ applies it with emphasis to His Person as well as to His doctrine: “<span class="ital">I</span> am the light of the world” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-49.htm" title="Nathanael answered and said to him, Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the King of Israel.">John 1:49</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-12.htm" title="Then spoke Jesus again to them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that follows me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.">John 8:12</a>), &c.

These two meanings are united in St Paul’s conception. (3) The thought of <span class="ital">mental enlightenment</span> also accompanies the figure (see e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/1-17.htm" title="That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him:...">Ephesians 1:17-18</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“Day” is here not a mere synonym for “light” in general; it takes up again the “day of the Lord” of <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-2.htm" title="For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so comes as a thief in the night.">1 Thessalonians 5:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-4.htm" title="But you, brothers, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief.">1 Thessalonians 5:4</a></span>. Now receiving the light of Christ’s truth and assimilated to it, the sons of light will be ready for “that day.” Christ’s advent will be to them like sunrise after long twilight. It is their birthday, the time of their full redemption and revelation. “The day of the Lord” claims them for its own,—“sons of day,” being “sons of God” and “the resurrection” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/20-34.htm" title="And Jesus answering said to them, The children of this world marry, and are given in marriage:...">Luke 20:34-36</a>).
