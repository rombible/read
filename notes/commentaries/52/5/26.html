If so, the “holy kiss” had hardly become the fixed Church ceremony which it afterwards was, for the practice (according to the <span class= "ital">Apostolicqal Constitutions</span>) was for the Church members to pass the kiss from one to another, men kissing men, and women kissing women, not for all the people to be kissed in turn by the priest. This kiss, however, is no doubt intended by St. Paul to be given at a solemn assembly of the Church, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>at the Holy Communion, which was the only fixed meeting of the Primitive Church. In the time of St. Cyril of Jerusalem, the kiss was given just before the <span class= "ital">Sursum Corda.</span> It was not till the thirteenth century that the kissing of the <span class= "ital">Pax</span> was substituted in the Western Church for the kissing of the brethren.

And as we must fall, if God did not carry on his good work in the soul, we should pray to God to perfect his work, till we are presented faultless before the throne of his glory. We should pray for one another; and brethren should thus express brotherly love. This epistle was to be read to all the brethren. Not only are the common people allowed to read the Scriptures, but it is their duty, and what they should be persuaded to do. The word of God should not be kept in an unknown tongue, but transplanted, that as all men are concerned to know the Scriptures, so they all may be able to read them. The Scriptures should be read in all public congregations, for the benefit of the unlearned especially. We need no more to make us happy, than to know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ.

A token of Christian fellowship in those days (compare Lu 7:45; Ac 20:37), as it is a common mode of salutation in many countries. The custom hence arose in the early Church of passing the kiss through the congregation at the holy communion [Justin Martyr, Apology, 1.65; Apostolic Constitutions, 2.57], the men kissing the men, and the women the women, in the Lord.

The brotherly kiss, the usual salutation of Christians, proceeded from the custom of antiquity, particularly in the East, to unite a salutation with a kiss. But Paul calls it <span class="greekheb">ἅγιον</span>, as a symbol of the holy Christian fellowship. In the Greek church it is still used at Easter.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[68] Contrary to the sense, Hofmann, whom Riggenbach follows, makes the whole church, the <span class="greekheb">ἀδελφοὶ πάντες</span>, be addressed in <span class="greekheb">ἀσπάσασθε</span>; thus the church is to salute itself.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/1_thessalonians/5.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-26.htm" title="Greet all the brothers with an holy kiss.">1 Thessalonians 5:26</a>.

Paul</span>, 262, <span class="ital">DC</span>[34]. i. 935, and <span class="ital">E. Bi</span>[35], 4254) in the early Christian worship.

Even in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-27.htm" title="I charge you by the Lord that this letter be read to all the holy brothers.">1 Thessalonians 5:27</a> it is not necessary to think of the local leaders. While the epistle would naturally be handed to some of them in the first instance, it was addressed to the church; the church owned it and was held responsible for its public reading at the weekly worship.—<span class="greekheb">πᾶσιν</span>, like the <span class="greekheb">πάντας</span> of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-26.htm" title="Greet all the brothers with an holy kiss.">1 Thessalonians 5:26</a>, simply shows Paul’s desire to prevent the church from becoming, on any pretext, a clique or coterie. But the remarkable emphasis of the injunction points to a period when such public reading of an apostolic epistle was not yet a recognised feature in the worship of the churches. Paul lays stress upon the proper use of his epistle, as being meant not for a special set, but for the entire brotherhood (<span class="ital">i.e.</span>, at Thessalonica, not, as Flatt thinks, in Macedonia). See that every member gets a hearing of it at some meeting or other (<span class="greekheb">ἀναγ</span>., timeless aor.), and thus knows exactly what has been said. So <span class="ital">Apoc.

V.). The <span class="ital">kiss</span>, as the common sign of affection amongst kindred and near friends in meeting or parting, was universal in the primitive Christian assemblies, and is still a usage of the Greek and Oriental Churches, especially at Holy Communion. In the West the ceremony gradually died out during the Middle Ages. It was unsuitable to the reserved manners of the Germanic races. The custom was naturally liable to abuse and suspicion, when the simplicity of primitive Christian feeling declined; and it became the subject of numerous regulations in early Councils. The Apostle desires “a holy kiss” to be exchanged by those who heard the Epistle read, as an expression through the Church of his love to each of its members. So in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-16.htm" title="Salute one another with an holy kiss. The churches of Christ salute you.">Romans 16:16</a>, after bidding the Church “salute” by name a number of his personal acquaintances, he includes all present at the reading of the letter by saying, “Salute one another with a holy kiss.” The same thing is said in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-20.htm" title="All the brothers greet you. Greet you one another with an holy kiss.">1 Corinthians 16:20</a>, followed by the words, “My love be with you all in Christ Jesus;” also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-12.htm" title="Greet one another with an holy kiss.">2 Corinthians 13:12</a>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-14.htm" title="Greet you one another with a kiss of charity. Peace be with you all that are in Christ Jesus.

The reference is to the mode of salutation in the East. The kiss is called "holy" because it was the symbol of Christian affection. The same exhortation is made in other Epistles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-16.htm">Romans 16:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-20.htm">1 Corinthians 16:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-12.htm">2 Corinthians 13:12</a>). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/1_thessalonians/5.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Kiss<p>See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-12.htm">2 Corinthians 13:12</a>.
