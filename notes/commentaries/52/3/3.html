The apostle's design was to establish and comfort the Thessalonians as to the object of their faith, that Jesus Christ was the Saviour of the world; and as to the recompence of faith, which was more than enough to make up all their losses, and to reward all their labours. But he feared his labours would be in vain. If the devil cannot hinder ministers from labouring in the word and doctrine, he will, if possible, hinder the success of their labours. No one would willingly labour in vain. It is the will and purpose of God, that we enter into his kingdom through many afflictions. And the apostles, far from flattering people with the expectation of worldly prosperity in religion, told them plainly they must count upon trouble in the flesh. Herein they followed the example of their great Master, the Author of our faith. Christians were in danger, and they should be forewarned; they will thus be kept from being improved by any devices of the tempter.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_thessalonians/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>That no man should be moved - The word rendered "moved" (&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;  saino&#772;) occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. It properly means to wag, to move to and fro, as of dogs which wag their tails in fondness (Hom. Od. K. 216. AEl. A. N. 10:7. Ovid. 14:258); then to caress, to fawn upon, to flatter; then to move or waver in mind - as from fear; to dread, to tremble. See Passow and Wetstein. Here the sense is, to be so moved or agitated by fear, or by the terror of persecution, as to forsake their religion. The object of sending Timothy was, that they might not be thus moved, but that amidst all opposition they might adhere steadfastly to their religion.<p>These afflictions - See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-14.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:14</a>.<p>For yourselves know that we are appointed thereunto - It is not quite certain whether by the word "we" here the apostle refers to himself; or to himself and the Thessalonians; or to Christians in general. On either supposition what he says is true, and either would meet the case. It would be most to the purpose, however, to suppose that he means to state the general idea that all Christians are exposed to persecution and could not hope to avoid it. It would then appear that the Thessalonians had partaken only of the common lot. Still there may have been a special reference to the fact that Paul and his fellow-laborers there were subjected to trials; and if this be the reference, then the idea is, that the Thessalonians should not be "moved" by their trials, for even their teachers were not exempt. Even their enemies could not say that the apostle and his co-workers were impostors, for they had persevered in preaching the gospel when they knew that these trials were coming upon them. The phrase, "we are appointed thereunto," means that such was the divine arrangement. No one who professed Christianity could hope to be exempted from trial, for it was the common lot of all believers; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-9.htm">1 Corinthians 4:9</a> note; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-12.htm">2 Timothy 3:12</a> note. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_thessalonians/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. moved&#8212;"shaken," "disturbed." The Greek is literally said of dogs wagging the tail in fawning on one. Therefore Tittmann explains it, "That no man should, amidst his calamities, be allured by the flattering hope of a more pleasant life to abandon his duty." So Elsner and Bengel, "cajoled out of his faith." In afflictions, relatives and opponents combine with the ease-loving heart itself in flatteries, which it needs strong faith to overcome.<p>yourselves know&#8212;We always candidly told you so (1Th 3:4; Ac 14:22).

T.,—means, to shake, to swing hither and thither. It is used specially of dogs who wag their tails (comp. Hom. <span class="ital">Od.</span> xvi. 4 ff., x. 217; Arist. <span class="ital">Eq.</span> 1031), from which the wider acceptation of fawning or caressing is derived. Then the verb stands generally for any act of shaking, passing from the sphere of sense to that of mind. Comp. Diog. Laert. viii. 41: <span class="greekheb">οἱ δὲ σαινόμενοι τοῖς λεγομένοις ἐδάκρυόν τε καὶ ᾤμοζον</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Sophocl. <span class="ital">Antig.</span> 1214: <span class="greekheb">παιδός με σαίνει φθόγγος</span>. (Other proofs in Wetstein.) Thus here <span class="greekheb">σαίνεσθαι</span> denotes a being disquieted, becoming wavering in the faith. Chrysostom correctly explains it by <span class="greekheb">θορυβεῖσθαι καὶ ταράττεσθαι</span>. With unnecessary harshness Faber Stapulensis, to whom also Beza (adblandiri, adversariis videlicet evangelii) is inclined, Elsner, <span class="ital">Observ. sacr.</span> II. p. 275 f., Wolf, and Tittmann, <span class="ital">de synonym. in N. T.</span> p. 189, think to preserve the meaning <span class="ital">fawning</span> (and alluring), giving the sense: that they should not permit themselves, by “adulationes et illicitamenta carnis” (Faber Stapulensis), to apostatize from Christianity, and relapse into heathenism or Judaism. Also Rückert, whom Koch follows, adopts this view, as he will not acknowledge the meaning <span class="greekheb">θορυβεῖσθαι</span> in the verb: he thinks, rather, that from the meaning <span class="ital">to fawn</span>, the meaning <span class="ital">blanditiis corrumpi</span> in the passive is formed; and from that, in consequence of the toning down of the meaning, the general idea of <span class="ital">corrumpi</span> arose. Hofmann explains <span class="greekheb">σαίνειν</span> directly by <span class="ital">to delude</span>, a meaning which the word never has.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐν ταῖς θλίψεσιν ταύταις</span>] <span class="ital">in these afflictions</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span>, is purely temporal, not instrumental, although, in regard to the subject in hand, it cannot be doubted that it was the <span class="greekheb">θλίψεις</span> to whose influence the possibility of a <span class="greekheb">σαίνεσθαι</span> is attributed. <span class="greekheb">ταύταις</span> is <span class="greekheb">δεικτικῶς</span>, <span class="ital">indicative</span>, denoting the afflictions which both the Thessalonians and Paul (so Calixtus, Flatt, Schott, and others; Oecumenius, Theophylact, Estius, Osiander, Nat. Alexander, Benson, Macknight, erroneously refer the <span class="greekheb">θλίψεις</span> to Paul <span class="ital">only</span>) have just experienced, and which are here considered as belonging to the present, since a renewed outbreak of them was every instant to be feared. The first part of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-3.htm" title="That no man should be moved by these afflictions: for yourselves know that we are appointed thereunto.">1 Thessalonians 3:3</a>, accordingly, contains the warning not to suffer themselves to apostatize from the faith in Christ in the time of trouble and of need.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But it is asked how <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-3.htm" title="That no man should be moved by these afflictions: for yourselves know that we are appointed thereunto.">1 Thessalonians 3:3</a> is to be connected with the preceding. Those who read, with the <span class="ital">Receptus</span>, <span class="greekheb">τῷ μηδένα σαίνεσθαι</span> (see critical note), regard <span class="greekheb">τῷ</span> as the Dativus commodi, which, as the Hebrew <span class="greekheb">לְ</span> placed before an infinitive, serves for the statement of the object; thus <span class="greekheb">τῷ</span> would be equivalent to <span class="greekheb">εἰς τό</span> (Grotius, Turretin, Benson, Koppe, Pelt, Olshausen). But <span class="greekheb">τῷ</span> with the infinitive is used exclusively to denote the reason or the inducing cause, never to denote the design; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-12.htm" title="Furthermore, when I came to Troas to preach Christ's gospel, and a door was opened to me of the Lord,">2 Corinthians 2:12</a>, and Winer, p. 293 [E. T. 413]. Rückert, indeed, retaining this grammatical use of <span class="greekheb">τῷ</span>, makes it denote: “unde nascituram <span class="greekheb">τὴν παράκλησιν</span> speraverat, quum Timotheum misit, apostolus;” and, although he does not decide positively, prefers the reading <span class="greekheb">τῷ</span>, in order that he may find expressed therein a twofold object in sending Timotheus, in conformity with the longing of the apostle previously stated: (1) in respect to the readers, and (2) in respect to himself. Timotheus, Paul intends to say, is sent “fratres ut firmaret, sibi ut afferret ex bona illorum conditione solatium.” But this interpretation is simply impossible, as, in referring <span class="greekheb">παρακαλέσαι</span> to the apostle, it would be indispensably necessary, on account of the preceding <span class="greekheb">ὑμᾶς</span>, to subjoin <span class="greekheb">ἡμᾶς</span>. Accordingly, even from internal reasons, criticism requires us to read <span class="greekheb">τὸ μηδένα σαίνεσθαι</span>. But here, also, a different view is conceivable:—(1) We might, with Matthaei, supply a second <span class="greekheb">εἰς</span> to <span class="greekheb">τὸ μηδένα σαίνεσθαι</span> from the preceding <span class="greekheb">εἰς τὸ στηρίξαι</span>. But in this case we cannot understand why the second <span class="greekheb">εἰς</span> has been suppressed by Paul, as elsewhere he does not avoid the repetition of the form <span class="greekheb">εἰς τό</span>; comp. e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-11.htm" title="And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed to them also:">Romans 4:11</a>. Or (2) with Schott, Koch, and Bisping, we might take <span class="greekheb">τὸ μηδένα σαίνεσθαι</span> as an absolute accusative, in the sense of quod attinet ad. But, considering the rarity of this construction, and the misuse which is practised with its assumption (comp. Bernhardy, Syntax, p. 132 f.; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-10.htm" title="But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me has flourished again; wherein you were also careful, but you lacked opportunity.">Php 4:10</a>, on which Schott founds, is no analogy, as there <span class="greekheb">τὸ ὑπὲρ ἐμοῦ φρονεῖν</span> is the usual objective accusative to <span class="greekheb">ἀνεθάλετε</span>, used transitively), this shift should only be resorted to when no other expedient presents itself. (3) Winer, 5th ed. p. 375 [E. T. 413], whom de Wette, Reiche, Buttmann, Gramm. des neutestam. Sprachgebrauchs, p. 226 [E. T. 263f.], Hofmann, and Riggenbach follow, makes <span class="greekheb">τὸ μηδένα σαίνεσθαι</span> dependent on <span class="greekheb">παρακαλέσαι</span>, and considers it as a further explanation of <span class="greekheb">ὑπὲρ τῆς πίστεως</span>, namely, to exhort that none should become wavering. But if <span class="greekheb">τὸ μηδένα σαίνεσθαι</span> depended on <span class="greekheb">παρακαλέσαι</span>, then <span class="greekheb">παρακαλεῖν</span>, in the sense of to exhort, would be construed with the simple accusative of the thing, an assumption the possibility of which is to be absolutely denied. (The passages on which Reiche supports the opposite view are without force. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-18.htm" title="And many other things in his exhortation preached he to the people.">Luke 3:18</a> both accusatives are not governed by <span class="greekheb">παρακαλῶν</span>, but, in agreement with <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-32.htm" title="And we declare to you glad tidings, how that the promise which was made to the fathers,">Acts 13:32</a>, by <span class="greekheb">εὐηγγελίζετο</span>; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-2.htm" title="And they that have believing masters, let them not despise them, because they are brothers; but rather do them service, because they are faithful and beloved, partakers of the benefit. These things teach and exhort.">1 Timothy 6:2</a>, <span class="greekheb">ταῦτα</span> depends on <span class="greekheb">δίδασκε</span>, and <span class="greekheb">καὶ παρακάλει</span> is annexed only in a loose manner to <span class="greekheb">ταῦτα δίδασκε</span>; so also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-15.htm" title="These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no man despise you.">Titus 2:15</a> <span class="greekheb">ταῦτα</span> belongs only to <span class="greekheb">λάλει</span>, but not also to the following verbs; further, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/5-23.htm" title="And sought him greatly, saying, My little daughter lies at the point of death: I pray you, come and lay your hands on her, that she may be healed; and she shall live.">Mark 5:23</a> <span class="greekheb">πολλά</span> does not depend on <span class="greekheb">παρακαλεῖ</span>, but is the adverbial much, very; lastly, <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/5-17.htm" title="And they began to pray him to depart out of their coasts.">Mark 5:17</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-31.htm" title="And he said, How can I, except some man should guide me? And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him.">Acts 8:31</a> are not analogous, as there <span class="greekheb">παρακαλεῖν</span> is put with the accusative of the person, to which a simple infinitive, but not an infinitive with the article <span class="greekheb">τό</span>, follows.) Besides, if <span class="greekheb">τὸ μηδένα σαίν</span>. were a further explanation or epexegesis of <span class="greekheb">ὑπὲρ τῆς πίστεως ὑμῶν</span>, then not the accusative <span class="greekheb">τὸ μηδένα σαίνεσθαι</span> would have been put, but the genitive <span class="greekheb">τοῦ μηδένα σαίν</span>., in agreement with <span class="greekheb">ὑπὲρ τῆς πίστεως ὑμῶν</span>. Accordingly, this interpretation is also to be rejected. There consequently remains only (4) to consider <span class="greekheb">τὸ μηδένα σαίνεσθαι ἐν ταῖς θλ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ταύταις</span> as an apposition to the whole preceding sentence <span class="greekheb">εἰς τὸ στηρίξαι ὑμᾶς καὶ παρακαλέσαι ὑπὲρ τῆς πίστεως ὑμῶν</span>, so that <span class="greekheb">τὸ μηδένα σαίν</span>. serves only to repeat the same thought which was before positively expressed in a negative but better defined form; thus, instead of <span class="greekheb">τό</span>, <span class="greekheb">τουτέστι</span> might have been written. Thus the sense is: to strengthen you and to exhort you on behalf of your faith—that is, that no one may be shaken in these troubles; or, to strengthen and exhort you on account of your faith, particularly on one point, which is contained in one requirement: that no one may be shaken, etc.[46] Accordingly, <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤῸ ΜΗΔΈΝΑ ΣΑΊΝΕΣΘΑΙ</span></span></span> certainly depends on the preceding <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΕἸς</span></span></span>; but our interpretation is entirely different from that adduced in (1), as no second <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΕἸς</span></span></span> can be inserted before <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤῸ ΜΗΔΈΝΑ ΣΑΊΝΕΣΘΑΙ</span></span></span> without injuring the indissoluble unity which combines <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤῸ ΜΗΔΈΝΑ ΣΑΊΝ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Λ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> with what precedes.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΑὐΤΟῚ ΓᾺΡ ΟἼΔ</span>.… <span class="greekheb">ΚΑῚ ΟἼΔΑΤΕ</span></span></span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-4.htm" title="For truly, when we were with you, we told you before that we should suffer tribulation; even as it came to pass, and you know.">1 Thessalonians 3:4</a>, is not, with Moldenhauer, Griesbach, Vater, Flatt, to be included in a parenthesis, as <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΙᾺ ΤΟῦΤΟ</span></span></span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-5.htm" title="For this cause, when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know your faith, lest by some means the tempter have tempted you, and our labor be in vain.">1 Thessalonians 3:5</a>, is connected with what directly precedes.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΓΆΡ</span></span></span>] proves the legitimacy of the demand <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΜΗΔΈΝΑ ΣΑΊΝΕΣΘΑΙ</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ΟἼΔΑΤΕ</span></span></span>] <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-4.htm" title="For truly, when we were with you, we told you before that we should suffer tribulation; even as it came to pass, and you know.">1 Thessalonians 3:4</a>, explains whence they knew it,—namely, partly from previous definite intimations of the apostle, and partly from their own experience.

Whatever truth there may be in the saying that prosperity is the promise of the Old Testament, affliction is certainly the promise of the New. We must be conformed to Christ in his sufferings. "In the world," says our Lord, "ye shall have tribulation" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-33.htm">John 16:33</a>). When our Lord called Paul to his apostleship, he showed him how great things he must suffer for his Name's sake (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-16.htm">Acts 9:16</a>). All the apostles suffered from persecution, and concerning Christians in general Paul asserts that it is only through tribulation that they can enter into the kingdom of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-22.htm">Acts 14:22</a>; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-14.htm">Revelation 7:14</a>). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/1_thessalonians/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Moved (&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;)<p>N.T.o olxx.
