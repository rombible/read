Perfect and settled sanctification in the eyes of God is the object in view, and the means by which it is to be attained is growing and overflowing love toward mankind. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-14.htm" title=" And above all these things put on charity, which is the bond of perfection.">Colossians 3:14</a>.) St. Paul is already thinking, probably, how he shall treat the subject of chastity in the next chapter. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-6.htm" title="That no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter: because that the Lord is the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned you and testified.">1Thessalonians 4:6</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Before God . . .</span> <span class= "bld">at the coming.</span>—The hearts are to be unblamably holy before God—not only all through life, but also at the Judgment Day, when Jesus Christ is to judge us in the Father’s presence. Though He has “committed all judgment unto the Son” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-22.htm" title="For the Father judges no man, but has committed all judgment to the Son:">John 5:22</a>), yet the judgment is His own, and the Son is the agent <span class= "ital">by</span> whom He judges, just as He is the agent by whom He creates (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-31.htm" title="Because he has appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he has ordained; whereof he has given assurance to all men, in that he has raised him from the dead.">Acts 17:31</a>): therefore in that day it is in the Father’s sight rather than in the Son’s (though there can be no divergence between Them) that we are to be able to clear ourselves.<p><span class= "bld">With all his saints</span>—<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, attended by them:-<p>“Thousand, thousand saints <span class= "ital">attending,<p>Swell the triumph of His train.”</span><p>The word might possibly be stretched to include the holy angels (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-2.htm" title="And he said, The LORD came from Sinai, and rose up from Seir to them; he shined forth from mount Paran, and he came with ten thousands of saints: from his right hand went a fiery law for them.">Deuteronomy 33:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-13.htm" title="I saw in the visions of my head on my bed, and, behold, a watcher and an holy one came down from heaven;">Daniel 4:13</a>, <span class= "ital">et al.</span>); but here we may more probably suppose that St. Paul is anticipating his teaching of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-14.htm" title="For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.">1Thessalonians 4:14</a>, and besides, the Greek seems almost to indicate that these “saints” are to be assessors in the judgment—an honour to be given only to holy men.

Prayer is to be offered to God as our Father. Prayer is not only to be offered in the name of Christ, but offered up to Christ himself, as our Lord and our Saviour. Let us acknowledge God in all our ways, and he will direct our paths. Mutual love is required of all Christians. And love is of God, and is fulfilling the gospel as well as the law. We need the Spirit's influences in order to our growth in grace; and the way to obtain them, is prayer. Holiness is required of all who would go to heaven; and we must act so that we do not contradict the profession we make of holiness. The Lord Jesus will certainly come in his glory; his saints will come with him. Then the excellence as well as the necessity of holiness will appear; and without this no hearts shall be established at that day, nor shall any avoid condemnation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_thessalonians/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>To the end he may stablish your hearts - That is, "may the Lord cause you to increase in love <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-12.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:12</a>, in order that you may be established, and be without blame in the day of judgment."

The word includes his "angels," who will come with him <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/25-31.htm">Matthew 25:31</a>, and all the redeemed, who will then surround him. The idea is, that before that holy assemblage it is desirable that we should be prepared to appear blameless. We should be fitted to be welcomed to the "goodly fellowship" of the angels, and to be regarded as worthy to be numbered with the redeemed who" have washed their robes and have made them pure in the blood of the Lamb." When we come to appear amidst that vast assemblage of holy beings, the honors of the world will appear to be small things; the wealth of the earth will appear worthless, and all the pleasures of this life beneath our notice. Happy will they be who are prepared for the solemnities of that day, and who shall have led such a life of holy love - of pure devotion to the Redeemer - of deadness to the world - and of zeal in the cause of pure religion of universal justice, fidelity, honesty, and truth, as to be without reproach, and to meet with the approbation of their Lord. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_thessalonians/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13. your hearts&#8212;which are naturally the spring and seat of unholiness.<p>before God, even our Father&#8212;rather, "before Him who is at once God and our Father."

The saints are "His" (Ac 9:13). We must have "holiness" if we are to be numbered with His holy ones or "saints." On "unblameable," compare Re 14:5. This verse (compare 1Th 3:12) shows that "love" is the spring of true "holiness" (Mt 5:44-48; Ro 13:10; Col 3:14). God is He who really "stablishes"; Timothy and other ministers are but instruments (1Th 3:2) in "stablishing."   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_thessalonians/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> These words some refer only to the verse immediately preceding: by increasing and abounding in love, their hearts would be established <span class="bld">unblamable in holiness.</span> Which is true, for that holiness is justly to be suspected, at least is to be blamed, which is without love to men. And love itself is a great part of holiness; and who will blame holiness when it shines forth in love? Yea, it will be unblamable before God and men. And when God doth cause a people to increase in love, he doth hereby establish them in holiness that is unblamable; where love is wanting the heart is not established. The hypocrite will fall off in an hour of temptation, because he wants love; and though he may for a while make a fair show before men, yet he is not unblamable before God, who searcheth the heart: neither will he be found so at the appearance of Jesus Christ; which the apostle prays for here with respect to these Thessalonians, that they might be established <span class="bld">in holiness</span> until <span class="bld">the coming of Christ; </span> or that they might be found unblameable in holiness at his coming. Whereby the apostle signifies there is yet another coming of Christ, when there will a strict trial pass upon men, and therefore the saints should labour to be then found unblamable, or without spot and blemish, as <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-14.htm" title="Why, beloved, seeing that you look for such things, be diligent that you may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless.">2 Peter 3:14</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">At the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints; </span> whereof he gives a particular account in the next chapter.

Which are very unstable and inconstant in their frames, and in the exercise of grace, and have need to be established in the love of God, against the fears of men, the frowns of the world, the temptations of Satan, and in, and with the doctrines of grace; See Gill on <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:2</a>, <p>unblamable in holiness before God, even our Father. There is no holiness in men naturally; what is in them without the grace of God is only a show; true holiness is from the Spirit of God; and this is a stable thing in itself, and can never be removed or taken away; but the acts of it, through the prevalence of corruption, the force of Satan's temptations, and the snares of the world, are fickle and inconstant; and the saints need to be established in the discharge of duty, as well as in the exercise of grace: and whereas the apostle prays, that they might be "unblamable in holiness", the Alexandrian copy reads, "in righteousness" so one of Stephens's; it must be observed, that no man is perfectly holy in this life; no man is without sin in himself, or lives without the commission of it; holiness in the best is imperfect; no man, as yet, is in himself sanctified wholly; there is no unblamable holiness but in Christ; and in him the saints are without spot and blemish, who is their sanctification and their righteousness; but in themselves they are full of spots and stains; yet through the grace of God their hearts may be so established with principles of holiness, and they may be so assisted in the acts of it daily, as to give no just cause of blame to men, and so to behave as to approve themselves "before God", who sees the heart, and knows from what principles all actions flow: and this the apostle desires may be at the coming of our Lord Jesus; or unto the coming of him, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-23.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:23</a> Either at death, when he comes into his garden, and gathers his lilies, and takes his to himself to be for ever with him; or at the day of judgment, when he comes to judge the quick and dead; and which coming of his is certain, and will be quickly and suddenly, and with great glory and power: and, as it is here added, <p>with all his saints; meaning either his holy angels, or rather the souls of his people, whom he will bring with him, and will raise their dead bodies, and reunite them to their souls, when they shall be for ever with him; and then shall they be unblamable in holiness, both in soul and body, and shall be presented by him, first to himself, and then to his Father, faultless, and without spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing. The Vulgate Latin, Arabic, and Ethiopic versions add, "Amen"; and so does Beza's ancient copy, and the Alexandrian manuscript. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_thessalonians/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">To the end he may stablish your hearts unblameable in holiness before God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/1_thessalonians/3.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-13.htm" title="To the end he may establish your hearts blameless in holiness before God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints.">1 Thessalonians 3:13</a>.

Schr. N. T.</span>, without altering his interpretation of <span class="greekheb">οἱ ἅγιοι</span>), unites the clause with <span class="greekheb">ἀμέμπτους ἐν ἁγιωσύνῃ</span>: “in order that ye may appear blameless on that day with all who are consecrated to God, who are the genuine members of His people, who truly honour God and Christ.” So also Musculus; and also Benson and Olshausen (comp. also Bouman, <span class="ital">Chartae theol.</span> I. p. 81 ff.), although they do not construe with Musculus and Flatt, understand by <span class="greekheb">ἅγιοι</span> the earlier perfected <span class="ital">believers</span>. But the difficulty which impelled Flatt to this interpretation (and in which Schrader finds even an objection against the <span class="ital">authenticity</span> of the Epistle), namely, that <span class="greekheb">ἅγιοι</span> in the New Testament never denotes the angels when it is by itself, that is, without the addition of <span class="greekheb">ἄγγελοι</span>, vanishes, as—(1) The advent is considered as glorified by the appearance of angels; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/1-7.htm" title="And to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels,">2 Thessalonians 1:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-27.htm" title="For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels; and then he shall reward every man according to his works.">Matthew 16:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-31.htm" title="When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit on the throne of his glory:">Matthew 25:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/8-38.htm" title="Whoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation; of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.">Mark 8:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-26.htm" title="For whoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he shall come in his own glory, and in his Father's, and of the holy angels.">Luke 9:26</a>. (2) In the Old Testament without any further addition <span class="greekheb">קְדֹשִׁים</span>, and in the LXX. <span class="greekheb">οἱ ἅγιοι</span>, is a designation of the angels; comp. e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-5.htm" title="And you shall flee to the valley of the mountains; for the valley of the mountains shall reach to Azal: yes, you shall flee, like as you fled from before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah: and the LORD my God shall come, and all the saints with you.">Zechariah 14:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-10.htm" title="Thus were the visions of my head in my bed; I saw, and behold a tree in the middle of the earth, and the height thereof was great.">Daniel 4:10</a>; and therefore this current designation cannot surprise us in Paul. Also, what Hofmann in the above-mentioned place urges in favour of Flatt’s interpretation is without force. For to “the probability of the three prepositions <span class="greekheb">ἔμπροσθεν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span>, and <span class="greekheb">μετά</span> being used in a similar connection,” is opposed the greater naturalness and easiness of the connection of <span class="greekheb">μετὰ πάντων τῶν ἁγίων αὐτοῦ</span> with the directly preceding <span class="greekheb">ἐν τῇ παρουσίᾳ τοῦ κυρίου ἡμῶν Ἰησοῦ</span>. “And that also the connection” supports Flatt’s explanation, “since the brotherly love in which the Thessalonians are to grow finds its suitable reward in sharing at length the blessed fellowship of all the saints of God,” so that hereby is already introduced “what the apostle has particularly to teach the Christians of Thessalonica for their comfort, that those believers who fell asleep before the Advent of the Lord will not be wanting at it,” can only be maintained without arbitrariness, if not only the explanation in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_thessalonians/4-1.htm" title="Furthermore then we beseech you, brothers, and exhort you by the Lord Jesus, that as you have received of us how you ought to walk and to please God, so you would abound more and more....">1 Thessalonians 4:1-12</a>, but the section <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-13.htm" title="But I would not have you to be ignorant, brothers, concerning them which are asleep, that you sorrow not, even as others which have no hope.">1 Thessalonians 4:13</a> ff., be directly joined to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-13.htm" title="To the end he may establish your hearts blameless in holiness before God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints.">1 Thessalonians 3:13</a>; and then this section would be introduced with <span class="greekheb">Οὐ θέλομεν γὰρ ὑμᾶς ἀγνοεῖν</span>, instead of with <span class="greekheb">Οὐ θέλομεν δὲ ὑμᾶς ἀγνοεῖν</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Moreover, the concluding word <span class="greekheb">αὐτοῦ</span> is more correctly referred to <span class="greekheb">τοῦ Θεοῦ</span>, than, with Pelt, Riggenbach, and others, to <span class="greekheb">τοῦ κυρίου ἡμῶν Ἰησοῦ</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/1_thessalonians/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">13</span>. <span class="ital">to the end he may stablish your hearts</span>] On “stablish” see note to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-2.htm" title="And sent Timotheus, our brother, and minister of God, and our fellow laborer in the gospel of Christ, to establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith:">1 Thessalonians 3:2</a>; and on “hearts,” ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-4.htm" title="But as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel, even so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, which tries our hearts.">1 Thessalonians 2:4</a>; comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-17.htm" title="Comfort your hearts, and establish you in every good word and work.">2 Thessalonians 2:17</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This is an O.T. phrase, found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-15.htm" title="And wine that makes glad the heart of man, and oil to make his face to shine, and bread which strengthens man's heart.">Psalm 104:15</a>, “Bread that <span class="ital">strengtheneth</span> (Greek, <span class="ital">stablisheth</span>) man’s <span class="ital">heart</span>”; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/112-8.htm" title="His heart is established, he shall not be afraid, until he see his desire on his enemies.">Psalm 112:8</a>, “His <span class="ital">heart</span> is <span class="ital">established</span>, he shall not be afraid.” The only N.T. parallel is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-8.htm" title="Be you also patient; establish your hearts: for the coming of the Lord draws near.">James 5:8</a>, “Be patient; <span class="ital">stablish your hearts</span>; for the coming of the Lord is at hand.” In all these places it signifies the <span class="ital">imparting of conscious strength</span>; and denotes here, therefore, not so much a <span class="ital">making firm or steadfast in character</span>, but <span class="ital">giving a firm confidence, a steadfast and assured heart</span> (contrast the language of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-2.htm" title="That you be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of Christ is at hand.">2 Thessalonians 2:2</a>). This would be the effect of the abounding love prayed for in the last verse. The Apostle’s thought runs in the same groove as St John’s in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_john/3-18.htm" title="My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth....">1 John 3:18-21</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_john/4-16.htm" title="And we have known and believed the love that God has to us. God is love; and he that dwells in love dwells in God, and God in him....">1 John 4:16-17</a>, “Herein is love made perfect with us, that we may have boldness in the day of judgement.… Perfect love casteth out fear.” The Church was living in the expectation of Christ’s speedy return to judgement, a prospect before which the heart naturally quails; in order to “assure their hearts before Him,” the Thessalonian believers must increase and abound in love. “Love” is the one thing that “never faileth” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-8.htm" title="Charity never fails: but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away.">1 Corinthians 13:8</a>). Ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-13.htm" title="But I would not have you to be ignorant, brothers, concerning them which are asleep, that you sorrow not, even as others which have no hope.">1 Thessalonians 4:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-18.htm" title="Why comfort one another with these words.">1 Thessalonians 4:18</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-14.htm" title="Now we exhort you, brothers, warn them that are unruly, comfort the feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward all men.">1 Thessalonians 5:14</a> show that courage and joyous confidence in Christ were wanting in some members of this Church.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The words <span class="ital">unblameable in holiness</span> form, then, a secondary predicate of the sentence: “to the end He may establish your hearts, making them unblameable,” or “so as to be unblameable in holiness before our God,” &c. The clause appears to be <span class="ital">proleptic</span>, or anticipatory (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-8.htm" title="Who shall also confirm you to the end, that you may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.">1 Corinthians 1:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-21.htm" title="Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like to his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things to himself.">Php 3:21</a>). Similarly in ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-23.htm" title="And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.">1 Thessalonians 5:23</a> the <span class="ital">keeping</span> of “spirit, soul and body” prayed for belongs to the present, but <span class="ital">unblameably</span> carries our thoughts at once to “the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ” (see note). We take the Apostle’s thought, amplified, to be this: “May the Lord make you to abound in love … so that you may have the confidence and strength of heart in which abiding you will be found blameless in holiness before God at Christ’s coming.” This blamelessness will be manifest at the coming of the Judge; but it is imparted already, and belongs to those whose hearts are filled with love to their fellow-men, and so with confidence toward God (comp. again <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_john/4-16.htm" title="And we have known and believed the love that God has to us. God is love; and he that dwells in love dwells in God, and God in him....">1 John 4:16-17</a>); in which confidence they anticipate the day when they shall be found “holy and without blemish before Him.” This assurance of heart resembles St Paul’s, expressed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-12.htm" title="For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world, and more abundantly to you-ward.">2 Corinthians 1:12</a> : “Our glorying is this, the testimony of our conscience that in holiness and sincerity of God we have behaved ourselves in the world.” Such confidence must always be guarded by strict self-scrutiny and absolute dependence upon Christ. It was <span class="ital">encouragement</span>, however, rather than caution that St Paul’s readers just now required (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-2.htm" title="And sent Timotheus, our brother, and minister of God, and our fellow laborer in the gospel of Christ, to establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith:">1 Thessalonians 3:2</a>). This verse and the last set forth Christian perfection in its twofold aspect, as constituted at once by an unbounded love to men and a blameless consecration to God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>On “holiness” see notes to ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-3.htm" title="For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that you should abstain from fornication:">1 Thessalonians 4:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-7.htm" title="For God has not called us to uncleanness, but to holiness.">1 Thessalonians 4:7</a>, also <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-10.htm" title="You are witnesses, and God also, how piously and justly and blamelessly we behaved ourselves among you that believe:">1 Thessalonians 2:10</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This “blamelessness” of the Thessalonians will be approved <span class="bld">before our God and Father</span>, Who listens to the Apostle’s prayers and thanksgivings and witnesses his joy on their account (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-9.htm" title="For what thanks can we render to God again for you, for all the joy with which we joy for your sakes before our God;">1 Thessalonians 3:9</a>, ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-3.htm" title="Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labor of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God and our Father;">1 Thessalonians 1:3</a>), and delights to see the good pleasure of His will accomplished in His children.

Christ fills His people’s hearts with love and sanctifies them by His Spirit, so that at the last He may present them to the Father as His joy and crown. Then He will be “glorified in His saints, and admired in all them that believed” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_thessalonians/1-10.htm" title="When he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in all them that believe (because our testimony among you was believed) in that day....">2 Thessalonians 1:10-12</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">His saints</span> (or <span class="ital">holy ones</span>) are those, “unblameable in holiness,” whom Christ will acknowledge and associate with Himself at His coming.

Christ will not then be solitary, but will have a vast retinue of “the saints,” visible in forms of splendour like His own (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/philippians/3-20.htm" title="For our conversation is in heaven; from where also we look for the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ:...">Php 3:20-21</a>) and “<span class="ital">with Him</span> in glory” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-4.htm" title=" When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall you also appear with him in glory.">Colossians 3:4</a>).
