From those passages it would appear that immediately upon reaching Athens, St. Paul sent word back to Macedonia, by the friends who had escorted him, that St. Silas and St. Timothy should join him at once; but that some delay took place, and that St. Paul had arrived at Corinth before his companions reached him; that they consequently never were with him at Athens. In that case, “to be left alone” must mean, “We resolved not to keep with us the brethren who escorted us;” and the “sent” of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-2.htm" title="And sent Timotheus, our brother, and minister of God, and our fellow laborer in the gospel of Christ, to establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith:">1Thessalonians 3:2</a> will mean that he gave them a message to Timothy that he should go back to Thessalonica (presumably from Berœa), before joining St. Paul at Athens; for the <span class= "ital">tense</span> of the Greek verb “to be left” absolutely necessitates an <span class= "ital">act</span> of parting with some one: it cannot mean, “We were willing to endure loneliness a little longer.” But such an interpretation suits ill with <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-15.htm" title="And they that conducted Paul brought him to Athens: and receiving a commandment to Silas and Timotheus for to come to him with all speed, they departed.">Acts 17:15</a>; it is hard to identify an urgent message to “come with all speed” with a command to make such a <span class= "ital">détour.</span> It seems, therefore, most reasonable to suppose that Silas and Timothy joined St. Paul forthwith at Athens, and were almost as soon sent back into Macedonia,—Silas to Berœa or Philippi, and Timothy to Thessalonica. This would explain St. Paul’s being left <span class= "ital">alone, </span>an expression which would hardly have been used had Silas remained with him at Athens, as some (misled by the word “we”) have supposed; and also it explains how in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-5.htm" title="And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in the spirit, and testified to the Jews that Jesus was Christ.">Acts 18:5</a> both Timothy <span class= "ital">and Silas</span> come from Macedonia to Corinth. The despatching <span class= "ital">of Silas</span> from Athens is not mentioned here, simply because it had no particular interest for the Thessalonians. If the two men did not reach St. Paul at all during the time he was at Athens, after receiving so imperative a message, they must have been very slow, for a week would have allowed ample time for their journey from Berœa, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-17.htm" title="Therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews, and with the devout persons, and in the market daily with them that met with him.">Acts 17:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-1.htm" title="After these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth;">Acts 18:1</a> certainly imply a much longer period of residence there. “To be left alone” was a great trial to St. Paul’s affectionate nature: such a sacrifice may well impress the Thessalonians with the strength of his love for them.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_thessalonians/3.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-1.htm" title="Why when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good to be left at Athens alone;">1 Thessalonians 3:1</a></span>. <span class="ital">When we could no longer forbear </span>— Or <span class="ital">bear, </span>rather, namely, our anxiety on your account. The word <span class="greekheb">στεγοντες</span>, here used, literally signifies <span class="ital">bearing </span>or <span class="ital">carrying, </span>but never <span class="ital">forbearing. </span>Some such word as <span class="ital">anxiety </span>is necessary to be supplied, because it appears from the following verse, that the apostle was at this time under great concern lest the Thessalonians should have been moved from the faith of the gospel, either by the false arguments of the unbelievers, or by the persecutions which they suffered. <span class="ital">We thought it good to be left at Athens alone </span>— Although there we had peculiar need of the support and comfort of having with us an approved companion and friend. Some infer, from this manner of speaking, that Silas was absent from Paul while he was at Athens. And Macknight supposes, that though Timothy and Silas were both ordered to follow him from Berea to Athens, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-15.htm" title="And they that conducted Paul brought him to Athens: and receiving a commandment to Silas and Timotheus for to come to him with all speed, they departed.">Acts 17:15</a>,) only Timothy came to him there.

If this opinion be correct, when Timothy left Athens, the apostle remained in that city alone, which was a very trying circumstance, as he expected great opposition from the Athenian philosophers. Some, however, infer, from the apostle’s speaking in the plural number, <span class="ital">We thought, </span>&c., that Silas must have been with him. <span class="ital">And sent Timotheus, our fellow-labourer in the gospel </span>— As Timothy is said (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-14.htm" title="And then immediately the brothers sent away Paul to go as it were to the sea: but Silas and Timotheus stayed there still.">Acts 17:14</a>) to have remained with Silas in Berea, after Paul’s departure, it is probable he had been with the apostle at Thessalonica, and had assisted him in his work of preaching the gospel there; <span class="ital">to establish you </span>— In the new faith you have embraced; <span class="ital">and to comfort you </span>— Under your suffering. <span class="ital">That no man </span>— That none of you, who have believed; <span class="ital">should be moved </span>— Or <span class="ital">shaken, </span>as <span class="greekheb">σαινεσθαι </span>means; should be discouraged, and made to fall off from his adherence to the Christian profession and hope, <span class="ital">by these afflictions </span>— Which either you or we are exposed to. <span class="ital">For you know that we are appointed thereto </span>— Our Lord expressly forewarned his apostles that they were to be persecuted, and that even to death; and that whoever killed them would think he did God service. Moreover, when he called Paul to the apostleship, he <span class="ital">showed him how great things he must suffer for his name’s sake, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-16.htm" title="For I will show him how great things he must suffer for my name's sake.">Acts 9:16</a>. All the apostles, therefore, and Paul more especially, expected to be persecuted. But here it is signified, that not only the apostles, evangelists, and other ministers of the word, were exposed to persecution, but that all who embraced the Christian faith were to expect to meet with the same treatment from the unbelievers, whether heathen or Jews; yea, that, as the original expression, <span class="greekheb">εις τουτο κειμεθα</span>, implies, that they were <span class="ital">appointed </span>to it, or rather <span class="ital">laid, </span>in <span class="ital">every respect, </span>in a fit posture for it, and that by the very design and contrivance of God himself, for the trial and increase of their faith and other graces. For, one principal part of the scheme of God, in establishing the Christian Church, was to raise a society of men who should glorify his name, and illustrate the force of true religion by enduring the greatest extremities in its defence with fortitude and cheerfulness. He gives great riches to the <span class="ital">world, </span>but stores up his treasures of wholesome afflictions for <span class="ital">his children. For when we were with you </span>— We did not flatter you with any vain hopes of an easy and pleasurable life, but plainly and candidly <span class="ital">told you, before </span>you embraced the gospel which we preach, and united yourselves to the Christian community, by submitting to the ordinance of baptism, <span class="ital">that we should suffer tribulation</span> — And indeed what else could be expected by any that consider the nature of the religion to which we are endeavouring to make converts, compared with the tempers, prejudices, and interests of mankind. Because the apostle knew that the enemies of the gospel would infer, from his not delivering himself from persecution by miracles, that he did not possess the miraculous powers to which he pretended, he took care to let his disciples know, in every place, that he was ordered by his Master to suffer for the gospel, and that his suffering for it was as necessary a part of the proof of its divine original as his working miracles.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_thessalonians/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:1-5 The more we find pleasure in the ways of God, the more we shall desire to persevere therein. The apostle's design was to establish and comfort the Thessalonians as to the object of their faith, that Jesus Christ was the Saviour of the world; and as to the recompence of faith, which was more than enough to make up all their losses, and to reward all their labours. But he feared his labours would be in vain. If the devil cannot hinder ministers from labouring in the word and doctrine, he will, if possible, hinder the success of their labours. No one would willingly labour in vain. It is the will and purpose of God, that we enter into his kingdom through many afflictions. And the apostles, far from flattering people with the expectation of worldly prosperity in religion, told them plainly they must count upon trouble in the flesh. Herein they followed the example of their great Master, the Author of our faith. Christians were in danger, and they should be forewarned; they will thus be kept from being improved by any devices of the tempter.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_thessalonians/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Wherefore - See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-18.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:18</a>. This particle (&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#768;  dio) is designed here to refer to another proof of his affection for them. One evidence had been referred to in his strong desire to visit them, which he had been unable to accomplish <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-18.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:18</a>, and he here refers to another - to wit, the fact that he had sent Timothy to them.<p>We could no longer forbear - That is, when I could not <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-5.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:5</a>, for there is every evidence that Paul refers to himself only though he uses the plural form of the word. There was no one with him at Athens after he had sent Timothy away <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-15.htm">Acts 17:15</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/18-5.htm">Acts 18:5</a>, and this shows that when, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:6</a>, he uses the term apostles in the plural number, he refers to himself only, and does not mean to give the name to Timothy and Silas. If this be so, Timothy and Silas are nowhere called "apostles" in the New Testament. The word rendered here "could forbear" (&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;  stegontes), means, properly, "to cover, to conceal;" and then to hide or conceal anger, impatience, weariness, etc.; that is, to hold out as to anything, to bear with, to endure. It is rendered suffer in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-12.htm">1 Corinthians 9:12</a>; beareth, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-7.htm">1 Corinthians 13:7</a>; and forbear, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-1.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-5.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:5</a>. It is not elsewhere used in the New Testament. It means that he could no longer bear up under, hide, or suppress his impatience in regard to them - his painful emotions - his wish to know of their state; and he therefore sent Timothy to them.<p>We thought it good - I was willing to suffer the inconvenience of parting with him in order to show my concern for you.<p>To be left at Athens alone - Paul had been conducted to Athens from Berea, where he remained until Silas and Timothy could come to him; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-15.htm">Acts 17:15</a>. It appears from the statement here that Timothy had joined him there, but such was his solicitude for the church at Thessalonica, that he very soon after sent him there, and chose to remain himself alone at Athens. Why he did not himself return to Thessalonica, is not stated. It is evidently implied here that it was a great personal inconvenience for him thus to part with Timothy, and to remain alone at Athens, and that he evinced the strong love which he had for the church at Thessalonica by being willing to submit to it. What that inconvenience consisted in, he has not stated, but it is not difficult to understand,<p>(1) he was among total strangers, and, when Timothy was gone, without an acquaintance or friend.<p>(2) the aid of Timothy was needed in order to prosecute the work which he contemplated. He had requested that Timothy should join him as soon as possible when he left Berea <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/17-15.htm">Acts 17:15</a>, and he evidently felt it desirable that in preaching the gospel in that city he should have all the assistance he could obtain. Yet he was willing to forego those comforts and advantages in order to promote the edification of the church at Thessalonica. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_thessalonians/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 3<p>1Th 3:1-13.

This implies that he sent Timothy from Athens, whither the latter had followed him. However, the "we" favors Alford's view that the determination to send Timothy was formed during the hasty consultation of Paul, Silas, and Timothy, previous to his departure from Berea, and that then he with them "resolved" to be "left alone" at Athens, when he should arrive there: Timothy and Silas not accompanying him, but remaining at Berea. Thus the "I," 1Th 3:5, will express that the act of sending Timothy, when he arrived at Athens, was Paul's, while the determination that Paul should be left alone at Athens, was that of the brethren as well as himself, at Berea, whence he uses, 1Th 3:1, "we." The non-mention of Silas at Athens implies that he did not follow Paul to Athens as was at first intended; but Timothy did. Thus the history, Ac 17:14, 15, accords with the Epistle. The word "left behind" (Greek) implies that Timothy had been with him at Athens. It was an act of self-denial for their sakes that Paul deprived himself of the presence of Timothy at Athens, which would have been so cheering to him in the midst of philosophic cavillers; but from love to the Thessalonians, he is well content to be left all "alone" in the great city.<span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_thessalonians/3-1.htm" title="Why when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good to be left at Athens alone;...">1 Thessalonians 3:1-5</a></span> The apostle showeth that out of his great care for<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>the Thessalonians he had sent Timothy to comfort and<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>strengthen them in the faith,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_thessalonians/3-6.htm" title="But now when Timotheus came from you to us, and brought us good tidings of your faith and charity, and that you have good remembrance of us always, desiring greatly to see us, as we also to see you:...">1 Thessalonians 3:6-8</a></span> whose good report of them had been a great<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>consolation to him in his distresses.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_thessalonians/3-8.htm" title="For now we live, if you stand fast in the Lord....">1 Thessalonians 3:8-10</a></span> He testifieth his thankfulness to God, and<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>earnest desire to see them,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_thessalonians/3-11.htm" title="Now God himself and our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way to you....">1 Thessalonians 3:11-13</a></span> praying God to guide him to them, and for their<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>increase in love and holiness unto the end.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The apostle proceeds upon the same argument to confirm his love to them, and care of them, that they might not doubt of it because of his long absence from them. Therefore he tells them, that though he could not come himself, yet he sent Timothy to them from Athens; which we find not mentioned in the Acts by Luke: and his love herein is commended the more: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. Because he sent him out of a strong impulse of affection, he could not <span class="ital">forbear</span> any <span class="ital">longer, </span> or bear, it was a heavy burden to him till he had done it, as the word imports. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2.

Zeitalters</span>, p. 249) and Alford (<span class="ital">Proleg.</span> p. 45), understand this of Paul’s being left alone at Athens, Timotheus not having been previously there with the apostle. They assume that Timotheus, left behind at Berea (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-14.htm" title="And then immediately the brothers sent away Paul to go as it were to the sea: but Silas and Timotheus stayed there still.">Acts 17:14</a>), either at the time of his being left behind, or at some later period, received the direction from the apostle, countermanding the charge given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-15.htm" title="And they that conducted Paul brought him to Athens: and receiving a commandment to Silas and Timotheus for to come to him with all speed, they departed.">Acts 17:15</a>, that <span class="ital">before</span> proceeding to Athens, he should return <span class="ital">from Berea</span> to Thessalonica to strengthen the church there. This view is brought forward from a desire of reconciling our passage with the narrative in the Acts of the Apostles. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-16.htm" title="Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred in him, when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry.">Acts 17:16</a> informs us only of a <span class="ital">waiting</span> for Timotheus at Athens, but not of his arrival there; on the contrary, it is stated that Silas and Timotheus did not return from Macedonia until the residence of the apostle at <span class="ital">Corinth</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-5.htm" title="And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in the spirit, and testified to the Jews that Jesus was Christ.">Acts 18:5</a>). But this view does not correspond with the <span class="ital">natural wording</span> of our passage, as <span class="greekheb">καταλειφθῆναι</span>, <span class="ital">to be left behind, to remain behind</span>, evidently presupposes the previous <span class="ital">presence</span> of Timotheus. We must therefore, with Zanchius, Piscator, Cornelius a Lapide, Beza, Wolf, Benson, Macknight, Eichhorn, Schott, Olshausen, de Wette, Koch, Hofmann, and others, suppose that Timotheus actually came from Berea to Athens, and was sent from it by the apostle to Thessalonica.

Alone in Athens, in the very metropolis of idolatry. Compare with this the common saying, "Alone in London." In the Acts of the Apostles we are informed that Paul came to Athens alone, and that there he waited for Silas and Timothy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-14.htm">Acts 17:14</a>, ]5), and that these fellow-workers rejoined him at Corinth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-5.htm">Acts 18:5</a>). Many expositors, however, from this and the next verse, infer that Timothy at least joined Paul at Athens, but was sent back by him to Thessalonica, to inquire into the condition of his converts in that city. Such is the opinion of Olshausen, Neander, De Wette, Lunemann, Hofmann, Koch, and Schott; and, among English expositors, of Macknight, Paley, Eadie, Jowett, Ellicott, and Wordsworth. There is no contradiction between this view and the narrative of the Acts. Luke merely omits to mention Timothy's short visit to Athens and departure from it, and relates only the final reunion of these three fellow-workers at Corinth. Indeed, Paley gives this coming of Timothy to Athens as one of the undesigned coincidences between this Epistle and the Acts of the Apostles. Still, however, we are not necessitated to suppose that Timothy joined the apostle at Athens. The words admit of the opinion that he was sent by Paul direct from Beraea, and not from Athens; and that he and Silas did not join Paul until they came from Macedonia to Corinth. Such is the opinion of Hug, Wieseler, Koppe, Alford, and Vaughan. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/1_thessalonians/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Forbear (&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;)<p>Lit. no longer forbearing.
