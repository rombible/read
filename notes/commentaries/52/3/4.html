The apostle's design was to establish and comfort the Thessalonians as to the object of their faith, that Jesus Christ was the Saviour of the world; and as to the recompence of faith, which was more than enough to make up all their losses, and to reward all their labours. But he feared his labours would be in vain. If the devil cannot hinder ministers from labouring in the word and doctrine, he will, if possible, hinder the success of their labours. No one would willingly labour in vain. It is the will and purpose of God, that we enter into his kingdom through many afflictions. And the apostles, far from flattering people with the expectation of worldly prosperity in religion, told them plainly they must count upon trouble in the flesh. Herein they followed the example of their great Master, the Author of our faith. Christians were in danger, and they should be forewarned; they will thus be kept from being improved by any devices of the tempter.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_thessalonians/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For verily, when we were with you, we told you before ... - It is not mentioned in the history <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/17.htm">Acts 17</a> that Paul thus predicted that special trials would come upon them, but there is no improbability in what is here said. He was with them long enough to discourse to them on a great variety of topics, and nothing can be more probable, than that in their circumstances, the subjects of persecution and affliction would be prominent topics of discourse. There was every reason to apprehend that they would meet with opposition on account of their religion, and nothing was more natural than that Paul should endearour to prepare their minds for it beforehand,<p>That we should suffer tribulation - We who preached to you; perhaps also including those to whom they preached.<p>Even as it came to pass, and ye know - When Paul, Silas, and Timothy were driven away, and when the church was so much agitated, by the opposition of the Jews; <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/17-5.htm">Acts 17:5-8</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_thessalonians/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. that we should suffer&#8212;Greek, "that we are about (we are sure) to suffer" according to the appointment of God (1Th 3:3).<p>even as&#8212;"even (exactly) as it both came to pass and ye know"; ye know both that it came to pass, and that we foretold it (compare Joh 13:19). The correspondence of the event to the prediction powerfully confirms faith: "Forewarned, forearmed" [Edmunds]. The repetition of "ye know," so frequently, is designed as an argument, that being forewarned of coming affliction, they should be less readily "moved" by it.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_thessalonians/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The apostle having said that they knew they were appointed to sufferings, tells them here they knew it because he had told them of it.
