The “if” implies no doubt: “if we believe (as we do), then,” &c.—merely clearing the ground for a logical deduction. The writer does not care to <span class= "ital">prove</span> so well-known a fact as the resurrection of Christ; he only argues from the clear faith of the Thessalonians with regard to it.<p><span class= "bld">Jesus died and rose again.</span>—Notice the human name; for though it is true that as God He raised Himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-18.htm" title="No man takes it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again.

We should have expected either the omission of “we believe that” in the first, or the insertion of it in the second: it makes the statement of the second, however, more direct or authoritative.<p><span class= "bld">Which sleep in Jesus.</span>—Rather, <span class= "ital">which were laid to sleep through Jesus.</span> The meaning of the preposition, however, is not widely different from “in.” The simpler words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-13.htm" title="And I heard a voice from heaven saying to me, Write, Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from now on: Yes, said the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors; and their works do follow them.">Revelation 14:13</a> mean “dying in full communion still with Him.” Our present phrase makes Him, as it were, the <span class= "ital">way, </span>or <span class= "ital">door, by which</span> they journeyed to death: He <span class= "ital">surrounded them as they sank to rest</span> (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-9.htm" title="I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture.">John 10:9</a>.) Additional sweetness is imparted to the phrase by the use of the metaphor of <span class= "ital">sleep;</span> but it is, perhaps, too much to say, as Dean Alford does, that “falling asleep” is here contrasted with “dying,” in this sense:—“Who through the power of Jesus fell asleep instead of dying”—for the word is even used of <span class= "ital">a judicial punishment</span> of death in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-30.htm" title="For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.">1Corinthians 11:30</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Will God bring with him</span>—<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, with Jesus. In the Greek the word <span class= "ital">God</span> stands in an unemphatic position—“Even so will God bring,” implying that it was God also who had raised Jesus from the dead. But St. Paul is not content with saying, “Even so will God <span class= "ital">raise</span> those who passed through Christ to death.” The thought of the Advent is so supreme with him that he passes at once to a moment beyond resurrection. If the question be asked from <span class= "ital">whence</span> God will bring the dead along with Christ, it must be answered, from Paradise, and the persons brought must be the disembodied <span class= "ital">spirits;</span> for in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm" title="For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:">1Thessalonians 4:16</a> this coming of the Lord with the saints is the signal for the dead—<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the <span class= "ital">bodies</span>—to rise. It must be owned, however, that this manner of speaking is unusual. Jesus is no longer in Paradise, for the spirits to be brought thence <span class= "ital">with Him;</span> and one would have expected something more like “bringing <span class= "ital">up”</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-20.htm" title="Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant,">Hebrews 13:20</a>), as it is always considered a <span class= "ital">descent</span> into “hell” or Paradise. Because of this difficulty (which however is more in form than reality), some take the words to mean, “God will lead them by the same path with Christ”—<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>will make their whole career (including resurrection) conform with His, comparing the same verb in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-14.htm" title="For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.">Romans 8:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-10.htm" title="For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.">Hebrews 2:10</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/maclaren/1_thessalonians/4.htm">MacLaren's Expositions</a></div>1 Thessalonians <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">SLEEPING THROUGH JESUS</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-14.htm" title="For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.">1 Thessalonians 4:14</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>That expression is not unusual, in various forms, in the Apostle’s writings. It suggests a very tender and wonderful thought of closeness and union between our Lord and the living dead, so close as that He is, as it were, the atmosphere in which they move, or the house in which they dwell. But, tender and wonderful as the thought is, it is not exactly the Apostle’s idea here. For, accurately rendered--and accuracy in regard to Scripture language is not pedantry--the words run, ‘Them which sleep through Jesus.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Now, that is a strange phrase, and, I suppose, its strangeness is the reason why our translators have softened it down to the more familiar and obvious ‘in Jesus.’ We can understand living through Christ, on being sacred through Christ, but what can sleeping through Christ mean? I shall hope to answer the question presently, but, in the meantime, I only wish to point out what the Apostle does say, and to plead for letting him say it, strange though it sounds. For the strange and the difficult phrases of Scripture are like the hard quartz reefs in which gold is, and if we slur them over we are likely to loose the treasure. Let us try if we can find what the gold here may be.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Now, there are only two thoughts that I wish to dwell upon as suggested by these words. One is the softened aspect of death, and of the state of the Christian dead; and the other is the ground or cause of that softened aspect.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. First, then, the softened aspect of death, and of the state of the Christian dead.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is to Jesus primarily that the New Testament writers owe their use of this gracious emblem of sleep. For, as you remember, the word was twice upon our Lord’s lips; once when, over the twelve-years-old maid from whom life had barely ebbed away, He said, ‘She is not dead, but sleepeth’; and once when in regard of the man Lazarus, from whom life had removed further, He said, ‘Our friend sleepeth, but I go that I may awake him out of sleep.’ But Jesus was not the originator of the expression. You find it in the Old Testament, where the prophet Daniel, speaking of the end of the days and the bodily Resurrection, designates those who share in it as ‘them that sleep in the dust of the earth.’ And the Old Testament was not the sole origin of the phrase. For it is too natural, too much in accordance with the visibilities of death, not to have suggested itself to many hearts, and been shrined in many languages. Many an inscription of Greek and Roman date speaks of death under this figure; but almost always it is with the added, deepened note of despair, that it is a sleep which knows no waking, but lasts through eternal night.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Now, the Christian thought associated with this emblem is the precise opposite of the pagan one. The pagan heart shrank from naming the ugly thing because it was so ugly. So dark and deep a dread coiled round the man, as he contemplated it, that he sought to drape the dreadfulness in some kind of thin, transparent veil, and to put the buffer of a word between him and its hideousness. But the Christian’s motive for the use of the word is the precise opposite. He uses the gentler expression because the thing has become gentler.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is profoundly significant that throughout the whole of the New Testament the plain, naked word ‘death’ is usually applied, not to the physical fact which we ordinarily designate by the name, but to the grim thing of which that physical fact is only the emblem and the parable, viz., the true death which lies in the separation of the soul from God; whilst predominately the New Testament usage calls the physical fact by some other gentler form of expression, because, as I say, the gentleness has enfolded the thing to be designated.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>For instance, you find one class of representations which speak of death as being a departing and a being with Christ; or which call it, as one of the apostles does, an ‘exodus,’ where it is softened down to be merely a change of environment, a change of locality. Then another class of representations speak of it as ‘putting off this my tabernacle,’ or, the dissolution of the ‘earthly house’--where there is a broad, firm line of demarcation drawn between the inhabitant and the habitation, and the thing is softened down to be a mere change of dwelling. Again, another class of expressions speak of it as being an ‘offering,’ where the main idea is that of a voluntary surrender, a sacrifice or libation of myself, and my life poured out upon the altar of God. But sweetest, deepest, most appealing to all our hearts, is that emblem of my text, ‘them that sleep.’ It is used, if I count rightly, some fourteen times in the New Testament, and it carries with it large and plain lessons, on which I touch but for a moment. What, then, does this metaphor say to us?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Well, it speaks first of rest. That is not altogether an attractive conception to some of us. If it be taken exclusively it is by no means wholesome. I suppose that the young, and the strong, and the eager, and the ambitious, and the prosperous rather shrink from the notion of their activities being stiffened into slumber. But, dear friends, there are some of us like tired children in a fair, who would fain have done with the weariness, who have made experience of the distractions and bewildering changes, whose backs are stiffened with toil, whose hearts are heavy with loss. And to all of us, in some moods, the prospect of shuffling off this weary coil of responsibilities and duties and tasks and sorrows, and of passing into indisturbance and repose, appeals. I believe, for my part, that, after all, the deepest longing of men--though they search for it through toil and effort--is for repose. As the poet has taught us, ‘there is no joy but calm.’ Every heart is weary enough, and heavy laden, and labouring enough, to feel the sweetness of a promise of rest:--<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> ‘Sleep, full of rest from head to foot, Lie still, dry dust, secure of change.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Yes! but the rest of which our emblem speaks is, as I believe, only applicable to the bodily frame. The word ‘sleep’ is a transcript of what sense enlightened by faith sees in that still form, with the folded hands and the quiet face and the closed eyes. But let us remember that this repose, deep and blessed as it is, is not, as some would say, the repose of unconsciousness. I do not believe, and I would have you not believe, that this emblem refers to the vigorous, spiritual life, or that the passage from out of the toil and moil of earth into the calm of the darkness beyond has any power in limiting or suspending the vital force of the man.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Why, the very metaphor itself tells us that the sleeper is not unconscious. He is parted from the outer world, he is unaware of externals. When Stephen knelt below the old wall, and was surrounded by howling fanatics that slew him, one moment he was gashed with stones and tortured, and the next ‘he fell on sleep.’ They might howl, and the stones fly as they would, and he was all unaware of it. Like Jonah sleeping in the hold, what mattered the roaring of the storm to him? But separation from externals does not mean suspense of life or of consciousness, and the slumberer often dreams, and is aware of himself persistently throughout his slumber. Nay! some of his faculties are set at liberty to work more energetically, because his connection with the outer world is for the time suspended.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And so I say that what on the hither side is sleep, on the further side is awaking, and that the complex whole of the condition of the sainted dead may be described with equal truth by either metaphor; ‘they sleep in Jesus’; or, ‘when I awake I shall be satisfied with Thy likeness.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Scripture, as it seems to me, distinctly carries this limitation of the emblem. For what does it mean when the Apostle says that to depart and to be with Christ is far better? Surely he who thus spoke conceived that these two things were contemporaneous, the departing and the being with Him. And surely he who thus spoke could not have conceived that a millennium-long parenthesis of slumberous unconsciousness was to intervene between the moment of his decease and the moment of his fellowship with Jesus. How could a man prefer that dormant state to the state here, of working for and living with the Lord? Surely, being with Him must mean that we know where we are, and who is our companion.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And what does that text mean: ‘Ye are come unto the spirits of just men made perfect,’ unless it means that of these two classes of persons who are thus regarded as brought into living fellowship, each is aware of the other? Does perfecting of the spirit mean the smiting of the spirit into unconsciousness? Surely not, and surely in view of such words as these, we must recognise the fact that, however limited and imperfect may be the present connection of the disembodied dead, who sleep in Christ, with external things, they know themselves, they know their home and their companion, and they know the blessedness in which they are lapped.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But another thought which is suggested by this emblem is, as I have already said, most certainly the idea of awaking. The pagans said, as indeed one of their poets has it, ‘Suns can sink and return, but for us, when our brief light sinks, there is but one perpetual night of slumber.’ The Christian idea of death is, that it is transitory as a sleep in the morning, and sure to end. As St. Augustine says somewhere, ‘Wherefore are they called sleepers, but because in the day of the Lord they will be reawakened?’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And so these are the thoughts, very imperfectly spoken, I know, which spring like flowers from this gracious metaphor ‘them that sleep’--rest and awaking; rest and consciousness.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. Note the ground of this softened aspect.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>They ‘sleep through Him.’ It is by reason of Christ and His work, and by reason of that alone, that death’s darkness is made beautiful, and death’s grimness is softened down to this. Now, in order to grasp the full meaning of such words as these of the Apostle, we must draw a broad distinction between the physical fact of the ending of corporeal life and the mental condition which is associated with it by us. What we call death, if I may so say, is a complex thing--a bodily phenomenon plus conscience, the sense of sin, the certainty of retribution in the dim beyond. And you have to take these elements apart. The former remains, but if the others are removed, the whole has changed its character and is become another thing, and a very little thing.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The mere physical fact is a trifle. Look at it as you see it in the animals; look at it as you see it in men when they actually come to it. In ninety-nine cases out of a hundred it is painless and easy, and men sink into slumber. Strange, is it not, that so small a reality should have power to cast over human life so immense and obscuring a shadow! Why? Because, as the Apostle says, ‘the sting of death is sin,’ and if you can take the sting out of it, then there is very little to fear, and it comes down to be an insignificant and transient element in our experience.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Now, the death of Jesus Christ takes away, if I may so say, the nimbus of apprehension and dread arising from conscience and sin, and the forecast of retribution. There is nothing left for us to face except the physical fact, and any rough soldier, with a coarse, red coat upon him, will face that for eighteenpence a day, and think himself well paid. Jesus Christ has abolished death, leaving the mere shell, but taking all the substance out of it. It has become a different thing to men, because in that death of His He has exhausted the bitterness, and has made it possible that we should pass into the shadow, and not fear either conscience or sin or judgment.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In this connection I cannot but notice with what a profound meaning the Apostle, in this very verse, uses the bare, naked word in reference to Him, and the softened one in reference to us. ‘If we believe that Jesus Christ died and rose again, even so them also which sleep.’ Ah! yes! He died indeed, bearing all that terror with which men’s consciences have invested death. He died indeed, bearing on Himself the sins of the world. He died that no man henceforward need ever die in that same fashion. His death makes our deaths sleep, and His Resurrection makes our sleep calmly certain of a waking.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>So, dear ‘brethren, I would not have you ignorant concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not even as others which have no hope.’ And I would have you to remember that, whilst Christ by His work has made it possible that the terror may pass away, and death may be softened and minimised into slumber, it will not be so with you--unless you are joined to Him, and by trust in the power of His death and the overflowing might of His Resurrection, have made sure that what He has passed through, you will pass through, and where He is, and what He is, you will be also.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Two men die by one railway accident, sitting side by side upon one seat, smashed in one collision. But though the outward fact is the same about each, the reality of their deaths is infinitely different. The one falls asleep through Jesus, in Jesus; the other dies indeed, and the death of his body is only a feeble shadow of the death of his spirit. Do you knit yourself to the Life, which is Christ, and then ‘he that believeth on Me shall never die.’ <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_thessalonians/4.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-14.htm" title="For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.">1 Thessalonians 4:14</a></span>. <span class="ital">For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again </span>— Namely, 1st, In attestation of the truth of his doctrine, in which he taught expressly the immortality of the soul, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-28.htm" title="And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.">Matthew 10:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-43.htm" title="And Jesus said to him, Truly I say to you, To day shall you be with me in paradise.">Luke 23:43</a>; and the resurrection of the body, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/5-28.htm" title="Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice,...">John 5:28-29</a>. 2d, For the expiation of sin, and the procuring of justification and peace with God for the penitent that should believe in him, however guilty they had before been, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-26.htm" title="For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world has he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.">Hebrews 9:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/4-24.htm" title="But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead;...">Romans 4:24-25</a>. 3d, That he might procure and receive for us the Holy Spirit, to work that repentance and faith in us, assure us of our justification and of our title to that future felicity, and to prepare us for it by inward holiness; and, 4th, That he might ascend, take possession of it in our name, receive our departing souls, and raise from the dust our fallen and corrupted bodies, and so exalt us to that immortal, glorious, and blessed state; <span class="ital">even so them also which sleep in Jesus — Who die in the Lord, </span>(<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-13.htm" title="And I heard a voice from heaven saying to me, Write, Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from now on: Yes, said the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors; and their works do follow them.">Revelation 14:13</a>,) in union with him, and possessed of an interest in him; <span class="ital">will God bring with him </span>— They will be found in the train of his magnificent retinue at his final appearance, when he comes to judge the world, and reward his faithful servants.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_thessalonians/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:13-18 Here is comfort for the relations and friends of those who die in the Lord. Grief for the death of friends is lawful; we may weep for our own loss, though it may be their gain. Christianity does not forbid, and grace does not do away, our natural affections. Yet we must not be excessive in our sorrows; this is too much like those who have no hope of a better life. Death is an unknown thing, and we know little about the state after death; yet the doctrines of the resurrection and the second coming of Christ, are a remedy against the fear of death, and undue sorrow for the death of our Christian friends; and of these doctrines we have full assurance. It will be some happiness that all the saints shall meet, and remain together for ever; but the principal happiness of heaven is to be with the Lord, to see him, live with him, and enjoy him for ever. We should support one another in times sorrow; not deaden one another's spirits, or weaken one another's hands. And this may be done by the many lessons to be learned from the resurrection of the dead, and the second coming of Christ. What! comfort a man by telling him he is going to appear before the judgment-seat of God! Who can feel comfort from those words? That man alone with whose spirit the Spirit of God bears witness that his sins are blotted out, and the thoughts of whose heart are purified by the Holy Spirit, so that he can love God, and worthily magnify his name. We are not in a safe state unless it is thus with us, or we are desiring to be so.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_thessalonians/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again - That is, if we believe this, we ought also to believe that those who have died in. the faith of Jesus will be raised from the dead. The meaning is not that the fact of the resurrection depends on our believing that Jesus rose, but that the death and resurrection of the Saviour were connected with the resurrection of the saints; that the one followed from the other, and that the one was as certain as the other. The doctrine of the resurrection of the saints so certainly follows from that of the resurrection of Christ, that, if the one is believed, the other ought to be also; see the notes on <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-12.htm">1 Corinthians 15:12-14</a>.<p>Which sleep in Jesus - A most beautiful expression. It is not merely that they have calm repose - like a gentle slumber - in the hope of awaking again, but that this is "in Jesus" - or "through" (&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#768;  dia) him; that is, his death and resurrection are the cause of their quiet and calm repose. They do not "sleep" in paganism, or in infidelity, or in the gloom of atheism - but in the blessed hope which Jesus has imparted. They lie, as he did, in the tomb - free from pain and sorrow, and with the certainty of being raised up again.<p>They sleep in Jesus, and are bless'd,<p>How kind their slumbers are;<p>From sufferings and from sin released,<p>And freed from every snare.<p>When, therefore, we think of the death of saints, let us think of what Jesus was in the tomb of Joseph of Arimathea. Such is the sleep of our pious friends now in the grave; such will be our own when we die.<p>Will God bring with him - This does not mean that God will bring them with him from heaven when the Saviour comes - though it will be true that their spirits will descend with the Saviour; but it means that he will bring them from their graves, and will conduct them with him to glory, to be with him; compare notes, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-3.htm">John 14:3</a>. The declaration, as it seems to me, is designed to teach the general truth that the redeemed are so united with Christ that they shall share the same destiny as he does. As the head was raised, so will all the members be. As God brought Christ from the grave, so will he bring them; that is, his resurrection made it certain that they would rise. It is a great and universal truth that God will bring all from their graves who "sleep in Jesus;" or that they shall all rise. The apostle does not, therefore, refer so much to the time when this would occur - meaning that it would happen when the Lord Jesus should return - as to the fact that there was an established connection between him and his people, which made it certain that if they died united with him by faith, they would be as certainly brought from the grave as he was.<p>If, however, it means, as Prof. Bush (Anastasis, pp. 266, 267) supposes, that they will be brought with him from heaven, or will accompany him down, it does not prove that there must have been a previous resurrection, for the full force of the language would be met by the supposition that their spirits had ascended to heaven, and would be brought with him to be united to their bodies when raised. If this be the correct interpretation, then there is probably an allusion to such passages as the following, representing the coming of the Lord accompanied by his saints. "The Lord my God shall come, and all the saints with thee." <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-5.htm">Zechariah 14:5</a>. "And Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these, saying, Behold, the Lord cometh, with thousand of his saints;" Jde 1:14. "Who," says President Dwight (Serm. 164), "are those whom God will bring with Him at this time? Certainly not the bodies of his saints ... The only answer is, he will bring with him 'the spirits of just men made perfect.'" <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_thessalonians/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14. For if&#8212;confirmation of his statement, 1Th 4:13, that the removal of ignorance as to the sleeping believers would remove undue grief respecting them. See 1Th 4:13, "hope." Hence it appears our hope rests on our faith ("if we believe"). "As surely as we all believe that Christ died and rose again (the very doctrine specified as taught at Thessalonica, Ac 17:3), so also will God bring those laid to sleep by Jesus with Him (Jesus)." (So the order and balance of the members of the Greek sentence require us to translate). Believers are laid in sleep by Jesus, and so will be brought back from sleep with Jesus in His train when He comes. The disembodied souls are not here spoken of; the reference is to the sleeping bodies. The facts of Christ's experience are repeated in the believer's. He died and then rose: so believers shall die and then rise with Him. But in His case death is the term used, 1Co 15:3, 6, &c.; in theirs, sleep; because His death has taken for them the sting from death. The same Hand that shall raise them is that which laid them to sleep. "Laid to sleep by Jesus," answers to "dead in Christ" (1Th 4:16).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_thessalonians/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> As in the former verse the apostle made use of the hope of the resurrection, as an argument against immoderate sorrow, so here he proves the resurrection by Christ’s rising again, &c. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again; </span> he supposeth they did believe that Christ died and rose again; it was that which he had taught them, and which they had received, as being the two first and fundamental points of the Christian faith, without which they could not have been a church of Christ. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Question.</span> But how doth Christ’s resurrection prove the resurrection of the saints?

Others understand it of God the Father, who will raise the dead, and then bring them to his Son, and bring them with him to heaven.

As every Christian does, for both the death and resurrection of Christ are fundamental articles of faith; nothing is more certain or more comfortable, and more firmly to be believed, than that Christ died for the sins of his people, and rose again for their justification; on these depend the present peace, joy, and comfort of the saints, and their everlasting salvation and happiness: and no less certain and comfortable, and as surely to be believed, is what follows, <p>even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him. The saints that are dead are not only represented as asleep, as before, but as "asleep in Jesus"; to distinguish them from the other dead, the wicked; for the phrase of sleeping in death is promiscuously used of good and bad, though most commonly applied to good men: and so say the Jews (c), <p>"we used to speak of just men, not as dead, but as sleeping; saying, afterwards such an one fell asleep, signifying that the death of the righteous is nothing else than a sleep.'' <p>To represent death as a sleep makes it very easy and familiar; but it is more so, when it is considered as sleeping in Jesus, in the arms of Jesus; and such as are asleep in him must needs be at rest, and in safety: some join the phrase "in", or "by Jesus", with the word bring, and read the passage thus, "them that are asleep, by Jesus will God bring with him"; intimating, that God will raise up the dead bodies of the saints by Christ, as God-man and Mediator; and through him will bring them to eternal glory, and save them by him, as he has determined: others render the words, "them which sleep through", or "by Jesus"; or die for his sake, and so restrain them to the martyrs; who they suppose only will have part in the first resurrection, and whom God will bring with Jesus at his second coming; but the coming of Christ will be "with all his saints"; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-13.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:13</a> wherefore they are best rendered, "them that sleep in Jesus"; that is, "in the faith of Jesus", as the Arabic version renders it: not in the lively exercise of faith on Christ, for this is not the case of all the saints at death; some of them are in the dark, and go from hence under a cloud, and yet go safe, and may be said to die, or sleep, in Jesus, and will be brought with him; but who have the principle, and hold the doctrine of faith, are, and live and die, true believers; who die interested in Christ, in union with him, being chosen and blessed, and preserved in him from everlasting, and effectually called by his grace in time, and brought to believe in him; these, both their souls and bodies, are united to Christ, and are his care and charge; and which union remains in death, and by virtue of it the bodies of the saints will be raised at the last day: so that there may be the strongest assurance, that such will God bring with him; either God the Father will bring them with his Son, or Jehovah the Son will bring them with himself; he will raise them from the dead, and unite them to their souls, or spirits, he will bring with him; the consideration of which may serve greatly to mitigate and abate sorrow for deceased friends. <p>(c) Shebet Juda, p. 294.

Reason not of <span class="greekheb">οὐ θέλομεν ὑμᾶς ἀγνοεῖν</span>, but of <span class="greekheb">ἵνα μὴ λυπῆσθε</span>. The Thessalonians were not to mourn, for <span class="ital">Christ</span> has risen from the dead; but if <span class="ital">this</span> fact be certain, then it follows that they also who are fallen asleep, about whom the Thessalonians were so troubled, will be raised. There lies at the foundation of this proof, which Paul uses as a supposition, the idea that Christ and believers form together an organism of indissoluble unity, of which Christ is the Head and Christians are the members; consequently what happens to the Head must likewise happen to the members; where that is, there these must also be. Comp. already Pelagius: Qui caput suscitavit, etiam caetera membra suscitaturum se promittit. From the nature of this argument it is evident (1) that those who are asleep, about whom the Thessalonians grieved, must already have been Christians; (2) that their complete exclusion from the blessed fellowship with Christ was dreaded.[54]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">εἰ γὰρ πιστεύομεν</span>] <span class="ital">for if we believe</span>. <span class="greekheb">εἰ</span> is not so much as “<span class="ital">quum</span>, since, because” (Flatt), also not equivalent to <span class="ital">quodsi</span>: “for as we believe” (Baumgarten-Crusius), but is here, as always, hypothetical. But since Paul from the hypothetical protasis, without further demonstrating it, immediately draws the inference in question, it is clear that he supposes the fact of the death and resurrection of <span class="ital">Christ</span> as an absolute recognised truth, as, indeed, among the early Christians generally no doubt was raised concerning the reality of <span class="ital">this</span> fact. For even in reference to the Corinthian church, among whom doubts prevailed concerning the resurrection of the dead, Paul, in combating this view, could appeal to the resurrection of Christ as an actual recognised truth; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/15-12.htm" title="Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?...">1 Corinthians 15:12-23</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The apodosis, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-14.htm" title="For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.">1 Thessalonians 4:14</a>, does not exactly correspond with the protasis.

Winer, p. 478 [E. T. 679].<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΙᾺ ΤΟῦ ἸΗΣΟῦ</span></span></span>] is (by Chry sostom, Ambrosiaster, Calvin, Hemming, Zanchius, Estius, Balduin, Vorstius, Cornelius a Lapide, Beza, Grotius, Calixt, Calov, Wolf, Whitby, Benson, Bengel, Macknight, Koppe, Jowett, Hilgenfeld (<span class="ital">Zeitschr. f. wissenschaftl. Theolog.</span>, Halle 1862, p. 239), Riggenbach, and others) connected with <span class="greekheb">τοὺς κοιμηθέντας</span>, and then the sense is given: “those who have fallen asleep, in Christ.”[55] But this would be expressed by <span class="greekheb">ἐν τῷ Ἰησοῦ</span>, as <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΟἹ ΔΙᾺ ΤΟῦ ἸΗΣΟῦ ΚΟΙΜΗΘΈΝΤΕς</span></span></span> would <span class="ital">at most</span> contain a designation of those whom Christ had brought to death, consequently of the Christian <span class="ital">martyrs</span>. Salmeron, Hammond, Joseph Mede, <span class="ital">Opp.</span> p. 519, and Thiersch (<span class="ital">die Kirche im apostol. Zeitalter</span>, Frankf. u. Erlang. 1852, p. 138) actually interpret the words in this sense. Yet how contrary to the apostle’s design such a mention of the martyrs would be is evident, as according to it the resurrection and participation in the glory of the returning Christ would be most inappropriately limited to a very small portion of Christians; not to mention that, first, the indications in both Epistles do not afford the slightest justification of the idea of persecutions, which ended in <span class="ital">bloody death</span>; and, secondly, the formula <span class="greekheb">κοιμηθῆναι διὰ τινός</span> would be much too weak to express the idea of martyrdom. Also in the fact that Paul does not speak of the dead in general, but specially of the Christian dead, there is no reason to unite <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΟῪς ΚΟΙΜΗΘΈΝΤΑς</span></span></span> with <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΙᾺ ΤΟῦ ἸΗΣΟῦ</span></span></span>; for the extent of the idea of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΟἹ ΚΟΙΜΗΘΈΝΤΕς</span></span></span> in our passage is understood from the relation of the apodosis, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-14.htm" title="For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.">1 Thessalonians 4:14</a>, to the protasis <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΕἸ ΠΙΣΤΕΎΟΜΕΝ Κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Λ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> We are accordingly constrained to unite <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΙᾺ ΤΟῦ ἸΗΣΟῦ</span></span></span> with <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἌΞΕΙ</span></span></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Christ is elsewhere by Paul and in the New Testament generally considered as the instrument by which the almighty act of God, the resurrection of the dead, is effected; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-21.htm" title="For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead.">1 Corinthians 15:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-28.htm" title="Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice,">John 5:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-39.htm" title="And this is the Father's will which has sent me, that of all which he has given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day.">John 6:39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-44.htm" title="No man can come to me, except the Father which has sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day.">John 6:44</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-54.htm" title="Whoever eats my flesh, and drinks my blood, has eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.">John 6:54</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἌΞΕΙ</span></span></span>] <span class="ital">will bring with Him</span>, is a pregnant expression, whilst, instead of the act of <span class="ital">resuscitation</span>, that which follows the act in time is given. And, indeed, the further clause <span class="greekheb">σὺν αὐτῷ</span>, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> <span class="greekheb">σὺν Ἰησοῦ</span> (incorrectly Zacharius and Koppe = <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Ὡς ΑὐΤΌΝ</span></span></span>), is united in a pregnant form with <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἌΞΕΙ</span></span></span>. God will through Christ bring <span class="ital">with Him</span> those who are asleep, that is, so that they are then united with Christ, and have a complete share in the benefits of His appearance. Hofmann arbitrarily transforms the words into the thought: “that Jesus will not appear, God will not introduce Him again into the world, without their deceased brethren coming with Him.” For the words instruct us not concerning Jesus, but concerning the <span class="greekheb">κοιμηθέντες</span>; it is not expressed in what manner the return of Christ will take place, but what will be the final fate of those who have fallen asleep. The apostle selects this pregnant form of expression instead of the simple <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΓΕΡΕῖ</span></span></span>, because the thought of a separation of deceased Christians from Christ was that which so greatly troubled the Thessalonians, and therefore it was his endeavour to remove this anxiety, this doubting uncertainty, as soon as possible.[56]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[54] Hofmann’s views are very distorted and perverted. He will not acknowledge that from the fact of the resurrection of Christ, the resurrection of those fallen asleep in Thessalonica is deduced; and—against which the <span class="greekheb">οὕτως καί</span> of the apodosis should have guarded him—he deduces the aimless platitude, that “the apostle with the words: <span class="greekheb">ὁ Θεὸς τοὺς κοιμηθέντας διὰ τοῦ Ἰησοῦ ἄξει σὺν αὐτῷ</span>, gives an assurance which avails us in the case of our death, if we believe on the death and resurrection of Jesus.” As Hofmann misinterprets the words, so also does Luthardt, <span class="ital">supra</span>, p. 140 f.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[55] Also Alford connects <span class="greekheb">διὰ τοῦ Ἰησοῦ</span> with <span class="greekheb">κοιμηθέντας</span>; but then arbitrarily (comp. <span class="greekheb">οἱ νεκροὶ ἐν Χριστῷ</span>, ver. 16) pressing the expression <span class="greekheb">κοιμηθέντας</span> (<span class="greekheb">οἱ κοιμηθέντες</span> are distinguished from the merely <span class="greekheb">θανόντες</span>. What makes this distinction? Why are they asleep and not dead? <span class="ital">By whom</span> have they been thus privileged? Certainly <span class="greekheb">διὰ τοῦ Ἰησοῦ</span>), and inappropriately regarding the constructions <span class="greekheb">εὐχαριστεῖν διὰ Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-8.htm" title="First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world.">Romans 1:8</a>; <span class="greekheb">εἰρήνην ἔχειν διὰ Ἰησοῦ</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-1.htm" title="Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ:">Romans 5:1</a>, <span class="greekheb">καυχᾶσθαι διὰ Ἰησοῦ</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-11.htm" title="And not only so, but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement.">Romans 5:11</a>, as analogous expressions, he brings out the following grammatically impossible meaning: If we believe that Jesus died and rose again, then even thus also <span class="ital">those, of whom we say that they sleep just because of Jesus</span>, will God, etc.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[56] The idea of “a general ascension of all Christians,” which Schrader finds in this verse, and in which he perceives a mark of un-Pauline composition, because Paul thought “only on a kingdom of God on earth,” is, according to the above, introduced by him into the passage.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/1_thessalonians/4.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-14.htm" title="For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.">1 Thessalonians 4:14</a>.

Paul assumes their faith in it and argues from it. Their vivid and naïve belief in Christ’s advent within their own lifetime was the very source of their distress. Paul still shares that belief (17).—<span class="greekheb">διὰ τοῦ Ἰησοῦ</span> is an unusual expression which might, so far as grammar is concerned, go either with <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κ</span>. (so. <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, Ellic., Alford, Kabisch, Lightfoot, Findlay, Milligan) or <span class="greekheb">ἄξει</span>. The latter is the preferable construction (so most editors). The phrase is not needed (<span class="ital">cf.</span> 15) to limit <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κ</span>. to Christians (so Chrys., Calvin), for the unbelieving dead are not before the writer’s mind, and, even so, <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span> would have been the natural preposition (<span class="ital">cf.</span> 16), nor does it mean martyrdom. In the light of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-9.htm" title="For God has not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,">1 Thessalonians 5:9</a> (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-9.htm" title="Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him.">Romans 5:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-21.htm" title="For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead.">1 Corinthians 15:21</a>), it seems to connect less awkwardly with <span class="greekheb">ἄξει</span>, though not = “at the intercession of Jesus” (Rutherford). Jesus is God’s agent in the final act, commissioned to raise and muster the dead (<span class="ital">cf.</span> Stähelin, <span class="ital">Jahrb. f. deut. Theol.</span>, 1874, 189 f., and Schettler, <span class="ital">Die paul. Formel, “Durch Christus,”</span> 1997, 57 f.). The divine mission of the Christ, which is to form the climax of things, involves the resurrection of the dead who are His (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-10.htm" title="Who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him.">1 Thessalonians 5:10</a>).

So in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-9.htm" title="That if you shall confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus, and shall believe in your heart that God has raised him from the dead, you shall be saved.">Romans 10:9</a> the Apostle declares the faith that “saves” to be the belief of the heart that “God raised Jesus from the dead.” This involves everything else; it carries with it the conviction that Christ is Divine (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-4.htm" title="And declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead:">Romans 1:4</a>), and that His death brings “justification of life” for men (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-25.htm" title="Who was delivered for our offenses, and was raised again for our justification.">Romans 4:25</a>). Such faith St Paul assumes, for himself and his readers, as a fundamental fact. He speaks of “Jesus,” thinking of Him in His human Person and in the analogy of His experience to our own. He is “Firstborn of many brethren, Firstborn out of the dead” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-29.htm" title="For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers.">Romans 8:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-18.htm" title=" And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence.">Colossians 1:18</a>); and what we believe of <span class="ital">Jesus</span>, we may expect to see fulfilled in His brethren.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>even <span class="ital">so them also which sleep in Jesus</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">which fell asleep</span>.

But the Apostle does not say here “will <span class="ital">raise</span> them with Jesus,” it is not the <span class="ital">resurrection</span> of the dead that is in question, but their relation to the Parousia, their place in Christ’s approaching kingdom. Therefore he says: “God will <span class="ital">bring</span> them with Him,”—they will not be forgotten or left behind when Jesus comes in triumph.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The argument of this verse is condensed and somewhat subtle. When the Apostle begins, “If we believe” &c., we expect him to continue, “so we believe that those who died will, by the power of Christ’s resurrection, be raised to life, and will return to share His glory.” But in the eagerness of his inference St Paul passes from the certainty of <span class="ital">conviction</span> in the first member of the sentence (“If we <span class="ital">believe</span>”) to the certainty of the fact itself (“<span class="ital">God will bring</span> them”) in the second. In the same eagerness of anticipation he blends the final with the intermediate stage of restoration, making the resurrection of Jesus the pledge not of the believer’s resurrection simply (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-14.htm" title="Knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus, and shall present us with you.">2 Corinthians 4:14</a>), but of his <span class="ital">participation in Christ’s glorious advent</span>, of which His resurrection is the prelude (comp. ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-10.htm" title="And to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, even Jesus, which delivered us from the wrath to come.">1 Thessalonians 1:10</a>, “to wait for His Son from the heavens, Whom He raised from the dead,” and note). The union between Christ and the Christian, as St Paul conceives it, is such that in whatever Christ the Head does or experiences, He carries the members of His body with Him. The Christian dead are “the dead <span class="ital">in Christ</span>” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm" title="For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:">1 Thessalonians 4:16</a>); they will therefore be in due course the risen and the glorified in Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/1-12.htm" title="That the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and you in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.">2 Thessalonians 1:12</a>); comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-11.htm" title="It is a faithful saying: For if we be dead with him, we shall also live with him:">2 Timothy 2:11</a>, “If we died with Him, we shall also live with Him.” The point of the Apostle’s reasoning lies in the connection of the words “<span class="ital">died and rose</span> again.” Jesus has made a pathway through the grave, and by this passage His faithful, fallen asleep, still one with the dying, risen Jesus, will be conducted, to appear with Him at His return.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/1_thessalonians/4.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-14.htm" title="For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.">1 Thessalonians 4:14</a>. <span class="greekheb">Γὰρ</span>, <span class="ital">for</span>) The Scripture, from among so many topics of consolation in regard to death, generally brings forward this one concerning the resurrection, as principal and pre-eminent.—<span class="greekheb">ἀπέθανε</span>, <span class="ital">died</span>) This word is usually applied to Christ; whereas <span class="ital">to fall asleep</span> is applied to believers, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-3.htm" title="For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;">1 Corinthians 15:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-6.htm" title="After that, he was seen of above five hundred brothers at once; of whom the greater part remain to this present, but some are fallen asleep.">1 Corinthians 15:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-18.htm" title="Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished.">1 Corinthians 15:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-20.htm" title="But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the first fruits of them that slept.">1 Corinthians 15:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-51.htm" title="Behold, I show you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,">1 Corinthians 15:51</a>.—<span class="greekheb">οὕτω</span>) in like manner, as Jesus Himself rose, so we believe that we shall be conducted alive by the path of death.—<span class="greekheb">διὰ τοῦ Ἰησοῦ</span>, <span class="ital">in Jesus</span>) This is construed with <span class="greekheb">κοιμηθέντας</span>,[19] <span class="ital">who have fallen asleep</span>.

Our knowledge and belief of a future state, and especially of the resurrection, is founded on the resurrection of Christ (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-12.htm">1 Corinthians 15:12-20</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Even so them also which sleep in Jesus</span>; or more literally, <span class="accented">through Jesus. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Will God bring with him</span>; namely, with Jesus. These words are differently construed. Some read them thus: "Even so them also which sleep will God through Jesus bring with him" (De Wette, Lunemann); but this appears to be an awkward construction; as we must then render the clause, "will God through Jesus bring with Jesus." It is, therefore, better to refer the words, "through Jesus," to the first clause. It is through Jesus that believers fall asleep; it is he who changes the nature of death, for all his people, from being the king of terrors into a quiet and gentle sleep, from which they will awaken to eternal life. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/1_thessalonians/4.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x399;&#788;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b9; &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#837;&#834;).<p>(1) Which sleep should be, which have been laid asleep or have fallen asleep, giving the force of the passive.<p>(2) &#x394;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x399;&#788;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; can by no possibility be rendered in Jesus, which would be &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x399;&#788;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;: see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-18.htm">1 Corinthians 15:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:16</a>.

It has been explained by supposing a reference to martyrs who have died by Jesus; because of their faith in him. In that case we should expect the accusative, &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x399;&#788;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd; on account of or for the sake of Jesus.

Rend. the whole: them also that are fallen asleep will God through Jesus bring with him. Jesus is thus represented as the agent of the resurrection.
