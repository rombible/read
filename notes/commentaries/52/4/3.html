To the Gentile mind, while the wickedness of adultery or incest was fully recognised, it was a novelty to be told that fornication was a “deadly sin;” hence the strange connection in which it stands in the Synodal letter to the Gentile churches (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-20.htm" title="But that we write to them, that they abstain from pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from things strangled, and from blood.">Acts 15:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-29.htm" title="That you abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication: from which if you keep yourselves, you shall do well.

This consideration also makes it easier to understand how St. Paul can praise these Gentile Thessalonians so heartily, although they need earnest correction on this vital point. It is a true instance of the sacerdotal <span class= "ital">metriopathy</span> (or, <span class= "ital">compassionate consideration</span>) towards the ignorant and deceived. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/5-1.htm" title="For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins:">Hebrews 5:1-2</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_thessalonians/4.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_thessalonians/4-3.htm" title="For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that you should abstain from fornication:...">1 Thessalonians 4:3-6</a></span>. <span class="ital">For </span>— As we solemnly assured you, and charged you to keep continually in remembrance; <span class="ital">this is the will of God, your sanctification </span>— That, as God hath chosen us from the rest of the world to be a people dedicated to his honour and service, we should not pollute ourselves with those abominations which are so common among the heathen, but that we should be perfectly holy in heart and life; and therefore, to mention one single branch of the contrary; <span class="ital">that ye should abstain from fornication </span>— And every other kind of lewdness, so commonly practised among those who are unacquainted with the true religion.

The apostle’s meaning may be, Let every man consider his body as a vessel consecrated to the service of God, and let him dread the impiety of polluting it by any vile, dishonourable indulgence whatever, or by putting it to any base use. Or, as some think, by <span class="ital">his vessel, </span>he may mean his wife. <span class="ital">In sanctification and honour </span>— In a chaste and holy manner, answerable to that dignity which God has put upon it by making it his temple. <span class="ital">Not in the lust of concupiscence </span>— <span class="greekheb">Εν παθει επιθυμιας</span>, <span class="ital">in the passion of lust; </span>not indulging passionate desires; <span class="ital">as the Gentiles </span>— The heathen; <span class="ital">who know not God </span>— To any saving purpose; and are ignorant of that pure and sublime happiness which arises from contemplating, adoring, imitating, and having communion with him. <span class="ital">That no man go beyond </span>—<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The bounds of chastity, or of matrimony; or <span class="ital">overreach, </span>as some render <span class="greekheb">υπερβαινειν</span>; <span class="ital">and defraud </span>— Or, <span class="ital">exceed toward, his brother, in any, </span>or <span class="ital">in the, matter </span>— Namely, of which the apostle had been speaking. Beza, Le Clerc, and some others, understand this as a prohibition of injustice in general; but the context seems to determine its meaning to that kind of injury by which chastity is violated. Probably the apostle intended here to prohibit three things; fornication, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-3.htm" title="For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that you should abstain from fornication:">1 Thessalonians 4:3</a>,) passionate desire, or inordinate affection in the married state, and the breach of the marriage contract. <span class="ital">Because the Lord is the avenger of all such </span>— Will severely punish all such gross misdeeds; <span class="ital">as we also have forewarned you, </span>&c. — As I formerly testified to you when I preached to you in Thessalonica. <span class="ital">For God hath not called us </span>— In so extraordinary a manner, and separated us from the rest of the world; <span class="ital">to uncleanness </span>— To leave us at liberty to defile ourselves with any kind of sin; <span class="ital">but unto holiness </span>— Of heart and life. <span class="ital">He therefore that despiseth </span>— The commandments we give by authority from God, and according to his will; <span class="ital">despiseth not man </span>— Only or chiefly; <span class="ital">but God </span>— Speaking in and by us; <span class="ital">who hath also given unto us </span>— Who are his divinely-commissioned teachers; <span class="ital">his Holy Spirit </span>— To guide us in what we deliver.

The rule according to which all ought to walk and act, is the commandments given by the Lord Jesus Christ. Sanctification, in the renewal of their souls under the influences of the Holy Spirit, and attention to appointed duties, constituted the will of God respecting them. In aspiring after this renewal of the soul unto holiness, strict restraint must be put upon the appetites and senses of the body, and on the thoughts and inclinations of the will, which lead to wrong uses of them. The Lord calls none into his family to live unholy lives, but that they may be taught and enabled to walk before him in holiness. Some make light of the precepts of holiness, because they hear them from men; but they are God's commands, and to break them is to despise God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_thessalonians/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For this is the will of God, even your sanctification - It is the will or command of God that you should be holy. This does not refer to the purpose or decree of God, and does not mean that he intended to make them holy - but it means that it was his command that they should be holy. It was also true that it was agreeable to the divine will or purpose that they should be holy, and that he meant to use such an influence as to secure this; but this is not the truth taught here. This text, therefore, should not be brought as a proof that God intends to make his people holy, or that they are sanctified. It is a proof only that he requires holiness. The word here rendered "sanctification" - &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2;  hagiasmos - is not used in the Greek classics, but is several times found in the New Testament.

It means here "purity of life," and particularly abstinence from those vices which debase and degrade the soul Sanctification consists in two things:<p>(1) in "ceasing to do evil;" and,<p>(2) in "learning to do well." Or in other words, the first work of sanctification is in overcoming the propensities to evil in our nature, and checking and subduing the unholy habits which we had formed before we became Christians; the second part of the work consists in cultivating the positive principles of holiness in the soul.<p>That ye should abstain from fornication - A vice which was freely indulged among the pagan, and to which, from that fact, and from their own former habits, they were particularly exposed. On the fact that they were thus exposed, and on the reasons for these solemn commands on the subject, see the <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-20.htm">Acts 15:20</a> note, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-18.htm">1 Corinthians 6:18</a> note. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_thessalonians/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3.

Since "this is the will of God," let it be your will also.<p>fornication&#8212;not regarded as a sin at all among the heathen, and so needing the more to be denounced (Ac 15:20).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_thessalonians/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> What in the former verse he called commandments from Christ, he here calls <span class="bld">the will of God; </span> or he had some further duties to lay before them, which he had not yet given commandments about, which were the will of God. There is the secret and revealed will of God, and his revealed will is about things to be believed or practised. The latter is here meant, so that the will of God is put figuratively here for the things he willeth, or commandeth of us. And that which the apostle first mentions is <span class="bld">sanctification, </span> which is often taken for holiness in general, which consists in men’s conformity to the will of God both in the heart and life. But I think not so taken here, but for chastity, as opposite to the sin of uncleanness, as the apostle explains it in the next words. For to <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">abstain from fornication</span> is the will of God. And by it is meant all unchasteness, either of persons married or unmarried; and that either in the heart, or in speech, or in the eye, or lascivious gesture, as well as in the very act itself. It was a sin common among the Gentiles, especially the Grecians, and judged as no sin. And therefore it is particularly mentioned and forbidden to the believing Gentiles by the council of Jerusalem, lest they should apprehend it not to be an evil, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-20.htm" title="But that we write to them, that they abstain from pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from things strangled, and from blood.">Acts 15:20</a></span>. For it is not so evident by the light of nature as many other moral evils; and therefore the apostle tells the Thessalonians that it is the will of God they should abstain from it, and that is a sufficient ground either of doing or not doing. This will of God is expressed in the seventh commandment, which though the Jews well knew, yet these new converted Gentiles might not yet so well understand. And therefore the apostle in his several Epistles to the Gentile churches doth dehort them from it, especially the Corinthians, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-9.htm" title="Know you not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,">1 Corinthians 6:9</a></span>, and that by many arguments. It is a sin which corrupts and effeminates the mind, captivates the heart, consumes the flesh, and wastes men’s estates. So that this will of God that forbids it is a good will, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-2.htm" title="And be not conformed to this world: but be you transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.">Romans 12:2</a></span>, as all the commandments of God are said to be for our good, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-13.htm" title="To keep the commandments of the LORD, and his statutes, which I command you this day for your good?">Deu 10:13</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_thessalonians/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For this is the will of God, even your sanctification,.... Which is another reason to enforce the above exhortation. "Sanctification" is internal or external. Internal sanctification is the work of the Spirit of God, and is a principle of spiritual life in the soul, a divine and spiritual light in the understanding, a flexion of the will to the will of God, and a settlement of the affections on divine things, and is an implantation of every grace in the heart. External sanctification arises from this, and lies in holiness of life and conversation; and is what is chiefly designed, as appears both by what goes before, and follows after: and this is "the will of God"; the will of his purpose and decree; for in the same decree that he wills the salvation of any by Jesus Christ, he also wills their sanctification in heart and life, and here and hereafter: and this is his approving will, or what is well pleasing in his sight, being agreeable to his nature, and divine perfections, particularly his holiness, in which he is glorious; and it is his will of command, and what he requires in his law, which is holy, just, and good, and perfectly agrees with the sound doctrine of the Gospel, and the revelation of his will in both. <p>That ye should abstain from fornication: which is particularly mentioned, abstinence from it being a branch of external holiness; and because that this sin was common among the Gentiles, and not esteemed a sin by them; as also to observe to these Christians, that as simple fornication was not to be allowed of, much less other acts of uncleanness, as adultery, incest, sodomy, and the like, which were iniquities that greatly prevailed among the Heathens. The Syriac version renders it, "from all fornication"; on this subject the apostle enlarges in some following verses. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_thessalonians/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{2}</span> For this is the will of God, <i>even</i> your <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> sanctification, that ye should abstain from fornication:</span><p>(2) This is the sum of those things which he delivered to them, to dedicate themselves wholly to God.

(Schrader), as the reception of Christianity never delivers, as with the stroke of a magician, from the wickedness and lusts of the heathen world which have become habitual; rather a long and constant fight is necessary for vanquishing them.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/1_thessalonians/4.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-3.htm" title="For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that you should abstain from fornication:">1 Thessalonians 4:3</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἁγιασμός</span> (in apposition to <span class="greekheb">τοῦτο</span>, <span class="greekheb">θέλημα</span> without the article being the predicate) = the moral issue of a life related to the <span class="greekheb">Ἅγιος</span> (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-8.htm" title="He therefore that despises, despises not man, but God, who has also given to us his holy Spirit.">1 Thessalonians 4:8</a>), viewed here in its special and negative aspect of freedom from sexual impurity. The gospel of Jesus, unlike some pagan cults, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, that of the Cabiri at Thessalonica (<span class="ital">cf.</span> Lightfoot’s <span class="ital">Biblical Essays</span>, pp. 257 f.), did not tolerate, much less foster, licentiousness among its worshippers. At Thessalonica as at Corinth Paul found his converts exposed to the penetrating taint of life in a large seaport. As the context indicates, <span class="greekheb">ἁγ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὑμῶν</span> = “the perfecting of you in holiness” (<span class="greekheb">ἁγ</span>. in its active sense, <span class="greekheb">ὑμῶν</span> genitive objective: so Lünemann, Ellicott, Bahnsen). The absence of any reference to <span class="greekheb">δικαιοσύνη</span> is remarkable. But Paul’s dialectic on justification was occasioned by controversies about <span class="greekheb">ὁ νόμος</span> which were not felt at Thessalonica. Besides, the “justified” standing of the believer, even in that synthesis of doctrine, amounted practically to the position assured by the possession of the Spirit to the Christian. In his uncontroversial and eschatological moments, Paul taught as here that the experience of the Spirit guaranteed the believer’s vindication at the end (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_thessalonians/1-9.htm" title="For they themselves show of us what manner of entering in we had to you, and how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God;...">1 Thessalonians 1:9-10</a>) and also implied his ethical behaviour during the interval. The comparative lack of any allusion to the forgiveness of sins (<span class="ital">cf. e.g.</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-5.htm" title="For this cause, when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know your faith, lest by some means the tempter have tempted you, and our labor be in vain.">1 Thessalonians 3:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-10.htm" title="Night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face, and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith?">1 Thessalonians 3:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-13.htm" title="To the end he may establish your hearts blameless in holiness before God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints.">1 Thessalonians 3:13</a>) does not mean that Paul thought the Thessalonians would be kept sinless during the brief interval till the parousia (so Wernle, <span class="ital">der Christ u. die Sünde bei Paulus</span>, 25–32); probably no occasion had called for any explicit teaching on this commonplace of faith (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-3.htm" title="For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;">1 Corinthians 15:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-11.htm" title="Therefore whether it were I or they, so we preach, and so you believed.">1 Corinthians 15:11</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/1_thessalonians/4.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">3</span>. <span class="ital">For this is the will of God</span>, even <span class="ital">your sanctification</span>, &c.] The connection will be clearer if we render thus: <span class="bld">For this is God’s will—it is your sanctification—that you abstain from fornication</span>, &c.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It was not some counsel or wish of his own that he pressed on the Thessalonians under the authority of Christ; it was nothing less than <span class="ital">God’s holy will</span>: the primary ground of this charge. At the same time it was <span class="ital">their sanctification</span>. God’s will and their consecration to Him are the double reason for their leading a chaste life; and these two reasons are one, the latter springing out of the former. God had chosen them to be His own (comp. ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-4.htm" title="Knowing, brothers beloved, your election of God.">1 Thessalonians 1:4</a>). And He willed that their sanctification should be realised and carried into effect in the important particular about to be stated. This will of God was proclaimed in His “call,” by which the Thessalonians had been summoned to a pure and holy life (ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_thessalonians/5-23.htm" title="And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ....">1 Thessalonians 5:23-24</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-12.htm" title="That you would walk worthy of God, who has called you to his kingdom and glory.">1 Thessalonians 2:12</a>). In all endeavours after purity it is our best support to know that God wishes and means ms to be holy; that His almighty help is at the back of our weak resolves, Who both “puts into our minds good desires” and “brings the same to good effect.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“Sanctification” is <span class="ital">the act or process of making holy</span>: then, in the second instance, it comes to denote the result of this process, <span class="ital">the state of one who is made holy</span>,—as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-22.htm" title="But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, you have your fruit to holiness, and the end everlasting life.">Romans 6:22</a>, “You have your fruit unto sanctification, and the end eternal life;” similarly in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-14.htm" title="Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord:">Hebrews 12:14</a>, “Follow after sanctification.” It is synonymous with <span class="ital">consecration</span>, i.e. <span class="ital">devotion to God</span>,—but to God as the Holy One.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Holy</span> is the single word which by itself denotes <span class="ital">the Divine character</span>, as it is revealed to us in its moral transcendence, in the awfulness and glory of its absolute perfection, raised infinitely above all that is earthly and sinful (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-2.htm" title="There is none holy as the LORD: for there is none beside you: neither is there any rock like our God.">1 Samuel 2:2</a>, Psalms 99, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/111-9.htm" title="He sent redemption to his people: he has commanded his covenant for ever: holy and reverend is his name.">Psalm 111:9</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-15.htm" title="For thus said the high and lofty One that inhabits eternity, whose name is Holy; I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones.">Isaiah 57:15</a>, &c). Now it is the character of God—“thy Maker … and thy Redeemer, <span class="ital">the Holy One of Israel</span>”—that constitutes His right to the consecration of those to whom He is revealed. Our “sanctification” is the acknowledgement of God’s claim upon us as the Holy One Who made us. This involves our assimilation to His nature. In Him, first the character, then the claim: in us, first the claim admitted, then the character impressed. In short, Sanctification is fulfilment of the supreme command, “Be ye holy, for I am holy” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_peter/1-15.htm" title="But as he which has called you is holy, so be you holy in all manner of conversation;...">1 Peter 1:15-16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-44.htm" title="For I am the LORD your God: you shall therefore sanctify yourselves, and you shall be holy; for I am holy: neither shall you defile yourselves with any manner of creeping thing that creeps on the earth.">Leviticus 11:44</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-2.htm" title="Speak to all the congregation of the children of Israel, and say to them, You shall be holy: for I the LORD your God am holy.">Leviticus 19:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-7.htm" title="Sanctify yourselves therefore, and be you holy: for I am the LORD your God.">Leviticus 20:7</a>).—See, further, notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-7.htm" title="For God has not called us to uncleanness, but to holiness.">1 Thessalonians 4:7</a>, and ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-23.htm" title="And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.">1 Thessalonians 5:23</a>; also on ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-10.htm" title="You are witnesses, and God also, how piously and justly and blamelessly we behaved ourselves among you that believe:">1 Thessalonians 2:10</a>, for the difference between the two Greek words for <span class="ital">holy</span> used in this Ep.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>St Paul makes <span class="ital">chastity</span> a part of holiness. He finds a new motive and powerful safeguard for virtue in the fact of the redemption of the body. Our physical frame belongs to God; it is a sharer in Christ’s resurrection, and in the new life received through Him. “Know you not,” he asks, “that your bodies are limbs of Christ,—a temple of the Holy Ghost, which you have from God? Therefore glorify God in your body” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/6-15.htm" title="Know you not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an harlot? God forbid....">1 Corinthians 6:15-20</a>). This is <span class="ital">bodily sanctification</span>. And faith in Christ effectually subdues impure and sensual passion.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The foul and heathenish vice of <span class="ital">fornication</span> was so prevalent in Greek cities and so little condemned by public opinion—it was even fostered by some forms of pagan religion—that abstinence from it on the part of the Thessalonians was a sign of devotion to a Holy God. But their purity was imperilled from the condition of society around them, and in many cases from former unchaste habits. The temptations to licentiousness assailing the first generation of Christians were fearfully strong; and all the Epistles contain urgent warnings upon this subject. The sense of purity had to be re-created in men gathered out of the midst of pagan corruption.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/1_thessalonians/4.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-3.htm" title="For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that you should abstain from fornication:">1 Thessalonians 4:3</a>. <span class="greekheb">Θέλημα</span>, <span class="ital">a will</span>) [a thing which God wills].
