The spiritualising of our natural bodies without death, as described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-50.htm" title="Now this I say, brothers, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither does corruption inherit incorruption.">1Corinthians 15:50</a>, <span class= "ital">et seq., </span>will enable us to be “caught up” equally well with, and in company with (both of which thoughts are included in “together with”), the resurgent dead. “Clouds” and “air” will be support enough for material so immaterial. Theodoret says, “He showeth the greatness of the honour: as the Master Himself was taken up upon a shining cloud, so also they that have believed in Him.” The absolute equality, then, of quick and dead is proved.<p><span class= "bld">To meet the Lord in the air.</span>—St. Chrysostom says:” When the King cometh into a city, they that are honourable proceed forth to meet him, but the guilty await their judge within.” The phrase “in the air” certainly does not mean “heaven.” The word “ai<span class= "ital">r”</span>) in itself properly signifies the lower, denser, grosser atmosphere, in which the powers of darkness reign (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-2.htm" title="Wherein in time past you walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now works in the children of disobedience:">Ephesians 2:2</a>); but here it is only used in contrast with the <span class= "ital">ground, </span>and means “on the way from Heaven whence He comes,” of course not to <span class= "ital">dwell</span> there, but to accompany Him to His Judgment-seat on the earth.<p><span class= "bld">And so.</span>—Now that St. Paul has settled the question of disparity between the dead and the living, he does not think it necessary to describe what is immediately to follow; <span class= "ital">that, </span>the Thessalonians were sure to know (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-2.htm" title="Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.">Hebrews 6:2</a>): it only remains to say that having once rejoined the Lord, they would never be parted from Him.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_thessalonians/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:13-18 Here is comfort for the relations and friends of those who die in the Lord. Grief for the death of friends is lawful; we may weep for our own loss, though it may be their gain. Christianity does not forbid, and grace does not do away, our natural affections. Yet we must not be excessive in our sorrows; this is too much like those who have no hope of a better life. Death is an unknown thing, and we know little about the state after death; yet the doctrines of the resurrection and the second coming of Christ, are a remedy against the fear of death, and undue sorrow for the death of our Christian friends; and of these doctrines we have full assurance. It will be some happiness that all the saints shall meet, and remain together for ever; but the principal happiness of heaven is to be with the Lord, to see him, live with him, and enjoy him for ever. We should support one another in times sorrow; not deaden one another's spirits, or weaken one another's hands. And this may be done by the many lessons to be learned from the resurrection of the dead, and the second coming of Christ. What! comfort a man by telling him he is going to appear before the judgment-seat of God! Who can feel comfort from those words? That man alone with whose spirit the Spirit of God bears witness that his sins are blotted out, and the thoughts of whose heart are purified by the Holy Spirit, so that he can love God, and worthily magnify his name. We are not in a safe state unless it is thus with us, or we are desiring to be so.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_thessalonians/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Then we which are alive - Those who shall then be alive; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-15.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:15</a>. The word here rendered "then" (&#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;  epeita), does not necessarily mean that this would occur immediately. It properly marks succession in time, and means "afterward, next, next in the order of events;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-7.htm">Luke 16:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-21.htm">Galatians 1:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/4-14.htm">James 4:14</a>. There may be a considerable interval between the resurrection of the pious and the time when the living shall be caught up to meet the Lord, for the change is to take place in them which will fit them to ascend with those who have been raised. The meaning is, that after the dead are raised, or the next thing in order, they and the living will ascend to meet the Lord. The proper meaning of the word, however, denotes a succession so close as to exclude the idea of a long interval in which other important transactions would occur, such an interval, for example, as would be involved in a long personal reign of the Redeemer on earth. The word demands this interpretation - that the next thing in order after the resurrection of the righteous, will be their being caught up with the living, with an appropriate change, into the air - though, as has been remarked, it will admit of the supposition of such a brief, momentary interval &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3b7; &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;  en atomos en rhipe&#772; ophthalmou, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-51.htm">1 Corinthians 15:51-52</a>) as shall be necessary to prepare for it.<p>Shall be caught up - The word here used implies that there will be the application of external force or power by which this will be done. It will not be by any power of ascending which they will themselves have; or by any tendency of their raised or changed bodies to ascend of their own accord, or even by any effort of their own will, but by a power applied to them which will cause them to rise. Compare the use of the word &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;  harpazo&#772; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/11-12.htm">Matthew 11:12</a>, "the violent take it by force;" <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/13-19.htm">Matthew 13:19</a>, "then cometh the wicked one and snatcheth away;" <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-15.htm">John 6:15</a>, "that they would come and take him by force; <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/10-12.htm">John 10:12</a>, "the wolf catcheth them;" <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/8-39.htm">Acts 8:39</a>, "the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-2.htm">2 Corinthians 12:2</a>, "such an one caught up to the third heaven;" also, <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-28.htm">John 12:28-29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-10.htm">Acts 23:10</a>; Jde 1:23; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-5.htm">Revelation 12:5</a>. The verb does not elsewhere occur in the New Testament In all these instances there is the idea of either foreign force or violence effecting that which is done. What force or power is to be applied in causing the living and the dead to ascend, is not expressed. Whether it is to be by the ministry of angels, or by the direct power of the Son of God, is not intimated, though the latter seems to be most probable. The word should not be construed, however. as implying that there will be any reluctance on the part of the saints to appear before the Saviour, but merely with reference to the physical fact that power will be necessary to elevate them to meet him in the air. Will their, bodies then be such that they will have the power of locomotion at will from place to place?<p>In the clouds - Greek, "in clouds" - &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;  en nephelais - without the article. This may mean "in clouds;" that is, in such numbers, and in such grouping as to resemble clouds. So it is rendered by Macknight, Koppe, Rosenmuller, Bush (Anasta. 266), and others. The absence of the article here would rather seem to demand this interpretation Still, however, the other interpretation may be true, that it means that they will be caught up into the region of the clouds, or to the clouds which shall accompany the Lord Jesus on his return to our world. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-30.htm">Matthew 24:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-64.htm">Matthew 26:64</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/16-19.htm">Mark 16:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/14-62.htm">Mark 14:62</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-7.htm">Revelation 1:7</a>; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13</a>. In whichever sense it is understood, the expression is one of great sublimity, and the scene will be immensely grand. Some doctrine of this kind was held by the ancient Jews. Thus rabbi Nathan (Midras Tillin, 48:13) says, "What has been done before will be done again. As he led the Israelites from Egypt in the clouds of heaven, so will he do to them in the future time."<p>To meet the Lord in the air - In the regions of the atmosphere - above the earth. It would seem from this, that the Lord Jesus, in his coming, would not descend to the earth, but would remain at a distance from it in the air, where the great transactions of the judgment will occur. It is, indeed, nowhere said that the transactions of the judgment will occur upon the earth. The world would not be spacious enough to contain all the assembled living and dead, and hence the throne of judgment will be fixed in the ample space above it.<p>And so shall we ever be with the Lord - This does not mean that they will always remain with him in the air - for their final home will be heaven - and after the trial they will accompany him to the realms of glory; <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/25-34.htm">Matthew 25:34</a>, "Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom," etc. The time during which they will remain with him "in the air" is nowhere mentioned in the Bible. It will be as long as will be necessary for the purposes of judging a world and deciding the eternal doom of every individual "according to the deeds done in the body." There is no reason to suppose that this will be accomplished in a single day of twenty-four hours; but it is impossible to form and conjecture of the period which will be occupied. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_thessalonians/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17. we which are alive &#8230; shall be caught up&#8212;after having been "changed in a moment" (1Co 15:51, 52). Again he says, "we," recommending thus the expression to Christians of all ages, each generation bequeathing to the succeeding one a continually increasing obligation to look for the coming of the Lord. [Edmunds].<p>together with them&#8212;all together: the raised dead, and changed living, forming one joint body.<p>in the clouds&#8212;Greek, "in clouds." The same honor is conferred on them as on their Lord. As He was taken in a cloud at His ascension (Ac 1:9), so at His return with clouds (Re 1:7), they shall be caught up in clouds. The clouds are His and their triumphal chariot (Ps 104:3; Da 7:13). Ellicott explains the Greek, "robed round by upbearing clouds" [Aids to Faith].<p>in the air&#8212;rather, "into the air"; caught up into the region just above the earth, where the meeting (compare Mt 25:1, 6) shall take place between them ascending, and their Lord descending towards the earth. Not that the air is to be the place of their lasting abode with Him.<p>and so shall we ever be with the Lord&#8212;no more parting, and no more going out (Re 3:12). His point being established, that the dead in Christ shall be on terms of equal advantage with those found alive at Christ's coming, he leaves undefined here the other events foretold elsewhere (as not being necessary to his discussion), Christ's reign on earth with His saints (1Co 6:2, 3), the final judgment and glorification of His saints in the new heaven and earth.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_thessalonians/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Christ will have a church to the end of the world, and some will be found alive at his coming, and will be <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">caught up, </span> or snatched up, to denote its suddenness, it may be in the arms of angels, or by some immediate attractive power of Christ; and it will be <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">together with them</span> that are now raised from the dead; they shall all ascend in one great body, and it will be <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">in the clouds; </span> as Christ himself ascended in a cloud, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-9.htm" title="And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight.">Acts 1:9</a></span>, and so will return again, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-30.htm" title="And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.">Matthew 24:30</a></span>, he making the clouds his chariots, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-3.htm" title="Who lays the beams of his chambers in the waters: who makes the clouds his chariot: who walks on the wings of the wind:">Psalm 104:3</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">To meet the Lord in the air:</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

From the words it follows that the apostle did not think of Christ descending completely down to the earth.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">εἰς ἀέρα</span>] into the air, belongs to <span class="greekheb">ἁρπαγησόμεθα</span>, and can as little be considered as equivalent to <span class="greekheb">εἰς τοὺς οὐρανούς</span> (Flatt) as it can denote through the air, i.e. through the air to the higher regions (Flatt). Nor, on the other hand, can it be the apostle’s meaning—although Pelt, Usteri, Paulin. Lehrbegr. pp. 356, 359 (hesitatingly), and Weizel in the Theol. Stud. u. Krit. 1836, p. 935 f. assume it—that the Christian host would be caught up into the air, in order to have their permanent abode with Christ in the air. For, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-1.htm" title="For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.">2 Corinthians 5:1</a>, the future eternal abode of Christians is <span class="greekheb">ἐν τοῖς οὐρανοῖς</span>.[60] Nevertheless the apostle was constrained to express himself as he has done. For when Christ descends <span class="ital">down</span> from heaven, and Christians are caught up to <span class="ital">meet</span> Him, the place of meeting can only be a space <span class="ital">between heaven and earth, i.e.</span> the air. Comp. Augustine, <span class="ital">de civit. Dei</span>, xx. 20, 1 Thessalonians 2 : Quod enim ait … non sic accipiendum est, tanquam in aëre nos dixerit semper cum domino esse mansuros; quia nec ipse utique ibi manebit, quia <span class="ital">veniens transiturus est. Venienti quippe ibitur obviam, non manenti</span>. But that Paul adds nothing concerning the removal of the glorified Christian host to heaven, following their being caught up with Christ, and of the resurrection of all men connected with the advent, along with the judgment of the world, is naturally explained, because the description of the advent as such is not here his object, but his design is wholly and entirely to satisfy the doubts raised by the Thessalonians in respect of the advent.[61] But to effect this purpose it was perfectly sufficient that he now, specifying the result of the points described, proceeds: <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑῚ ΟὝΤΩς ΠΆΝΤΟΤΕ ΣῪΝ ΚΥΡΊῼ ἘΣΌΜΕΘΑ</span></span></span>] <span class="ital">and so shall we ever be united with the Lord</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">οὕτως</span>] <span class="ital">so</span>, that is, after that we have actually met with Him. It refers back to <span class="greekheb">εἰς ἀπάντησιν</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">σύν</span>] imports more than <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΜΕΤΆ</span></span></span>. It expresses intimate union, not mere companionship.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΣΌΜΕΘΑ</span></span></span>] comprehends as its subject both <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΝΕΚΡΟῚ ἘΝ ΧΡΙΣΤῷ</span></span></span> and the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΖῶΝΤΕς</span></span></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[60] Also on this account Paul cannot have thought on a permanent residence on the glorified earth (Georgii in Zeller’s <span class="ital">theol.

Against Schrader, who thinks on account of this silence that the author must have conceived the circumstances of the advent “in an entirely sensible manner;” “the incongruities of this representation, if it is understood sensibly,” cannot be Pauline, because with Paul the doctrine of the last things has a “purely (?) spiritual character.”<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/1_thessalonians/4.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-17.htm" title="Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.">1 Thessalonians 4:17</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἐν νεφέλαις</span>, the ordinary method of sudden rapture or ascension to heaven (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-9.htm" title="And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight.">Acts 1:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-11.htm" title="Which also said, You men of Galilee, why stand you gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as you have seen him go into heaven.">Acts 1:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-12.htm" title="And they heard a great voice from heaven saying to them, Come up here.

His aim is to reassure the Thessalonians about the prospects of their dead in relation to the Lord, not to give any complete programme of the future (so <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-31.htm" title="And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.">Matthew 24:31</a>; Did. x., xvi.). Plainly, however, the saints do not rise at once to heaven, but return with the Lord to the scene of his final manifestation on earth (so Chrysost., Aug., etc.).

So Christ Himself, and the angels at His Ascension, promised He should come (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-68.htm" title="Saying, Prophesy to us, you Christ, Who is he that smote you?">Matthew 26:68</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/1-9.htm" title="And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight....">Acts 1:9-11</a>); comp. the “bright overshadowing cloud” at the Transfiguration, and the “voice out of the cloud” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/17-5.htm" title="While he yet spoke, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them: and behold a voice out of the cloud, which said, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear you him.">Matthew 17:5</a>). There is something wonderful and mystical about the clouds, half of heaven and half of earth, that fits them to be the medium of such events. They lend their ethereal drapery to form the curtain and canopy of this glorious meeting. “What belongs to cloudland is no less real than if set down on the solid ground.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Such a raising of the living bodies of the saints, along with the risen dead, implies the physical transformation of the former to which the Apostle afterwards alludes in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-51.htm" title="Behold, I show you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,">1 Corinthians 15:51</a> : “we shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed” (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/5-1.htm" title="For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens....">2 Corinthians 5:1-4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-21.htm" title="Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like to his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things to himself.">Php 3:21</a>). Some change had taken place in the sacred body of Jesus after His resurrection, for it was emancipated from the ordinary laws of matter. And this transformation the Apostle conceived to be possible without dissolution.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">to meet the Lord in the air</span>] Lit., <span class="bld">into</span> (raised into) <span class="bld">the air</span>. “The air,” like the “clouds,” belongs to the interspace between the heaven from which Christ comes and the earth to which He returns. Here He will meet His Church. She will not need to wait until He sets foot on earth; but those who are ready, “looking for their Lord when He shall return” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/12-35.htm" title="Let your loins be girded about, and your lights burning;...">Luke 12:35-40</a>), will hear His trumpet call and “go forth <span class="ital">to meet</span> the Bridegroom” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-1.htm" title="Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened to ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.">Matthew 25:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-6.htm" title="And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom comes; go you out to meet him.">Matthew 25:6</a>). St Paul employs the same, somewhat rare Hebraistic idiom which is found in this passage of St Matthew, as though the words of Christ lingered in his ear.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and so shall we ever be with the Lord</span>] <span class="ital">Where</span> the Apostle does not say; whether still on earth for some longer space, or in heaven. The one and all-sufficing comfort is in the thought of being <span class="bld">always with the Lord</span>. This, too, was the promise of Christ, “Where I am, there shall also My servant be” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-26.htm" title="If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will my Father honor.">John 12:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-3.htm" title="And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you to myself; that where I am, there you may be also.">John 14:3</a>). Those living in the flesh cannot be so in any complete sense; “at home in the body,” we are “absent from the Lord” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-6.htm" title="Therefore we are always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord:">2 Corinthians 5:6</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/1_thessalonians/4.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-17.htm" title="Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.">1 Thessalonians 4:17</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἅμα</span>) Ammonious, <span class="greekheb">ἅμα μὲν ἐστι χρονικὸν ἐπίῤῥημα</span>· <span class="greekheb">ὁμοῦ δὲ</span>, <span class="greekheb">τοπικόν</span>, “<span class="greekheb">ἅμα</span> is an adverb of time, <span class="greekheb">ὁμοῦ</span> of place.” You see here the propriety of the apostle’s language.—<span class="greekheb">εἰς ἀέρα</span>, <span class="ital">in</span>, or rather, [caught up] <span class="ital">into the air</span>) The ungodly will remain on the earth.
