The sudden disappearance of the Assyrian locust-pest is here enlarged upon. A sudden outburst of sunshine will sometimes induce a swarm of locusts to take flight; cold, on the other hand, makes these insects settle, and soon deprives them of the power of flying. Dr. Pusey well observes, “The heathen conqueror rehearsed his victory, ‘I came, I saw, conquered.’ The prophet goes further, as the issue of all human conquest, ‘I disappeared.’” The insect designations, rendered in Authorised Version, “cankerworm,” “locust,” “great grasshopper,” all represent varieties of the locust species.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/nahum/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:8-19 Strong-holds, even the strongest, are no defence against the judgments of God. They shall be unable to do any thing for themselves. The Chaldeans and Medes would devour the land like canker-worms. The Assyrians also would be eaten up by their own numerous hired troops, which seem to be meant by the word rendered merchants. Those that have done evil to their neighbours, will find it come home to them. Nineveh, and many other cities, states, and empires, have been ruined, and should be a warning to us. Are we better, except as there are some true Christians amongst us, who are a greater security, and a stronger defence, than all the advantages of situation or strength? When the Lord shows himself against a people, every thing they trust in must fail, or prove a disadvantage; but he continues good to Israel. He is a strong-hold for every believer in time of trouble, that cannot be stormed or taken; and he knoweth those that trust in Him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/nahum/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thy crowned are as the locust, and thy captains as the great locusts - What he had said summarily under metaphor, the prophet expands in a likeness. "The crowned" are probably the subordinate princes, of whom Sennacherib said, "Are not my princes altogether kings?" <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-8.htm">Isaiah 10:8</a>. It has been observed that the headdress of the Assyrian Vizier has the ornament which  "throughout the whole series of sculptures is the distinctive mark of royal or quasi-royal authority." : "All high officers of state, 'the crowned captains,' were adorned with diadems, closely resembling the lower band of the royal mitre, separated from the cap itself. Such was that of the vizier, which was broader in front than behind, was adorned with rosettes and compartments, and terminated in two ribbons with embroidered and fringed ends, which hung down his back." "Captain" is apparently the title of some military ounce of princely rank.<p>One such Jeremiah Jer 51:27, in a prophecy in which he probably alludes to this, bids place over the armies of Ararat, Minni, and Ashchenaz, to marshall them against Babylon, against which he summons the cavalry like the rough locust. The "captains" are likened to the "great caterpillars," either as chief in devastation, or as including under them the armies antler their command, who moved at their will. These and their armies now subsided into stillness for a time under the chill of calamity, like the locust  "whose nature it is, that, torpid in the cold, they fly in the heat." The stiffness of the locusts through the cold, when they lie motionless, heaps upon heaps, hidden out of sight, is a striking image of the helplessness of Nineveh's mightiest in the day of her calamity; then, by a different part of their history, he pictures their entire disappearance. : "The locusts, are commonly taken in the morning when they are agglomerated one on another, in the places where they passed the night. As soon as the sun warms them, they fly away." "When the sun ariseth, they flee away," literally, "it is chased away."<p>One and all; all as one. As at God's command the plague of locusts, which He had sent on Egypt, was removed; "there remained not one locust in all the coasts of Egypt" <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-19.htm">Exodus 10:19</a>; so the mighty of Nineveh were driven north, with no trace where they had been, where they were. "The wind carried them away <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-16.htm">Isaiah 41:16</a>; the wind passes over him and he is not, and his place knows him no more <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-16.htm">Psalm 103:16</a>. The triumphing of the wicked is short, and the joy of the ungodly for a moment: though his excellency mount up to the heavens, and his head reach unto the clouds, yet he shall perish for ever; they which have seen him shall say, where is he? He shall fly away, as a dream, and shall not be formal; neither shall his place any were bebold him <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/20-5.htm">Job 20:5-9</a>.<p>Where they are - So Zechariah asks, "Your fathers, where are they?" <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/1.htm">Zechariah 1</a>. History, experience, human knowledge can answer nothing. They can only say, where they are not. God alone can answer that much-containing word, "Where-they." They had disappeared from human sight, from their greatness, their visible being, their place on earth. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/nahum/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17.

Tributary kings, and hired officers, as some think, who might be distinguished by what they wore on their heads; or their own princes and nobles, who wore coronets or diadems; unless their religious persons are meant, their Nazarites and devotees, their priests; these were like locusts for their number, fear, and flight in time of danger, and for their spoil of the poor; and some locusts have been seen with little crowns on their heads, as those in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/9-7.htm">Revelation 9:7</a> "which had on their heads as it were crowns like gold". In the year 1542 came locusts out of Turkish Satmatia into Austria, Silesia, Lusatia, and Misnia, which had on their heads little crowns (e). In the year 1572 a vehement wind brought large troops of locusts out of Turkey into Poland, which did great mischief, and were of a golden colour (f); and Aelianus (g) speaks of locusts in Arabia, marked with golden coloured figures; and mention is made in the Targum on <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-27.htm">Jeremiah 51:27</a>, of the shining locust, shining like gold: <p>and thy captains as the great grasshoppers; or "locusts of locusts" (h); those of the largest size. The Vulgate Latin renders the word for captains "thy little ones", junior princes, or officers of less dignity and authority; these were, as the Targum paraphrases it, as the worms of locusts; but rather as the locusts themselves, many and harmful: <p>which camp in the hedges in the cold day; in the cold part of the day, the night; when they get into the hedges of fields, gardens, and vineyards, in great numbers, like an army, and therefore said to encamp like one: <p>but when the sun ariseth they flee away, and their place is not known where they are; whither they are fled, as the Targum; so these captains, or half pay officers, swarmed in great numbers about the city, and in the provinces, while it was a time of peace, and they were indulged in sloth, and enjoyed much ease and prosperity; but when war broke out, and the heat of it began to be felt, these disappeared, and went into their own countries, from whence they came, with the auxiliaries and hired troops; nor could they be found where they were, or be called upon to do their duty: this is true of locusts in a literal sense, who flee away when the sun rises; hence the Arabs, as Bochart says (i) elegantly express this by the word "ascaara"; signifying, that when the sun comes to the locust it goes away, According to Macrobius (k), both Apollo and Hercules are names for the sun; and both these are surnamed from their power in driving away locusts: Hercules was called Cornopion by the Oeteans, because he delivered them from the locusts (l): and Apollo was called Parnopius by the Grecians, because, when the country was hurt by locusts, he drove them out of it, at Pausanias (m) relates; who observes, that they were drove out they knew, but in what manner they say not; for his own part, he says, he knew them thrice destroyed at Mount Sipylus, but not in the same way; one time a violent wind drove them out; another time a prodigious heat killed them; and a third time they perished by sudden cold; and so, according to the text here, the cold sends them to the hedges, and the heat of the sun obliges them to abandon their station. <p>(e) Vid.

The Anglican Version derives the word from <span class="accented">nezer</span>, "a diadem," and "the crowned" are the officials of upper rank. "High officers of state in Assyria were adorned with diadems, closely resembling the lower baud of the royal mitre, separated from the cap itself. Very commonly the head was encircled with a simple fillet or hoop, probably of gold, without any adornment" (Gosse, 'Assyria,' p. 463, quoted by Strauss; see the figures in Bonomi, p. 319). Others derive it from <span class="accented">nazar.</span> "to separate," in the signification of "those separated or selected for war." Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>: <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the band of mixed mercenary troops - a rendering in which Wordsworth acquiesces. Knabenbauer (referring to Strassmaier's Assyrian vocabulary) considers the word to be a transliteration (<span class="accented">ss</span> being resolved into <span class="accented">ne</span>) of the Assyrian <span class="accented">ma-as-sa-ru</span>, which means "guardian," or some inferior officer. With this agrees the Vulgate <span class="accented">custodes. <span class="cmt_word"></span>As the locusts;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in multitude. That the number of captains and superior officers would be very great may be conjectured from the inscriptions which sometimes enumerate the captives carried off from conquered countries. Thus in the account of the capture of some insignificant nation, the then king boasts that he took away 13,000 fighting men, 1121 captains, and 460 superior officers (Strauss, <span class="accented">in loc</span>.). The prophet's meaning is that if the officers, etc., are so numerous, the multitude of soldiers and civilians must be truly immense. <span class="cmt_word">Thy captains.</span> <span class="accented">Taphsar</span> is an Assyrian word, occurring only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-27.htm">Jeremiah 51:27</a>. It is probably the same as <span class="accented">dupsarru</span> or <span class="accented">dipsarru</span> of the inscriptions, and is taken to signify "a scribe" (see Sehrader, p. 424) Such officials are often represented on the monuments (see Layard, 2:184), and seem sometimes to have been of high or priestly rank. Jerome translates, <span class="accented">parvuli</span> <span class="accented">tui</span>, though in Jeremiah, <span class="accented">loc. cit.</span>, he retains the Assyrian word.

"Hear, all ye nations: observe, O earth, and that which fills it: and let the Lord Jehovah be a witness against you, the Lord out of His holy palace. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-3.htm">Micah 1:3</a>. For, behold, Jehovah cometh forth from His place, and cometh down, and marcheth over the high places of the earth. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-4.htm">Micah 1:4</a>. And the mountains will melt under Him, and the valleys split, like wax before the fire, like water poured out upon a slope." The introductory words, "Hear, ye nations all," are taken by Micah from his earlier namesake the son of Imlah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-28.htm">1 Kings 22:28</a>). As the latter, in his attack upon the false prophets, called all nations as witnesses to confirm the truth of his prophecy, so does Micah the Morashite commence his prophetic testimony with the same appeal, so as to announce his labours at the very outset as a continuation of the activity of his predecessor who had been so zealous for the Lord. As the son of Imlah had to contend against the false prophets as seducers of the nation, so has also the Morashtite (compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/2-6.htm">Micah 2:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/2-11.htm">Micah 2:11</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/3-5.htm">Micah 3:5</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/3-11.htm">Micah 3:11</a>); and as the former had to announce to both kingdoms the judgment that would come upon them on account of their sins, so has also the latter; and he does it by frequently referring to the prophecy of the elder Micah, not only by designating the false prophets as those who walk after the ru&#772;a&#774;ch and lie, sheqer (<a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/2-11.htm">Micah 2:11</a>), which recals to mind the ru&#772;a&#774;ch sheqer of the prophets of Ahab (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-22.htm">1 Kings 22:22-23</a>), but also in his use of the figures of the horn of iron in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-13.htm">Micah 4:13</a> (compare the horns of iron of the false prophet Zedekiah in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-11.htm">1 Kings 22:11</a>), and of the smiting upon the cheek in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/5-1.htm">Micah 5:1</a> (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-14.htm">1 Kings 22:14</a>). &#8219;Amm&#305;&#772;m kulla&#770;m does not mean all the tribes of Israel; still less does it mean warlike nations. &#8219;Amm&#305;&#772;m never has the second meaning, and the first it has only in the primitive language of the Pentateuch. But here both these meanings are precluded by the parallel &#1488;&#1512;&#1509; &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1492;&#1468;; for this expression invariably signifies the whole earth, with that which fills it, except in such a case as <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-16.htm">Jeremiah 8:16</a>, where 'erets is restricted to the land of Israel by the preceding ha&#770;'a&#770;rets, or <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-19.htm">Ezekiel 12:19</a>, where it is so restricted by the suffix 'artsa&#770;h. The appeal to the earth and its fulness is similar to the appeals to the heaven and the earth in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-2.htm">Isaiah 1:2</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-1.htm">Deuteronomy 32:1</a>. All nations, yea the whole earth, and all creatures upon it, are to hear, because the judgment which the prophet has to announce to Israel affects the whole earth (<a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/1-3.htm">Micah 1:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-4.htm">Micah 1:4</a>), the judgment upon Israel being connected with the judgment upon all nations, or forming a portion of that judgment. In the second clause of the verse, "the Lord Jehovah be witness against you," it is doubtful who is addressed in the expression "against you." The words cannot well be addressed to all nations and to the earth, because the Lord only rises up as a witness against the man who has despised His word and transgressed His commandments. For being a witness is not equivalent to witnessing or giving testimony by words, - say, for example, by the admonitory and corrective address of the prophet which follows, as C. B. Michaelis supposes, - but refers to the practical testimony given by the Lord in the judgment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-3.htm">Micah 1:3</a> ff), as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-5.htm">Malachi 3:5</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/42-5.htm">Jeremiah 42:5</a>. Now, although the Lord is described as the Judge of the world in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-3.htm">Micah 1:3</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/1-4.htm">Micah 1:4</a>, yet, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-5.htm">Micah 1:5</a>., He only comes to execute judgment upon Israel. Consequently we must refer the words "to you" to Israel, or rather to the capitals Samaria and Jerusalem mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/1-1.htm">Micah 1:1</a>, just as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/1-8.htm">Nahum 1:8</a> the suffix simply refers to the Nineveh mentioned in the heading, to which there has been no further allusion in <a href="http://biblehub.com/nahum/1-2.htm">Nahum 1:2-7</a>. This view is also favoured by the fact that Micah summons all nations to hear his word, in the same sense as his earlier namesake in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-28.htm">1 Kings 22:28</a>. What the prophet announces in word, the Lord will confirm by deed, - namely, by executing the predicted judgment, - and indeed "the Lord out of His holy temple," i.e., the heaven where He is enthroned (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/11-4.htm">Psalm 11:4</a>); for (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-3.htm">1 Kings 22:3</a>) the Lord will rise up from thence, and striding over the high places of the earth, i.e., as unbounded Ruler of the world (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/4-13.htm">Amos 4:13</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-13.htm">Deuteronomy 32:13</a>), will come down in fire, so that the mountains melt before Him, that is to say, as Judge of the world. The description of this theophany is founded upon the idea of a terrible storm and earthquake, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-8.htm">Psalm 18:8</a>. The mountains melt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-4.htm">Judges 5:4</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-9.htm">Psalm 68:9</a>) with the streams of water, which discharge themselves from heaven (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-4.htm">Judges 5:4</a>), and the valleys split with the deep channels cut out by the torrents of water. The similes, "like wax," etc. (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-3.htm">Psalm 68:3</a>), and "like water," etc., are intended to express the complete dissolution of mountains and valleys. The actual facts answering to this description are the destructive influences exerted upon nature by great national judgments. </body></html>
