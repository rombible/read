Some form of this weapon may well have been in use long before the present date. Xenophon relates that Cyrus was the first to introduce the scythe-chariot. Ctesias, however, speaks of it as of much earlier origin. The older Hebrew commentators render this word <span class= "ital">p</span>’<span class= "ital">lâdôth,</span> “torches,” as in the Authorised Version.

In its behalf, the description of a panic in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-8.htm" title="And they shall be afraid: pangs and sorrows shall take hold of them; they shall be in pain as a woman that travails: they shall be amazed one at another; their faces shall be as flames.">Isaiah 13:8</a> has been adduced: “They shall be amazed one at another; their faces shall be as <span class= "ital">flames.</span>” But it is obviously better to restrict the reference throughout to the chariots of the besieged city, darting hither and thither in wild undisciplined attempts to resist the invader’s onset.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/nahum/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:1-10 Nineveh shall not put aside this judgment; there is no counsel or strength against the Lord.

The assailing army, from its compactness and unity, is spoken of, both as many and one. The might is of many; the order and singleness of purpose is as of one. The shield, collectively, not shields. "His mighty men;" He, who was last spoken of, was Almighty God, as He says in Isaiah; "I have commanded My consecrated ones; I have also called My mighty ones, them that rejoice in My highness" <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-3.htm">Isaiah 13:3</a>.<p>Is reddened - Either with blood of the Assyrians, shed in some previous battle, before the siege began, or (which is the meaning of the word elsewhere ), an artificial color, the color of blood being chosen, as expressive of fiery fierceness. The valiant men are in scarlet, for beauty and terror, as, again being the color of blood . It was especially the color of the dress of their nobles  one chief color of the Median dress, from whom the Persians adopted their's . "The chariots shall be with flaming torches," literally, "with the fire of steels , or of sharp incisive instruments. Either way the words seem to indicate that the chariots were in some way armed with steel. For steel was not an ornament, nor do the chariots appear to have been ornamented with metal. Iron would have hindered the primary object of lightness and speed. Steel, as distinct from iron, is made only for incisiveness. In either way, it is probable, that scythed chariots were already in use. Against such generals, as the younger Cyrus  and Alexander , they were of no avail; but they must have been terrific instruments against undisciplined armies.<p>The rush and noise of the British chariots disturbed for a time even Caesar's Roman troops . They were probably in use long before . Their use among the ancient Britons , Gauls  and Belgians , as also probably among the Canaanites , evinces that they existed among very rude people.<p>The objection that the Assyrian chariots are not represented in the monuments as armed with scythes is an oversight, since these spoken of by Nahum may have been Median, certainly were not Assyrian. "In the day of His preparation" , when He musters the hosts for the battle; "and the fir-trees shall be terribly shaken;" i. e., fir-spears  (the weapon being often named from the wood of which it is made) shall be made to quiver through the force wherewith they shall be hurled.<p>The chariots shall rage - (Or madden , as the driving of Jehu is said to be "furiously," literally, in madness) "in the streets." The city is not yet taken; so, since this takes place "in the streets and broad ways," they are the confused preparations of the besieged. "They shall justle one against another," shall run rapidly to and fro, restlessly; "their show (English margin) is like torches," leaving streaks of fire, as they pass rapidly along. "They shall run" vehemently, "like the lightnings," swift; but vanishing. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/nahum/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. his mighty men&#8212;the Medo-Babylonian general's mighty men attacking Nineveh.<p>made red&#8212;The ancients dyed their bull's-hide shields red, partly to strike terror into the enemy, chiefly lest the blood from wounds which they might receive should be perceived and give confidence to the foe [Calvin].

It is better to translate the Hebrew as it is, "the chariots (shall be furnished) with fire-flashing scythes" (literally, "with the fire," or glitter, of iron weapons). Iron scythes were fixed at right angles to the axles and turned down, or parallel to it, inserted into the felly of the wheel. The Medes, perhaps, had such chariots, though no traces of them are found in Assyrian remains.

The shields of the soldiers in the armies of the Babylonians and Medes, those dashers in pieces that would come up against Nineveh, should be red; either with the blood of the slain, or thus coloured on purpose to inject terror to their enemies; or this may express the lustre of them, which being gilded, or made of gold or brass, in the rays of the sun glittered, and looked of a fiery red; see the Apocrypha: <p>"Now when the sun shone upon the shields of gold and brass, the mountains glistered therewith, and shined like lamps of fire.'' (1 Maccabees 6:39) <p>the valiant men are in scarlet; the generals and other officers of the army were clothed in scarlet; partly to show their greatness and nobleness, and partly to strike their enemies with terror, and to hide their blood should they be wounded, and so keep up their own spirits, and not encourage their enemies: <p>the chariots shall be with flaming torches in the day of his preparation; that is, when the Medes and Chaldeans, under their respective commander or commanders, shall prepare for the siege of the city, and to make their onset and attack upon it, the chariots used by them in war, which was common in those times, would have flaming torches in them; either to guide them in the night, or to set fire to houses or tents they should meet with, or to terrify the enemy: or "the chariots shall be as flaming torches" (g); they should run with such swiftness, that the wheels, being of iron, or cased with it, should strike fire upon the stones in such quantities, that they should look like torches flaming: <p>and the fir trees shall be terribly shaken; with the motion of the chariots; or this may be interpreted of spears and lances, and such like instruments of war, made of fir; which should be in such great numbers, and with so much activity used against the Ninevites, that it would look like shaking a forest of fir trees.

It is supposed that reference is made to shields covered with copper, which flashed red in the sun (<a href="http://apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/6-39.htm" title="Now when the sun shone upon the shields of gold and brass, the mountains glistered therewith, and shined like lamps of fire.">1Ma 6:39</a>). The word would more naturally suggest some practice of dyeing or anointing (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-5.htm" title="Prepare the table, watch in the watchtower, eat, drink: arise, you princes, and anoint the shield.">Isaiah 21:5</a>) the shields red. In Assyrian warfare the men fought in groups of two or three, one carrying the shield and the others shooting arrows or using other weapons of offence. Shields were of various kinds, sometimes of wicker work on a metal frame and covered with leather or metal plates; sometimes of more solid materials mounted with round or pointed bosses. Large standing shields set upon the ground were also in use, behind which the archers stood. Examples are given in Layard, <span class="ital">Nineveh</span>, II. pp. 344–348, and in Billerb.-Jerem., pp. 169, 174 seq.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">valiant men</span> are <span class="ital">in scarlet</span>] The reference is probably to the colour of the uniforms, which in ancient times was often red. As to the Babylonians, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-14.htm" title="And that she increased her prostitutions: for when she saw men portrayed on the wall, the images of the Chaldeans portrayed with vermilion,">Ezekiel 23:14</a>, and the Assyrians, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-6.htm" title="Which were clothed with blue, captains and rulers, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding on horses.">Ezekiel 23:6</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>shall be <span class="ital">with flaming torches</span>] lit., <span class="ital">with</span> (or, in) <span class="ital">fire of torches are the chariots</span>. The word rendered torches (<span class="ital">pldt</span>) is of uncertain meaning and was translated torches by A.V. under the assumption that it was a form of the usual word (<span class="ital">lpdt</span>). Ges. conjectured “steel” after Arabic, and so R.V. The Arab. word for steel, however, is borrowed from the Persian, and too late to be found here. Others think of an Arab, verb “to cut off,” &c., and render “fire which divides itself,” coruscating or flashing fire. The Ar. word means <span class="ital">to cut off a piece of property</span> in order to bestow it upon another; or, to cut flesh meat or liver in pieces, but has not the general sense of cut or divide, and could not express the idea of flashes or flames of fire. Altogether to be rejected is the idea founded on the word “to cut,” that chariots armed with scythes are meant. In Biblical literature such chariots are first mentioned, <a href="http://apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/13-2.htm" title="And with him Lysias his protector, and ruler of his affairs, having either of them a Grecian power of footmen, an hundred and ten thousand, and horsemen five thousand and three hundred, and elephants two and twenty, and three hundred chariots armed with hooks.">2Ma 13:2</a>. They were not known in early antiquity, being referred to for the first time in connexion with the battle of Cunaxa (Anab. i. 7, 10, i. 8, 10). In the Cyropaedia (iv. 1, 30) Cyrus is said to have been the inventor of scythed chariots. The Assyrians did not employ them, nor, it may be assumed, the Medes. The unknown word here is probably a technical term, and the reference may be to the burnished plates of metal with which the chariots were mounted or mailed, and the glittering weapons hung on them. A figure of such an armed chariot in Billerb.-Jerem., p. 167.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the fir trees shall be terribly shaken</span>] If “firtrees” be the true reading, long lances or spears may be intended. Sept. read <span class="ital">horsemen</span>, a somewhat similar word. The verb rendered “terribly shaken” (R.V. <span class="ital">shaken terribly</span>; perhaps <span class="ital">bristle, horrent</span>) does not occur again, though the word “reeling,” <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-2.htm" title="Behold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of trembling to all the people round about, when they shall be in the siege both against Judah and against Jerusalem.">Zechariah 12:2</a>, and the more usual form, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/60-3.htm" title="You have showed your people hard things: you have made us to drink the wine of astonishment.">Psalm 60:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-17.htm" title="Awake, awake, stand up, O Jerusalem, which have drunk at the hand of the LORD the cup of his fury; you have drunken the dregs of the cup of trembling, and wrung them out.">Isaiah 51:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-22.htm" title="Thus said your Lord the LORD, and your God that pleads the cause of his people, Behold, I have taken out of your hand the cup of trembling, even the dregs of the cup of my fury; you shall no more drink it again:">Isaiah 51:22</a>, may be derived from it; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-19.htm" title="The chains, and the bracelets, and the mufflers,">Isaiah 3:19</a> <span class="ital">gauze veils?</span> possibly from the quivering of the fine stuff? The reference would be to the shaking or vibrating of the long lances in the hands of those who brandished them. Or, reference might be to the battering rams swung against the walls.

The shields of the early Assyrians were usually circular or oval in shape, formed of wicker work, with a central boss of wood or metal. In the latest period they were made straight at bottom and rounded only at top (Rawlinson's 'Anc. Mon.,' 1:440). Some bronze shields have been brought to England from Nineveh; these are circular, about two feet and a half in diameter, the rim bending inwards, and forming a deep groove round the edge. The handles are of iron, and fastened by six bosses or nails, the heads of which form an ornament on the outer face of the shield (Layard, 'Discoveries,' p. 194). There were used also in sieges tall oblong shields, sufficient to protect the entire body, constructed of wicker work or the hides of animals (Bonomi, 'Nineveh and its Discoveries,' p. 320, etc.). The shields are said to be "made red," either because they were really so coloured (though the monuments have not confirmed this opinion), or else because of the polished copper with which they were sometimes covered (Josephus, 'Ant.,' 13:12. 5). Septuagint, pointing differently, <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, "the arms of their power from among men." <span class="cmt_word">Are in scarlet.</span> The word rendered "scarlet" is found nowhere else.

It is derived from the term applied to the <span class="accented">coccus</span>, or worm which was used in dyeing to give to cloth a deep scarlet colour (Henderson). Some have seen in the colour of the soldiers' garments an emblem of the Divine wrath of which they were the appointed ministers. This colour was much affected by combatants in old times as in modern days. Professor Edwards quotes Aelian, 'Var. Hist.' 6:6, "it was necessary to enter into battle clothed in purple, that the colour might denote a certain dignity, and if drops of blood from wounds were sprinkled on it, it became terrible to the enemy" (comp. Xen., 'Cyrop.,' 1:3, 2). Red or purple seems to have been the favourite colour of the Medea and Babylonians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-14.htm">Ezekiel 23:14</a>), blue or violet that of the Assyrians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-6.htm">Ezekiel 23:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-23.htm">Ezekiel 28:23</a>, etc.) (Orelli). <span class="cmt_word">The chariots shall be with flaming torches;</span> literally, <span class="accented">are with fire of steels</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> flash with steel, and so the clause should be translated, as in the Revised Version.

There is no trace in the monuments of chariots armed with scythes, which seem to have been unknown before the time of Cyrus. They are first mentioned in 2 Macc. 13:2 (see Livy, 37:41).

The LXX. renders it, <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "the reins," whence Jerome obtained his version, <span class="accented">igneae habenae curruum</span>; but it means, "things made of iron or steel,"and by critics uninstructed in monumental discoveries was naturally referred to the scythes with which chariots were armed in later times, instead of to the gleaming metal with which they were adorned. <span class="cmt_word">In the day of his preparation.</span> When the Lord marshals the host for battle, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-4.htm">Isaiah 13:4</a>. <span class="cmt_word">The fir trees shall be terribly shaken,</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the spears with their fir or cypress shafts are brandished. So Homer often calls the spear "the ash," from the material of which the handle was made (comp. 'Il.,' 16:143; 22:225, etc.). The Septuagint rendering is very far from the present text, <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1f31;&#x3c0;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "The horsemen shall be thrown into confusion." Nor is the Vulgate any better, <span class="accented">Agitatores cosopiti sunt</span>, which is explained to mean that the invaders are so carried away by their courage and fury, that they act as if intoxicated. "Sensus utique non spernedus," says a Roman Catholic commentator, "at unum desidero, ut scil. ex verbo ipso fluat" - which is certainly not the case. The text is possibly corrupt, and might be corrected from the Septuagint. Certainly there seems to be no other passage in the Hebrew Scriptures where the metaphor of "cypress" is used for "a spear." After the mention of the chariots, it is not unnatural that the writer should proceed, "and the riders are in active motion," urging their horses with hand and whip and gesture (see Knabenbauer, <span class="accented">in loc.</span>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/jonah/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>5 Waters surrounded me even to the soul: the flood encompassed me,<p>Sea-grass was wound round my head.<p>6 I went down to the foundations of the mountains;<p>The earth, its bolts were behind me for ever:<p>Then raisedst Thou my life out of the pit, O Jehovah my God.<p>7 When my soul fainted within me, I thought of Jehovah;<p>And my prayer came to Thee into Thy holy temple.<p>This strophe opens, like the last, with a description of the peril of death, to set forth still more perfectly the thought of miraculous deliverance which filled the prophet's mind. The first clause of the fifth verse recals to mind <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-5.htm">Psalm 18:5</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-2.htm">Psalm 69:2</a>; the words "the waters pressed (&#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;) even to the soul" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-2.htm">Psalm 69:2</a>) being simply strengthened by &#1488;&#1508;&#1508;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; after <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-5.htm">Psalm 18:5</a>. The waters of the sea girt him round about, reaching even to the soul, so that it appeared to be all over with his life. Teho&#772;m, the unfathomable flood of the ocean, surrounded him. Su&#772;ph, sedge, i.e., sea-grass, which grows at the bottom of the sea, was bound about his head; so that he had sunk to the very bottom. This thought is expressed still more distinctly in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-6.htm">Psalm 18:6</a>. &#1511;&#1510;&#1489;&#1497; &#1492;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, "the ends of the mountains" (from qa&#770;tsabh, to cut off, that which is cut off, then the place where anything is cut off), are their foundations and roots, which lie in the depths of the earth, reaching even to the foundation of the sea (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-16.htm">Psalm 18:16</a>). When he sank into the deep, the earth shut its bolts behind him (&#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; is placed at the head absolutely). The figure of bolts of the earth that were shut behind Jonah, which we only meet with here (&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1491; from the phrase &#1505;&#1490;&#1512; &#1492;&#1491;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514; &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1491;, to shut the door behind a person: <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/7-16.htm">Genesis 7:16</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-4.htm">2 Kings 4:4-5</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-33.htm">2 Kings 4:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-20.htm">Isaiah 26:20</a>), has an analogy in the idea which occurs in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/38-10.htm">Job 38:10</a>, of bolts and doors of the ocean. The bolts of the sea are the walls of the sea-basin, which set bounds to the sea, that it cannot pass over. Consequently the bolts of the earth can only be such barriers as restrain the land from spreading over the sea. These barriers are the weight and force of the waves, which prevent the land from encroaching on the sea. This weight of the waves, or of the great masses of water, which pressed upon Jonah when he had sunk to the bottom of the sea, shut or bolted against him the way back to the earth (the land), just as the bolts that are drawn before the door of a house fasten up the entrance into it; so that the reference is neither to "the rocks jutting out above the water, which prevented any one from ascending from the sea to the land," nor "densissima terrae compages, qua abyssus tecta Jonam in hac constitutum occludebat" (Marck). Out of this grave the Lord "brought up his life." Shachath is rendered &#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;, corruptio, by the early translators (lxx, Chald., Syr., Vulg.); and this rendering, which many of the more modern translators entirely reject, is unquestionably the correct one in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/17-14.htm">Job 17:14</a>, where the meaning "pit" is quite unsuitable. But it is by no means warranted in the present instance. The similarity of thought to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/30-4.htm">Psalm 30:4</a> points rather to the meaning pit  equals  cavern or grave, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/30-10.htm">Psalm 30:10</a>, where shachath is used interchangeably with &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512; and &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1493;&#1500; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/2-4.htm">Jonah 2:4</a> as being perfectly synonymous. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/2-7.htm">Jonah 2:7</a> is formed after <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/142-4.htm">Psalm 142:4</a> or <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/143-4.htm">Psalm 143:4</a>, except that &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; is used instead of &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1497;, because Jonah is not speaking of the covering of the spirit with faintness, but of the plunging of the life into night and the darkness of death by drowning in the water. &#1492;&#1514;&#1506;&#1496;&#1468;&#1507;, lit., to veil or cover one's self, hence to sink into night and faintness, to pine away. &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;, upon or in me, inasmuch as the I, as a person, embraces the soul or life (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-5.htm">Psalm 42:5</a>). When his soul was about to sink into the night of death, he thought of Jehovah in prayer, and his prayer reached to God in His holy temple, where Jehovah is enthroned as God and King of His people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-7.htm">Psalm 18:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/88-3.htm">Psalm 88:3</a>).<p>But when prayer reaches to God, then He helps and also saves. This awakens confidence in the Lord, and impels to praise and thanksgiving. These thoughts form the last strophe, with which the Psalm of thanksgiving is appropriately closed. </body></html>
