But Jehovah has allowed its hedge to be broken down. “All they that go by do pluck her . . .” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/80-12.htm" title="Why have you then broken down her hedges, so that all they which pass by the way do pluck her?">Psalm 80:12-13</a>). In the punishment of one notoriously oppressive world-power the prophet sees a pledge that the branch of Jehovah shall be again “beautiful and glorious” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/4-2.htm" title="In that day shall the branch of the LORD be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and comely for them that are escaped of Israel.">Isaiah 4:2</a>). The construction in the first part of the verse is perplexing. It appears best to attach a special emphasis to the names “Jacob” and “Israel” in connection with their original signification. “Jacob” is the birth-name—the nation regarded apart from its religious privileges, the homeless exile, the downtrodden “worm (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-14.htm" title="Fear not, you worm Jacob, and you men of Israel; I will help you, said the LORD, and your redeemer, the Holy One of Israel.">Isaiah 41:14</a>), the younger son among nations. But “Israel” is the chosen of God; he who “had power over the angel and prevailed”; the “beloved son, called out of Egypt.” The name given by Jehovah is henceforth to have its full significance, as in the days of old. “Jacob,” the name which is so often used after the deportation of the ten tribes, is again to be indicated as “Israel,” the favoured people of God. Some commentators render, “For Jehovah restores alike the glory of Jacob and the glory of Israel,” &c., making “Jacob” the designation of the southern, “Israel” that of the northern kingdom. But the term “Jacob” nowhere else has this distinctive force.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/nahum/2.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/nahum/2-2.htm" title="For the LORD has turned away the excellency of Jacob, as the excellency of Israel: for the emptiers have emptied them out, and marred their vine branches....">Nahum 2:2-4</a></span>. <span class="ital">For the Lord hath turned away the excellency of Jacob — </span>Jacob and Israel stood in a nearer relation to God than Nineveh; yet God hath punished them: much more will he punish Nineveh. By the <span class="ital">excellency of Jacob, </span>the wealth, the strength, the valiant men, all that Jacob gloried in is here meant. <span class="ital">For the emptiers have emptied them out — </span>This is spoken of the Assyrians having spoiled the kingdoms of Israel and Judah. <span class="ital">And marred their vine-branches — </span>Ruined their towns and villages.

Some think, however, that the expression signifies here, their being bereaved of their children by the Assyrian conquerors. <span class="ital">The shield of his mighty men is made red — </span>Is stained with blood: this appears to be a description of the Chaldeans, or Medes, assaulting Nineveh. <span class="ital">The valiant</span> <span class="ital">men are in scarlet — </span>The eastern people were very fond of dressing themselves in scarlet, as we learn from Herodotus.

God looks upon proud cities, and brings them down. Particular account is given of the terrors wherein the invading enemy shall appear against Nineveh. The empire of Assyria is represented as a queen, about to be led captive to Babylon. Guilt in the conscience fills men with terror in an evil day; and what will treasures or glory do for us in times of distress, or in the day of wrath? Yet for such things how many lose their souls!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/nahum/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For the Lord hath turned away - (rather restoreth) the excellency of Jacob Speaking of what should come, as already come. For Nineveh falls, because God restores His people, whom it had oppressed. The restoration of God's favor to His Church is the season of His punishment of their enemies; as, again, His displeasure against her enemies is a token of His favor to her. When Herod was smitten by God, "the word of God grew and multiplied" <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/12-24.htm">Acts 12:24</a>. A long captivity was still before Judah, yet the destruction of the Assyrian was the earnest that every "oppressing city should cease" <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-1.htm">Isaiah 33:1</a>.<p>The excellency of Jacob - The word, "excellency," is used in a good or bad sense; bad, if man takes the excellency to himself; good, as given by God. This is decisive against a modern popular rendering ; "has returned to the excellency of Jacob;" for Scripture knows of no "excellency of Jacob," except God Himself or grace from God. Jacob, if separated from God or left by Him, has no excellency, to which God could return.<p>As the excellency of Israel - Both the ten and the two tribes had suffered by the Assyrian. The ten had been carried captive by Shalmanezer, the two had been harassed by Sennacherib. After the captivity of the ten tribes, the name Jacob is used of Judah only. It may be then, that the restoration of God's favor is promised to each separately. Or , there may be an emphasis in the names themselves. Their forefather bore the name of Jacob in his troubled days of exile; that of Israel was given him on his return <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-28.htm">Genesis 32:28</a>. It would then mean, the afflicted people (Jacob) shall be restored to its utmost glory as Israel. The sense is the same.<p>For the emptiers have emptied them out - Their chastisement is the channel of their restoration. Unlike the world, their emptiness is their fullness, as the fullness of the world is its emptiness. The world is cast down, not to arise, for "woe to him that is alone when he falleth: for he hath not another to help him up" <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:10</a>. The Church falleth, but "to arise" <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/7-8.htm">Micah 7:8</a> : the people is restored, because it had borne chastening <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-3.htm">Ezekiel 36:3</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-6.htm">Ezekiel 36:6-7</a>; "for the Lord hath restored the excellency of Jacob, for the emptiers have emptied them. out and marred their vinebranches" (see <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/80-12.htm">Psalm 80:12-13</a>), i. e., its fruit-bearing branches, that, as far as in them lay, it should not bear fruit unto God; but to cut the vine is, by God's grace, to make it shoot forth and bear fruit more abundantly. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/nahum/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. For the Lord hath turned away the excellency of Jacob&#8212;that is, the time for Nineveh's overthrow is ripe, because Jacob (Judah) and Israel (the ten tribes) have been sufficiently chastised. The Assyrian rod of chastisement, having done its work, is to be thrown into the fire. If God chastised Jacob and Israel with all their "excellency" (Jerusalem and the temple, which was their pre-eminent excellency above all nations in God's eyes, Ps 47:4; 87:2; Eze 24:21; see on [1158]Am 6:8), how much more will He punish fatally Nineveh, an alien to Him, and idolatrous?

Israel and Judah are often compared to a vine, and so their posterity to branches: or "corrupted" (f) them, with superstition and idolatry.

Jehovah cast him into the depth of the sea, because the seamen were merely the executors of the punishment inflicted upon him by Jehovah. Metsu&#772;la&#770;h, the deep, is defined by "the heart of the seas" as the deepest abyss of the ocean. The plural yamm&#305;&#772;m (seas) is used here with distinct significance, instead of the singular, "into the heart of the sea" (ya&#770;m) in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/15-8.htm">Exodus 15:8</a>, to express the idea of the boundless ocean (see Dietrich, Abhandlung zur hebr. Grammatik, pp. 16, 17). The next clauses are circumstantial clauses, and mean, so that the current of the sea surrounded me, and all the billows and waves of the sea, which Jehovah had raised into a storm, went over me. Na&#770;ha&#770;r, a river or stream, is the streaming or current of the sea, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/24-2.htm">Psalm 24:2</a>. The words of the second hemistich are a reminiscence of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-8.htm">Psalm 42:8</a>. What the Korahite singer of that psalm had experienced spiritually, viz., that one wave of trouble after another swept over him, that had the prophet literally experienced. Jonah "does not say, The waves and the billows of the sea went over me; but Thy waves and Thy billows, because he felt in his conscience that the sea with its waves and billows was the servant of God and of His wrath, to punish sin" (Luther). <a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/2-4.htm">Jonah 2:4</a> contains the apodosis to <a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/2-3.htm">Jonah 2:3</a>: "When Thou castedst me into the deep, then I said (sc., in my heart, i.e., then I thought) that I was banished from the sphere of Thine eyes, i.e., of Thy protection and care." These words are formed from a reminiscence of <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/31-23.htm">Psalm 31:23</a>, &#1504;&#1490;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; being substituted for the &#1504;&#1490;&#1512;&#1494;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; of the psalm. The second hemistich is attached adversatively. &#1488;&#1498;, which there is no necessity to alter into &#1488;&#1498;  equals  &#1488;&#1497;&#1498;, as Hitzig supposes, introduces the antithesis in an energetic manner, like &#1488;&#1499;&#1501; elsewhere, in the sense of nevertheless, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-15.htm">Isaiah 14:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/49-16.htm">Psalm 49:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-15.htm">Job 13:15</a> (cf. Ewald, 354, a). The thought that it is all over with him is met by the confidence of faith that he will still look to the holy temple of the Lord, that is to say, will once more approach the presence of the Lord, to worship before Him in His temple, - an assurance which recals <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/5-8.htm">Psalm 5:8</a>.<p>The thought that by the grace of the Lord he has been once more miraculously delivered out of the gates of death, and brought to the light of the world, is carried out still further in the following strophe, in entirely new turns of thought. </body></html>
