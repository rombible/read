God looks upon proud cities, and brings them down. Particular account is given of the terrors wherein the invading enemy shall appear against Nineveh. The empire of Assyria is represented as a queen, about to be led captive to Babylon. Guilt in the conscience fills men with terror in an evil day; and what will treasures or glory do for us in times of distress, or in the day of wrath? Yet for such things how many lose their souls!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/nahum/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Army is arrayed against army; the armies, thus far, of God against the army of His enemy; all without is order; all within, confusion. The assailing army, from its compactness and unity, is spoken of, both as many and one. The might is of many; the order and singleness of purpose is as of one. The shield, collectively, not shields. "His mighty men;" He, who was last spoken of, was Almighty God, as He says in Isaiah; "I have commanded My consecrated ones; I have also called My mighty ones, them that rejoice in My highness" <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-3.htm">Isaiah 13:3</a>.<p>Is reddened - Either with blood of the Assyrians, shed in some previous battle, before the siege began, or (which is the meaning of the word elsewhere ), an artificial color, the color of blood being chosen, as expressive of fiery fierceness. The valiant men are in scarlet, for beauty and terror, as, again being the color of blood . It was especially the color of the dress of their nobles  one chief color of the Median dress, from whom the Persians adopted their's . "The chariots shall be with flaming torches," literally, "with the fire of steels , or of sharp incisive instruments. Either way the words seem to indicate that the chariots were in some way armed with steel. For steel was not an ornament, nor do the chariots appear to have been ornamented with metal. Iron would have hindered the primary object of lightness and speed. Steel, as distinct from iron, is made only for incisiveness. In either way, it is probable, that scythed chariots were already in use. Against such generals, as the younger Cyrus  and Alexander , they were of no avail; but they must have been terrific instruments against undisciplined armies.<p>The rush and noise of the British chariots disturbed for a time even Caesar's Roman troops . They were probably in use long before . Their use among the ancient Britons , Gauls  and Belgians , as also probably among the Canaanites , evinces that they existed among very rude people.<p>The objection that the Assyrian chariots are not represented in the monuments as armed with scythes is an oversight, since these spoken of by Nahum may have been Median, certainly were not Assyrian. "In the day of His preparation" , when He musters the hosts for the battle; "and the fir-trees shall be terribly shaken;" i. e., fir-spears  (the weapon being often named from the wood of which it is made) shall be made to quiver through the force wherewith they shall be hurled.<p>The chariots shall rage - (Or madden , as the driving of Jehu is said to be "furiously," literally, in madness) "in the streets." The city is not yet taken; so, since this takes place "in the streets and broad ways," they are the confused preparations of the besieged. "They shall justle one against another," shall run rapidly to and fro, restlessly; "their show (English margin) is like torches," leaving streaks of fire, as they pass rapidly along. "They shall run" vehemently, "like the lightnings," swift; but vanishing. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/nahum/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. rage&#8212;are driven in furious haste (Jer 46:9).<p>justle one against another&#8212;run to and fro [Maurer].<p>in the broad ways&#8212;(2Ch 32:6).

In the streets of Nineveh when taken; where they shall be drove in a furious manner from place to place, the men in them breathing out slaughter and death wherever they came. Kimchi understands this of the chariots of the Ninevites; who shall drive about in them in the streets of the city like madmen; not daring to go out to fight the enemy, being mightier and more numerous than they. <p>They shall justle one against another in the broad ways; because of their numbers, and the haste they shall make to spoil and plunder the city; or the Ninevites shall justle one against another, in their hurry and confusion to make their escape. <p>They shall seem like torches; either the chariots of the Medes and Chaldeans, for the reasons given in the preceding verse <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/2-3.htm">Nahum 2:3</a>; or they themselves, because of their fierceness and cruelty; or the faces of the Ninevites, being covered with shame, so Kimchi; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-8.htm">Isaiah 13:8</a>. <p>They shall run like the lightnings; exceeding swiftly, with irresistible force and power; the above writer interprets this of the Ninevites also, running from one end of their city to the other in the utmost confusion, not knowing what to do; but the whole of these two verses <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/2-3.htm">Nahum 2:3</a> seem to be a description of their enemies. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/nahum/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The chariots shall rage in the streets, they shall justle one against another in the broad ways: they shall seem like torches, they shall run like the lightnings.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/nahum/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">4</span>. <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/2-3.htm" title="The shield of his mighty men is made red, the valiant men are in scarlet: the chariots shall be with flaming torches in the day of his preparation, and the fir trees shall be terribly shaken.">Nahum 2:3</a> referred to the aspect of the assailing army in the day of preparation; <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/2-4.htm" title="The chariots shall rage in the streets, they shall jostle one against another in the broad ways: they shall seem like torches, they shall run like the lightning.">Nahum 2:4</a></span> appears to describe an actual conflict before the city.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">shall rage in the streets</span>] <span class="bld">rage in the outplaces</span>. The reference is certainly to what is taking place outside the walls, not within the town. The term “streets” often means fields (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-10.htm" title="Who gives rain on the earth, and sends waters on the fields:">Job 5:10</a>), or what lies outside or abroad; it is parallel to “broad places” next clause, i.e. open ground in front of the walled city.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>A suburb or outskirt of Nineveh called <span class="ital">ribit Nina</span> (broad place of Nineveh) lay probably on the N.E. of the city, or on the east, the side on which the great road to Arbela left the city.

The first clause of the fifth verse recals to mind <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-5.htm">Psalm 18:5</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-2.htm">Psalm 69:2</a>; the words "the waters pressed (&#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;) even to the soul" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-2.htm">Psalm 69:2</a>) being simply strengthened by &#1488;&#1508;&#1508;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; after <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-5.htm">Psalm 18:5</a>. The waters of the sea girt him round about, reaching even to the soul, so that it appeared to be all over with his life. Teho&#772;m, the unfathomable flood of the ocean, surrounded him. Su&#772;ph, sedge, i.e., sea-grass, which grows at the bottom of the sea, was bound about his head; so that he had sunk to the very bottom. This thought is expressed still more distinctly in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-6.htm">Psalm 18:6</a>. &#1511;&#1510;&#1489;&#1497; &#1492;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, "the ends of the mountains" (from qa&#770;tsabh, to cut off, that which is cut off, then the place where anything is cut off), are their foundations and roots, which lie in the depths of the earth, reaching even to the foundation of the sea (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-16.htm">Psalm 18:16</a>). When he sank into the deep, the earth shut its bolts behind him (&#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; is placed at the head absolutely). The figure of bolts of the earth that were shut behind Jonah, which we only meet with here (&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1491; from the phrase &#1505;&#1490;&#1512; &#1492;&#1491;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514; &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1491;, to shut the door behind a person: <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/7-16.htm">Genesis 7:16</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-4.htm">2 Kings 4:4-5</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-33.htm">2 Kings 4:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-20.htm">Isaiah 26:20</a>), has an analogy in the idea which occurs in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/38-10.htm">Job 38:10</a>, of bolts and doors of the ocean. The bolts of the sea are the walls of the sea-basin, which set bounds to the sea, that it cannot pass over. Consequently the bolts of the earth can only be such barriers as restrain the land from spreading over the sea. These barriers are the weight and force of the waves, which prevent the land from encroaching on the sea. This weight of the waves, or of the great masses of water, which pressed upon Jonah when he had sunk to the bottom of the sea, shut or bolted against him the way back to the earth (the land), just as the bolts that are drawn before the door of a house fasten up the entrance into it; so that the reference is neither to "the rocks jutting out above the water, which prevented any one from ascending from the sea to the land," nor "densissima terrae compages, qua abyssus tecta Jonam in hac constitutum occludebat" (Marck). Out of this grave the Lord "brought up his life." Shachath is rendered &#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;, corruptio, by the early translators (lxx, Chald., Syr., Vulg.); and this rendering, which many of the more modern translators entirely reject, is unquestionably the correct one in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/17-14.htm">Job 17:14</a>, where the meaning "pit" is quite unsuitable. But it is by no means warranted in the present instance. The similarity of thought to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/30-4.htm">Psalm 30:4</a> points rather to the meaning pit  equals  cavern or grave, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/30-10.htm">Psalm 30:10</a>, where shachath is used interchangeably with &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512; and &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1493;&#1500; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/2-4.htm">Jonah 2:4</a> as being perfectly synonymous. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/2-7.htm">Jonah 2:7</a> is formed after <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/142-4.htm">Psalm 142:4</a> or <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/143-4.htm">Psalm 143:4</a>, except that &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; is used instead of &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1497;, because Jonah is not speaking of the covering of the spirit with faintness, but of the plunging of the life into night and the darkness of death by drowning in the water. &#1492;&#1514;&#1506;&#1496;&#1468;&#1507;, lit., to veil or cover one's self, hence to sink into night and faintness, to pine away. &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;, upon or in me, inasmuch as the I, as a person, embraces the soul or life (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-5.htm">Psalm 42:5</a>). When his soul was about to sink into the night of death, he thought of Jehovah in prayer, and his prayer reached to God in His holy temple, where Jehovah is enthroned as God and King of His people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-7.htm">Psalm 18:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/88-3.htm">Psalm 88:3</a>).<p>But when prayer reaches to God, then He helps and also saves. This awakens confidence in the Lord, and impels to praise and thanksgiving. These thoughts form the last strophe, with which the Psalm of thanksgiving is appropriately closed. </body></html>
