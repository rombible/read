The empire of Assyria is represented as a queen, about to be led captive to Babylon.

She (the people of the city, under the figure of a captive woman) "shall be laid bare," in shame, to her reproach; "she shall be brought up" , to judgment, or from Nineveh as being now sunk low and depressed; "and her maids," the lesser cities, as female attendants on the royal city, and their inhabitants represented as women, both as put to shame and for weakness. The whole empire of Nineveh was overthrown by Nabopalassar. Yet neither was the special shame wanting, that the noble matrons and virgins were so led captives in shame and sorrow.

Huzzab&#8212;the name of the queen of Nineveh, from a Hebrew root implying that she stood by the king (Ps 45:9), [Vatablus]. Rather, Nineveh personified as a queen. She who had long stood in the most supreme prosperity. Similarly Calvin. Maurer makes it not a proper name, and translates, "It is established," or "determined" (compare Ge 41:32). English Version is more supported by the parallelism.<p>led away captive&#8212;The Hebrew requires rather, "she is laid bare"; brought forth from the apartments where Eastern women remained secluded, and is stripped of her ornamental attire. Compare Isa 47:2, 3, where the same image of a woman with face and legs exposed is used of a city captive and dismantled (compare Na 3:5), [Maurer].<p>brought up&#8212;Her people shall be made to go up to Babylon.

The image implies helplessness and grief suppressed, but at times breaking out). The minor cities and dependencies of Nineveh may be meant, or her captive women [Jerome].

The Targum translates it the queen; and Jarchi and Aben Ezra, after R. Samuel, take it to be the name of the queen of Assyria; so called, as every queen might, from her standing at the king's right hand, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-9.htm">Psalm 45:9</a> who, when the royal palace was destroyed, was taken out, and carried captive with the rest, who before was in a well settled and tranquil state and condition: or perhaps the king himself is designed, who may be represented as a woman, as follows, for his effeminacy; conversing only with women; imitating their voice; wearing their apparel; and doing their work, spinning, &amp;c. which is the character historians (l) give of the last king of the Assyrians: some (m) take it to be the idol Venus, worshipped by the Ninevites: though it may be meant either of the palace itself, as Kimchi's father, which was firm and well established; or rather Nineveh itself, thought to be stable and secure, the inhabitants of which should be carried into a strange land: <p>she shall be brought up; the queen, or the king, out of the palace or private retirement, where they were in peace and safety; or Nineveh, and the inhabitants of it, out of their secure state and condition: <p>and her maids shall lead her; her maids of honour, supporting her on the right hand and left, ready to sink and faint under her misfortunes: this may also be understood of towns and villages, and the inhabitants of them, that should go into captivity along with Nineveh: <p>as with the voice of doves, tabering upon their breasts; mourning like doves, inwardly and secretly, not daring to express their sorrow more publicly, because of their enemies; but knocking and beating upon their breasts, as men do upon tabrets or drums, thereby expressing the inward grief of their minds; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-16.htm">Ezekiel 7:16</a>. <p>(l) Diodor.

Reference must be to the queen, but whether she be called by her name, or whether some epithet be applied to her is uncertain. The text even may be faulty. Some would read <span class="ital">hazzab</span>, “the lizard,” a creature which takes refuge in holes, fancying that the queen was so called because she was detected and dragged from her hiding-place. This poor witticism need not be attributed to the prophet. There is another word <span class="ital">hazzab</span> signifying “the litter” or palanquin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-20.htm" title="And they shall bring all your brothers for an offering to the LORD out of all nations on horses, and in chariots, and in litters, and on mules, and on swift beasts, to my holy mountain Jerusalem, said the LORD, as the children of Israel bring an offering in a clean vessel into the house of the LORD.">Isaiah 66:20</a>), and in lieu of anything better one might be tempted to think that the litter might mean the woman or lady, just as in Arab. <span class="ital">ḍḥa‘inah</span> means a woman’s litter and then a woman.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">shall be led away captive</span>] <span class="bld">is detected</span>, or <span class="bld">uncovered</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">shall be brought up</span>] <span class="bld">she is brought up</span> (or, out), <span class="bld">her maids moaning as with the voice of doves, tabering upon their breasts</span> (<a href="http://apocrypha.org/judith/8-5.htm" title="And she made her a tent upon the top of her house, and put on sackcloth upon her loins and ware her widow's apparel.">Jdt 8:5</a>). The phrase “brought up” following “detected” probably means dragged out; R.V. <span class="ital">carried away</span>. To “taber” is to drum or beat. Beating the breast was a gesture of grief or despair, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-13.htm" title="And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes to heaven, but smote on his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner.">Luke 18:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-27.htm" title="And there followed him a great company of people, and of women, which also bewailed and lamented him.">Luke 23:27</a>; people also smote upon the thigh, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-19.htm" title="Surely after that I was turned, I repented; and after that I was instructed, I smote on my thigh: I was ashamed, yes, even confounded, because I did bear the reproach of my youth.">Jeremiah 31:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-12.htm" title="Cry and howl, son of man: for it shall be on my people, it shall be on all the princes of Israel: terrors by reason of the sword shall be on my people: smite therefore on your thigh.">Ezekiel 21:12</a> (Heb. 21:17).

Such a personage is unknown to history; and there is no reason why she should be mentioned rather than the king; and persona are not introduced by name in prophecy except for some very special reason, as Cyrus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a>). The alternative rendering, "it is decreed," adopted by Keil, Pusey, and many modern commentators, is unexampled, and comes in baldly, and not at all according to the prophet's manner.
