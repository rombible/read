Nineveh knows not that God who contends with her, but is told what a God he is. It is good for all to mix faith with what is here said concerning Him, which speaks great terror to the wicked, and comfort to believers. Let each take his portion from it: let sinners read it and tremble; and let saints read it and triumph. The anger of the Lord is contrasted with his goodness to his people. Perhaps they are obscure and little regarded in the world, but the Lord knows them. The Scripture character of Jehovah agrees not with the views of proud reasoners. The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ is slow to wrath and ready to forgive, but he will by no means acquit the wicked; and there is tribulation and anguish for every soul that doeth evil: but who duly regards the power of his wrath?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/nahum/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Who can stand before His indignation? - This question appeals to our own consciences, that we cannot . It anticipates the self-conviction at every day of God's visitation, the forerunners of the lust. The word rendered "indignation" is reserved almost exclusively to denote the wrath of God. : "Who can trust in his own righteousness, and, for the abundance of his works or consciousness of his virtues, not be in need of mercy? 'Enter not into judgment with Thy servant, O Lord, for in Thy sight shall no man living be justified;' and in Job it is said truly, 'Behold He put no trust in His servants, and His Angels He charged with folly. How much less in them that dwell in houses of' clay, whose foundation is in the dust, which ewe crushed before the moth?' <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/4-18.htm">Job 4:18-19</a>. It were needless now to prove, that man's own deserts suffice to no one, and that we are not saved but by the grace of God, 'for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God' <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-23.htm">Romans 3:23</a>. Wherefore he saith, 'before His indignation,' standing face to Face before Him in wrath."<p>Literally, "in the Face of:" guilt cannot look in the face of man, how much less, of God. The bliss of the righteous is the punishment of the wicked, to behold God face to Face. For  "whoever trusts in his own works deserves His indignation. and thinking he stands, righteously does he fall."<p>His fury is poured out - &#1504;&#1514;&#1498; is used of the pouring out of God's wrath, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-20.htm">Jeremiah 7:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/42-18.htm">Jeremiah 42:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-7.htm">2 Chronicles 12:7</a> (as more commonly &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1498; here its native meaning is brought out the more, by adding &#1499;&#1488;&#1513;.<p>Like fire - , sweeping away, like a torrent of molten fire, him who presumes that be can stand before His Face, as He did the cities of the plain <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/19.htm">Genesis 19</a>, the image of the everlasting fire, which shall burn up His enemies on every side.

The description, <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/nahum/1-2.htm" title="God is jealous, and the LORD revenges; the LORD revenges, and is furious; the LORD will take vengeance on his adversaries, and he reserves wrath for his enemies....">Nahum 1:2-5</a></span>, is one of the manifestation of the Lord on the more terrible side of His being. For though His revelation of Himself at the Exodus and later (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/judges/5-4.htm" title="LORD, when you went out of Seir, when you marched out of the field of Edom, the earth trembled, and the heavens dropped, the clouds also dropped water....">Jdg 5:4-5</a>) had for its purpose the delivery of His people, this implied wrath and vengeance upon their enemies (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/habakkuk/3-12.htm" title="You did march through the land in indignation, you did thresh the heathen in anger....">Habakkuk 3:12-13</a>).

By the statement, "I fear," etc., he had no intention of describing himself as a righteous or innocent man (Hitzig), but simply meant to indicate his relation to God - namely, that he adored the living God who created the whole earth and, as Creator, governed the world. For he admits directly after, that he has sinned against this God, by telling them, as we may see from <a href="http://biblehub.com/jonah/1-10.htm">Jonah 1:10</a>, of his flight from Jehovah. He had not told them this as soon as he embarked in the ship, as Hitzig supposes, but does so now for the first time when they ask about his people, his country, etc., as we may see most unmistakeably from <a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/1-10.htm">Jonah 1:10</a>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/1-9.htm">Jonah 1:9</a> Jonah's statement is not given completely; but the principal fact, viz., that he was a Hebrew and worshipped Jehovah, is followed immediately by the account of the impression which this acknowledgement made upon the heathen sailors; and the confession of his sin is mentioned afterwards as a supplement, to assign the reason for the great fear which came upon the sailors in consequence. &#1502;&#1492;&#1470;&#1494;&#1468;&#1488;&#1514; &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1514;, What hast thou done! is not a question as to the nature of his sin, but an exclamation of horror at his flight from Jehovah, the God heaven and earth, as the following explanatory clauses &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1497;&#1491;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; clearly show. The great fear which came upon the heathen seamen at this confession of Jonah may be fully explained from the dangerous situation in which they found themselves, since the storm preached the omnipotence of God more powerfully than words could possibly do. </body></html>
