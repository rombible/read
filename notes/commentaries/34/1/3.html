To vindicate His power, Nahum, after the manner of other Hebrew poets and prophets, reverts to the wonders of the Exodus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/nahum/1-4.htm" title="He rebukes the sea, and makes it dry, and dries up all the rivers: Bashan languishes, and Carmel, and the flower of Lebanon languishes.">Nahum 1:4-5</a>). The pillars of cloud and fire in the desert march; the quaking cliffs of Sinai; the Red Sea and Jordan divided at His word; Canaan succumbing at every point, upwards to mighty Lebanon in the north, and across from Eastern Bashan to Western Carmel—these are the testimonies to Jehovah’s might. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/habakkuk/3-6.htm" title="He stood, and measured the earth: he beheld, and drove asunder the nations; and the everlasting mountains were scattered, the perpetual hills did bow: his ways are everlasting.">Habakkuk 3:6-10</a>.)<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/nahum/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:1-8 About a hundred years before, at Jonah's preaching, the Ninevites repented, and were spared, yet, soon after, they became worse than ever. Nineveh knows not that God who contends with her, but is told what a God he is. It is good for all to mix faith with what is here said concerning Him, which speaks great terror to the wicked, and comfort to believers. Let each take his portion from it: let sinners read it and tremble; and let saints read it and triumph. The anger of the Lord is contrasted with his goodness to his people. Perhaps they are obscure and little regarded in the world, but the Lord knows them. The Scripture character of Jehovah agrees not with the views of proud reasoners. The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ is slow to wrath and ready to forgive, but he will by no means acquit the wicked; and there is tribulation and anguish for every soul that doeth evil: but who duly regards the power of his wrath?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/nahum/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Lord is slow to anger - Nahum takes up the words of Jonah Jon 4:2 as he spoke of God's attributes toward Nineveh, but only to show the opposite side of them. Jonah declares how God is "slow to anger," giving men time of repentance, and if they do repent, "repenting Him also of the evil;" Nahum, that the long-suffering of God is not "slackness," that "He is long-suffering to usward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance."<p>And strong in power - Divine long-suffering gees along with Divine power. God can be long-suffering, because He can, whenever He sees good, punish. His long-suffering is a token, not of weakness, but of power. He can allow persons the whole extent of trial, because, when they are past cure, He can end it at once. "God is a righteous judge, strong and patient, and God wraths every day" <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-11.htm">Psalm 7:11</a>. The wrath comes only at the last, but it is ever present with God. He cannot but be displeased with the sin; and so the Psalmist describes in the manner of men the gradual approximation to its discharge. "If he (the sinner) will not return (from evil or to God), He will whet His sword; He hath trodden His bow and directed it: He hath prepared for him instruments of death; He hath made his arrows burning" <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/7-12.htm">Psalm 7:12-13</a>. We see the arrow with unextinguishable fire, ready to be discharged, waiting for the final decision of the wicked, whether he will repent or not, but that still "the Day of the Lord will come" <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9-10</a>. "He will not at all acquit."<p>The words occur originally in the great declaration of God's attributes of mercy by Moses, as a necessary limitation of them ; they are continued to God's people, yet with the side of mercy predominant <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-11.htm">Jeremiah 30:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-28.htm">Jeremiah 46:28</a>; they are pleaded to Himself <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-18.htm">Numbers 14:18</a>; they are the sanction of the third commandment <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-7.htm">Exodus 20:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-11.htm">Deuteronomy 5:11</a>. He "will not acquit" of His own will, apart from His justice. So He saith, "I can of Mine own self do nothing" <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/5-30.htm">John 5:30</a>, i. e., (in part), not as unjust judges, who "call good evil and evil good," following their own will, not the merits of the case; but, "as I hear, I judge, and My judgment is just." He cannot even have mercy and spare unjustly, nor without the lowliness of penitence. Even if it is Jerusalem, over which He wept, or His "companion, His own familiar friend" <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/55-14.htm">Psalm 55:14</a>, He, who is no "accepter of persons," cannot of mere favor forgive the impenitent.<p>The Lord hath His way in the whirlwind and in the storm - The vengeance of God comes at last swiftly, vehemently, fearfully, irresistibly. "When they say, Peace and safety, then sudden destruction cometh upon them" <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:3</a>, and all creation stands at the command of the Creator against His enemies. "He shall take to Him His jealousy for complete armor, and make the creature His weapon, for the revenge of His enemies" (Wisd. 5:17).<p>And the clouds are the dust of His feet - Perhaps the imagery is from the light dust raised by an earthly army, of which Nahum's word is used <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/26-10.htm">Ezekiel 26:10</a>. The powers of heaven are arrayed against the might of earth. On earth a little dust, soon to subside; in heaven, the whirlwind and the storm, which sweep away what does not bow before them. The vapors, slight on outward seeming, but formed of countless multitudes of mist-drops, are yet dark and lowering, as they burst, and resistless. "The Feet of God are that power whereby He trampleth upon the ungodly." So it is said to the Son, "Sit Thou on My Right Hand until I make Thine enemies Thy footstool."

He is not in haste to execute it; he takes time for it, and gives men space for repentance. Nineveh had had a proof of this when it repented at the preaching of Jonah, upon which the Lord deferred the execution of his wrath; but lest they should presume upon this, and conclude the Lord would always bear with them, though they had returned to their former impieties; they are let to know, that this his forbearance was not owing to want of power or will in him to punish: since he is <p>great in power, and will not at all acquit the wicked; he is able to execute the wrath he threatens, and will by no means clear the guilty, or let them go free and unpunished; though he moves slowly, as he may seem in the execution of his judgments, yet they shall surely be brought on his enemies, and be fully accomplished: <p>the Lord hath his way in the whirlwind and in the storm, and the clouds are the dust of his feet; he spoke to Job out of the whirlwind; he descended on Mount Sinai in a storm and tempest; and the clouds are his chariots; in which he rides swiftly; and which, for their appearance and number, are like the dust raised by a multitude of horsemen riding full speed, The wrath of God may be compared to a whirlwind, and a storm, which is sometimes hastily and suddenly executed upon men: respect seems to be had to the armies of the Medes and Chaldeans against the Assyrians; who, as the Babylonians against the Jews, came up as clouds, and their chariots as the whirlwind, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-13.htm">Jeremiah 4:13</a>; and the figures beautifully describe the numbers of them, the force with which they came; and in an elegant manner represent the vast quantity of dust raised by an army in full march; at the head of which was the Lord himself, ordering, directing, and succeeding, before whom none can stand. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/nahum/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The <span class="cverse3">{f}</span> LORD <i>is</i> slow to anger, and great in power, and will not at all acquit <i>the wicked</i>: the LORD hath his way in the whirlwind and in the storm, and the clouds <i>are</i> the dust of his feet.</span><p>(f) Thus the wicked would make God's mercy an occasion to sin, but the Prophet wishes them to consider his power and justice.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/nahum/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">3</span>. <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/1-3.htm" title="The LORD is slow to anger, and great in power, and will not at all acquit the wicked: the LORD has his way in the whirlwind and in the storm, and the clouds are the dust of his feet.">Nahum 1:3</a> continues the description of the relation of Jehovah to His enemies: He is longsuffering, delays chastisement long, but eventually takes vengeance. The meaning of the phrase “great in power” is not clear. If employed in the usual objective sense as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-4.htm" title="He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who has hardened himself against him, and has prospered?">Job 9:4</a>, the verse would read, The Lord is slow to anger, but great in strength and will by no means leave unpunished (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-22.htm" title="What if God, willing to show his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much long-suffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction:">Romans 9:22</a>). If “great in power” had a sense parallel to <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/36-5.htm" title="Behold, God is mighty, and despises not any: he is mighty in strength and wisdom.">Job 36:5</a>, “Lo God is great and despises not, great in strength of heart” (mind), that is, if “strength” referred to attributes of the divine mind, magnanimity and longsuffering, the clause would be connected rather with the first, and the verse would read, “The Lord is slow to anger and great in strength, but he will &c.”; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/14-17.htm" title="And now, I beseech you, let the power of my LORD be great, according as you have spoken, saying,...">Numbers 14:17-18</a>, to which the verse has great resemblance. The phrase “will not acquit,” or leave unpunished, is used here absolutely, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-7.htm" title="Keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear the guilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children, and on the children's children, to the third and to the fourth generation.">Exodus 34:7</a>, it being readily understood who it is that He will not let go unpunished; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-7.htm" title="You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain; for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that takes his name in vain.">Exodus 20:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-21.htm" title="For I will cleanse their blood that I have not cleansed: for the LORD dwells in Zion.">Joel 3:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-29.htm" title="For, see, I begin to bring evil on the city which is called by my name, and should you be utterly unpunished?

The meaning is not so much that Jehovah uses the whirlwind and storm as the vehicles of His movement as that these commotions and terrors in nature are created by His presence, of which to men they are the tokens. The splendid words “the clouds are the dust of his feet,” like the others “the earth is his footstool” need to be conceived, not explained.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/nahum/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Slow to anger</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6, 7</a>).

The clouds are the dust of his feet, Large and  grand as the clouds look to us, they are to God but as the dust raised by the feet in walking. As an illustration of this statement (though, of course, the fact was utterly unknown to Nahum), it has been remarked that recent scientific discovery asserts that clouds owe their beauty, and even their very existence, to the presence of dust particles in the atmosphere. The aqueous vapour, it is said, condenses on these particles, and thus becomes visible. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/jonah/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When the danger was at its height, the upper-steersman, or ship's captain (rabh hacho&#772;bhe&#772;l, the chief of the ship's governors; cho&#772;bhe&#772;l with the article is a collective noun, and a denom. from chebhel, a ship's cable, hence the one who manages, steers, or guides the ship), wakes him with the words, "How canst thou sleep soundly? Arise, and call upon thy God; perhaps God (ha&#770;'e&#774;lo&#772;h&#305;&#772;m with the article, 'the true God') will think of us, that we may not perish." The meaning of &#1497;&#1514;&#1506;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1514; is disputed. As &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514; is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-28.htm">Jeremiah 5:28</a> in the sense of shining (viz., of fat), Calvin and others (last of all, Hitzig) have maintained that the hithpael has the meaning, shown himself shining, i.e., bright (propitious); whilst others, including Jerome, prefer the meaning think again, which is apparently better supported than the former, not only by the Chaldee, but also by the nouns &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-5.htm">Job 12:5</a>) and &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1503; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/146-4.htm">Psalm 146:4</a>). God's thinking of a person involves the idea of active assistance. For the thought itself, compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-18.htm">Psalm 40:18</a>. The fact that Jonah obeyed this awakening call is passed over as self-evident; and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/1-7.htm">Jonah 1:7</a> the narrative proceeds to relate, that as the storm had not abated in the meantime, the sailors, firmly believing that some one in the ship had committed a crime which had excited the anger of God that was manifesting itself in the storm, had recourse to the lot to find out the culprit. &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;  equals  &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1500;&#1502;&#1497; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/1-8.htm">Jonah 1:8</a>), as &#1513;&#1473; is the vulgar, and in conversation the usual contraction for &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;: "on account of whom" (&#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, in this that  equals  because, or followed by &#1500;, on account of). &#1492;&#1512;&#1506;&#1492;, the misfortune (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/3-6.htm">Amos 3:6</a>), - namely, the storm which is threatening destruction. The lot fell upon Jonah. "The fugitive is taken by lot, not from any virtue in lots themselves, least of all the lots of heathen, but by the will of Him who governs uncertain lots" (Jerome).<p>When Jonah had been singled out by the lot as the culprit, the sailors called upon him to confess his guilt, asking him at the same time about his country, his occupation, and his parentage. The repetition of the question, on whose account this calamity had befallen them, which is omitted in the lxx (Vatic.), the Socin. prophets, and Cod. 195 of Kennicott, is found in the margin in Cod. 384, and is regarded by Grimm and Hitzig as a marginal gloss that has crept into the text. It is not superfluous, however; still less does it occasion any confusion; on the contrary, it is quite in order. The sailors wanted thereby to induce Jonah to confess with his own mouth that he was guilty, now that the lot had fallen upon him, and to disclose his crime (Ros. and others). As an indirect appeal to confess his crime, it prepares the way for the further inquiries as to his occupation, etc. They inquired about this occupation, because it might be a disreputable one, and one which excited the wrath of the gods; also about his parentage, and especially about the land and people from which he sprang, that they might be able to pronounce a safe sentence upon his crime. </body></html>
