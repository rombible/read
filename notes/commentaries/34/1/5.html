Nineveh knows not that God who contends with her, but is told what a God he is. It is good for all to mix faith with what is here said concerning Him, which speaks great terror to the wicked, and comfort to believers. Let each take his portion from it: let sinners read it and tremble; and let saints read it and triumph. The anger of the Lord is contrasted with his goodness to his people. Perhaps they are obscure and little regarded in the world, but the Lord knows them. The Scripture character of Jehovah agrees not with the views of proud reasoners. The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ is slow to wrath and ready to forgive, but he will by no means acquit the wicked; and there is tribulation and anguish for every soul that doeth evil: but who duly regards the power of his wrath?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/nahum/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The mountains quaked at Him, and the hills melted - As of their own accord. The words are a renewal of those of Amos Amo 9:13. Inanimate nature is pictured as endowed with the terror, which guilt feels at the presence of God. All power; whether greater or less, whatsoever lifteth itself up, shall give way in that Day, which shall be "upon all the cedars of Lebanon that are high and lifted up, and upon all the oaks of Bashan, and upon all the high mountains, and upon all the hills that are lifted up" <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-13.htm">Isaiah 2:13-14</a>. "And the earth is burned" (rather lifteth itself up; as an an earthquake it seems, as it were, to rise and sink down, lifting itself as if to meet its God or to flee. What is strongest, shaketh; what is hardest, melteth; yea, the whole world trembles and is removed. : "If," said even Jews of old, "when God made Himself known in mercy, to give the law to His people, the world was so moved at His presence, how much more, when He shall reveal Himself in wrath!" The words are so great that they bear the soul on to the time, when the heaven and earth shall flee away from the Face of Him "Who sitteth on the throne, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat" <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-11.htm">Revelation 20:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-10.htm">2 Peter 3:10</a>.

As Sinai of old did, when the Lord descended on it, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18</a>. Mountains figuratively signify kings and princes; and hills large countries, as Jarchi and Abarbinel observe, and the inhabitants of them; particularly the kingdoms and nations belonging to the Assyrian empire, which would tremble and quake, and their hearts melt with fear, when they should hear of the destruction of Nineveh their chief city; and of the devastation made by the enemy there and in other parts, under the direction of the Lord of hosts; his power and providence succeeding him: <p>and the earth is burnt at his presence; either when he withholds rain from it, and so it be comes parched and burnt up with the heat of the sun; or when he rains fire and brimstone on it, as he did on Sodom and Gomorrah; or consumes any part of it with thunder and lightning, as he sometimes does; nay, if he but touch the mountains, they smoke; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-32.htm">Psalm 104:32</a>; <p>yea, the world, and all that dwell therein; as in the last day, at the general conflagration, when the world, and all the wicked inhabitants of it, will be burnt up; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-10.htm">2 Peter 3:10</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/nahum/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The mountains quake at him, and the hills melt, and the earth is burned at his presence, yea, the world, and all that dwell therein.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/nahum/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">5</span>. <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/1-5.htm" title="The mountains quake at him, and the hills melt, and the earth is burned at his presence, yes, the world, and all that dwell therein.">Nahum 1:5</a> returns to describe the Theophany in the tempest, and its effects.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">mountains quake at him</span>] lit., <span class="ital">from Him</span>, the effect comes from Him. It is not an earthquake that is described but the effect of the thunder and roar of the tempest. This shakes the mountains. It is not out of terror alone that the mountains tremble, it is the goings, the tread of the mighty God by which they are shaken, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/micah/1-3.htm" title="For, behold, the LORD comes forth out of his place, and will come down, and tread on the high places of the earth....">Micah 1:3-4</a>. <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-6.htm" title="He stood, and measured the earth: he beheld, and drove asunder the nations; and the everlasting mountains were scattered, the perpetual hills did bow: his ways are everlasting.">Habakkuk 3:6</a>, “He stood (stepped on earth) and the earth rocked”; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-4.htm" title="LORD, when you went out of Seir, when you marched out of the field of Edom, the earth trembled, and the heavens dropped, the clouds also dropped water.">Jdg 5:4</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the hills melt</span>] What the physical phenomenon is which suggests this figure is not quite clear. Possibly <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/judges/5-4.htm" title="LORD, when you went out of Seir, when you marched out of the field of Edom, the earth trembled, and the heavens dropped, the clouds also dropped water....">Jdg 5:4-5</a> explains the meaning: “When thou wentest forth from Seir the earth trembled, the heavens also dropped, the clouds dropped water, the mountains flowed down”—the streams rushing down the mountains on all sides seemed as if the mountains themselves had become fluid. The rendering “flowed down” <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-5.htm" title="The mountains melted from before the LORD, even that Sinai from before the LORD God of Israel.">Jdg 5:5</a>, is the most natural, though others derive the form used from another root which might mean “to quake.” In this case the melting of the mountains might refer to their <span class="ital">motion</span>, their undulating as if fluid. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/micah/1-3.htm" title="For, behold, the LORD comes forth out of his place, and will come down, and tread on the high places of the earth....">Micah 1:3-4</a>, “Behold the Lord cometh forth out of his place, and will tread upon the heights of the earth (the storm cloud trailing over the mountains), and the mountains shall be molten under him, and the valleys shall be cleft, as wax before the fire, as waters that are poured down a steep place.” The figure of melting wax hardly means that the mountains melt under the fiery feet of Jehovah.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the earth is burnt</span>] Rather: <span class="bld">riseth up</span>, reference being to the rising and sinking motion of the earth—not its oscillation; cf. R.V. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/9-5.htm" title="And the Lord GOD of hosts is he that touches the land, and it shall melt, and all that dwell therein shall mourn: and it shall rise up wholly like a flood; and shall be drowned, as by the flood of Egypt.">Amos 9:5</a>. R.V. is <span class="ital">upheaved</span>. Bickell from a different root, <span class="ital">becomes waste</span>. The last clause is a not unusual formula; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/24-1.htm" title="The earth is the LORD's, and the fullness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein.">Psalm 24:1</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/nahum/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The mountains quake.</span> The mountains, the very emblems of stability, tremble before him (Adios 8:8). <span class="cmt_word">The hills melt;</span> <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, "The hills were shaken" (Septuagint).

By the statement, "I fear," etc., he had no intention of describing himself as a righteous or innocent man (Hitzig), but simply meant to indicate his relation to God - namely, that he adored the living God who created the whole earth and, as Creator, governed the world. For he admits directly after, that he has sinned against this God, by telling them, as we may see from <a href="http://biblehub.com/jonah/1-10.htm">Jonah 1:10</a>, of his flight from Jehovah. He had not told them this as soon as he embarked in the ship, as Hitzig supposes, but does so now for the first time when they ask about his people, his country, etc., as we may see most unmistakeably from <a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/1-10.htm">Jonah 1:10</a>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/1-9.htm">Jonah 1:9</a> Jonah's statement is not given completely; but the principal fact, viz., that he was a Hebrew and worshipped Jehovah, is followed immediately by the account of the impression which this acknowledgement made upon the heathen sailors; and the confession of his sin is mentioned afterwards as a supplement, to assign the reason for the great fear which came upon the sailors in consequence. &#1502;&#1492;&#1470;&#1494;&#1468;&#1488;&#1514; &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1514;, What hast thou done! is not a question as to the nature of his sin, but an exclamation of horror at his flight from Jehovah, the God heaven and earth, as the following explanatory clauses &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1497;&#1491;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; clearly show. The great fear which came upon the heathen seamen at this confession of Jonah may be fully explained from the dangerous situation in which they found themselves, since the storm preached the omnipotence of God more powerfully than words could possibly do. </body></html>
