Nineveh knows not that God who contends with her, but is told what a God he is. It is good for all to mix faith with what is here said concerning Him, which speaks great terror to the wicked, and comfort to believers. Let each take his portion from it: let sinners read it and tremble; and let saints read it and triumph. The anger of the Lord is contrasted with his goodness to his people. Perhaps they are obscure and little regarded in the world, but the Lord knows them. The Scripture character of Jehovah agrees not with the views of proud reasoners. The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ is slow to wrath and ready to forgive, but he will by no means acquit the wicked; and there is tribulation and anguish for every soul that doeth evil: but who duly regards the power of his wrath?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/nahum/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He rebuketh the sea and maketh it dry - Delivering His people, as He did from Pharaoh <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/106-9.htm">Psalm 106:9</a>, the type of all later oppressors, and of antichrist.

These mountains then together are emblems of richness, lasting beauty, fruitfulness, loftiness; yet all, even that which by nature is not, in the variety of seasons, wont to fade, dries up and withers before the rebuke of God. But if these thing are "done in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry?" All freshness, beauty, comeliness, show of outward nature, shall fade as grass; all ornament of men's outward graces or gifts, all mere show of goodness, shall fall off like a leaf and perish. If the glory of nature perishes before God, how much more the pride of man! Bashan also was the dwelling-place of the race of giants, and near Libanus was Damascus; yet their inhabitants became as dead men and their power shrank to nothing at the word of God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/nahum/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. rebuketh the sea&#8212;as Jesus did (Mt 8:26), proving Himself God (compare Isa 50:2).<p>Bashan languisheth&#8212;through drought; ordinarily it was a region famed for its rich pasturage (compare Joe 1:10).<p>flower of Lebanon&#8212;its bloom; all that blooms so luxuriantly on Lebanon (Ho 14:7).

Before the hot breath of Jehovah’s anger they languish and wither. The description is scarcely on a line with the former “rebuketh the sea,” though “drieth up the rivers” may form the transition. It was the furious tempest that rolled back the sea, it is the hot wind and drought of the desert under which Bashan languishes and withers up. Both are operations of Jehovah. Nature is alive but not with a life of her own, all her forces are but the personal energies of Jehovah. It is His rebuke, spoken though men may not hear it, before which the sea retreats and its bed is made bare; the hot wind which withers Carmel and Lebanon is His fiery breath. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-7.htm" title="The grass wither, the flower fades: because the spirit of the LORD blows on it: surely the people is grass.">Isaiah 40:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-24.htm" title="Yes, they shall not be planted; yes, they shall not be sown: yes, their stock shall not take root in the earth: and he shall also blow on them, and they shall wither, and the whirlwind shall take them away as stubble.">Isaiah 40:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-2.htm" title="And he said, The LORD will roar from Zion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem; and the habitations of the shepherds shall mourn, and the top of Carmel shall wither.">Amos 1:2</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/nahum/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - The great physical changes and convulsions in the world are tokens of God's wrath on sinful nations. <span class="cmt_word">He rebuketh the sea,</span> as at the passage of the Red Sea (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-21.htm">Exodus 14:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-9.htm">Psalm 106:9</a>).

These three regions are mentioned as remarkable for their fertility, and they occur most naturally to the mind of a native of Galilee, as was Nahum. They also geographically are the eastern, western, and northern boundaries of the land.

Arise, and call upon thy God; perhaps God (ha&#770;'e&#774;lo&#772;h&#305;&#772;m with the article, 'the true God') will think of us, that we may not perish." The meaning of &#1497;&#1514;&#1506;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1514; is disputed. As &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514; is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-28.htm">Jeremiah 5:28</a> in the sense of shining (viz., of fat), Calvin and others (last of all, Hitzig) have maintained that the hithpael has the meaning, shown himself shining, i.e., bright (propitious); whilst others, including Jerome, prefer the meaning think again, which is apparently better supported than the former, not only by the Chaldee, but also by the nouns &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-5.htm">Job 12:5</a>) and &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1503; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/146-4.htm">Psalm 146:4</a>). God's thinking of a person involves the idea of active assistance. For the thought itself, compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-18.htm">Psalm 40:18</a>. The fact that Jonah obeyed this awakening call is passed over as self-evident; and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/1-7.htm">Jonah 1:7</a> the narrative proceeds to relate, that as the storm had not abated in the meantime, the sailors, firmly believing that some one in the ship had committed a crime which had excited the anger of God that was manifesting itself in the storm, had recourse to the lot to find out the culprit. &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;  equals  &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1500;&#1502;&#1497; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/1-8.htm">Jonah 1:8</a>), as &#1513;&#1473; is the vulgar, and in conversation the usual contraction for &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;: "on account of whom" (&#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, in this that  equals  because, or followed by &#1500;, on account of). &#1492;&#1512;&#1506;&#1492;, the misfortune (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/3-6.htm">Amos 3:6</a>), - namely, the storm which is threatening destruction. The lot fell upon Jonah. "The fugitive is taken by lot, not from any virtue in lots themselves, least of all the lots of heathen, but by the will of Him who governs uncertain lots" (Jerome).<p>When Jonah had been singled out by the lot as the culprit, the sailors called upon him to confess his guilt, asking him at the same time about his country, his occupation, and his parentage. The repetition of the question, on whose account this calamity had befallen them, which is omitted in the lxx (Vatic.), the Socin. prophets, and Cod. 195 of Kennicott, is found in the margin in Cod. 384, and is regarded by Grimm and Hitzig as a marginal gloss that has crept into the text. It is not superfluous, however; still less does it occasion any confusion; on the contrary, it is quite in order. The sailors wanted thereby to induce Jonah to confess with his own mouth that he was guilty, now that the lot had fallen upon him, and to disclose his crime (Ros. and others). As an indirect appeal to confess his crime, it prepares the way for the further inquiries as to his occupation, etc. They inquired about this occupation, because it might be a disreputable one, and one which excited the wrath of the gods; also about his parentage, and especially about the land and people from which he sprang, that they might be able to pronounce a safe sentence upon his crime. </body></html>
