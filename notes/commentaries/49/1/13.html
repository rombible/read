It is far better to refer the whole to the one verb, “ye were sealed.” The irregularity of construction (arising from the addition to “hearing” of its proper accessory of “faith,” <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-17.htm" title="So then faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.">Romans 10:17</a>) will surprise no one who studies St. Paul’s Epistles, and especially these Epistles of his Captivity, remembering that they were dictated, and in all probability read over again to the Apostle for addition or correction.<p><span class= "bld">After that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation.</span>—There is a contrast hero between the Jewish believers, looking on in hope and gladly embracing its fulfilment, and the Gentiles, who had no such hope, and who therefore waited “for the word of the truth” (the full truth, not veiled in type or symbol), the glad tidings of a present salvation. The greater emphasis laid on the latter process seems intended to impress on the Gentiles a sense of the simpler and fuller means by which they were led to Christ.<p><span class= "bld">After that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise.—</span>The order is to be noted, and compared with the experience of the Day of Pentecost (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-38.htm" title="Then Peter said to them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.">Acts 2:38</a>). First, the light of the gospel shines before men; next, by faith they open their eyes to see it; then they are sealed by a special gift of the Holy Spirit. Such faith is, of course, the gift of God by the Spirit; but our Lord teaches us (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/16-8.htm" title="And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:">John 16:8-13</a>) to distinguish between the pleading of the Holy Spirit with “the world” “to convince of sin, because they believe not in Christ,” and the special gift of His presence in the Church and the believing soul “to guide unto all the truth.” This fuller presence is the seal of the new covenant.<p><span class= "bld">Ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise.</span>—This word “sealed” is found in exactly the same connection in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-22.htm" title="Who has also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.">2Corinthians 1:22</a>. The original idea of this sealing (which, it should be observed, is not of documents, but of men) is best seen in the “sealing of the servants of God in their foreheads,” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/7-3.htm" title="Saying, Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads.">Revelation 7:3-8</a>. In that passage, and in the passage of Ezekiel which it recalls (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/9-4.htm" title="And the LORD said to him, Go through the middle of the city, through the middle of Jerusalem, and set a mark on the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all the abominations that be done in the middle thereof.">Ezekiel 9:4</a>), the sealing is simply an outward badge, to be at once a pledge and means of safety amidst the destruction coming on the earth. In like sense, circumcision appears to be called “a seal” of previously existing righteousness of faith, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-11.htm" title="And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed to them also:">Romans 4:11</a>; and the conversion of the Corinthians “a seal” of St. Paul’s apostleship, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-2.htm" title="If I be not an apostle to others, yet doubtless I am to you: for the seal of my apostleship are you in the Lord.">1Corinthians 9:2</a>. (Comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-33.htm" title="He that has received his testimony has set to his seal that God is true.">John 3:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-28.htm" title="When therefore I have performed this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will come by you into Spain.">Romans 15:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-19.htm" title="Nevertheless the foundation of God stands sure, having this seal, The Lord knows them that are his. And, Let every one that names the name of Christ depart from iniquity.">2Timothy 2:19</a>.) But the word is used in a deeper sense whenever it is connected with the gift of the Holy Spirit. Then it corresponds to the “circumcision not made with hands” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-29.htm" title="But he is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God.">Romans 2:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-11.htm" title=" In whom also you are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ:">Colossians 2:11</a>); it has the character of a sacrament, and is not a mere badge, but a true means of grace. In this connection we read first of our Lord, “Him God the Father sealed” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-27.htm" title="Labor not for the meat which perishes, but for that meat which endures to everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give to you: for him has God the Father sealed.">John 6:27</a>), with a clear reference to the outpouring of the Holy Spirit at His baptism (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-33.htm" title="And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said to me, On whom you shall see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizes with the Holy Ghost.">John 1:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-37.htm" title="And the Father himself, which has sent me, has borne witness of me. You have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape.">John 5:37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-33.htm" title="The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone you not; but for blasphemy; and because that you, being a man, make yourself God.">John 10:33</a>); next of His people (as here, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-30.htm" title="And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby you are sealed to the day of redemption.">Ephesians 4:30</a>, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-22.htm" title="Who has also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.">2Corinthians 1:22</a>) as being, like Himself, baptised with the Holy Ghost. In this passage the very title given to the Spirit is significant. He is called (in the curious order of the original) “the Spirit of the Promise, the Holy One.” “The promise” is clearly the promise in the Old Testament (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/31-31.htm" title="Behold, the days come, said the LORD, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah:">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/joel/2-28.htm" title="And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my spirit on all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions:">Joel 2:28-32</a>) of the outpouring of the Spirit on all God’s people in “the latter days.” The emphatic position of the epithet “Holy One” seems to point to the effect of His indwelling in the actual sanctification of the soul thus sealed. From this passage was probably derived the ecclesiastical application of the name “seal” to the sacrament of baptism, which is undoubtedly made the seal of conversion in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-38.htm" title="Then Peter said to them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.">Acts 2:38</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/ephesians/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/1-13.htm" title="In whom you also trusted, after that you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that you believed, you were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise,...">Ephesians 1:13-14</a></span>. <span class="ital">In whom ye, </span>Gentiles, <span class="ital">also trusted </span>— Believed and hoped for eternal life; <span class="ital">after ye heard the word of truth </span>— The word which reveals and attests most important truth, the <span class="ital">faithful saying, </span>(<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-15.htm" title="This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.">1 Timothy 1:15</a>,) that Jesus of Nazareth is the true Messiah, the Son of God, who came into the world to save sinners; <span class="ital">the gospel of your salvation </span>— Which brings the good tidings of salvation to you as well as others: or, which God has made the means of your salvation; <span class="ital">in whom after ye believed </span>— Or rather, as <span class="greekheb">πιστευσαντες </span>signifies, <span class="ital">having believed; ye were sealed — </span>Probably immediately after believing; <span class="ital">with that Holy Spirit of promise </span>— Holy both in his nature and in his operations, and promised to all true believers, to all the children of God. Of the seal and earnest of this Spirit, see the note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-22.htm" title="Who has also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.">2 Corinthians 1:22</a>, where the apostles are said to have been sealed by the Spirit, and to have the earnest thereof in their hearts. As applied to them, the expressions undoubtedly signified their having received the extraordinary gifts, as well as the sanctifying graces of the Spirit. But here being applied to all the Gentile believers, but few of whom certainly were endowed with these extraordinary gifts, the words can only mean those ordinary influences of the Spirit, whereby they were assured of their adoption and regeneration, were stamped with the image of God, and thereby constituted heirs of the heavenly inheritance, and prepared for the enjoyment of it. This <span class="ital">sealing </span>of the Spirit produces, in every man that possesses it, a new nature, whereby he is marked, or declared to be, the son of God; a mark which, as Macknight observes, is to him a stronger evidence of his title to eternal life, than if he possessed the miraculous gifts. See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-22.htm" title="Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in your name? and in your name have cast out devils? and in your name done many wonderful works?">Matthew 7:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-2.htm" title="And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.">1 Corinthians 13:2</a>. How earnest then ought we to be in our endeavours to obtain this important blessing! See also <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-30.htm" title="And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby you are sealed to the day of redemption.">Ephesians 4:30</a>, where believers are said to be sealed with the Holy Spirit to the day of redemption. When this sealing of the Spirit is enjoyed in the most perfect manner, it seems to imply, 1st, A full impression of the image of God on a man’s soul; 2d, A full assurance of his receiving all the promises, whether relating to time or eternity. <span class="ital">Which is the earnest </span>—<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Both a pledge and a foretaste; <span class="ital">of our inheritance, </span>in heaven, <span class="ital">until the redemption of the purchased possession </span>— Till the church, which he has purchased with his own blood, shall be fully delivered from all sin and sorrow, and advanced to everlasting glory. As the redemption here spoken of includes the redemption of the bodies of Christ’s purchased people from death, by the resurrection, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-23.htm" title="And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the first fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.">Romans 8:23</a>,) <span class="ital">the earnest of the Spirit, </span>which is to remain in the church, that is, in the hearts of its true members, till that glorious event is accomplished, must be principally those ordinary influences of the Spirit, which produce in believers that holiness which is necessary to fit them for heaven, and that happiness which is an anticipation thereof.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:9-14 Blessings were made known to believers, by the Lord's showing to them the mystery of his sovereign will, and the method of redemption and salvation. But these must have been for ever hidden from us, if God had not made them known by his written word, preached gospel, and Spirit of truth. Christ united the two differing parties, God and man, in his own person, and satisfied for that wrong which caused the separation. He wrought, by his Spirit, those graces of faith and love, whereby we are made one with God, and among ourselves. He dispenses all his blessings, according to his good pleasure. His Divine teaching led whom he pleased to see the glory of those truths, which others were left to blaspheme. What a gracious promise that is, which secures the gift of the Holy Ghost to those who ask him! The sanctifying and comforting influences of the Holy Spirit seal believers as the children of God, and heirs of heaven. These are the first-fruits of holy happiness. For this we were made, and for this we were redeemed; this is the great design of God in all that he has done for us; let all be ascribed unto the praise of his glory.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ephesians/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In whom ye also trusted - This stands in contrast with those who had "first" embraced the gospel.<p>Heard the word of truth - The gospel; called the "word" or message of truth, the word of God, etc. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-17.htm">Romans 10:17</a>.

It is not improbable, I think, that the apostle here refers particularly to the occurrence of which we have a record in <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/19-1.htm">Acts 19:1-6</a>. Paul, it is there said, having passed through the upper provinces of Asia Minor, came to Ephesus. He found certain persons who were the disciples of John, and he asked them if they had received the Holy Spirit since they "believed," <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-2.htm">Ephesians 1:2</a>. They replied that they had not heard whether there was any Holy Spirit, and that they had been baptized unto John's baptism. Paul taught them the true nature of the baptism of John; explained to them the Christian system; and they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus, and "the Holy Spirit came upon them, and they spake with tongues, and prophesied." They were thus sealed by the Holy Spirit of promise, "after they had believed" <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13</a>; they had the full evidence of the favor of God in the descent of the promised Holy Spirit, and in his miraculous influences. If this be the true interpretation, it constitutes a striking coincidence between the Epistle and the Acts , of such a nature as constitute the arguments in Paley's "Horae Paulinae" (though he has not referred to this), which shows that the Epistle was not forged. The circumstance is such that it would not have been alluded to in this manner by one who should forge the Epistle; and the mention of it in the Epistle is so slight, that no one, from the account there, would think of forging the account in the Acts . The coincidence is just such as would occur on the supposition that the transaction actually occurred, and that both the Acts and the Epistle are genuine. At the same time, there is a sealing of the Holy Spirit which is common to all Christians; see the notes referred to on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-22.htm">2 Corinthians 1:22</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ephesians/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13. In whom ye also&#8212;Ye Gentiles. Supply as English Version, "trusted," from Eph 1:12; or "are." The priority of us Jews does not exclude you Gentiles from sharing in Christ (compare Ac 13:46).<p>the word of truth&#8212;the instrument of sanctification, and of the new birth (Joh 17:17; 2Ti 2:15; Jas 1:18). Compare Col 1:5, where also, as here, it is connected with "hope." Also Eph 4:21.<p>sealed&#8212;as God's confirmed children, by the Holy Spirit as the seal (Ac 19:1-6; Ro 8:16, 23; 1Jo 3:24; see on [2360]2Co 1:22). A seal impressed on a document gives undoubted validity to the contract in it (Joh 3:33; 6:27; compare 2Co 3:3). So the sense of "the love of God shed abroad in the heart by the Holy Ghost" (Ro 5:5), and the sense of adoption given through the Spirit at regeneration (Ro 8:15, 16), assure believers of God's good will to them. The Spirit, like a seal, impresses on the soul at regeneration the image of our Father. The "sealing" by the Holy Spirit is spoken of as past once for all. The witnessing to our hearts that we are the children of God, and heirs (Eph 1:11), is the Spirit's present testimony, the "earnest of the (coming) inheritance" (Ro 8:16-18).<p>that Holy Spirit of promise&#8212;rather, as the Greek, "The Spirit of promise, even the Holy Spirit": The Spirit promised both in the Old and New Testaments (Joe 2:28; Zec 12:10; Joh 7:38, 39). "The word" promised the Holy Spirit. Those who "believed the word of truth" were sealed by the Spirit accordingly.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ephesians/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">In whom ye also; </span> here is a defect of the verb in the Greek, which may be supplied either from <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-11.htm" title="In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who works all things after the counsel of his own will:">Ephesians 1:11</a></span>, which seems to be the principal verb in the sentence, and then it must be read: <span class="ital">In whom ye also have obtained an inheritance; </span> or from <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-12.htm" title="That we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in Christ.">Ephesians 1:12</a></span>, <span class="ital">trusted, </span> which is the nearest verb; so our translation: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">In whom ye also trusted; </span> but neither way makes any difference in the scope of the words. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Ye; </span> ye Ephesians and other Gentiles. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The word of truth; </span> the gospel, so called, either: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

The Gentile believers, the Ephesians, whom the apostle now particularly addresses; and who participated of the same grace and privileges with the believing Jews; the promise belonged to all that God called, whether afar off or nigh; and the same common salvation was sent to one as to another; and the same faith was wrought in one as in the other; and they were interested in the same Christ, and were heirs of the same inheritance; the Alexandrian copy reads "we": <p>after that ye heard the word of truth; the Gospel; and which is so called, on account of its divine original, coming from the God of truth, who cannot lie; and because of the concern which Christ has in it, who is truth itself, and was the author, subject, and preacher of it, and who confirmed it by his miracles, and his death; and on account of the Spirit of God, the dictator of it, and who leads into all truths, and owns and blesses them for conversion and comfort; and because it contains nothing but truth, and particularly that eminent one, salvation alone by Christ, for the chief of sinners; and in contradistinction from the law, which was typical and shadowy; , "the word of truth", is a phrase used by the Jews (e), for sublime and heavenly doctrine: now, by the hearing of this, faith came; and this the Ephesians heard, not only externally, but internally; so as to understand, approve, and believe it, and to put it in practice: and which is also called <p>the Gospel of your salvation: because it is a declaration and publication of salvation by Christ; and gives an account of the author of salvation, of his ability and willingness to save, and of the nature of this salvation, and describes the persons who shall be saved; and because it is the means of salvation, when attended with the Spirit and power of God; and the instrument, in God's hand, of showing to souls their special and particular interest in salvation: <p>in whom also after that ye believed; which may refer either to the Gospel of salvation, in which they believed upon hearing it; or rather to Christ, the Saviour revealed, in whom they believed to the saving of their souls: and this shows, that the sealing work of the Spirit after mentioned, and with which this stands in connection, is a distinct thing from faith, or indeed any other work of the Spirit; as illumination, regeneration, sanctification, &amp;c. it is what follows believing, and is a work that passes upon the soul after it; and so is something over and above, and more than faith, at least than first believing: and from hence it also appears, that there may be true faith, where this is not as yet; and that none but believers in Christ enjoy the following privilege: <p>ye were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise. This cannot have respect to the Father's sealing his people in election, with the seal of his foreknowledge, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-19.htm">2 Timothy 2:19</a> for that is before faith, and is within himself, and not on them, and is distinct from the Spirit's work; and for the same reasons it cannot design the Son's affection to them, setting them as a seal on his arm and heart, Sol 8:6, or his asserting his property in them, and the security and protection of them, Sol 4:12, nor the Spirit's finishing and completing his own work of grace upon the soul, in which sense the word is used, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-28.htm">Romans 15:28</a> for this as yet was not done upon these believing Ephesians; nor the confirming the Gospel, and the saints in it, by the extraordinary effusion of the Spirit on the day of Pentecost, or by his extraordinary works which attended the ministry of the word, to the establishing of it, and the faith of men in it; since these were not common to believers, nor did they continue; whereas the believing Ephesians, in common, were sealed; and the Spirit of God continues still as a sealer of his people, and as an earnest and pledge of their inheritance until the day of redemption; but it is to be understood of the confirming, certifying, and assuring the saints, as to their interest in the favour of God, and in the blessings of grace, of every kind, and their right and title to the heavenly glory; See Gill on <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-22.htm">2 Corinthians 1:22</a>, and the seal of these things is not circumcision, nor baptism, nor the Lord's supper, nor even the graces of the Spirit; but the Spirit himself, who witnesses to the spirits of believers the truth of these things, and that as a "spirit of promise": so called, both because he is the Spirit promised, as the Syriac and Ethiopic versions render it, whom the Father and Christ had promised, and who was sent by them; and because he usually seals, or certifies believers of the truth of the above things, by opening and applying a word of promise to them: and which he does also, as the "Holy" Spirit; for this sealing work of his leaves a greater impress of holiness upon the soul, and engages more to acts of holiness; wherefore the doctrine of assurance is no licentious doctrine; no persons are so holy as those who are truly possessed of that grace; and as for such who pretend unto it, and live in sin, it is a certain thing that they in reality know nothing of it. <p>(e) Zohar in Numb. fol. 76. 3.<a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/ephesians/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{16}</span> In whom ye also <i>trusted</i>, after that ye heard the <span class="cverse3">{q}</span> word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were <span class="cverse3">{r}</span> sealed with that holy <span class="cverse3">{s}</span> Spirit of promise,</span><p>(16) Now he makes the Ephesians (or rather all the Gentiles) equal to the Jews, because even though they came last, being called by the same Gospel, they embraced faith, and were sealed up with the same Spirit, who is the pledge of election, until the inheritance itself is seen.

Taking, therefore, the <span class="greekheb">καὶ ὑμεῖς</span>, as contrasted with the previous <span class="greekheb">ἡμᾶς</span>, to refer to the readers of the Epistle as <span class="ital">Gentiles</span> in distinction from the writer and those whom he couples with himself as having formerly been <span class="ital">Jews</span>, we have in this verse and the following a paragraph which gives first a description of the evangelical standing and experience of Gentile Christians such as these Ephesians were, and then a statement of the fact that, in their case as in that of the others, God’s ultimate end in His gracious dealing with them was the praise of His glory. The opening clause, however, presents some difficulty. The sentence is left with something unexpressed, or its form is disturbed. How is it to be construed? It is natural to think first of explaining it by supplying some verb for the <span class="greekheb">ὑμεῖς</span>, and as the substantive verb is often left to be understood, some introduce <span class="greekheb">ἐστέ</span> here = “in whom ye also are,” “in whom ye also have a part” (Mey., Alf.). But the great Pauline formula <span class="greekheb">ἐν Χριστῷ εἶναι</span> can scarcely be dealt with thus, the <span class="greekheb">εἶναι</span> in it has too profound a sense to allow of its being dropped and left to be understood as is possible with the ordinary substantive verb. Others, therefore, look to the immediately preceding <span class="greekheb">προηλπικότας</span> for the word that is to be supplied (Erasm. Calv., Beza, Est., etc.; and so AV “in whom ye also <span class="ital">trusted</span>”). But to make this applicable to Gentile believers requires us (unless the Second Advent is supposed to be the object of the hope) to supply only <span class="greekheb">ἠλπίκατε</span> not <span class="greekheb">προηλπίκατε</span>, and to give the verb the modified sense of <span class="ital">trusting</span> or <span class="ital">believing</span>. Much more may be said in favour of supplying the definite verb <span class="greekheb">ἐκληρώθημεν</span> which rules the larger sentence (Erasm. in his <span class="ital">Paraphrase</span>, Cornel, a Lap., Harl., Olsh., etc.) = “in whom ye also were made God’s <span class="greekheb">κλῆρος</span>, or possession”. The comparative distance of the <span class="greekheb">ἐν ᾧ καὶ ὑμεῖς</span> from <span class="greekheb">ἐκληρώθητε</span> is no serious objection, especially in view of the fact that it is the definite verb, and not a qualifying participle, that is in view. There remains, however, yet another method of explanation, <span class="ital">viz.</span>, to regard the sentence as an interrupted construction, in which the expression of the main thought, that of the <span class="greekheb">ἐσφραγίσθητε</span>, is delayed by other preliminary ideas, the second <span class="greekheb">ἐν ᾦ</span> being a <span class="ital">resumption</span> and continuation of the first (Theod. Mops., Jer., Beng., De Wette, Rück., Bleek, Bisp., Ell., Humphrey, Abb., Von Sod., Haupt). This solution of the difficulty appears on the whole to be the best, and it has been preferred by the majority of interpreters. It seems to be favoured by the Syr., Copt. and Eth. Versions, and is adopted by the RV—“in whom ye also, having heard the word of the truth, the gospel of your salvation—in whom, having also believed, ye were sealed”. The interruption of the regular construction in the statement of the fact of their having been “sealed” appears to be caused by the introduction of the idea of the primary Christian requirement of <span class="ital">faith</span> after the mention of the <span class="ital">hearing</span>. It is objected that the distance between the one <span class="greekheb">ἐν ᾧ</span> and the other is much less than is usual in such cases, and that in a <span class="ital">resumption</span> we should expect not <span class="greekheb">ἐν ᾧ καί</span>, but <span class="greekheb">ἐν ᾧ καὶ ὑμεῖς</span>. But <span class="ital">anacoloutha</span> are quite in Paul’s way, and they are not all of one type or one extension (<span class="ital">cf.</span> Win.-Moul., p. 704), and the <span class="greekheb">καί</span> (<span class="ital">minus</span> the <span class="greekheb">ὑμεῖς</span>) is appropriate as giving an ascensive force to the <span class="greekheb">πιστεύσαντες</span>. This view of the construction has the advantage also of enabling us to retain substantially the same sense for the <span class="greekheb">ἐν ᾧ</span> in these three occurrences (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-11.htm" title="In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who works all things after the counsel of his own will:">Ephesians 1:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-13.htm" title="In whom you also trusted, after that you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that you believed, you were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise,">Ephesians 1:13</a>), and it makes the defining participles <span class="greekheb">ἀκούσαντες</span> (with its clause) and <span class="greekheb">πιστεύσαντες</span> important preparations for the statement of privilege in the <span class="greekheb">ἐσφραγίσθητε</span>, each contributing something proper in its own place to the order of ideas. Hence both the first <span class="greekheb">ἐν ᾧ</span> and the second are to be connected with the <span class="greekheb">ἐσφραγίσηθητε</span> = “in whom, on hearing and believing, ye were sealed”; it being <span class="ital">in Christ</span>, in virtue of our union with Him, that we receive the gift of the Spirit.—<span class="greekheb">ἀκούσαντες</span>: <span class="ital">having heard</span> (or, <span class="ital">on hearing</span>). This comes in its proper order, the <span class="ital">first</span> in the series of things, preparing the way for the sealing of the Spirit. In the narratives of cases of reception into the Christian Church in the Book of Acts we discover this order of grace: hearing, repentance, baptism, the gift of the Holy Ghost (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/2-37.htm" title="Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said to Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brothers, what shall we do?...">Acts 2:37-38</a>), or hearing, faith, baptism, the gift of the Holy Ghost (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-6.htm" title="And the people with one accord gave heed to those things which Philip spoke, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did.">Acts 8:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-12.htm" title="But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.">Acts 8:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-17.htm" title="Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost.">Acts 8:17</a>). Yet this is not an invariable order. Sometimes only hearing, baptism, and the gift of the Holy Ghost (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/19-5.htm" title="When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus....">Acts 19:5-6</a>) are mentioned; and in such instances as those of Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-17.htm" title="And Ananias went his way, and entered into the house; and putting his hands on him said, Brother Saul, the Lord, even Jesus, that appeared to you in the way as you came, has sent me, that you might receive your sight, and be filled with the Holy Ghost.">Acts 9:17</a>) and the men of Cæsarea (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/10-44.htm" title="While Peter yet spoke these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word....">Acts 10:44-47</a>), the gift of the Holy Ghost appears to have preceded the administration of baptism. On the importance of <span class="ital">hearing</span>, that is, access to the preached word, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/10-13.htm" title="For whoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved....">Romans 10:13-17</a>, where the <span class="greekheb">πιστεύειν</span> is declared to come by the <span class="greekheb">ἀκούειν</span>.—<span class="greekheb">τὸν λόγον τῆς ἀληθείας</span>: <span class="ital">the word of the truth</span>. The <span class="greekheb">λόγος</span> here is evidently the word of preaching, and it is said to be “of the truth,” not with any particular reference, as Meyer justly observes, to the OT word as one that dealt with types and shadows rather than realities (Chrys.), or to the word of heathenism as the word of error (Corn. a Lap., etc.), but in the sense in which our Lord Himself spoke of the <span class="ital">truth</span> and the <span class="ital">word</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-17.htm" title="Sanctify them through your truth: your word is truth.">John 17:17</a>; <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-5.htm" title=" For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, whereof you heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel;">Colossians 1:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-15.htm" title="Study to show yourself approved to God, a workman that needs not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.">2 Timothy 2:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-17.htm" title="Even so faith, if it has not works, is dead, being alone.">Jam 2:17</a>). The gen. is not that of apposition (Harl.), but the <span class="ital">gen. objecti</span>, “the word concerning the truth;” or, as Ell. suggests, the gen. of ethical <span class="ital">substance</span> or ethical <span class="ital">content</span>, “the word of which the truth is the very essence, or content”.—<span class="greekheb">τὸ εὐαγγέλιον τῆς σωτηρίας ὑμῶν</span>: <span class="ital">the gospel of your salvation</span>. Further definition of “the word of the truth”. The preached word which has the truth for its essential content is that which brought you the good tidings of salvation. Here, again, the gen. is not that of <span class="ital">appos.</span> or <span class="ital">identity</span> (Harl., etc.), but most probably that of <span class="ital">content</span> or <span class="ital">subject matter</span> (Mey., Ell., etc.). Elsewhere we have the <span class="greekheb">εὐαγγέλιον</span> defined as that of <span class="ital">the Kingdom</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-35.htm" title="And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease among the people.">Matthew 9:35</a>), of <span class="ital">God</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-1.htm" title="Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, separated to the gospel of God,">Romans 1:1</a>), of <span class="ital">the Kingdom of God</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/1-14.htm" title="Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,">Mark 1:14</a>), of <span class="ital">Christ, Jesus Christ, His Son</span>, etc. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-1.htm" title="Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, separated to the gospel of God,">Romans 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-9.htm" title="For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers;">Romans 1:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-16.htm" title="For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God to salvation to every one that believes; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.">Romans 1:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/1-1.htm" title="The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God;">Mark 1:1</a>), of <span class="ital">peace</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-15.htm" title="And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace;">Ephesians 6:15</a>), of <span class="ital">the grace of God</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-24.htm" title="But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear to myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God.">Acts 20:24</a>), of <span class="ital">the glory of the blessed God</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-11.htm" title="According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.">1 Timothy 1:11</a>), of <span class="ital">the glory of Christ</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-4.htm" title="In whom the god of this world has blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine to them.">2 Corinthians 4:4</a>). Nowhere in the NT is the word <span class="greekheb">εὐαγγέλιον</span> used so frequently and in such a variety of applications as in the Pauline Epistles. It is never used in Luke’s Gospel, in John’s Gospel or Epistles, in Hebrews, or in James; in Matthew’s Gospel it occurs four times, in Mark eight times, in Acts twice, in Peter once, and in the Apocalypse once. The noun <span class="greekheb">σωτηρία</span>, which has so large a place in the rest of the Pauline writings, is of rare occurrence in these Epistles of the Captivity. It is found thrice in the Epistle to the Philippians, but only once in this profound Epistle to the Ephesians (in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-17.htm" title="And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:">Ephesians 6:17</a> we have the other form <span class="greekheb">τὸ σωτήριον</span>), and not even once in the sister Epistle to the Colossians.—<span class="greekheb">ἐν ᾧ</span>:—<span class="ital">in whom, I say</span>. With the former <span class="greekheb">ἐν ᾧ</span> the writer turned from the case of those like himself who, having been Jews, had been made God’s <span class="greekheb">κλῆρος</span> in Christ, to that of Gentiles like these Ephesians who also had been made partakers of God’s grace in Christ, though in a different way, not as having had the hope of the Jews in a promised Messiah, but simply as having heard the word of Christian preaching. The particular gift of grace which it was in his mind to state as bestowed on these Gentile Christians was the sealing of the Spirit. With this second <span class="greekheb">ἐν ᾧ</span>, “—in whom, I say,” he takes up the statement which had been interrupted by the mention of the way in which they had come to receive the grace, and brings it (with a further reference to the antecedents to the sealing) to its intended conclusion. This <span class="greekheb">ἐν ᾧ</span>, therefore, is not to be dealt with differently from the former and made to relate to the <span class="greekheb">εὐαγγέλιον</span>, as if = “in which Gospel having also believed, ye were sealed” (Mey.). It simply continues the idea of the previous <span class="greekheb">ἐν ᾧ</span>, expressing the fact that the grace which came to the Gentile who heard the word of preaching, like the grace which came to the Jew who had the Messianic hope, was bestowed “in Christ,” and had its ground in Him.—<span class="greekheb">καὶ πιστεύσαντες</span>: <span class="ital">having also believed</span>. The <span class="greekheb">καί</span> belongs not to an implied <span class="greekheb">ὑμεῖς</span> but to the <span class="greekheb">πιστεύσαντες</span>. It is the <span class="ital">ascensive</span> <span class="greekheb">καί</span>, adding to the first condition of <span class="ital">hearing</span> the second and higher of <span class="ital">believing</span>. The object of the <span class="greekheb">πιστεύσαντες</span> is the previous <span class="greekheb">λόγον τῆς ἀληθείας</span>, “having also believed that word of preaching;” not the <span class="greekheb">ᾧ</span>, “believing also in whom” (Calv., Bez., Mey.). In Biblical Greek the phrase <span class="greekheb">πιστεύειν ἔν τινι</span> is of very rare occurrence, especially in the sense of believing or confiding in a <span class="ital">person</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-22.htm" title="Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation:">Psalm 78:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-6.htm" title="For even your brothers, and the house of your father, even they have dealt treacherously with you; yes, they have called a multitude after you: believe them not, though they speak fair words to you.">Jeremiah 12:6</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/1-1.htm" title="The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God;">Mark 1:1</a> it has <span class="greekheb">τὸ εὐαγγέλιον</span> as the object. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-15.htm" title="That whoever believes in him should not perish, but have eternal life.">John 3:15</a> both the reading and the connection are uncertain; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-30.htm" title="Now are we sure that you know all things, and need not that any man should ask you: by this we believe that you came forth from God.">John 16:30</a> the idea is “by this”. The <span class="greekheb">πιστεύσαντες</span> here expresses something prior to the fact conveyed by the definite verb, not contemporaneous with it (Harl.). The sealing was <span class="ital">in Christ</span> (<span class="greekheb">ἐν ᾧ</span>), and it followed on their <span class="greekheb">πίστις</span>.—<span class="greekheb">ἐσφραγίσθητε</span>: <span class="ital">ye were sealed</span>. The verb <span class="greekheb">σφραγίζειν</span> (= <span class="greekheb">חָתַס</span>) in the NT expresses several distinct ideas, <span class="ital">e.g., confirming</span> or <span class="ital">authenticating</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-32.htm" title="And what he has seen and heard, that he testifies; and no man receives his testimony.">John 3:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-27.htm" title="Labor not for the meat which perishes, but for that meat which endures to everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give to you: for him has God the Father sealed.">John 6:27</a>; <span class="ital">cf.</span> <span class="greekheb">σφραγίς</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-11.htm" title="And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed to them also:">Romans 4:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-2.htm" title="If I be not an apostle to others, yet doubtless I am to you: for the seal of my apostleship are you in the Lord.">1 Corinthians 9:2</a>); <span class="ital">securing</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-66.htm" title="So they went, and made the sepulcher sure, sealing the stone, and setting a watch.">Matthew 27:66</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-3.htm" title="And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal on him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a little season.">Revelation 20:3</a>); <span class="ital">keeping secret</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/10-4.htm" title="And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I was about to write: and I heard a voice from heaven saying to me, Seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered, and write them not.">Revelation 10:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-10.htm" title="And he said to me, Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book: for the time is at hand.">Revelation 22:10</a>; <span class="ital">cf.</span> <span class="greekheb">σφραγίς</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/5-1.htm" title="And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside, sealed with seven seals....">Revelation 5:1-2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-5.htm" title="And one of the elders said to me, Weep not: behold, the Lion of the tribe of Juda, the Root of David, has prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof.">Revelation 5:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-9.htm" title="And they sung a new song, saying, You are worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for you were slain, and have redeemed us to God by your blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation;">Revelation 5:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-1.htm" title="And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard, as it were the noise of thunder, one of the four beasts saying, Come and see.">Revelation 6:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/8-1.htm" title="And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour.">Revelation 8:1</a>, etc.); <span class="ital">marking</span> as one’s possession or as destined for something (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/8-3.htm" title="And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer; and there was given to him much incense, that he should offer it with the prayers of all saints on the golden altar which was before the throne....">Revelation 8:3-8</a>; <span class="ital">cf.</span> <span class="greekheb">σφραγίς</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-4.htm" title="Traitors, heady, high minded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;">2 Timothy 3:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/9-4.htm" title="And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree; but only those men which have not the seal of God in their foreheads.">Revelation 9:4</a>). Here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-30.htm" title="And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby you are sealed to the day of redemption.">Ephesians 4:30</a> the idea seems to be either that of <span class="ital">authenticating</span> or <span class="ital">certifying</span> them to be of God’s heritage, or that of <span class="ital">marking</span> them as such. The two ideas are near akin. The latter will be more applicable, if (with Theophyl., Chrys., Cornel. a Lap., Alf., etc.) we take the attestation to be the objective attestation to others, the evidence to our fellows that we are the chosen of God; the former, if (with Mey., Ell., etc.) we take it to be the attestation to our own consciousness. This hope or assurance which is given to ourselves seems rather in view here (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-16.htm" title="The Spirit itself bears witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God:">Romans 8:16</a>). There is no reason to suppose that there is any allusion here to any peculiar use of the seal whether in Jewish custom or in heathen religious service. Nor is the rite of Baptism specially referred to. In ecclesiastical Greek, indeed, baptism came to be denoted by the term <span class="greekheb">σφραγίς</span>; but there is no instance of that in the NT. The terms <span class="greekheb">σφραγίς</span>, <span class="greekheb">σφραγίζειν</span>, are used in the Pauline Epistles of <span class="ital">circumcision</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-11.htm" title="And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed to them also:">Romans 4:11</a>), of the <span class="ital">contribution</span> from Macedonia and Achaia (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-28.htm" title="When therefore I have performed this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will come by you into Spain.">Romans 15:28</a>), of the Corinthians as the <span class="ital">witnesses</span> to Paul’s apostleship (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-2.htm" title="If I be not an apostle to others, yet doubtless I am to you: for the seal of my apostleship are you in the Lord.">1 Corinthians 9:2</a>), of the inward <span class="ital">certification</span> of believers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-22.htm" title="Who has also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.">2 Corinthians 1:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-13.htm" title="In whom you also trusted, after that you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that you believed, you were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise,">Ephesians 1:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-30.htm" title="And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby you are sealed to the day of redemption.">Ephesians 4:30</a>), and of the <span class="ital">destination</span> or <span class="ital">ownership</span> of the Church or congregation of believers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-19.htm" title="Nevertheless the foundation of God stands sure, having this seal, The Lord knows them that are his. And, Let every one that names the name of Christ depart from iniquity.">2 Timothy 2:19</a>).—<span class="greekheb">τῶ Πνεύματι τῆς ἐπαγγελίας τῷ ἁγίῳ</span>: <span class="ital">with the Holy Spirit of promise</span>. The Spirit is that by which (<span class="ital">instrumental</span> dative) the sealing is effected; and that Spirit is called the Spirit <span class="ital">of promise</span>, not in the active sense of <span class="ital">bringing</span> or <span class="ital">confirming</span> the promise (Calv., Bez., etc.), but in the passive sense of having been announced by the promise, or being the <span class="ital">object</span> or <span class="ital">content</span> of the promise in the OT. The <span class="greekheb">τῷ ἁγίῳ</span>, thrown emphatically to the end of the clause, designates the Spirit solemnly in respect of the essential personal quality of holiness. Taken together with the general tenor of the paragraph and with the fact that in the <span class="greekheb">ὑμεῖς</span> Gentile Christians as a whole are addressed, and not any select number or class, it is clear that what is in view here is not the extraordinary or miraculous gifts of the Spirit, but that bestowal of the Spirit in which all believers shared, which was the subject of the great OT prophecies (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/joel/3-1.htm" title="For, behold, in those days, and in that time, when I shall bring again the captivity of Judah and Jerusalem,...">Joel 3:1-5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-15.htm" title="Until the spirit be poured on us from on high, and the wilderness be a fruitful field, and the fruitful field be counted for a forest.">Isaiah 32:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-3.htm" title="For I will pour water on him that is thirsty, and floods on the dry ground: I will pour my spirit on your seed, and my blessing on your offspring:">Isaiah 44:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-26.htm" title="A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh.">Ezekiel 36:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/39-29.htm" title="Neither will I hide my face any more from them: for I have poured out my spirit on the house of Israel, said the Lord GOD.">Ezekiel 39:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-10.htm" title="And I will pour on the house of David, and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of supplications: and they shall look on me whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn for him, as one mourns for his only son, and shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is in bitterness for his firstborn.">Zechariah 12:10</a>), and of which a new heart, a new spirit, was to be the result.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[68] Codex Alexandrinus (sæc. v.), at the British Museum, published in photographic facsimile by Sir E.

V. In R. V. we have:—“In Whom ye also, having heard the word of the truth, the gospel of your salvation—<span class="ital">in Whom, having also believed, ye were sealed</span>.” Here the second “in Whom” is treated as the resumption and repetition of the first, and the verb “ye were sealed” is connected with both. But a simpler explanation than either is possible;—“<span class="ital">In Whom</span> [<span class="ital">are</span>] <span class="ital">ye also, having heard</span>, &c.” And this adapts itself well to the repeated “in Whom”; as if to say, “In Whom you enjoy acceptance, attained by your reception of the message of salvation; in Whom further you experienced the special ‘seal’ of the Spirit”—as an additional aspect of the privilege of union with Christ. But the grammatical difficulty does not affect the main import of the verse.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">after that ye heard</span>] Better, <span class="bld">on hearing</span>; without the strong suggestion of <span class="ital">sequence</span> of time given by A. V. On the all-importance of “hearing,” in order to salvation, cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-14.htm" title="How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?">Romans 10:14</a>. The hearing may of course be literally with the ear, or not; but it must be the reception <span class="ital">ab extra</span> of a message, no mere result of thought or aspiration.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">of truth</span>] Better, perhaps, <span class="bld">of the truth</span>; the Eternal Verity of Christ. So often in N. T. “truth” is truth not in general but in special; spiritual truth, Christian truth (cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-13.htm" title="However, when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will show you things to come.">John 16:13</a>, where lit. “He shall guide you into all <span class="ital">the truth</span>”); a thing in harmony, of course, with all truth, scientific or other, but capable of being quite separately studied.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">salvation</span>] The one place in the Epistle where the Gr. noun occurs; another noun being used <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-17.htm" title="And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:">Ephesians 6:17</a>; which see. On the threefold aspect of “salvation” in Scripture see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-5.htm" title="Even when we were dead in sins, has quickened us together with Christ, (by grace you are saved;)">Ephesians 2:5</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">In whom also</span>, &c.] Better, <span class="bld">In Whom moreover, on believing, ye were sealed,</span> &c. The Gr. does not forbid the rendering, “<span class="ital">on believing in Whom;</span>” but this demands an unusual construction.—The Christian is here viewed as “<span class="ital">sealed in Christ;</span>” that is, as receiving a Divine attestation of his union with his Lord.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“<span class="ital">On believing</span>”<span class="ital">:</span>—better than “<span class="ital">after</span> believing,” because the Gr. does not emphasize sequence. It rather combines into one idea the facts of the <span class="ital">faith</span> and the <span class="ital">seal</span>. In experience, the latter might markedly <span class="ital">follow</span> the former; but not necessarily in the Divine ideal.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">sealed</span>] So again <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-30.htm" title="And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby you are sealed to the day of redemption.">Ephesians 4:30</a>; and cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-22.htm" title="Who has also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.">2 Corinthians 1:22</a>. The idea of the phrase is a double one; attestation of reality (cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-33.htm" title="He that has received his testimony has set to his seal that God is true.">John 3:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-11.htm" title="And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed to them also:">Romans 4:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-2.htm" title="If I be not an apostle to others, yet doubtless I am to you: for the seal of my apostleship are you in the Lord.">1 Corinthians 9:2</a>), and claim of property (cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-28.htm" title="When therefore I have performed this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will come by you into Spain.">Romans 15:28</a>). “The Spirit” was at once the proof of the presence of Divine faith in the recipient, and the mark of Divine ownership over him. The latter view is the leading one in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-30.htm" title="And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby you are sealed to the day of redemption.">Ephesians 4:30</a>. In the Fathers, the word “seal” is a frequent equivalent for Baptism; one explanation (given by Gregory of Nazianzus, cent. 4) being that Baptism was the “badge of lordship;” the mark of the Lord’s ownership. In the N. T. however the reference is plainly to something usually subsequent to Baptism, and we turn for illustration to the Acts. There we find many cases in which baptized converts receive supernatural powers, visible (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-18.htm" title="And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles' hands the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money,">Acts 8:18</a>) in their effects; which gifts in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-14.htm" title="For the body is not one member, but many.">1 Corinthians 12:14</a> are treated as things preeminently (in a certain sense) <span class="ital">spiritual</span>, the work of the <span class="ital">Spirit</span>. We find as a fact that these powers were conferred not in the ordinary ministry of the Church but in special connexion with the Apostles; at least, no clear case is to the contrary. So it is in Samaria (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/8-14.htm" title="Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent to them Peter and John:...">Acts 8:14-18</a>); at Cæsarea (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/10-44.htm" title="While Peter yet spoke these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word....">Acts 10:44-46</a>); at Ephesus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/19-5.htm" title="When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus....">Acts 19:5-6</a>). We do not find e.g. Philip the Evangelist (Acts 8) conveying these gifts. Ananias (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-17.htm" title="And Ananias went his way, and entered into the house; and putting his hands on him said, Brother Saul, the Lord, even Jesus, that appeared to you in the way as you came, has sent me, that you might receive your sight, and be filled with the Holy Ghost.">Acts 9:17</a>) <span class="ital">apparently</span> does so to Saul at Damascus; but the circumstances in that case are unique. As a fact, the possession of Spiritual Gifts, in this sense, became early rare; a phenomenon falling in with this limitation of conveyance. And in one remarkable passage (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-8.htm" title="Charity never fails: but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away.">1 Corinthians 13:8</a>) we have inspired intimation that they were <span class="ital">meant</span> to cease. On these manifestations it will be here enough to remark that it is impossible in all details to lay down a precise theory, for instance as to the demarcation of the “gifts” from the “ordinary” graces of faith, hope and love, things equally due, in their regenerate exercise, to Divine agency; while on the other hand we soon, in observation, practically reach a point where the “gifts” and the “graces” (to use convenient though inexact terms) diverge. The connexion is always close, for both are effects of the same Power; the difference is real, for the “gifts” are limited by many circumstances, and are rather means to ends than ends, while the “graces” are universal and essential in the regenerate character, and in fact constitute that character, and are thus true ends. Cp. especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-31.htm" title="But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet show I to you a more excellent way.">1 Corinthians 12:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/13-1.htm" title="Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal....">1 Corinthians 13:1-2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-22.htm" title="Why tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to them that believe not: but prophesying serves not for them that believe not, but for them which believe.">1 Corinthians 14:22</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>that <span class="ital">holy Spirit of promise</span>] Lit. <span class="bld">the Spirit of the promise, the Holy One</span>; the Personal Paraclete, the great burthen of the <span class="ital">promises</span> of the Son (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-13.htm" title="If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?">Luke 11:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-39.htm" title="(But this spoke he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.)">John 7:39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-16.htm" title="And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever;">John 14:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-26.htm" title="But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatever I have said to you.">John 14:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-26.htm" title="But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send to you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceeds from the Father, he shall testify of me:">John 15:26</a>, &c.), and of the Father (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-49.htm" title="And, behold, I send the promise of my Father on you: but tarry you in the city of Jerusalem, until you be endued with power from on high.">Luke 24:49</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/1-4.htm" title="And, being assembled together with them, commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which, said he, you have heard of me....">Acts 1:4-5</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/ephesians/1.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-13.htm" title="In whom you also trusted, after that you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that you believed, you were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise,">Ephesians 1:13</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ὧ</span>, <span class="ital">in Whom</span>) To be referred to <span class="ital">in Christ</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-12.htm" title="That we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in Christ.">Ephesians 1:12</a>, or to <span class="ital">in Him</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-10.htm" title="That in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him:">Ephesians 1:10</a>.—<span class="greekheb">ἀκούσαντες</span>, <span class="ital">having heard</span>) The sense is suspended,[13] till the participle <span class="ital">having believed</span> [“after that ye believed”], which is correlative to <span class="ital">having heard</span>, be added.—<span class="greekheb">τῆς ἀληθείας</span>, <span class="ital">of the truth</span>) Hence it is called the <span class="ital">hearing of faith</span>.

This seems hardly natural, because the prefix <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;</span> is characteristic and emphatic in ver. 12. It is a much less strain to supply simply <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f72;</span>, the important point being that you are now in him - in Christ. This expression, "in Christ," is one of the hinges of the Epistle; it occurs times almost without number, denoting the intimate vital union through faith between Christ and his people, as of the members to the head, in virtue of which they not only get the benefit of his atonement, but share his vital influences, live by faith on the Son of God. Having heard and received the truth as it is in Jesus, the glad tidings of salvation through a crucified Jesus, they became one with him, just as freely as did the believing Jews, and to the same blessed effects. More than that - <span class="cmt_word">in whom also having believed, ye were sealed with the Holy Spirit of the promise</span>; thus receiving a new ground for thankfulness, a new proof of the riches of the grace of God. Many explain this seal of baptism, which undoubtedly seals Christ and all his blessings <span class="accented">to believers</span>. But though the seal of the Holy Spirit may have been given in and with baptism, it is not identical with baptism. The impression of it is partly within believers and partly without. Within, it is the felt result of the working of the Holy Spirit - the feeling of satisfaction and delight in the work and person of Christ, of love, confidence, and joy flowing out toward God, and the desire and endeavor in all things to be conformed to his will. Without, it is the fruit of the Spirit, the new man, created in righteousness and holiness after the image of Christ. Within, the Spirit bears witness with their spirits; without, the transformed life corroborates the inward witness, and gives it to the world. The first is never complete without the second, nor the second without the first. The spiritual history of believers is thus presented: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> hearing the truth; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> believing; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> being sealed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Spirit is called the Spirit of the promise, because he is often promised in the Old Testament (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-15.htm">Isaiah 32:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-27.htm">Ezekiel 36:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-1.htm">Joel 3:1</a>, etc.). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/ephesians/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Ye also trusted<p>Gentile Christians.
