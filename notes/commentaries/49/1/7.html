(In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-1.htm" title="And you has he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins;">Ephesians 2:1</a>, both are used.) In both passages we have united, as correspondent to each other, the two expressions under which our Lord Himself describes His atonement—in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-28.htm" title="Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered to, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.">Matthew 20:28</a>, as the “giving His life a ransom for many,” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-28.htm" title="For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.">Matthew 26:28</a>, as “the shedding of His blood for the forgiveness of sins.” These two expressions appear to be complementary to each other, rather than identical. (1) The primary idea in “redemption” is deliverance from a bondage, mostly the bondage of sin itself (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-23.htm" title="And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the first fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.">Romans 8:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-14.htm" title="Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify to himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.">Titus 2:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-15.htm" title="And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.">Hebrews 9:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_peter/1-18.htm" title="For as much as you know that you were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers;">1Peter 1:18-21</a>); occasionally (and in this sense with a different Greek word), the bondage under sentence of punishment for sin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-13.htm" title="Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangs on a tree:">Galatians 3:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-5.htm" title="To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.">Galatians 4:5</a>). Into that bondage man has plunged himself; God’s mercy redeems him from it at an unspeakable price (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-16.htm" title="For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.">John 3:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/7-24.htm" title="O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?">Romans 7:24-25</a>). (2) The primary idea in “the forgiveness of sins through His blood” is propitiation, that is, the offering to God “a full, perfect, and sufficient sacrifice” for sin, by One who is the Head and Representative of the human race (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-25.htm" title="Whom God has set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;">Romans 3:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-2.htm" title="And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for our's only, but also for the sins of the whole world.">1John 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-10.htm" title="Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.">1John 4:10</a>). So St. Paul interprets our Lord’s words by the declaration that “Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-7.htm" title="Purge out therefore the old leaven, that you may be a new lump, as you are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us:">1Corinthians 5:7</a>); and it is notable that exactly in His words is the Atonement designated in the earliest apostolic preaching (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-38.htm" title="Then Peter said to them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.">Acts 2:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-31.htm" title="Him has God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Savior, for to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins.">Acts 5:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-43.htm" title="To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name whoever believes in him shall receive remission of sins.">Acts 10:43</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-38.htm" title="Be it known to you therefore, men and brothers, that through this man is preached to you the forgiveness of sins:">Acts 13:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-18.htm" title="To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me.">Acts 26:18</a>). Hence the former phrase looks at the Atonement from the side of God, the latter from the side of man; both being wrought by Him who is Son of God and Son of Man at once. Together they represent the whole truth.<p><span class= "bld">According to the riches of his grace.</span>—As above, in relation to praise, stress is laid on the gloriousness of God’s grace, so here, in relation to enjoyment of it, on its overflowing richness. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-7.htm" title="That in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus.">Ephesians 2:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-8.htm" title="To me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ;">Ephesians 3:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-16.htm" title="That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man;">Ephesians 3:16</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-24.htm" title="Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:">Romans 3:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-23.htm" title="And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he had before prepared to glory,">Romans 9:23</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/maclaren/ephesians/1.htm">MacLaren's Expositions</a></div>EPHESIANS<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">ACCORDING TO’-II.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-7.htm" title="In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace;">Ephesians 1:7</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>We have seen, in a previous sermon, that a characteristic note of this letter is the frequent occurrence of that phrase ‘according to.’ I also then pointed out that it was employed in two different directions. One class of passages, with which I then tried to deal, used it to compare the divine purpose in our salvation with the historical process of the salvation. The type of that class of reference is found in a verse just before my text, ‘according to the good pleasure of His will.’ There is a second class of passages to which our text belongs, where the comparison is not between the purpose and its realisation, but between the stores of the divine riches and the experiences of the Christian life. The one set of passages suggests the ground of our salvation in the deep purpose of God; the other suggests the measure of the power which is working out that salvation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The instances of this second use of the phrase, besides the one in my text, ‘according to the riches of His grace,’ are such as these: ‘According to the riches of His glory’; ‘According to the power that worketh in us’; ‘According to the measure of the gift of Christ’; ‘According to the energy of the might of His power, which He wrought in Christ when He raised Him from the dead.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Now it is clear that all these are varying forms of the same thing. They vary in form, they are identical in substance. What a Jew calls a ‘cubit’ an Englishman calls a ‘foot,’ but the result is pretty nearly the same. Shillings, marks, francs, are various standards; they all come to substantially the same result. These varying measures of the divine gift which is at work in man’s salvation, have this in common, that they all run out into God’s immeasurable, unlimited power, boundless wealth. And so, if we gather them together, and try to focus them in a few words, they may help to widen our conceptions of what we ought to expect from God, to bow us in contrition as to the small use that we have made of it, and to open our desires wide, that they may be filled.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>I only aspire, then, to deal with these four forms which I have already suggested.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. The measure of our possible attainments is the whole wealth of God.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>‘According to the riches of His grace.’ Another angle at which the same thought is viewed appears in another part of the letter, where we have this variation in the expression, ‘According to the riches of His glory.’ ‘Grace’ and ‘Glory’ are generally opposed antithetically; in this epistle they are united, for in the verse before my text I:read: ‘To the praise of the glory of His grace.’ So the first thought is, the whole wealth of God is available for every Christian soul.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Now it seems to me that there are very few things that the popular Christianity of this day needs more than a furnishing up of the familiar old Christian terminology, which has largely lost the freshness and the power that it once had. They tell us that these incandescent burners, that we are using nowadays, are very much more bright when they are first fixed than after the mantle gets a little worn. So it is with the terminology of Christianity. It needs to be re-stated, not in such a way as to take the pith out of it, which is what a great deal of the modern craze for re-statement means, but in such a way as to brighten it up again, and to invest it with something of the ‘celestial light’ with which it was ‘apparelled’ when it first came. Now that word ‘grace,’ I have no doubt, sounds to you hard, theological, remote. But what does it mean? It gathers into one burning point the whole of the rays of that conception of God, with which it is the glory of Christianity to have flooded and drenched the world. It tells us that at the heart of the universe there is a heart; that God is Love, that that love is the motive-spring of His activity, that it comes and bends over the lowliest with a smile of amity on its lips, with healing and help in its hands, with forgiveness for all sins against itself, with boundless wealth for the poorest, and that the wealth of His self-communicating love is the measure of the wealth that each of us may possess.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>God gives ‘according to the riches of His grace.’ You do not expect a millionaire to give half-a-crown to a subscription fund; and God gives royally, divinely, measuring His bestowments by the abundance of His treasures, and handing over with an open palm large gifts of coined money, because there are infinite chests of uncirculated bullion in the deep storehouses. ‘How great is Thy goodness which Thou hast manifested before the sons of men for them that fear Thee. How much greater is Thy goodness which Thou hast laid up in store.’ But whilst He gives all, the question comes to be: What do I receive? The measure of His gift is His measureless grace; the measure of my reception is my-alas! easily-measured faith. What about the unearned increment? What about the unrealised wealth? Too many of us are like some man who has a great estate in another land. He knows nothing about it, and is living in grimy poverty in a back street. For you have all God’s riches waiting for you, and ‘the potentiality of wealth beyond the dreams of avarice’ at your beck and call, and yet you are but poorly realising your possible riches. Alas, that when we might have so much we do have so little. ‘According to the riches of His grace’ He gives. But another ‘according to’ comes in. ‘According to thy faith be it unto thee.’ So we have to take these two measures together, and the working limit of our possession of God’s riches comes out of the combination of them both.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Let me remind you, before I pass on, of what I have already suggested is but another phase of this same thought, Paul says in this epistle that God gives not only ‘according to the riches of His grace,’ but ‘according to the riches of His glory,’ and that the latter expression is substantially identical with the former, is plain from the combination of the two in an earlier verse of this chapter: ‘To the praise of the glory of His grace.’ Thus we come to the blessed thought that the glory of God is essentially the revelation of that stooping, pitying, pardoning, enriching love. Not in the physical attributes, not in the characteristics of the divine nature which part Him off from men, and make Him remote, both from their conceptions and their affections, but in the love that bends to them is the true glory of God. All these other things are but the fringes; the centre of glory is the Love, which is the mightiest and the divinest thing in the Might Divine. The sunshine is far stronger than the lightning, and there is more force developed in the rain than in an earthquake. That truth is what Christianity has made the common possession of the world. It has thereby broken the chains of dread; it has bridged over the infinite distance. It has given us a God that can love and be loved, can stoop and can lift, can pardon and can purify. ‘According to the good pleasure of His goodness,’-there is the foundation of our salvation. ‘According to the riches of His grace,’-there is the measure of our salvation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. We have another form of the same measure in another set of verses which speak of the present working of God’s power.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Apostle speaks in regard to his own apostolic commission of its being given ‘according to the working of His power’; and he speaks of all Christian men as receiving gifts ‘according to the power that worketh in us.’ So there we have a standard that comes, as it were, a little closer to ourselves. We do not need to travel up into the dim abysses above, or think of the sanctities and the secrecies of that divine heart in the light which is inaccessible, but we have the measure in ourselves.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The standards of length are kept at Greenwich, the standards of capacity are kept in the Tower; but there are local standards distributed throughout the land to which men may go and have their measures corrected. And so besides all these lofty thoughts about the grace and the glory which measures His gift, we can turn within, if we are Christian people, and say, ‘According to the power that worketh in us.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Ah, brethren! there are few things that we want more than to revive and deepen the conviction that in every Christian man, by virtue of his faith, and in proportion to his faith, there is in operation an actual, superhuman, divine power moulding his nature, guiding, quickening, ennobling, lifting, confirming, and hallowing and shaping him into conformity with Jesus Christ. I would that we all believed not as a dogma, but realised as a personal experience, that irrefragable truth, ‘Know ye not that the Spirit of Christ dwelleth in you, except ye be reprobate?’ The life of self is evil; the life of Christ in self is good, and only good. And if you are Christian men, and in the proportion, as I have said, in which you are living by faith, you have working in your spirits the very Spirit of Christ Himself.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And that power is the measure of your possibilities. Obviously ‘the power that worketh in us’ is able to do a great deal more than it is doing in any of us. And so with deep significance the Apostle, side by side with his adducing of this power as being the measure of our possible attainments, speaks about God as being ‘able to do for us, exceeding abundantly above all that we can ask or think.’ ‘The power that works in us’ transcends in its possibilities our present experience, it transcends our conceptions, it transcends our desires. It is able to do everything; it actually does-well, you know what it does in you. And the responsibility of hampering and hindering that power from working out its only adequately corresponding results lies at our own doors. ‘A rushing, mighty wind’-yes; and in myself a scarcely perceptible breathing, and often a dead calm, stagnant as in the latitudes on either side of the Equator, where, for long, dreary days, no freshening motion in the atmosphere is perceptible. ‘A fire?’-yes; then why is my grate full of grey, cold ashes, and one little spark in the corner? ‘A fountain springing into everlasting life?’-yes; then why in my basin is there so much scum and ooze, mud and defilement, and so little of the flashing and brilliant water? ‘The power that works in us’ is sorely hindered by the weakness in which it works.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>III. In the third place another form of this measure is stated by the Apostle, ‘According to the measure of the gift of Christ.’</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>That means, of course, the gift which Christ bestows. It is substantially the same idea as I have just been dealing with, only looked at from rather a different point of view. Therefore, I need not dwell upon its parallelism with what has just been occupying our attention, but rather ask you simply to consider one point in reference to it, and that is that, side by side with the reference to the gift of Christ as being the measure of our possible attainments, the Apostle enlarges on the Infinite variety of the shapes which that one gift takes in different people. ‘He gave some apostles, some prophets,’ etc.; one man receiving according to this fashion, and another according to that, and to each of us the distribution is made ‘according to the measure of the gift of Christ.’ That is to say, it takes us all, the collective goodness and beauty of the whole community of saints, to approximate to the fulness of that gift, and all are needed in their different types and forms of excellence, sanctity and beauty, in order to set forth, even imperfectly, the richness and the manifoldness of His great gift. And so ‘we all come’-there is a multiplicity-’unto the perfect man, the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ’-there is a unity in which the multiplicity inheres.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>So try to get a little more of some different type of excellence than that to which you are naturally inclined. Seek, and consciously endeavour, to appropriate into your character uncongenial excellences, and be very charitable in your judgments of the different types of Christian conformity to Christ our Lord. The crystals that are set round a light do not quarrel with each other as to whether green, or yellow, or blue, or red, or violet is the true colour to reflect. We need all the seven prismatic tints to make the perfect white light. The gift of Christ is many-sided; try not to be one-sided in your reception of it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">IV. And now the last form of this measure is ‘according to the energy of the might of His power, which He wrought in Christ when He raised Him from the dead.’</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>When we gazed upon the riches of God’s grace, they were high above us, when we looked upon ‘the power that worketh in us,’ we saw it working amidst many hindrances and hamperings, but here there is presented to us in a concrete example, close beside us, of what God can make of a man when the man is wholly pliable to His will, and the recipient of His influences. And so there stands before us the guarantee and the pattern of immortal life, the Christ whose Manhood died and lives, who is clothed with a spiritual body, who wields royal authority in the Kingdom of the Most High. And that is the measure of what God can do with me, and wishes to do with me, if I will let Him. Christ is my pattern, and the measure of my own possibilities.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>To be with Him, where and what He is, is the only adequate result of the power that works in us, and of the process that is already begun in us, if we are Christian people. You are sometimes-there is one eminent example of it in that great Medicean Chapel at Florence-a statue exquisitely finished in all its limbs, but one part left in the rough. That is the best that Christian people come to here. Shall it always be so? Do not the very imperfections prophesy completion, and is it not certain that the half-finished torso will be carried to the upper workshop, and be there disengaged from the dead marble and made to stand out in perfect beauty and fullest completeness? Christ is the object of our hopes, and no hopes of the Christian life are adequate to the power that works in us, or to the progress already made, which do not see in the ‘energy of the might of the power’ which wrought in Christ, the example and the guarantee of the exceeding greatness of ‘His power which is to usward.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And now, one last word. Besides all these passages which have been occupying us, there is another use of this same phrase in this letter which presents a very solemn and grim contrast. I can do no better with it than simply read it: ‘Ye were dead in trespasses and sins; wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh’-mark the allusion to the other words that we have been referring to-’in the children of disobedience.’ So there you have the alternative, either ‘dead in trespasses and sins,’ whilst living the physical and the intellectual life, or partaking of the life of Him ‘who was dead, and is alive for ever more’; either ‘walking according to the course of this world,’ which is ‘disobedience’ and ‘wrath,’ or walking ‘according to the power that worketh in us’; either ‘putting on,’ or rather continuing to wear, ‘the old man which is corrupt according to the lusts which deceive,’ or ‘putting on the new man, which according to God is created in righteousness and holiness and truth.’ The choice is before us. May God help us to choose aright!<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/ephesians/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/1-7.htm" title="In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace;...">Ephesians 1:7-8</a></span>. <span class="ital">In, </span>or by, <span class="ital">whom we have redemption </span>— By price and by power, are bought and delivered from the guilt and dominion of sin, the tyranny of Satan, and the final displeasure and wrath of God. <span class="ital">Through his blood </span>— Shed for these purposes; or through what he hath done and suffered; having undertaken the great and awful work of making an atonement for us by the sacrifice of himself, by which we obtain, what is an introduction to all the other blessings here mentioned, <span class="ital">the forgiveness of sins </span>— For, being pardoned, God’s wrath is removed from us; we are taken into his favour; adopted into his family; born of his Spirit; love him who hath thus first loved us; and, through this love, become holy, and without blame before him.

This was from the choice of them in Christ, before the foundation of the world, that they should be made holy by separation from sin, being set apart to God, and sanctified by the Holy Spirit, in consequence of their election in Christ. All who are chosen to happiness as the end, are chosen to holiness as the means. In love they were predestinated, or fore-ordained, to be adopted as children of God by faith in Christ Jesus, and to be openly admitted to the privileges of that high relation to himself. The reconciled and adopted believer, the pardoned sinner, gives all the praise of his salvation to his gracious Father. His love appointed this method of redemption, spared not his own Son, and brought believers to hear and embrace this salvation. It was rich grace to provide such a surety as his own Son, and freely to deliver him up. This method of grace gives no encouragement to evil, but shows sin in all its hatefulness, and how it deserves vengeance. The believer's actions, as well as his words, declare the praises of Divine mercy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ephesians/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In whom we have redemption - On the meaning of the word here rendered "redemption" - (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;  apolutro&#772;sis) - see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-24.htm">Romans 3:24</a>. The word here, as there, denotes that deliverance from sin and from the evil consequences of sin, which has been procured by the atonement made by the Lord Jesus Christ. This verse is one of the passages which prove conclusively that the apostle here does not refer to "nations" and to "national privileges." Of what "nation" could it be said that it had "redemption through the blood of Jesus, even the forgiveness of sins?"<p>Through his blood - By means of the atonement which he has made; see this phrase fully explained in the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-25.htm">Romans 3:25</a>.<p>The forgiveness of sins - We obtain through his blood, or through the atonement which he has made, the forgiveness of sins. We are not to suppose that this is all the benefit which we receive from his death, or that this is all that constitutes redemption. It is the main, and perhaps the most important thing. But we also obtain the hope of heaven, the influences of the Holy Spirit, grace to guide us and to support us in trial, peace in death, and perhaps many more benefits. Still "forgiveness" is so prominent and important, that the apostle has mentioned that as if it were all.<p>According to the riches of his grace - According to his rich grace; see a similar phrase explained in the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-4.htm">Romans 2:4</a>. The word "riches," in the form in which it is used here, occurs also in several other places in this Epistle; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-18.htm">Ephesians 1:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-7.htm">Ephesians 2:7</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-8.htm">Ephesians 3:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-16.htm">Ephesians 3:16</a>. It is what Paley (Horae Paul) calls "a cant phrase," and occurs often in the writings of Paul; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-4.htm">Romans 2:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-23.htm">Romans 9:23</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-12.htm">Romans 11:12</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-33.htm">Romans 11:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-19.htm">Philippians 4:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-27.htm">Colossians 1:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-2.htm">Colossians 2:2</a>. It is not found in any of the other writings of the New Testament, except once in a sense somewhat similar, in James Jam 2:5, "Hath not God chosen the poor of this world "rich" in faith," and Dr. Paley from this fact has constructed an argument to prove that this Epistle was written by Paul. It is unique to him, and marks his style in a manner which cannot be mistaken. An impostor, or a forger of the Epistle, would not have thought of introducing it, and yet it is just such a phrase as would naturally be used by Paul. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ephesians/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7.

If a man were unable to redeem himself from being a bond-servant, his kinsman might redeem him (Le 25:48). Hence, antitypically the Son of God became the Son of man, that as our kinsman He might redeem us (Mt 20:28). Another "redemption" follows, namely, that "of the purchased possession" hereafter (Eph 1:14).<p>through his blood&#8212;(Eph 2:13); as the instrument; the propitiation, that is, the consideration (devised by His own love) for which He, who was justly angry (Isa 12:1), becomes propitious to us; the expiation, the price paid to divine justice for our sin (Ac 20:28; Ro 3:25; 1Co 6:20; Col 1:20; 1Pe 1:18, 19).<p>the forgiveness of sins&#8212;Greek, "the remission of our transgressions": not merely "pretermission," as the Greek (Ro 3:25) ought to be translated. This "remission," being the explanation of "redemption," includes not only deliverance from sin's penalty, but from its pollution and enslaving power, negatively; and the reconciliation of an offended God, and a satisfaction unto a just God, positively.<p>riches of his grace&#8212;(Eph 2:7); "the exceeding riches of His grace." Compare Eph 1:18; Eph 3:16, "according to the riches of His glory": so that "grace" is His "glory."<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ephesians/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">In whom; </span> in Christ, God-man, the immediate worker of this redemption; for though the Father and the Spirit concurred to it, yet the redeeming work was peculiarly terminated in the Second Person.

Redemption supposes captivity and slavery, and is a deliverance out of it; God's elect by nature are in bondage to sin, Satan, and the law; through the grace of Christ, they are redeemed from all iniquity; ransomed out of the hands of him that is stronger than they; and are freed from the law, its bondage, curse, and condemnation, and from every other enemy: and this benefit Christ is the author of; he was called to be the Redeemer of his people from all eternity; and he was sent in the fulness of time, to procure the redemption of them; to which he had a right, being their near kinsman; and for which he was every way fit, being God as well as man; and which he has obtained by his obedience, sufferings, and death: and in whom it resides, as in its proper subject and author; who, by imputation, is made redemption to all the chosen ones; for not angels, but men, share in this redemption; and not all men, but elect men; such as are chosen in Christ, predestinated to the adoption of children by him, and who are accepted in the beloved: and this comes to them through the blood of Christ, which was freely shed on the cross to procure it; and was a sufficient ransom, or redemption price; it being not only the same blood with those who are redeemed, but the blood of an innocent person; and not of a mere man, but of one who is truly and properly God, as well as man; see more of this See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-14.htm">Colossians 1:14</a>.

What is in view, therefore, is something possessed now, and the writer describes that as <span class="greekheb">τὴν ἀπολύτρωσιν</span>—“<span class="ital">the</span> redemption,” <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, the redemption familiar to every Christian, long expected and now accomplished. This <span class="greekheb">ἀπολύτρωσις</span> is viewed sometimes as a thing of the future (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/21-28.htm" title="And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption draws near.">Luke 21:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-23.htm" title="And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the first fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.">Romans 8:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-30.htm" title="And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby you are sealed to the day of redemption.">Ephesians 4:30</a>; and probably also <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-14.htm" title="Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, to the praise of his glory.">Ephesians 1:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-30.htm" title="But of him are you in Christ Jesus, who of God is made to us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:">1 Corinthians 1:30</a>); sometimes as a present possession (as here; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-24.htm" title="Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:">Romans 3:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-14.htm" title=" In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins:">Colossians 1:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-15.htm" title="And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.">Hebrews 9:15</a>). That the <span class="greekheb">ἀπολύτρωσις</span> here is a redemption not from the power or pollution of sin, but from its guilt, its condemnation, its penalty, is made plain by the defining clause which follows, identifying it with the <span class="ital">forgiveness</span> of sins. This is not the only aspect in which it is presented in the Pauline Epistles. The verb <span class="greekheb">λυτροῦσθαι</span> is applied there to a redemption from “all iniquity,” <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-14.htm" title="Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify to himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.">Titus 2:14</a>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-18.htm" title="For as much as you know that you were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers;">1 Peter 1:18</a> it is used of a redemption from a “vain manner of life”. But it is the primary aspect of the word and its cognates, and the one that is at the foundation of the other. The noun <span class="greekheb">ἀπολύτρωσις</span> is of rare occurrence, found only in a few passages in profane Greek (Plut., <span class="ital">Pomp.</span>, xxiv., 2; Joseph., <span class="ital">Antiq.</span>, xii., ii., 3; Diod., <span class="ital">Frag.</span>, lib. xxxvii., 5, 3 (Dindorf.); Philo, <span class="ital">Quod omn. prob. lib. sit.</span>, § 17); and in the NT itself only ten times in all. The verb <span class="greekheb">ἀπολυτροῦσθαι</span> is not found in the NT at all; the simple <span class="greekheb">λυτροῦν</span>, <span class="greekheb">λυτροῦσθαι</span> thrice (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-18.htm" title="For as much as you know that you were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers;">1 Peter 1:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-21.htm" title="But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel: and beside all this, to day is the third day since these things were done.">Luke 24:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-14.htm" title="Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify to himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.">Titus 2:14</a>) and the noun <span class="greekheb">λύτρωσις</span> thrice (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-68.htm" title="Blessed be the Lord God of Israel; for he has visited and redeemed his people,">Luke 1:68</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-38.htm" title="And she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise to the Lord, and spoke of him to all them that looked for redemption in Jerusalem.">Luke 2:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-12.htm" title="Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us.">Hebrews 9:12</a>). The proper idea is that of a release, deliverance, or redemption effected by payment of a price or ransom (<span class="greekheb">λύτρον</span>). It is argued indeed that this idea cannot be said to be the essential or primary idea of <span class="greekheb">ἀπολύτρωσις</span>, because it is used in connections in which the notion of a <span class="ital">payment</span> is not in view (so Abbott); and that, therefore, we are not entitled to say that it means more than <span class="ital">deliverance</span>. It is true that, as is the case with most words, the definite, specific sense passes at times into the more general sense of “deliverance” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-35.htm" title="Women received their dead raised to life again: and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection:">Hebrews 11:35</a>; <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-6.htm" title="Why say to the children of Israel, I am the LORD, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will rid you out of their bondage, and I will redeem you with a stretched out arm, and with great judgments:">Exodus 6:6</a>). But in profane Greek and in the LXX the primary sense of the verb. the noun, and their cognates is that of a redemption effected by payment of a price, or a release granted on receiving a price (Plut., <span class="ital">Pomp.</span>, 24; Plato, <span class="ital">Leges</span>, 11, p. 919(<span class="ital">a</span>); Polyb., xxii., 21, 8; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-8.htm" title="If she please not her master, who has betrothed her to himself, then shall he let her be redeemed: to sell her to a strange nation he shall have no power, seeing he has dealt deceitfully with her.">Exodus 21:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-1.htm" title="Woe to her that is filthy and polluted, to the oppressing city!">Zephaniah 3:1</a>); and in the Pauline Epistles it denotes the deliverance accomplished at the cost of Christ’s death from the Divine wrath and the penalty of sin. So it is understood, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, by Origen, <span class="ital">in loc.</span>, Mey., Alf., Ell., etc.; and as the <span class="greekheb">ἄφεσιν κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. shows that the “redemption” here in view is one in relation to the <span class="ital">guilt</span> or <span class="ital">penalty</span> of sin, so the <span class="greekheb">διὰ τοῦ αἵματος αὐτοῦ</span> shows that it is a redemption by payment of a price. This is consistent with Paul’s doctrine of the Divine wrath, redemption, propitiation, expiation, and the curse of the law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-18.htm" title="For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;">Romans 1:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-23.htm" title="For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;">Romans 3:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-5.htm" title="And hope makes not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given to us.">Romans 5:5</a> ff.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-20.htm" title="For you are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.">1 Corinthians 6:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-4.htm" title="But when the fullness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law,">Galatians 4:4</a>). It has its foundation also in Christ’s own declaration of the purpose of His coming, <span class="ital">viz.</span>, to give His life a <span class="greekheb">λύτρον ἀντὶ πολλῶν</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-28.htm" title="Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered to, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.">Matthew 20:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-45.htm" title="For even the Son of man came not to be ministered to, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.">Mark 10:45</a>).—<span class="greekheb">διὰ τοῦ αἵματος αὐτοῦ</span>: <span class="ital">through His blood</span>. Christ’s “blood,” therefore, is that by which the redemption is effected—the price (<span class="greekheb">τιμή</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-20.htm" title="For you are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.">1 Corinthians 6:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-23.htm" title="You are bought with a price; be not you the servants of men.">1 Corinthians 7:23</a>) of the deliverance, the “ransom” that had to be paid for it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-28.htm" title="Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered to, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.">Matthew 20:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-45.htm" title="For even the Son of man came not to be ministered to, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.">Mark 10:45</a>). The same idea appears in the teaching both of Peter and of John (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-18.htm" title="For as much as you know that you were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers;">1 Peter 1:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-9.htm" title="And they sung a new song, saying, You are worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for you were slain, and have redeemed us to God by your blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation;">Revelation 5:9</a>). The term occurs repeatedly in the NT, and in various forms—<span class="greekheb">τὸ αἷμα τοῦ Χριστοῦ</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-16.htm" title="The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?

What is its import? It means more than the <span class="ital">death</span> of Christ. It means that death in a particular aspect—as a sacrifice, a death having a definite efficacy. It is a <span class="ital">sacrificial</span> term, based on the use of the blood of victims, offered under the OT Law, for purposes of purification and expiation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/17-11.htm" title="For the life of the flesh is in the blood: and I have given it to you on the altar to make an atonement for your souls: for it is the blood that makes an atonement for the soul.">Leviticus 17:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-7.htm" title="But into the second went the high priest alone once every year, not without blood, which he offered for himself, and for the errors of the people:">Hebrews 9:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-12.htm" title="Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us.">Hebrews 9:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/9-18.htm" title="Whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without blood....">Hebrews 9:18-22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-25.htm" title="Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest enters into the holy place every year with blood of others;">Hebrews 9:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-4.htm" title="For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins.">Hebrews 10:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-28.htm" title="Through faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of blood, lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them.">Hebrews 11:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-11.htm" title="For the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin, are burned without the camp.">Hebrews 13:11</a>). It looks back also to Christ’s own words in the institution of the Supper (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-28.htm" title="For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.">Matthew 26:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/14-29.htm" title="But Peter said to him, Although all shall be offended, yet will not I.">Mark 14:29</a>), and denotes the ratification of a new relation between God and men by a new covenant sacrifice. It is used with reference to the purchase of the Church (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-28.htm" title="Take heed therefore to yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost has made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he has purchased with his own blood.">Acts 20:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-9.htm" title="And they sung a new song, saying, You are worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for you were slain, and have redeemed us to God by your blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation;">Revelation 5:9</a>), the grace of access to God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-19.htm" title="Having therefore, brothers, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus,">Hebrews 10:19</a>), the admission of the Gentiles on equal terms with the Jews (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-13.htm" title="But now in Christ Jesus you who sometimes were far off are made near by the blood of Christ.">Ephesians 2:13</a>), the reconciliation of all things to God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-20.htm" title=" And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things to himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven.">Colossians 1:20</a>); but also and most definitely to the changed condition of sinful men, and that most frequently on the objective side, as a new relation. As in the Levitical system there was a purificatory use of blood in the case of certain matters of uncleanness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/14-5.htm" title="And the priest shall command that one of the birds be killed in an earthen vessel over running water:">Leviticus 14:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/14-50.htm" title="And he shall kill the one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water:">Leviticus 14:50</a>), so in the NT the “blood” of Christ is used with reference to the ethical power of Christ’s death in purifying or in overcoming (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-19.htm" title="But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot:">1 Peter 1:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-7.htm" title="But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleans us from all sin.">1 John 1:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-11.htm" title="And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives to the death.">Revelation 12:11</a>). But its special use is with reference to justification (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-9.htm" title="And they sung a new song, saying, You are worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for you were slain, and have redeemed us to God by your blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation;">Revelation 5:9</a>), the position of non-condemnation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-24.htm" title="And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaks better things that that of Abel.">Hebrews 12:24</a>), the cleansing of the conscience (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-14.htm" title="How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?">Hebrews 9:14</a>), the making of peace between God and the world (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-20.htm" title=" And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things to himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven.">Colossians 1:20</a>), the manifestation of the righteousness of God in the passing over of sins (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-25.htm" title="Whom God has set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;">Romans 3:25</a>), the remission of sins (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-22.htm" title="And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.">Hebrews 9:22</a>). Its primary idea, as is shown by usage and by OT analogy, is not that of renewing power or moral effect, but that of expiation, the removal of guilt, the restoration of broken relations with God. The important passage indeed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/17-11.htm" title="For the life of the flesh is in the blood: and I have given it to you on the altar to make an atonement for your souls: for it is the blood that makes an atonement for the soul.">Leviticus 17:11</a>, which speaks of the “blood” as reserved by Jehovah for the altar, for the purpose of “covering” sin or making “atonement” for it, and declares that the atonement is made by the blood by reason of “the <span class="ital">life</span> of the flesh” that is in it, has been held by not a few (including Bähr and other distinguished scholars) to express only the idea of self-surrender. On this ground the piacular efficacy of the OT sacrifices, and, therefore, of the sacrifice of Christ, has been denied. But the “covering” of sin or making “atonement” for it by sacrifice, is in many passages of the OT definitely connected with the <span class="ital">forgiveness</span> of sin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-26.htm" title="And he shall burn all his fat on the altar, as the fat of the sacrifice of peace offerings: and the priest shall make an atonement for him as concerning his sin, and it shall be forgiven him.">Leviticus 4:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-18.htm" title="And he shall bring a ram without blemish out of the flock, with your estimation, for a trespass offering, to the priest: and the priest shall make an atonement for him concerning his ignorance wherein he erred and knew it not, and it shall be forgiven him.">Leviticus 5:18</a>, etc.); the passage in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/17-11.htm" title="For the life of the flesh is in the blood: and I have given it to you on the altar to make an atonement for your souls: for it is the blood that makes an atonement for the soul.">Leviticus 17:11</a> embodies the idea that “life” is the offering by which the transgressor “covers” his sin or finds forgiveness for it; and in passages like the present it is this kind of efficacy that is definitely ascribed to the “blood” of Christ.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[26] Codex Sinaiticus (sæc. iv.), now at St. Petersburg, published in facsimile type by its discoverer, Tischendorf, in 1862.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[27] Codex Claromontanus (sæc. vi.), a Græco-Latin MS. at Paris, edited by Tischendorf in 1852.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[28] Codex Vaticanus (sæc. iv.), published in photographic facsimile in 1889 under the care of the Abbate Cozza-Luzi.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[29] Corrections of א introduced by a scribe of the seventh century.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[30] Corrections of א introduced by a scribe of the seventh century.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[31] Codex Alexandrinus (sæc. v.), at the British Museum, published in photographic facsimile by Sir E.

Thus the phrase in question is interpreted as setting forth Christ’s <span class="ital">life</span> in two distinct aspects, namely, as <span class="ital">laid down</span> in the act of dying and as <span class="ital">liberated</span> by the same act and made <span class="ital">available</span> for us, so that we are saved by having it communicated to us.

But neither in the present paragraph nor in any other Pauline passage is there anything to bear this out.
