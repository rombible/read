(See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/1-8.htm" title="First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world.">Romans 1:8-9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/philippians/1-3.htm" title="I thank my God on every remembrance of you,">Philippians 1:3-4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/colossians/1-3.htm" title=" We give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you,">Colossians 1:3-4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_thessalonians/1-2.htm" title="We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers;">1Thessalonians 1:2-3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-3.htm" title="I thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers with pure conscience, that without ceasing I have remembrance of you in my prayers night and day;">2Timothy 1:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-4.htm" title="I thank my God, making mention of you always in my prayers,">Philemon 1:4</a>.) In the Galatian Epistle the omission of both is characteristic; in the two Epistles to the Corinthians thanksgiving alone is explicit, though prayer may be implied. But the proportion of the two elements varies. Here the thanksgiving has already been offered, although in the widest generality. Accordingly all that follows is prayer. In the parallel Colossian Epistle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/colossians/1-3.htm" title=" We give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you,">Colossians 1:3-13</a>), which has no corresponding preface of thanksgiving, both elements are co-ordinate, with perhaps a slight predominance of thanksgiving.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:15-23 God has laid up spiritual blessings for us in his Son the Lord Jesus; but requires us to draw them out and fetch them in by prayer. Even the best Christians need to be prayed for: and while we hear of the welfare of Christian friends, we should pray for them. Even true believers greatly want heavenly wisdom. Are not the best of us unwilling to come under God's yoke, though there is no other way to find rest for the soul? Do we not for a little pleasure often part with our peace? And if we dispute less, and prayed more with and for each other, we should daily see more and more what is the hope of our calling, and the riches of the Divine glory in this inheritance. It is desirable to feel the mighty power of Divine grace, beginning and carrying on the work of faith in our souls. But it is difficult to bring a soul to believe fully in Christ, and to venture its all, and the hope of eternal life, upon his righteousness. Nothing less than Almighty power will work this in us. Here is signified that it is Christ the Saviour, who supplies all the necessities of those who trust in him, and gives them all blessings in the richest abundance. And by being partakers of Christ himself, we come to be filled with the fulness of grace and glory in him. How then do those forget themselves who seek for righteousness out of him! This teaches us to come to Christ. And did we know what we are called to, and what we might find in him, surely we should come and be suitors to him. When feeling our weakness and the power of our enemies, we most perceive the greatness of that mighty power which effects the conversion of the believer, and is engaged to perfect his salvation. Surely this will constrain us by love to live to our Redeemer's glory.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ephesians/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Cease not to give thanks for you - In the prosperity of the church at Ephesus he could not but feel the deepest interest, and their welfare he never forgot.<p>Making mention of you in my prayers - Paul was far distant from them, and expected to see them no more.

This <span class="greekheb">μνείαν ποιούμενος κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., however, is not superfluous, and after <span class="greekheb">εὐχαρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὑπὲρ ὑμ</span>. self-evident; but it serves, through the close joining on to it of the following <span class="greekheb">ἵνα κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">λ</span>.

See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-10.htm" title="Making request, if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come to you.">Romans 1:10</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/ephesians/1.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-16.htm" title="Cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers;">Ephesians 1:16</a>. <span class="greekheb">οὐ παύομαι εὐχαριστῶν ὑπὲρ ὑμῶν</span>: <span class="ital">cease not to give thanks for you</span>. The <span class="greekheb">παύομαι</span> is most naturally connected with the nearer participle. There is no reason why the remoter participle should be made the leading term, as some construe it, rendering it so—“I cease not, while giving thanks for you, to make mention,” etc. (Abbott). The verb <span class="greekheb">εὐχαριστεῖν</span>, which is used in later Greek both in the sense of <span class="ital">feeling thankful</span> and in that of <span class="ital">giving thanks</span>, occurs in none of the NT Epistles except in that bearing Paul’s name. In these it is found some twenty-six times. It also appears once in Revelation, twice in Acts, and more frequently in the Gospels.—<span class="greekheb">μνείαν ὑμῶν ποιούμενος</span>: <span class="ital">making mention of you</span>. Documentary evidence is against the insertion of <span class="greekheb">ὑμῶν</span>. Though it is supported by considerable authorities ([88] [89] [90] [91], Vulg., Syr., Boh., Orig., etc.), it has no place in [92] [93] [94] [95]1, etc., and is omitted by LTTrWH and the Revisers. The subject of the <span class="greekheb">μνεία</span>, therefore, must be understood. It may be <span class="greekheb">ὑμῶν</span>, or it may rather be the preceding <span class="greekheb">πίστιν</span> and <span class="greekheb">ἀγάπην</span>. In the phrase <span class="greekheb">μνείαν ποιεῖσθαι</span> the noun seems to have the sense of <span class="ital">mention</span>. In other connections it has the sense of <span class="ital">mindfulness</span> (<span class="greekheb">μνείαν ἔχειν τινός</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-6.htm" title="But now when Timotheus came from you to us, and brought us good tidings of your faith and charity, and that you have good remembrance of us always, desiring greatly to see us, as we also to see you:">1 Thessalonians 3:6</a>) or that of <span class="ital">remembrance</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-3.htm" title="I thank my God on every remembrance of you,">Php 1:3</a>).—<span class="greekheb">ἐπὶ τῶν προσευχῶν μου</span>: in <span class="ital">my prayers</span>, On <span class="greekheb">ἐπί</span> as here = <span class="ital">in</span> see Blass, <span class="ital">Gram. of N. T. Greek</span>, p. 137; Win.-Moult., p. 470; Bernh., <span class="ital">Synt.</span>, p. 246. The <span class="ital">local</span> reference proper to <span class="greekheb">ἐπί</span> (as the preposition answering the question Where?), however, is not wholly sunk in the <span class="ital">temporal</span> sense. See Ell. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-2.htm" title="We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers;">1 Thessalonians 1:2</a>. Winer takes it to express the idea of something <span class="ital">attaching</span> itself to something else. The word for prayer used here is one of frequent occurrence in the NT, sometimes joined with <span class="greekheb">δέησις</span> (<span class="ital">e.g.</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-18.htm" title="Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints;">Ephesians 6:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-6.htm" title="Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God.">Php 4:6</a>, etc.), and sometimes with <span class="greekheb">ἔντευξις</span> as well (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-1.htm" title="I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men;">1 Timothy 2:1</a>). The most general term is <span class="greekheb">προσευχή</span> = <span class="ital">precatio</span>, and that term is not used but of prayer to <span class="ital">God</span>. <span class="greekheb">Δέησις</span>, which can be used also of addresses to men, has the more definite sense of <span class="ital">petitio, rogatio</span>; while <span class="greekheb">ἔντευξις</span>, which means a <span class="ital">falling in with, conference, conversation</span>, and goes beyond the idea of <span class="ital">intercession</span> (as our AV renders it), expresses prayer as the converse of the soul with God, with the notion of urgency and filial confidence.

The phrase implies the <span class="ital">expression</span> of individual remembrance. It might be literally “by name,” or not. How much of the Apostle’s work for his converts consisted in the holy labour of special intercessory prayer, with thanksgiving! In his Roman lodging this was the case, perhaps, even more than ever.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The recorded prayers of St Paul form in themselves one of the richest of Scripture studies. Most observable in them is their almost invariable intercessory direction. He thinks of others, not of self, upon his knees.—On that which now follows Bengel remarks, “<span class="ital">Argumentum precum pro veris Christianis</span>,” “heads of prayer for true Christians.”<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/ephesians/1.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-16.htm" title="Cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers;">Ephesians 1:16</a>. <span class="greekheb">Οὐ παύομαι</span>, <span class="ital">I do not cease</span>) Paul made mention of all the churches in his prayers; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-9.htm" title=" For this cause we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that you might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding;">Colossians 1:9</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Cease not to give thanks for you.</span> This clause expresses the continuation of a former action - the giving thanks for them had begun before the hearing of their faith and love - from the days, in short, of his personal intercourse. We notice as a remarkable feature of Paul's personal religion, as well as his pastoral care, the frequency of his thanksgiving, indicating the prevalence in him of a bright, joyous state of mind, and tending to increase and perpetuate the same. Constantly to recognize God's goodness in the past begets a larger expectation of it in the future. <span class="cmt_word">Making mention of you in my prayers.</span> This seems additional to his giving thanks. "Prayers" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>) refers more to supplication and entreaty. While thankful for them, his heart was not satisfied regarding them; he wished them to forget the things behind, and reach forth to those before. The apostle's prayers for his spiritual charge are always remarkable. They are very short, but wonderfully deep and comprehensive; very rich and sublime in aspiration; powerful in their pleas, whether expressed or implied; and exhaustive in the range of blessings which they implore. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/ephesians/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Making mention, etc.<p>As I make mention.
