Reason can apprehend, when revealed, that which it cannot discover; but seldom or never can it comprehend it perfectly.

Also it signifies a plan formed for the management of any sort of business. In this passage it signifies the plan which God had formed for accomplishing the salvation of believers.” — Macknight. <span class="ital">He might gather together in one — </span>Greek, <span class="greekheb">ανακεφαλαιωσασθαι</span>, he might recapitulate, or <span class="ital">unite again under one head; all things in Christ — </span>All persons, whether angels or men, whether living or dead, with all things that are connected with or concern them; <span class="ital">both in heaven and on earth </span>— This is considered by some as a Jewish phrase, to express the whole world; and Locke thinks it may be equivalent to <span class="ital">Jews and Gentiles, </span>which is the meaning adopted also by Macknight, who says, “According to this interpretation, <span class="ital">the gathering of all things under Christ, </span>means both the forming of believing Jews and Gentiles into one catholic church, and the bringing of them both into the heavenly country through the mediation of Christ.” Beza, by <span class="ital">things in heaven, </span>understands the saints in heaven, who died before Christ came into the world, and who are not to be made perfect till the resurrection. But the interpretation adopted by Whitby, Chandler, Doddridge, Wesley, and many others, seems more probable, namely, that by <span class="ital">things in heaven, </span>both in this passage and <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-20.htm" title=" And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things to himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven.">Colossians 1:20</a>, <span class="ital">the angelical hosts </span>are to be understood; and by <span class="ital">things on earth, believers of all nations, </span>who, with the angels, shall at length be joined in one great society, or church, for the purpose of worshipping God through all eternity, agreeably to <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-22.htm" title="But you are come to mount Sion, and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels,">Hebrews 12:22</a>. “Both angels and men were at first in sweet and harmonious subjection to the Son of God, the great Creator of both; but man having broken himself off from this society, the Son of man, by his humiliation and sufferings, recovers all who believe in him, and in his human nature presides over the kingdom to which, in the world of glory, they and his angels belong. This interpretation presents so noble a view, that no other will bear a comparison.” — Doddridge.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:9-14 Blessings were made known to believers, by the Lord's showing to them the mystery of his sovereign will, and the method of redemption and salvation. But these must have been for ever hidden from us, if God had not made them known by his written word, preached gospel, and Spirit of truth. Christ united the two differing parties, God and man, in his own person, and satisfied for that wrong which caused the separation. He wrought, by his Spirit, those graces of faith and love, whereby we are made one with God, and among ourselves. He dispenses all his blessings, according to his good pleasure. His Divine teaching led whom he pleased to see the glory of those truths, which others were left to blaspheme. What a gracious promise that is, which secures the gift of the Holy Ghost to those who ask him! The sanctifying and comforting influences of the Holy Spirit seal believers as the children of God, and heirs of heaven. These are the first-fruits of holy happiness. For this we were made, and for this we were redeemed; this is the great design of God in all that he has done for us; let all be ascribed unto the praise of his glory.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ephesians/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Having made known to us the mystery of his will - The word "mystery" (&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;  muste&#772;rion) means literally something into which one must be "initiated" before it is fully known (from &#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c9;  mueo&#772;, to initiate, to instruct); and then anything which is concealed or hidden. We commonly use the word to denote that which is above our comprehension or unintelligible. But this is never the meaning of the word in the New Testament. It means there some doctrine or fact which has been concealed, or which has not before been fully revealed, or which has been set forth only by figures and symbols. When the doctrine is made known, it may be as clear and plain as any other. Such was the doctrine that God meant to call the Gentiles, which was long concealed, at least in part, and which was not fully made known until the Saviour came, and which had been until that time "a mystery - a concealed truth" - though when it was revealed, there was nothing incomprehensible in it. Thus, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/1-26.htm">Colossians 1:26</a>, "The mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints." So it was in regard to the doctrine of election. It was a mystery until it was made known by the actual conversion of those whom God had chosen. So in regard to the incarnation of the Redeemer; the atonement; the whole plan of salvation. Over all these great points there was a veil thrown, and people did not understand them until God revealed them. When they were revealed, the mystery was removed, and men were able to see clearly the manifestation of the will of God.<p>Which he hath purposed in himself - Without foreign aid or counsel.

The word <span class="greekheb">μυστήριον</span>, which in classical Greek meant something <span class="ital">secret</span>, especially the secrets of religion communicated only to the initiated and by them to be kept untold, is used in the Apocryphal books of things hidden, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, the counsels of God (<a href="http://apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/2-22.htm" title="As for the mysteries of God, they knew them not: neither hoped they for the wages of righteousness, nor discerned a reward for blameless souls.">Wis 2:22</a>; <a href="http://apocrypha.org/judith/2-2.htm" title="So he called unto him all his officers, and all his nobles, and communicated with them his secret counsel, and concluded the afflicting of the whole earth out of his own mouth.">Jdt 2:2</a>), and in the NT occasionally of things not clear to the understanding (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-2.htm" title="And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.">1 Corinthians 13:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-2.htm" title="For he that speaks in an unknown tongue speaks not to men, but to God: for no man understands him; however, in the spirit he speaks mysteries.">1 Corinthians 14:2</a>), or of the mystic meaning of things—sayings, names, appearances (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-32.htm" title="This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church.">Ephesians 5:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-20.htm" title="The mystery of the seven stars which you saw in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches: and the seven candlesticks which you saw are the seven churches.">Revelation 1:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-5.htm" title="And on her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.">Revelation 17:5</a>). But its distinctive sense in the NT is that of something once hidden and now revealed, a secret now open. In this sense it is applied to the Divine plan of redemption as a whole (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-25.htm" title="Now to him that is of power to establish you according to my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery, which was kept secret since the world began,">Romans 16:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-7.htm" title="But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world to our glory:">1 Corinthians 2:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-19.htm" title="And for me, that utterance may be given to me, that I may open my mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of the gospel,">Ephesians 6:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-26.htm" title=" Even the mystery which has been hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints:">Colossians 1:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-9.htm" title="Holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.">1 Timothy 3:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-16.htm" title="And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached to the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.">1 Timothy 3:16</a>, etc.), or to particular things belonging to that Divine plan—the inclusion of the Gentiles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-25.htm" title="For I would not, brothers, that you should be ignorant of this mystery, lest you should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles be come in.">Romans 11:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-3.htm" title="How that by revelation he made known to me the mystery; (as I wrote before in few words,">Ephesians 3:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-9.htm" title="And to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning of the world has been hid in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ:">Ephesians 3:9</a>), the transformation of Christians alive on earth at Christ’s return (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-52.htm" title="In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.">1 Corinthians 15:52</a>), the union of Christ and the Church (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-32.htm" title="This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church.">Ephesians 5:32</a>). It does not convey the idea of something that we cannot take in or understand even when it is declared to us. It is peculiarly frequent in the kindred Epistles to the Ephesians and Colossians, ten out of the twenty-six or twenty-seven occurrences being found in them. Nor is it confined absolutely to the things of grace. Paul speaks also of the “mystery of lawlessness” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-7.htm" title="For the mystery of iniquity does already work: only he who now lets will let, until he be taken out of the way.">2 Thessalonians 2:7</a>). The redemption accomplished through Christ—this is the secret hidden for ages in the Divine Counsel and now revealed. This also is the truth, the disclosure of which to our understandings meant so large a gift of grace in the way of insight and spiritual discernment.—<span class="greekheb">κατὰ τὴν εὐδοκίαν αὐτοῦ</span>: <span class="ital">according to His good pleasure</span>. This is to be attached neither to the <span class="greekheb">μυστήριου τοῦ θελήματος αὐτοῦ</span>, which needs no further definition, nor to the following <span class="greekheb">προέθετο</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., but to the <span class="greekheb">γνωρίσας</span>, precisely as the previous <span class="greekheb">προορίσας</span> was declared to be <span class="greekheb">κατὰ τὴν εὐδοκίαν τοῦ θελήματος αὐτοῦ</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-5.htm" title="Having predestinated us to the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,">Ephesians 1:5</a>). The opening of this secret to us after the silence of ages had its ground and reason in nothing else than the gracious counsel or free purpose of God.—<span class="greekheb">ἣν προέθετο</span>: <span class="ital">which He purposed</span>. This verb <span class="greekheb">προτίθεμαι</span> occurs only thrice in the NT, and all three instances are in the Pauline Epistles: once of human purpose (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-13.htm" title="Now I would not have you ignorant, brothers, that oftentimes I purposed to come to you, (but was let till now,) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles.">Romans 1:13</a>), once of the Divine action (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-25.htm" title="Whom God has set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;">Romans 3:25</a>), and once (here) of the Divine purpose. The <span class="ital">eternal</span> purpose of God is in view, as the context shows. The <span class="greekheb">προ</span> in the compound verb, however, does not express the idea of the <span class="ital">pre-temporal</span>. It appears to have the local sense—<span class="ital">setting before oneself</span> and so <span class="ital">determining</span>.—<span class="greekheb">ἐν αὐτῷ</span>: <span class="ital">in Himself</span>. Some make it “in him,” that is, in <span class="ital">Christ</span> (Chrys., Luth., Bengel, Hofm., Light., Wycl., Vulg., etc.), and this would be quite in accordance with the subsequent statement of the eternal purpose as one which God “purposed in Christ Jesus the Lord” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-11.htm" title="According to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord:">Ephesians 3:11</a>). But God and His will are the subjects in view here, and the mention of <span class="ital">Christ</span> seems too remote for the <span class="greekheb">αὐτῷ</span> to refer naturally to Him. The purpose is God’s own free determination, originating in His own gracious mind. The reading <span class="greekheb">ἐν αὑτῷ</span> is adopted by Mey., Ell., etc., while <span class="greekheb">ἐν αὐτῷ</span> is given by Lachm., Tisch., WH, Harl., etc. The question whether the NT knows any other form than <span class="greekheb">ἑαυτοῦ</span> as the reflexive of the third person is still debated. It is urged (<span class="ital">e.g.</span>, by Bleek, Buttm., etc.) that the NT does not use <span class="greekheb">αὑτοῦ</span>, but only <span class="greekheb">ἑαυτοῦ</span> in most cases or at least the vast majority, on such grounds as these, <span class="ital">viz.</span>, that the MSS. have <span class="greekheb">ἀπό</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἐπί</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὑπό</span>, etc., and not <span class="greekheb">ἀφʼ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἐφʼ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὑφʼ</span>, before <span class="greekheb">αὐτοῦ</span>; that in the second person we find only <span class="greekheb">σεαυτοῦ</span>, not <span class="greekheb">σαυτοῦ</span>; and that the first and second personal pronouns are often used in the NT instead of the reflexive, though not when the pronoun is immediately dependent on the verb. Lightfoot concludes that “<span class="greekheb">αὐτοῦ</span>, etc., may be used for <span class="greekheb">ἑαυτοῦ</span>, etc., in almost every connection, except where it is the direct object of the verb” (see his note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-20.htm" title=" And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things to himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven.">Colossians 1:20</a>). On the other hand, Ell. is of opinion that the reflexive form is in place “where the attention is principally directed to the subject,” and the non-reflexive where it is “diverted by the importance of the details”. Winer, while admitting that in most passages <span class="greekheb">αὐτοῦ</span>, etc., would suffice, would write <span class="greekheb">αὑτοῦ</span>, etc., certainly in a few cases such as <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-21.htm" title="But by what means he now sees, we know not; or who has opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall speak for himself.">John 9:21</a> (<span class="greekheb">αὐτὸς περὶ αὑτοῦ λαλήσει</span>) and <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-25.htm" title="Whom God has set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;">Romans 3:25</a> (<span class="greekheb">ὃν προέθετο ὁ Θεὸς</span> … <span class="greekheb">εἰς ἔνδειξιν τῆς δικαιοσύνης αὑτοῦ</span>), and would prefer it also in such passages as <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/7-35.htm" title="And straightway his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spoke plain.">Mark 7:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-34.htm" title="For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.">Luke 12:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-15.htm" title="And it came to pass, that when he was returned, having received the kingdom, then he commanded these servants to be called to him, to whom he had given the money, that he might know how much every man had gained by trading.">Luke 19:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-14.htm" title="I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that there is nothing unclean of itself: but to him that esteems any thing to be unclean, to him it is unclean.">Romans 14:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-7.htm" title="And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that ascends out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them, and shall overcome them, and kill them.">Revelation 11:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-2.htm" title="And the beast which I saw was like to a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority.">Revelation 13:2</a>; as also here in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-9.htm" title="Having made known to us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he has purposed in himself:">Ephesians 1:9</a>. See Buttm., p. 111; Win.-Moult., p. 188; Bleek, <span class="ital">Heb.</span>, ii., p. 69.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/ephesians/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">9</span>. <span class="ital">Having made known</span>] An aorist participle. The time-reference is to the actual revelation of the Gospel. Cp. e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-21.htm" title="But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;">Romans 3:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/16-25.htm" title="Now to him that is of power to establish you according to my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery, which was kept secret since the world began,...">Romans 16:25-26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-10.htm" title="But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ, who has abolished death, and has brought life and immortality to light through the gospel:">2 Timothy 1:10</a>. And see last note.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">unto us</span>] the believing Church; as throughout this passage. No special reference to St Paul, or other Apostles, is intended. The “us” of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-9.htm" title="Having made known to us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he has purposed in himself:">Ephesians 1:9</a> must be identical with the “we” of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/1-11.htm" title="In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who works all things after the counsel of his own will:...">Ephesians 1:11-12</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the mystery</span>] I.e., as always in N. T., a truth undiscoverable except by revelation; never necessarily (as our popular use of the word may suggest) a thing unintelligible, or perplexing, <span class="ital">in itself</span>. In Scripture a “mystery” may be a fact which, when revealed, we cannot understand in detail, though we can know it and act upon it; such a fact as that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-51.htm" title="Behold, I show you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,">1 Corinthians 15:51</a>, where we have it revealed that an inconceivable change will take place, at the last day, in the bodily condition of the then living saints; a change quite beyond the inferences of reason and <span class="ital">also</span> beyond the reach of imagination. Or it may be, as here, something much more within our understanding. But in both cases it is a thing only to be known when revealed. What this “mystery” is will be seen just below.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">which he had purposed in himself</span>] Better, <span class="bld">which He purposed in Him</span>, i.e. in the Son. The “purpose” of the Father was “in the Son,” inasmuch as it was to take effect through the Son, incarnate, sacrificed, and glorified; and further, as it concerned a Church which was to be incorporated “into Christ.” The whole context illustrates this phrase. For the “purpose,” cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-11.htm" title="In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who works all things after the counsel of his own will:">Ephesians 1:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-28.htm" title="And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.">Romans 8:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-11.htm" title="(For the children being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that calls;)">Romans 9:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-9.htm" title="Who has saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began,">2 Timothy 1:9</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/ephesians/1.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-9.htm" title="Having made known to us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he has purposed in himself:">Ephesians 1:9</a>. <span class="greekheb">Γνωρίσας</span>, <span class="ital">having made known</span>) This word depends on <span class="ital">hath abounded</span>.
