It refers, of course, entirely to our Lord’s nature as the true Son of Man. In that respect God is in the full sense (which in us is interrupted by sin) His God, in whom He lived and had His being. In proportion as we are conformed to His likeness, “God is our God for ever and ever.”<p><span class= "bld">The Father of glory.</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">of the glory.</span> This phrase is again unique. We have, indeed, such phrases as “Father of Mercies” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-3.htm" title="Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort;">2Corinthians 1:3</a>), “Father of Lights” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-17.htm" title="Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and comes down from the Father of lights, with whom is no ficklenss, neither shadow of turning.">James 1:17</a>); and, on the other hand, “the King of Glory” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/28-5.htm" title="Because they regard not the works of the LORD, nor the operation of his hands, he shall destroy them, and not build them up.">Psalm 28:5</a>), “the God of Glory” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-2.htm" title="And he said, Men, brothers, and fathers, listen; The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelled in Charran,">Acts 7:2</a>), “the Lord of Glory” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-8.htm" title="Which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.">1Corinthians 2:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-1.htm" title="My brothers, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect of persons.">James 2:1</a>). In all these last instances “the glory” seems certainly to be the <span class= "ital">Shechinah</span> of God’s manifested presence, and in all cases but one is ascribed to our Lord. But “the Father of the glory,” seems a phrase different from all these. I cannot help connecting it with the missing element in the preceding clause, and believing (with some old interpreters), in spite of the strangeness of expression, that God is here called “the Father of the glory” of the incarnate Deity in Jesus Christ (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-14.htm" title="And the Word was made flesh, and dwelled among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.">John 1:14</a>), called in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-6.htm" title="For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, has shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.">2Corinthians 4:6</a>, “the glory of God in the face (or <span class= "ital">person</span>) of Jesus Christ.” (See <span class= "ital">Excursus A to St. John’s Gospel: On the Doctrine of the Word;</span> dealing with the identification of “the Word” with the Shechinah by the Jewish interpreters). The prayer which follows connects the knowledge of the glory of our inheritance with the exaltation of our Lord in glory.<p><span class= "bld">The knowledge of him.</span>—The word here rendered “knowledge” signifies “perfect and thorough knowledge;” and the verb corresponding to it is used distinctively in this sense in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-4.htm" title="That you might know the certainty of those things, wherein you have been instructed.">Luke 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-12.htm" title="For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.">1Corinthians 13:12</a>. It is employed by St. Paul more especially in his later Epistles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-13.htm" title="Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ:">Ephesians 4:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-9.htm" title="And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment;">Philippians 1:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/colossians/1-9.htm" title=" For this cause we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that you might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding;">Colossians 1:9-10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-2.htm" title=" That their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and to all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the acknowledgment of the mystery of God, and of the Father, and of Christ;">Colossians 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-10.htm" title=" And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him:">Colossians 3:10</a>), dealing as they do with the deeper things of God, and assuming more of a contemplative tone. It is represented here as coming from distinct “revelation.”<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:15-23 God has laid up spiritual blessings for us in his Son the Lord Jesus; but requires us to draw them out and fetch them in by prayer. Even the best Christians need to be prayed for: and while we hear of the welfare of Christian friends, we should pray for them. Even true believers greatly want heavenly wisdom. Are not the best of us unwilling to come under God's yoke, though there is no other way to find rest for the soul? Do we not for a little pleasure often part with our peace? And if we dispute less, and prayed more with and for each other, we should daily see more and more what is the hope of our calling, and the riches of the Divine glory in this inheritance. It is desirable to feel the mighty power of Divine grace, beginning and carrying on the work of faith in our souls. But it is difficult to bring a soul to believe fully in Christ, and to venture its all, and the hope of eternal life, upon his righteousness. Nothing less than Almighty power will work this in us. Here is signified that it is Christ the Saviour, who supplies all the necessities of those who trust in him, and gives them all blessings in the richest abundance. And by being partakers of Christ himself, we come to be filled with the fulness of grace and glory in him. How then do those forget themselves who seek for righteousness out of him! This teaches us to come to Christ. And did we know what we are called to, and what we might find in him, surely we should come and be suitors to him. When feeling our weakness and the power of our enemies, we most perceive the greatness of that mighty power which effects the conversion of the believer, and is engaged to perfect his salvation. Surely this will constrain us by love to live to our Redeemer's glory.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ephesians/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ - The God who has sent the Lord Jesus into the world, and appointed him as the Mediator between himself and man. The particular reason why Paul here speaks of him as "the God of the Lord Jesus" is, that he prays that they might be further acquainted with the Redeemer, and be enlightened in regard to the great work which he came to do.<p>The Father of glory - The glorious Father, that is, the Father who is worthy to be praised and honored.<p>May give unto you the Spirit of wisdom - May make you wise to understand the great doctrines of the religion of the Redeemer.<p>And revelation - That is, revealing to you more and more of the character of the Redeemer, and of the nature and results of his work. It is probable here that by the word "Spirit" the apostle refers to the Holy Spirit as the Author of all wisdom, and the Revealer of all truth. His prayer is, that God would grant to them the Holy Spirit to make them wise, and to reveal his will to them.<p>In the knowledge of him - Margin, "for the acknowledgment." That is, in order that you may more fully acknowledge him, or know him more intimately and thoroughly. They had already made high attainments <a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-15.htm">Ephesians 1:15</a>, but Paul felt that they might make still higher; and the idea here is, that however far Christians may have advanced in knowledge and in love, there is an unfathomed depth of knowledge which they may still explore, and which they should be exhorted still to attempt to fathom. How far was Paul from supposing that the Ephesians had attained to perfection! <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ephesians/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17.

The Father of that infinite glory which shines in the face of Christ, who is "the glory" (the true Shekinah); through whom also "the glory of the inheritance" (Eph 1:18) shall be ours (Joh 17:24; 2Co 3:7-4:6).<p>the spirit of wisdom&#8212;whose attribute is infinite wisdom and who works wisdom in believers (Isa 11:2).<p>and revelation&#8212;whose function it is to reveal to believers spiritual mysteries (Joh 16:14, 15; 1Co 2:10).<p>in the knowledge&#8212;rather, as Greek (see on [2362]1Co 13:12), "in the full knowledge of Him," namely, God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ephesians/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ; </span> he is the God of Christ not according to Christ’s Divine nature, but his human, and as Mediator, in which respect he was subject to the Father. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The Father of glory; </span> the most glorious Father, and the Author of all glory and glorious things, and to whom all glory is due. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">May give unto you the spirit of wisdom; </span> a greater measure (for some they already had) of faith, <span class="ital">{as <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-8.htm" title="Wherein he has abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence;">Ephesians 1:8</a></span>, where it is called wisdom</span>} or of the knowledge of the things of God, whereof the Spirit is the Author.

It is to be admitted, however, that in NT Greek the proper <span class="ital">telic</span> sense of <span class="greekheb">ἵνα</span> is seen in the process of <span class="ital">weakening</span> and passing over into the force of <span class="greekheb">ἵνα</span> as the sign of the inf. in modern Greek. Yet, even when expressing simple <span class="ital">result</span> or <span class="ital">event</span>, it has behind it the Hebrew idea of events as the results of Divine purpose <span class="ital">cf.</span> Blass, <span class="ital">Gram. of N.T.

It is most usual for Paul to speak of God as the <span class="ital">Father</span> of our Lord Jesus Christ or as His <span class="ital">God and Father</span>. Here he speaks simply of “the God of our Lord Jesus Christ”. The designation, though misunderstood and misapplied by the Arians and their successors in modern times, is entirely consistent with Christ’s own words (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-46.htm" title="And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?">Matthew 27:46</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-17.htm" title="Jesus said to her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brothers, and say to them, I ascend to my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God.">John 20:17</a>) and with the highest view of His Person. In the Eternal Godhead the Son has His life from the Father, the One Fount of Deity, and is subordinate in the sense in which <span class="ital">son</span> is subordinate to <span class="ital">father</span>, while He has the same Divine being. In the ministry of redemption our Lord, while the Son of the Eternal Father, is the Christ of God, God being revealed in Him, <span class="ital">sending</span> Him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-4.htm" title="But when the fullness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law,">Galatians 4:4</a>), <span class="ital">exalting</span> Him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-9.htm" title="Why God also has highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name:">Php 2:9</a>), receiving back the kingdom from Him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-24.htm" title="Then comes the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power.">1 Corinthians 15:24</a>). In respect of His mission, His mediation, His official work and relations, He has God as <span class="ital">His</span> God, whose commission He bears and whose redeeming purpose He is to fulfil.—<span class="greekheb">ὁ πατὴρ τῆς δόξης</span>: <span class="ital">the Father of glory</span>. This is not to be taken in the reduced sense of “the glorious Father”. On the other hand it is not to be dealt with as if the <span class="greekheb">δόξα</span> referred to Christ’s <span class="ital">divinity</span>, as in the exigencies of the controversy with Arian views some were driven to interpret it, arguing that the one phrase, “the God of our Lord Jesus Christ,” applied to His human nature and the other, “the Father of the glory,” to His divine nature (Athan., Greg. Naz.). Nor yet, again, is <span class="greekheb">δόξα</span> to be regarded as referring to Christ’s glorified humanity (Stier). Taking the <span class="greekheb">δόξης</span> in its proper sense and with the full force of the gen. case, some give the <span class="greekheb">πατήρ</span> the sense of <span class="ital">author</span> or <span class="ital">maker</span>, understanding God to be designated as the Source of glory (Erasm., Grot., Olsh., etc.). For this some appeal to such instances as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-28.htm" title="Has the rain a father? or who has begotten the drops of dew?">Job 38:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-17.htm" title="Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and comes down from the Father of lights, with whom is no ficklenss, neither shadow of turning.">Jam 1:17</a>. But that is at the best a rare sense of <span class="greekheb">πατήρ</span> and one otherwise unknown to Paul. More is to be said in favour of the idea that the gen. designates God as the Father who <span class="ital">gives</span> glory, the glory bestowed on Christ Himself (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-13.htm" title="The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified his Son Jesus; whom you delivered up, and denied him in the presence of Pilate, when he was determined to let him go.">Acts 3:13</a>) no less than that reserved for Christians. It is best, however, to take it as the gen. of <span class="ital">characteristic quality</span>—the Father to whom glory belongs (Mey., Ell., etc.); <span class="ital">cf.</span> the same designation in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/29-3.htm" title="The voice of the LORD is on the waters: the God of glory thunders: the LORD is on many waters.">Psalm 29:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-2.htm" title="And he said, Men, brothers, and fathers, listen; The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelled in Charran,">Acts 7:2</a>; also “the King of glory,” <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/24-7.htm" title="Lift up your heads, O you gates; and be you lift up, you everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in.">Psalm 24:7</a>; “the Lord of glory,” <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-8.htm" title="Which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.">1 Corinthians 2:8</a>; “the cherubims of glory,” <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-5.htm" title="And over it the cherubim of glory shadowing the mercy seat; of which we cannot now speak particularly.">Hebrews 9:5</a>, etc. The appropriateness of the title here lies in the preceding definition of the final end of God’s counsel and grace—<span class="greekheb">εἰς ἔπαινον τῆς δόξης αὐτοῦ</span>.—<span class="greekheb">δῴη ὑμῖν</span>: <span class="ital">may give unto you</span>. Lachm., Fritzsche (<span class="ital">Rom.</span>, iii. 230) and Haupt (who refers to the confirmation furnished recently by two inscriptions of the second century given in Dittenb., <span class="ital">Syll.</span>, 46217, 4669) give the Ionic conj. <span class="greekheb">δώῃ</span>; WH give <span class="greekheb">δώῃ</span> <span class="ital">vel</span> <span class="greekheb">δῷ</span> in the margin, but <span class="greekheb">δῴη</span> in the text. The latter form is to be preferred, although opinion is still divided to some extent on the conj. and opt. forms. Blass, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, takes the <span class="greekheb">δώῃ</span> in the present passage to be really a conj. and to be best represented by the <span class="greekheb">δῷ</span> of Cod. B. He is inclined to regard the forms <span class="greekheb">δοῖ</span>, <span class="greekheb">δώῃ</span> as both conj. and opt. (<span class="ital">Gram. of N.T. Greek</span>, pp. 49, 211). As in the NT <span class="greekheb">ἵνα</span> in the vast majority of cases is followed by the conj. or the fut. indic. even after past tenses, it would be most natural to accept the conj. form here. But this Ionic form of the conj. appears to be strange to the NT and to be “without analogies in later Greek” (Butt., <span class="ital">Gram. of N.T. Greek</span>, p. 46). On the other hand, the form <span class="greekheb">δῴη</span> seems to be recognised as a later Greek equivalent to <span class="greekheb">δοίη</span>, and Winer accepts it as an opt. pres. in NT Greek, pointing to such passages as <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-5.htm" title="Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be like minded one toward another according to Christ Jesus:">Romans 15:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-16.htm" title="The Lord give mercy to the house of Onesiphorus; for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain:">2 Timothy 1:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-18.htm" title="The Lord grant to him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day: and in how many things he ministered to me at Ephesus, you know very well.">2 Timothy 1:18</a> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-7.htm" title="That in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus.">Ephesians 2:7</a>); <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-16.htm" title="You have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that you should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that whatever you shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.">John 15:16</a>, as well as <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-17.htm" title="That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him:">Ephesians 1:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-16.htm" title="That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man;">Ephesians 3:16</a>, and the comp. <span class="greekheb">ἀποδῴη</span> of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-14.htm" title="Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord reward him according to his works:">2 Timothy 4:14</a> (Win.-Moult, <span class="ital">Gram.</span>, p. 94.—<span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα σοφίας καὶ ἀποκαλύψεως</span>: <span class="ital">the Spirit of wisdom and revelation</span>. The question here is whether the <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span> is to be understood in the subjective sense of our <span class="ital">spirit</span>, or in the objective sense of the Holy Spirit. The former view is adopted by Chrys., Thdrt., Rückert, De Wette, Bleek, and more recently by Abbott and the Revisers, the RV rendering being “a spirit of wisdom and revelation”. This is urged on the analogy of such occurrences as <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-15.htm" title="For you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but you have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.">Romans 8:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-8.htm" title="(According as it is written, God has given them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear;) to this day.">Romans 11:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-1.htm" title="Brothers, if a man be overtaken in a fault, you which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering yourself, lest you also be tempted.">Galatians 6:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-7.htm" title="For God has not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.">2 Timothy 1:7</a>. But there is much against this. As Meyer points out, it is doubtful whether in the NT there is any case in which, when the <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span> is spoken of as <span class="ital">given</span>, it is not the <span class="ital">objective</span> <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span>. But apart from this, the matter in view is what the Ephesians were themselves to be, not what they were to do for others, and although it is easy enough to suit the subjective view of the <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα σοφίας</span> (“a wise spirit”) to this, the difficulty is to adjust to this the subjective view of the <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα ἀποκάλυψεως</span>. The fatal objection, indeed, to the interpretation in question lies in the sense of the <span class="greekheb">ἀποκάλυψις</span>, which has the stated meaning not of <span class="ital">understanding</span> mysteries but of <span class="ital">disclosing</span> them; and the tenor of the paragraph makes it impossible to suppose that in the one case, that of the <span class="greekheb">σοφία</span>, Paul had in view a gift that was to make themselves wise, and in the other, the <span class="greekheb">ἀποκάλυψις</span>, a gift that was to render them capable of disclosing mysteries to others. How difficult it is to give <span class="greekheb">ἀποκάλυψις</span> its proper sense on the subjective view appears from the renderings proposed, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, De Wette’s, Rückert’s, or Abbott’s. The first makes it = “the quality of mind which consists in wisdom (mediate knowledge) and revelation (susceptibility for the immediate knowledge of divine truth)”; the second takes it as = “a wise heart and open for His revelation”; the third gives “a spirit of wisdom,” but leaves the rest unattempted. But <span class="greekheb">ἀποκάλυψις</span> is not a <span class="ital">susceptibility</span> for knowledge, nor a <span class="ital">mind open</span> to revelation, nor anything like that. It is necessary, therefore, to take <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span> as = the <span class="ital">Holy Spirit</span>, with Mey., Ell., Haupt. and most. The fact that the phrase is <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span> and not <span class="greekheb">τὸ πνεῦμα</span> is no objection to that. The attempts made by Middleton, Harless, and others to make out an established distinction between the two forms, the one referring regularly to the personal Spirit of God and the other to the indwelling influence of the Spirit or the spirit of the believers as ruled by the Holy Spirit, cannot be regarded as successful; the terms <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span>, <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα ἅγιον</span>, <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα Θεοῦ</span> being free to drop the article as proper names or terms of understood meaning. But what is the particular idea then in each of the two words <span class="greekheb">σοφία</span> and <span class="greekheb">ἀποκάλυψις</span>? It cannot be that the latter refers specifically to the <span class="greekheb">χάρισμα</span> of prophecy (so Olsh., etc.). For that is presented as a gift bestowed only on <span class="ital">some</span>, whereas the prayer here contemplates gifts for <span class="ital">all</span> those addressed, and there is nothing to indicate that a gift for the time being only is in view. Nor can it well be that the second noun expresses the means by which the gift intimated by the first noun was to take effect,—the gift of revelation bringing about the gift of wisdom (Harl.); for we should expect the order in that case to be reversed. The distinction between the terms is rather that of the gift of spiritual understanding generally and the gift of special revelations in particular, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-10.htm" title="But God has revealed them to us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searches all things, yes, the deep things of God.">1 Corinthians 2:10</a>; and so far the second is the higher idea. What Paul prays for on behalf of these Ephesian converts is that God might continue to bestow upon them the gift of His Holy Spirit already imparted to them, and that to the effect both of making them wise to understand the things of His grace and of disclosing to them more of the mysteries of His kingdom.—<span class="greekheb">ἐν ἐπιγνώσει αὐτοῦ</span>: <span class="ital">in the knowledge of him</span>. The <span class="greekheb">αὐτοῦ</span> refers to <span class="ital">God</span>, as the context shows, not to <span class="ital">Christ</span>. The term <span class="greekheb">ἐπίγνωσις</span> occurs with special frequency in the Epistles of the Captivity and in 2 Peter with reference to the knowledge of <span class="ital">God</span> or of <span class="ital">Christ</span>, as in the Pastoral Epistles and Hebrews it is used of the knowledge of the <span class="ital">truth</span>. It <span class="ital">means</span> a knowledge that is true, accurate, thorough, and so might be rendered “full knowledge,” notwithstanding the fact that the simple <span class="greekheb">γνῶσις</span> may be used at times in much the same sense (as possibly in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-8.htm" title="For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;">1 Corinthians 12:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-8.htm" title="Charity never fails: but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away.">1 Corinthians 13:8</a>). The use of <span class="greekheb">γινώσκω</span> and <span class="greekheb">ἐπιγινώσκω</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-12.htm" title="For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.">1 Corinthians 13:12</a> points to the intensive sense of the compound form. The <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span> is not to be dealt with as = <span class="greekheb">εἰς</span> (Grot.) or <span class="greekheb">διά</span> (Beza), but must have either the <span class="ital">instrumental</span> sense or the <span class="ital">local</span>. It was by the knowledge of God Himself, or, as it may be better put, <span class="ital">within</span> the sphere of that knowledge that the gift of enlightenment and the reception of further disclosures of the Divine Counsel were to make themselves good. The only gifts desired for these converts were gifts of a spiritual order, meaning a better acquaintance with God Himself. The clause <span class="greekheb">ἐν ἐπιγνώσει αὐτοῦ</span> is connected by some (Chrys., Lachm., Olsh., etc.) with the sentence which <span class="ital">follows</span>, and by others only with the <span class="greekheb">ἀποκαλύψεως</span>. But the course of thought and the balance of the terms point to it as qualifying the two gifts specified in the preceding sentence.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/ephesians/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">17</span>. <span class="ital">the God of our Lord Jesus Christ</span>] Cp. the Saviour’s own words on the Cross, “Eli, Eli” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-46.htm" title="And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?">Matthew 27:46</a>); and after Resurrection (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-17.htm" title="Jesus said to her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brothers, and say to them, I ascend to my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God.">John 20:17</a>), “I ascend unto … my God.” See also <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-22.htm" title="You worship you know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews.">John 4:22</a>.—The Father is the God of the Son Incarnate, in a sense which, however partially, we may be said to understand. Hence in the two passages just quoted, where the Death and the Resurrection of the Incarnate One Who could not “taste death” except as Incarnate (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-9.htm" title="But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.">Hebrews 2:9</a>), are respectively in view, the thought is specially in point; and so also in a passage like this, where the Saviour’s exaltation <span class="ital">after death</span> is before us. There <span class="ital">may</span> also lie in the phrase here the thought that He is “the God of our Lord” in the sense of being the God revealed and known through our Lord.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the Father of glory</span>] Not merely “the glorious Father,” but the Father who is the Origin and King of all that is meant by eternal “glory.” Cp. the words “the Lord of glory” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-1.htm" title="My brothers, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect of persons.">James 2:1</a>), used of the Son. Alford suggests that the “glory” here involves the thought of Christ as the true Shechinah, in whom the true glory of Godhead shines forth; who is thus the true “Glory of God.” But the suggestion, beautiful and true in itself, appears far-fetched here. Cp. the phrase “Father of mercies,” <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-3.htm" title="Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort;">2 Corinthians 1:3</a>, to illustrate the interpretation above.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">may give</span>] Lit., <span class="bld">might give</span>. The writer records his object as it <span class="ital">was</span> when he last prayed.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the spirit</span>] R. V., “<span class="ital">a spirit</span>.” The Gr. has no article, but this does not settle the question, for (not to speak of other grammatical reasons) the article is often omitted with well-known words, such as God, and Christ. And in passages where certainly “<span class="ital">the</span> Holy Spirit” is meant, we have the same omission; see esp. the LXX. of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-2.htm" title="And the spirit of the LORD shall rest on him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the LORD;">Isaiah 11:2</a>, where lit., “<span class="ital">A</span> spirit of God shall rest upon Him, <span class="ital">a</span> spirit of wisdom and intelligence, &c.;” a close verbal parallel to this passage.—The Scripture use of the word “spirit” seems to us to favour the reference here to the Holy Spirit. The word is rarely if ever in Scripture used in the loose modern sense of “sentiment,” “tendency,” or the like, but far rather of personal spirits—the spirit of man, in or out of the body; spirits, good or evil, not human; and The Spirit of God. And the idea of <span class="ital">Gift</span> is deeply connected with this last, very usually betokening the impartation to man, in whatever mode, of the Holy Spirit in His presence and power, whether for lower effects and purposes (as e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-3.htm" title="And you shall speak to all that are wise hearted, whom I have filled with the spirit of wisdom, that they may make Aaron's garments to consecrate him, that he may minister to me in the priest's office.">Exodus 28:3</a>), or for the highest.—<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-8.htm" title="(According as it is written, God has given them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear;) to this day.">Romans 11:8</a> is an exception; “God hath given them the (or a) spirit of slumber.” But even there the reference is probably to a <span class="ital">personal</span> spiritual agent.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It may be asked, was not the Holy Spirit already “given” to these saints? Yes, undoubtedly. But where <span class="ital">spirit</span> is concerned we must be cautious how we insist too much on logical inferences from forms of expression. We are not to think of the “coming” of the Spirit as a literal passage through space to a locality, but a manifestation of His power in human subjects in a new way. Similarly we are not to think of the “giving” of the Spirit as of an isolated deposit of what, once given, is now locally in possession. The first “gift” is, as it were, the first point in a series of actions of which each one may be expressed also as a gift. Not infrequently in Scripture spiritual processes are viewed as <span class="ital">beginning</span> at what is more precisely a point of new development.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Practically, the bearing of this passage is not greatly affected by the question of “<span class="ital">a</span>” or “<span class="ital">the</span>”. The work would in any case be immediately done by the Holy Spirit, and would take the form of a developed experience in the spirit of the Christian.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in the knowledge of him</span>] Precisely, <span class="bld">in full</span>, or <span class="bld">thorough, knowledge</span>; <span class="ital">epignôsis</span>, more than <span class="ital">gnôsis</span>. The same word is used, e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-20.htm" title="Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.">Romans 3:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-2.htm" title="For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge.">Romans 10:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-2.htm" title=" That their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and to all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the acknowledgment of the mystery of God, and of the Father, and of Christ;">Colossians 2:2</a>; and the cognate verb, e. g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-12.htm" title="For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.">1 Corinthians 13:12</a>.—The tendency of the word in N. T. usage is to denote knowledge which is not merely intellectual, but of the nature of spiritual experience.—“<span class="ital">Of Him</span>”<span class="ital">:</span>—of the Father, to Whom similar pronouns throughout the passage plainly refer. To know Him (in and with the Son) is the inmost secret of “life eternal”(<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-3.htm" title="And this is life eternal, that they might know you the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.">John 17:3</a>; cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-27.htm" title="All things are delivered to me of my Father: and no man knows the Son, but the Father; neither knows any man the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him.">Matthew 11:27</a>). “Philosophy, taking, as it must, man for its centre, says to him, <span class="ital">Know thyself</span>. But the inspired Word, which alone can originate with God, is alone able to say to man, <span class="ital">Know God</span>” (Monod, after Pascal).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This Divine knowledge is the region, so to speak, “<span class="ital">in</span>” which the “wisdom and unveiling” just spoken of are to grow and work.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/ephesians/1.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-17.htm" title="That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him:">Ephesians 1:17</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἵνα</span>, <span class="ital">that</span>) A subject of prayer for true Christians.—<span class="greekheb">ὁ πατὴρ τῆς δόξης</span>, <span class="ital">the Father of glory</span>) That infinite glory, which shines in the face of Christ; nay, more, [the Father] of the glory, which is the Son of God Himself; by whom also the glorious inheritance will become ours, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-18.htm" title="The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that you may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,">Ephesians 1:18</a>.—<span class="greekheb">Πνεῦμα σοφίας καὶ ἀποκαλύψεως</span>, <span class="ital">the Spirit of wisdom and revelation</span>) The same Spirit, who is the Spirit of promise, is, in the progress of believers, also the Spirit of wisdom and revelation. <span class="ital">Wisdom</span> works wisdom in us; <span class="ital">revelation</span> knowledge.—<span class="greekheb">ἐν</span>, <span class="ital">in</span>) Construe with <span class="ital">may give</span>.—<span class="greekheb">αὐτοῦ</span>, <span class="ital">of Him</span>) God.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory.</span> The invocations of Paul - the terms by which he calls on God - are always significant, involving a plea for the blessings sought. God, as "the God of our Lord Jesus Christ," gave to him the Holy Spirit without measure, and might well, therefore, be asked and expected to give the gifts of the same Spirit to those who were "<span class="accented">in</span> him" - one with him as members of his body. Being also the "<span class="accented">Father</span> of glory," and having glorified Jesus, even after his suffering, with the glory which he had with him before the world began, he might well be asked and expected to glorify his people too. <span class="cmt_word">May give to you the Spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of him.</span> "Spirit" here is neither exclusively the Holy Spirit nor the spirit of man, but the complex idea of the spirit of man dwelt in and moved by the Spirit of God (Alford). Wisdom seems to denote the general gift of spiritual illumination; revelation, capacity of apprehending the revealed - of perceiving the drift and meaning of what God makes known, so that it may be a real revelation to us (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-11.htm">Matthew 13:11</a>). <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> is something more than mere <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> - full knowledge of Christ, implying that it is in becoming better acquainted with Christ that we get the spirit of wisdom and revelation. In seeking to know Christ more, we are in the true way to get more insight into all that is Divine (croup. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-9.htm">John 14:9</a>). The importance of seeking more knowledge, even after we have believed and been settled by the Holy Spirit, is here apparent; a growing knowledge is a most healthful feature of Christian life. "Grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-18.htm">2 Peter 3:18</a>). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/ephesians/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>God of our Lord Jesus Christ<p>Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-17.htm">John 20:17</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-46.htm">Matthew 27:46</a>, and see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-3.htm">Ephesians 1:3</a>.<p>Father of glory (&#x3bf;&#788; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3c1; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;)<p>The Father to whom the glory belongs.

Wisdom and revelation are special forms of the Spirit's operation. He imparts general illumination (wisdom) and special revelations of divine mysteries. The combination of two words with an advance in thought from the general to the special is characteristic of Paul.
