It is notable that, while it is on the spiritual meaning of the resurrection of Christ that the chief stress is laid in the earlier Epistles (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/6-4.htm" title="Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.">Romans 6:4-11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/15-12.htm" title="Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?">1Corinthians 15:12-22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/15-50.htm" title="Now this I say, brothers, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither does corruption inherit incorruption.">1Corinthians 15:50-57</a>), in these later Epistles the Apostle passes on beyond this, as taken for granted (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-1.htm" title=" If you then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sits on the right hand of God.">Colossians 3:1</a>), and dwells on “Christ in heaven,” exalted far above all created things, but yet vouchsafing to be in a peculiar sense the head and life of the Church on earth. See, for example, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/philippians/2-9.htm" title="Why God also has highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name:">Philippians 2:9-11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/colossians/1-14.htm" title=" In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins:">Colossians 1:14-19</a>; and compare the pervading conception of the Apocalypse. In this advance of thought he approaches to the idea of our Lord’s own great intercession (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-5.htm" title="And now, O Father, glorify you me with your own self with the glory which I had with you before the world was.">John 17:5</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>constantly connecting the unity of His Church in Him with the glory which was His from all eternity, and to which He was to return—“Now, O Father, glorify Thou Me with Thine own self with the glory which I had with Thee before the world was. . . . I will that they also whom Thou hast given Me, be with Me where I am, that they may behold My glory.”<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:15-23 God has laid up spiritual blessings for us in his Son the Lord Jesus; but requires us to draw them out and fetch them in by prayer. Even the best Christians need to be prayed for: and while we hear of the welfare of Christian friends, we should pray for them. Even true believers greatly want heavenly wisdom. Are not the best of us unwilling to come under God's yoke, though there is no other way to find rest for the soul? Do we not for a little pleasure often part with our peace? And if we dispute less, and prayed more with and for each other, we should daily see more and more what is the hope of our calling, and the riches of the Divine glory in this inheritance. It is desirable to feel the mighty power of Divine grace, beginning and carrying on the work of faith in our souls. But it is difficult to bring a soul to believe fully in Christ, and to venture its all, and the hope of eternal life, upon his righteousness. Nothing less than Almighty power will work this in us. Here is signified that it is Christ the Saviour, who supplies all the necessities of those who trust in him, and gives them all blessings in the richest abundance. And by being partakers of Christ himself, we come to be filled with the fulness of grace and glory in him. How then do those forget themselves who seek for righteousness out of him! This teaches us to come to Christ. And did we know what we are called to, and what we might find in him, surely we should come and be suitors to him. When feeling our weakness and the power of our enemies, we most perceive the greatness of that mighty power which effects the conversion of the believer, and is engaged to perfect his salvation. Surely this will constrain us by love to live to our Redeemer's glory.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ephesians/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Which he wrought in Christ - Which he exerted in relation to the Lord Jesus when he was dead. The "power" which was then exerted was as great as that of creation. It was imparting life to a cold and "mangled" frame. It was to open again the arteries and veins, and teach the heart to beat and the lungs to heave. It was to diffuse vital warmth through the rigid muscles, and to communicate to the body the active functions of life. It is impossible to conceive of a more direct exertion of "power" than in raising up the dead; and there is no more striking illustration of the nature of conversion than in such a resurrection.<p>And set him at his own right hand - The idea is, that great power was displayed by this, and that a similar exhibition is made when man is renewed and exalted to the high honor of being made an heir of God.

The raising of Christ is not only an earnest of our bodies being hereafter raised, but has a spiritual power in it involving (by virtue of our living union with Him, as members with the Head) the resurrection, spiritually of the believer's soul now, and, consequently, of his body hereafter (Ro 6:8-11; 8:11). The Son, too, as God (though not as man), had a share in raising His own human body (Joh 2:19; 10:17, 18). Also the Holy Spirit (Ro 1:4; 1Pe 3:18).<p>set him&#8212;Greek, "made Him sit."

There are many articles of faith contained in this passage; as that Christ died, that he is raised from the dead, that he was raised from the dead by God the Father, and that his resurrection was by the power of God: the resurrection of any person is an instance of great power, but Christ's resurrection from the dead was an instance of peculiar and special power; for he was raised from the dead as a public person, representing all his people, for whom he became a surety; and he was raised again for their justification, and to great glory in himself, after he had been brought into a very low estate indeed: moreover, this passage in connection with the preceding verse suggests, that there is some proportion between the power put forth on Christ in raising him from the dead, and that which is exerted in the work of conversion and faith: there is some likeness between the things themselves, as well as in the display of power in them; Christ's resurrection is called a begetting, and he is styled the first begotten from the dead, and the regeneration of men is signified by a resurrection from the dead; as Christ's body was really dead, lifeless, and without motion, antecedent to his resurrection, so men, previous to conversion, are dead in trespasses and sins, and are destitute of spiritual life and motion; and as Christ's human nature could not help itself, could not raise itself, so neither can dead sinners convert themselves, or bring themselves out of that state and condition, in which they are by nature; and as the resurrection of Christ was the pure work of God, and a display of his almighty power, so the work of faith, of grace and conversion, is the entire work of God, which is begun, carried on, and finished wholly by his power; and as Christ's resurrection was in order to his glorification, so is the regeneration and conversion of men, in order to their enjoyment of the heavenly inheritance, as it follows: <p>and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places; which is expressive of the great honour conferred upon the human nature of Christ, such as never was given to any of the angels, and of the glory it is exalted to; and shows that he has done his work on earth with acceptance, which he came about; and therefore is set down at his Father's right hand, where he enjoys rest and ease from his labours, and is out of the reach of every enemy; will never die again, but live for ever, to intercede for his people, to assist and protect them, and bring them where he is; and in whom, as their head and representative, they are already set down in the same heavenly places. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/ephesians/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{20}</span> Which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set <i>him</i> at his own <span class="cverse3">{z}</span> right hand in the heavenly <i>places</i>,</span><p>(20) The apostle wishes us to behold in our most glorious Christ (with the eyes of faith) that most excellent power and glory of God, of which all the faithful are partakers, even though it is as yet very dim in us, by reason of the shame of the cross, and the weakness of the flesh.<p>(z) To be set on God's right hand is to be a partaker of the sovereignty which he has over all creatures.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/ephesians/1.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-20.htm" title="Which he worked in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places,">Ephesians 1:20</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἥν</span>] namely, <span class="greekheb">ἐνέργειαν</span>; see Winer, p. 205 [E.

WH (with the other in margin). The aorist is more in keeping with the definite historical event referred to; the succeeding aorists on the other hand favour the perfect, making it the more difficult reading to account for. Here again the article with the <span class="greekheb">Χριστῷ</span> may give it the official sense “the Christ”. This is the more probable in view of the use of the <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span> as well as the relation of the statement to the <span class="ital">hope</span> and the <span class="ital">inheritance</span>. The surpassing power of God was not only <span class="ital">manifested</span> in the case of our Lord, but was wrought <span class="ital">in</span> Him, and in Him not as an individual member of the race, but as “the Christ,” the Anointed of God, in whom we are represented and have our Head. The result of that working of God’s energy in Him was His resurrection from the dead—an event which, as Paul uniformly teaches, had a power not for Himself only but for us. The <span class="greekheb">ἐγείρας</span> may have the force (coincidence in time) given it by the AV and the RV, etc., “when he raised Him”; or it may be better taken as the defining, explanatory aor. (as in <span class="greekheb">γνωρίσας</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-9.htm" title="Having made known to us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he has purposed in himself:">Ephesians 1:9</a>), “in that He raised Him”.—<span class="greekheb">καὶ ἐκάθισεν ἐν δεξιᾷ αὐτοῦ</span>: <span class="ital">and seated Him on His right hand</span>. The <span class="greekheb">ἐκάθισεν</span> of the TR, supported by such MSS. as [120] [121] [122] [123], the Copt. and Goth. Versions, etc., must give place to <span class="greekheb">καθίσας</span>, the reading of [124] [125] [126] 17, etc., adopted by LTTrWHRV. A few authorities ([127] [128] 17, etc.) insert <span class="greekheb">αὐτόν</span> before <span class="greekheb">ἐν δεξιᾷ</span>.

Two thoughts are conveyed; first, subordinately, the existence of orders and authorities[32] in the angelic (as well as human) world; then, primarily, the imperial and absolute Headship of the Son over them all. The additional thought is given us by <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-16.htm" title=" For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:">Colossians 1:16</a> that He was also, in His preexistent glory, their Creator; but this is not in definite view here, where He appears altogether as the exalted Son of Man after Death. In Romans 8, Colossians 2, and Ephesians 6, (quoted above,) we have cognate phrases where <span class="ital">evil</span> powers are meant; (and see note below on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-12.htm" title="For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.">Ephesians 6:12</a>, on the remarkable wording, “in the <span class="ital">heavenly</span> places”). But the context here is distinctly favourable to a <span class="ital">good</span> reference. That the Redeemer should be “exalted above” powers of <span class="ital">evil</span> is a thought scarcely adequate in a connexion so full of the imagery of glory as this. That He should be “exalted above” the holy Angels is fully in point. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-22.htm" title="Who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God; angels and authorities and powers being made subject to him.">1 Peter 3:22</a> is our best parallel; and cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/5-11.htm" title="And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders: and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands;...">Revelation 5:11-12</a>.

T.

Such a fact gives special point to the phrases here. On the other hand it does not warrant the inference that St Paul repudiates all the ideas of such an Angelology. The idea of order and authority in the angelic world he surely endorses, though quite in passing.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Theories of Angelic Orders, more or less elaborate, are found in the <span class="ital">Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs</span>, cent. 1–2; Origen, cent. 3; St Ephrem Syrus, cent. 4. By far the most famous ancient treatise on the subject is the book <span class="ital">On the Celestial Hierarchy</span>, under the name (certainly assumed) of Dionysius the Areopagite; a book first mentioned cent. 6, from which time onwards it had a commanding influence in Christendom. (See article <span class="ital">Dionysius</span> in Smith’s <span class="ital">Dict. Christ. Biography</span>.) “Dionysius” ranked the Orders (in descending scale) in three <span class="ital">Trines;</span> Seraphim, Cherubim, Thrones; Dominations, Virtues, Powers (Authorities); Principalities, Archangels, Angels. The titles are thus a combination of the terms Seraphim, Cherubim, Archangels, Angels, with those used by St Paul here and in Colossians 1.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Readers of <span class="ital">Paradise Lost</span>, familiar with the majestic line,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Virtues, Pow’rs,”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>are not always aware of its learned accuracy of allusion. The Dionysian system powerfully attracted the sublime mind of Dante. In the <span class="ital">Paradiso</span>, Canto xxxviii., is a grand and characteristic passage, in which Beatrice expounds the theory to Dante, as he stands, in the ninth heaven, in actual view of the Hierarchies encircling the Divine Essence:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“All, as they circle in their orders, look<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Aloft; and, downward, with such sway prevail<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>That all with mutual impulse tend to God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>These once a mortal view beheld.

To appreciate this, we must bear in mind the apostle's full doctrine of the resurrection of Jesus, embracing not only the revivifying of his dead body, but the transformation of that body into a spiritual body, and the constituting of Jesus a second Adam, who should transmit or communicate to His spiritual seed both a renewed soul and a glorified body, as the first Adam transmitted a sinful nature and a corruptible body to his natural seed.
