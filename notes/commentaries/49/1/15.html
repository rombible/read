They are not, however, decisive, for we have a similar expression to Philemon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-5.htm" title="Hearing of your love and faith, which you have toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints;">Philemon 1:5</a>), St. Paul’s own convert.<p>We may note a distinction between “faith in the Lord Jesus” and “faith towards the Lord Jesus” (like “the love towards the saints”). Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-13.htm" title="Hold fast the form of sound words, which you have heard of me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.">2Timothy 1:13</a> (“faith and love in Christ Jesus”). “Faith in Christ” is a faith which, centred in Christ, nevertheless rests through Him on the Father; recognising a “life hid with him in God” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-3.htm" title=" For you are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.">Colossians 3:3</a>) and a sonship of God in Christ Jesus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-26.htm" title="For you are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.">Galatians 3:26</a>). The connection of the two clauses here shows that such a faith abounds (<span class= "ital">i.e.</span> overflows) unto love, first necessarily to God, so being made perfect (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-6.htm" title="For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision avails any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which works by love.">Galatians 5:6</a>), but next towards all His children. For “this commandment we have from Him, that he who loveth God, love his brother also” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-21.htm" title="And this commandment have we from him, That he who loves God love his brother also.">1John 4:21</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/ephesians/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/1-15.htm" title="Why I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and love to all the saints,...">Ephesians 1:15-17</a></span>. <span class="ital">Wherefore, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus </span>— That is, of your perseverance and increase therein. For the apostle’s manner of speaking does not imply that he received by report an account of their first believing in the Lord Jesus, and therefore that he wrote this epistle to them before he had been at Ephesus in person, or was personally acquainted with them. He wrote in the same terms to the Thessalonians, who were his converts, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-4.htm" title="For truly, when we were with you, we told you before that we should suffer tribulation; even as it came to pass, and you know.">1 Thessalonians 3:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-6.htm" title="But now when Timotheus came from you to us, and brought us good tidings of your faith and charity, and that you have good remembrance of us always, desiring greatly to see us, as we also to see you:">1 Thessalonians 3:6</a>,) and to his convert Philemon, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/1-4.htm" title="According as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love:...">Ephesians 1:4-5</a>. Therefore, as his saying that he heard of the faith and love of the Thessalonians and of Philemon, does not mean that he was ignorant of these things till they were reported to him, but only that he had heard of their persevering in the true faith of the gospel, and in their love to the saints; so the faith of the Ephesians, which he says he had heard of, was not their first faith, or their conversion to Christianity, but their continued and increasing faith, evidencing itself by the fruit here spoken of. <span class="ital">Love unto all the saints </span>— Namely, whether circumcised or uncircumcised. For, by praising the Ephesians for their love to <span class="ital">all the saints, </span>the apostle seems to intimate that they were free from that narrow, bigoted spirit, which prevailed in some other churches, where difference in opinion about the necessity of circumcision had interrupted love. <span class="ital">I cease not </span>— In all my solemn addresses to God; <span class="ital">to give thanks for you </span>— On account of your perseverance in the true faith of the gospel, and in your love to all Christ’s disciples; <span class="ital">making mention of you in my prayers </span>— So he did of all the churches, <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-9.htm" title=" For this cause we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that you might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding;">Colossians 1:9</a>. <span class="ital">That the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory </span>— Of which he is eternally and immutably possessed; from whom all glory proceeds, and to whom it returns; and whose glory shines in the face of Christ his beloved Son; or, as the expression might have been rendered, <span class="ital">the glorious Father; may give you the Spirit of wisdom and revelation </span>— This Spirit, termed <span class="ital">the Spirit of promise, </span>(<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-13.htm" title="In whom you also trusted, after that you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that you believed, you were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise,">Ephesians 1:13</a>,) they had already received, in a great measure, for he had <span class="ital">sealed them, </span>as is there signified, and was an earnest of their inheritance in their hearts; but the apostle here prays that the same Spirit might be still more largely communicated to them, revealing more fully the deep things of God, and rendering them still more wise in all matters that concerned their own salvation, and the salvation of others. <span class="ital">In the knowledge of him </span>— Of Christ, of his person and offices, of his wonderful process in accomplishing the work of man’s redemption; of his humiliation and exaltation, his grace and glory, which he termed, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-8.htm" title="Yes doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ,">Php 3:8</a>,) <span class="ital">the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus </span>his <span class="ital">Lord, for whom </span>he had willingly <span class="ital">suffered the loss of all things, </span>and accounted them despicable, in comparison of this knowledge of him.

Even the best Christians need to be prayed for: and while we hear of the welfare of Christian friends, we should pray for them. Even true believers greatly want heavenly wisdom. Are not the best of us unwilling to come under God's yoke, though there is no other way to find rest for the soul? Do we not for a little pleasure often part with our peace? And if we dispute less, and prayed more with and for each other, we should daily see more and more what is the hope of our calling, and the riches of the Divine glory in this inheritance. It is desirable to feel the mighty power of Divine grace, beginning and carrying on the work of faith in our souls. But it is difficult to bring a soul to believe fully in Christ, and to venture its all, and the hope of eternal life, upon his righteousness. Nothing less than Almighty power will work this in us. Here is signified that it is Christ the Saviour, who supplies all the necessities of those who trust in him, and gives them all blessings in the richest abundance. And by being partakers of Christ himself, we come to be filled with the fulness of grace and glory in him. How then do those forget themselves who seek for righteousness out of him! This teaches us to come to Christ. And did we know what we are called to, and what we might find in him, surely we should come and be suitors to him. When feeling our weakness and the power of our enemies, we most perceive the greatness of that mighty power which effects the conversion of the believer, and is engaged to perfect his salvation. Surely this will constrain us by love to live to our Redeemer's glory.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ephesians/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Wherefore, I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus - This is one of the passages usually relied on by those who suppose that this Epistle was not written to the Ephesians. The argument is, that he writes to them as if they were strangers to him, and that it is not language such as would be used in addressing a people among whom he had spent three years; see the introduction, section 5. But this inference is not conclusive. Paul had been some years absent from Ephesus when this Epistle was written. In the difficult communication in those times between distant places, it is not to be supposed that he would hear often from them. Perhaps he had heard nothing after the time when he bade farewell to the elders of Ephesus at Miletus <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/20.htm">Acts 20</a>, until the time here referred to. It would be, therefore, a matter of great interest with him to hear from them; and when in some way intelligence was brought to him at Rome of a very gratifying character about their growth in piety, he says that his anxiety was relieved, and that he did not cease to give thanks for what he had heard, and to commend them to God in prayer. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ephesians/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15.

Not implying that he had only heard of their conversion: an erroneous argument used by some against the address of this Epistle to the Ephesians (see on [2361]Eph 1:1); but referring to the report he had heard since he was with them, as to their Christian graces.

And the grace of faith, which terminates on him, is a seeing him, a beholding the glory of his person, and the fulness of his grace; a going to him, and venturing on him; a laying hold upon him, and embracing of him; a committing all unto him, and a leaning and depending on him, and a living upon him, and a walking on in him. <p>And love unto all the saints: whether Jew or Gentile, rich or poor, greater or lesser believers, of meaner gifts, or larger abilities; and which love was unfeigned, fervent, active, and laborious; and which is the evidence of regeneration, and without which a profession is in vain. These two graces, faith and love, are inseparable; they always go together, and are to be found in the same persons; and where they are, they cannot be hid, as they were not in these Ephesians; their faith was professed by them, and was made public, and their love showed itself in deeds, as well as in words, to the saints: hence the apostle came to hear of them both, upon the certain relation of others; for these things were come abroad, and were talked of; See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-3.htm">Colossians 1:3</a>.

SECOND SECTION OF THE EPISTLE: in which the writer expresses his own feelings and desires towards the Ephesians, and in doing so leads them to the highest conception both of Christ’s own supremacy and of the grandeur of that Church of His of which they had been made members. The wonders of the grace thus shown them give him occasion, he tells them, for increasing thanksgiving. But his thanksgiving also prompts him to prayer on their behalf. Seeing to what they had already attained in the Christian life into which that marvellous grace had brought them, especially in faith and in brotherly love, his prayer is that they may increase in these yet more and more, and in particular that they may have an enlarging insight into the hope that springs from their calling, the inheritance which is reserved for them, and the present power of Christ which is the guarantee for all that they have and look for.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/ephesians/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div>15–23. Prayer, that the Saints may fully realize their Divine privileges and prospects in Christ<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">15</span>. <span class="ital">Wherefore</span>, &c.]. The Apostle now passes from the adoring view of Divine Redemption to prayer that its treasures of grace may be realized in the whole experience and life of the saints. And this he does, as elsewhere (Colossians 1; 2 Thessalonians 1) in close connexion with thanksgiving for what they had already found[31].—“<span class="ital">Wherefore</span>”<span class="ital">:</span>—because such is the greatness of Redemption, in fact and prospect.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[31] In Dean Howson’s admirable <span class="ital">Lectures on the Character of St Paul</span> (Lect. IV.) it is pointed out that St Paul always, in opening an Epistle, joins prayer to thanksgiving, except in Epistles (1 Cor.; Gal.) marked by a certain severity.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">I also</span>] as well as others who have you in their hearts; a touch of gracious modesty.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">heard</span>] in his Roman lodging, doubtless through Epaphras (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-7.htm" title=" As you also learned of Epaphras our dear fellow servant, who is for you a faithful minister of Christ;">Colossians 1:7</a>) among others.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">your faith</span>] More lit., <span class="bld">the faith among you</span>, <span class="ital">la foi chez vous</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in the Lord Jesus</span>] Reposed on and <span class="ital">in</span> Him, as an anchor in the ground. It is questioned whether “faith,” “believe,” &c. with the preposition “in,” do not rather mean “faith, &c., <span class="ital">maintained in</span> and by connexion with Christ.” But there are passages which fully prove the possibility of the simple meaning given above (e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/1-15.htm" title="And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent you, and believe the gospel.">Mark 1:15</a>, where lit., “believe <span class="ital">in the Gospel</span>;” and cp. in LXX. Psalms 77 (78) 26; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-6.htm" title="For even your brothers, and the house of your father, even they have dealt treacherously with you; yes, they have called a multitude after you: believe them not, though they speak fair words to you.">Jeremiah 12:6</a>); and in most passages where the construction occurs a remote and elaborate meaning would in the nature of the case be unlikely.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and love unto all the saints</span>] Cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-4.htm" title=" Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love which you have to all the saints,">Colossians 1:4</a> for an exact parallel. Here, however, the reading is disputed. Some very important MSS. omit “love,” and R. V. reads accordingly “<span class="ital">the faith … which ye shew toward all the saints</span>.” But the external evidence for the received reading is very strong. All the ancient Versions give it, as well as some of the oldest MSS., and the vast majority of others. And it is internally very much more likely than a phrase which is <span class="ital">without any real parallel</span>, and which couples together, under closely kindred terms, “faith in” Christ and “faith towards” Christians. And the parallel in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-4.htm" title=" Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love which you have to all the saints,">Colossians 1:4</a> is strongly in favour of the received reading; for though it is likely enough that St Paul may have <span class="ital">omitted</span> in one Epistle a whole phrase which he used in the other (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-7.htm" title="In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace;">Ephesians 1:7</a> above, where the Colossian parallel omits “through His blood”), it is far from likely that he should have <span class="ital">varied</span> the easy and obvious phrase in the one for a curiously difficult one in the other. The true probability is that we have here an early mistake of transcription, due to certain phenomena in the Gr. words.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Apostle has heard with joy of their personal trust in the Divine Redeemer, and their consequent love to all who are His; “faith working by love,” coming out, developing itself, in a life of holy love.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is obvious that this “love to the saints” does not negative “love towards <span class="ital">all</span> men.” But it is love of another order, love of endearment, not only of good will; a necessary sequel of the family connexion of the saints; “<span class="ital">brotherly</span> love.” The N. T. is full of this supernatural family affection.—See <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-7.htm" title="And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity.">2 Peter 1:7</a> for “love” (to all men) “<span class="ital">added to</span>,” or rather “<span class="ital">supplied in</span>, love to the brethren.”<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/ephesians/1.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-15.htm" title="Why I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and love to all the saints,">Ephesians 1:15</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἀκούσας</span>, <span class="ital">having heard</span>) At a distance.

Special mention is made of their faith and love, as cardinal Christian graces, to which elsewhere the apostle adds hope (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-13.htm">1 Corinthians 13:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/1-3.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:3</a>).

If it be asked - Could this knowledge of the condition of his correspondents have been derived from <span class="accented">hearsay</span> ("having heard") if the letter was addressed to the Ephesians, among whom Paul had lived so long, and whose condition he must have known by personal intercourse (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-10.htm">Acts 19:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-31.htm">Acts 20:31</a>)? we reply that, though he derived his first acquaintance from personal intercourse, it was some years since he had been at Ephesus, and the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> refers to what he had heard in the interval (see Introduction). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/ephesians/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Your faith (&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;' &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;)<p>The Greek phrase is nowhere else used by Paul.
