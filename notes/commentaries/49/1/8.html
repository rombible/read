Of these two gifts, wisdom is clearly the higher gift, signifying (as in the Old Testament) the knowledge of the true end of life, which can only come from some knowledge of the “wisdom of God,” that is, the divine purpose of His dispensation. (See especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/proverbs/8-22.htm" title="The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old.">Proverbs 8:22-31</a>.) Such knowledge is revealed to us through the “mind of Christ,” who is Himself the true wisdom or “Word of God.” (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-24.htm" title="But to them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.">1Corinthians 1:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-30.htm" title="But of him are you in Christ Jesus, who of God is made to us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:">1Corinthians 1:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/2-6.htm" title="However, we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nothing:">1Corinthians 2:6-10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-16.htm" title="For who has known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.">1Corinthians 2:16</a>.) Hence wisdom is spoken of in connection with various other gifts, which are but partial manifestations of it. Here with “prudence,” that is, wisdom in action; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-9.htm" title=" For this cause we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that you might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding;">Colossians 1:9</a>, with “intelligence,” that is, wisdom in judgment; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-8.htm" title="For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;">1Corinthians 12:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-3.htm" title=" In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.">Colossians 2:3</a>, with “knowledge,” that is, wisdom in perception; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-17.htm" title="That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him:">Ephesians 1:17</a> of this chapter, with “revelation,” the means by which wisdom is gained.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:3-8 Spiritual and heavenly blessings are the best blessings; with which we cannot be miserable, and without which we cannot but be so. This was from the choice of them in Christ, before the foundation of the world, that they should be made holy by separation from sin, being set apart to God, and sanctified by the Holy Spirit, in consequence of their election in Christ. All who are chosen to happiness as the end, are chosen to holiness as the means. In love they were predestinated, or fore-ordained, to be adopted as children of God by faith in Christ Jesus, and to be openly admitted to the privileges of that high relation to himself. The reconciled and adopted believer, the pardoned sinner, gives all the praise of his salvation to his gracious Father. His love appointed this method of redemption, spared not his own Son, and brought believers to hear and embrace this salvation. It was rich grace to provide such a surety as his own Son, and freely to deliver him up. This method of grace gives no encouragement to evil, but shows sin in all its hatefulness, and how it deserves vengeance. The believer's actions, as well as his words, declare the praises of Divine mercy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ephesians/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Wherein he hath abounded - Which he has liberally manifested to us This grace has not been stinted and confined, but has been liberal and abundant.<p>In all wisdom - That is, he has evinced great wisdom in the plan of salvation; wisdom in so saving people as to secure the honor of his own law, and in devising a scheme that was eminently adapted to save people; see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-24.htm">1 Corinthians 1:24</a>.<p>And prudence - The word used here (&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;  phrone&#772;sis) means understanding, thinking, prudence. The meaning here is, that, so to speak, God had evinced great "intelligence" in the plan of salvation. There was ample proof of "mind" and of "thought." It was adapted to the end in view. It was far-seeing; skillfully arranged; and carefully formed. The sense of the whole is, that there was a wise design running through the whole plan, and abounding in it in an eminent degree. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ephesians/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. Rather, "which He made to abound towards us."<p>all wisdom and prudence&#8212;"wisdom" in devising the plan of redeeming mankind; "prudence" in executing it by the means, and in making all the necessary arrangements of Providence for that purpose. Paul attributes to the Gospel of God's grace "all" possible "wisdom and prudence," in opposition to the boasts of wisdom and prudence which the unbelieving Jews and heathen philosophers and false apostles arrogated for their teachings. Christ crucified, though esteemed "foolishness" by the world, is "the wisdom of God" (1Co 1:18-30). Compare Eph 3:10, "the manifold wisdom of God."<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ephesians/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Wherein, </span> in which grace before mentioned, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">he hath abounded toward us; </span> i.e. out of abundance of grace in himself, (called <span class="ital">riches of grace, </span><span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-7.htm" title="In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace;">Ephesians 1:7</a></span>), he hath bestowed upon us wisdom and prudence.

That is, in the grace which is so abundantly displayed in redemption and forgiveness of sin, through the blood of Christ: <p>in all wisdom and prudence; this may be understood, either of the aboundings of grace in the Gospel; which may be called all wisdom and prudence, because it is the wisdom of God; it is the product of his wisdom, and a display of it; the doctrines it contains are full of wisdom, and are the means of communicating it to men, and of making them wise unto salvation; and it may be so called, to set forth the excellency and perfection of it, as greatly transcending all human wisdom; and in this the grace of God has much abounded, for the Gospel is a declaration of the free grace of God, in the salvation of sinners by Christ; in the free justification of them by his righteousness; and in the full pardon of their sins through his blood; and is a kind invitation and free promise of grace to all sensible sinners: or else of the aboundings of grace in conversion; all men by nature are foolish and unwise; in conversion God makes men to know wisdom in the hidden part, which he puts there; and for which purpose the Spirit is given as a spirit of wisdom; and some part of the work of sanctification lies in spiritual light, knowledge, and understanding; and the Syriac version reads the last clause, "and in all spiritual understanding"; and faith particularly may be intended, which is sometimes expressed by knowledge; and now the grace of God is exceeding abundant with faith and love, in regeneration, sanctification, and conversion; or rather this may be understood of the display of divine wisdom, in the work of redemption and salvation by Christ; and which is to be seen, in pitching upon a proper person to be the Mediator, to become a sacrifice, and make intercession, who is the Son of God, truly God and man, and so every way able to perform the business of salvation; and in the manner of its being effected, in a way wherein grace and mercy are highly exalted, and yet in no wise reproachful to the holiness of God, or injurious to his justice, but to the honour of them, in which Satan is greatly mortified, and sin is condemned, and yet the sinner saved; and in the several parts of it, in the justification of the ungodly without works, by the righteousness of another, in pardoning their sins in a way of justice and faithfulness, and yet according to the riches of grace, and in the security of the persons of God's elect, and of their grace and glory in Christ; and in the subjects of this salvation, who are the foolish things of this world, ungodly sinners, the chief of sinners; and lastly, in making faith the receiver of all the blessings of salvation, that so it might appear to be all of grace. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/ephesians/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{12}</span> <span class="cverse3">{k}</span> Wherein he hath abounded toward us in <span class="cverse3">{l}</span> all wisdom and prudence;</span><p>(12) Now he comes at length to the formal cause, that is to say, to vocation or preaching of the Gospel, by which God executes that eternal counsel of our free reconciliation and salvation in Christ.

Rückert (comp.

Not only would this introduce here something remote from the point,—since in the whole context Paul is commending only <span class="ital">grace</span> as such, and not any other attribute along with it,—but the words themselves are opposed to it, not indeed by <span class="greekheb">φρονήσει</span> in itself, which (in opposition to Harless and Schenkel) might be used also of <span class="ital">God</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-28.htm" title="And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged; and they feared the king: for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him, to do judgment.">1 Kings 3:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-19.htm" title="The LORD by wisdom has founded the earth; by understanding has he established the heavens.">Proverbs 3:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-12.htm" title="He has made the earth by his power, he has established the world by his wisdom, and has stretched out the heavens by his discretion.">Jeremiah 10:12</a>), but certainly by <span class="greekheb">πάσῃ</span>.

It is so used in the vast majority of cases in the Pauline Epistles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-15.htm" title="But not as the offense, so also is the free gift. For if through the offense of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, has abounded to many.">Romans 5:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-12.htm" title="Even so you, for as much as you are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek that you may excel to the edifying of the church.">1 Corinthians 14:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-5.htm" title="For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also abounds by Christ.">2 Corinthians 1:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-2.htm" title="How that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded to the riches of their liberality.">2 Corinthians 8:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-12.htm" title="For the administration of this service not only supplies the want of the saints, but is abundant also by many thanksgivings to God;">2 Corinthians 9:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-26.htm" title="That your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for me by my coming to you again.">Php 1:26</a>, etc.). In later Greek, however, it has also, though not frequently, the trans, sense, and there are some instances of this also in the NT (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-17.htm" title="And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my father's have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger!">Luke 15:17</a>, according to the better reading; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-15.htm" title="For all things are for your sakes, that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of God.">2 Corinthians 4:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-8.htm" title="And God is able to make all grace abound toward you; that you, always having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work:">2 Corinthians 9:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-12.htm" title="And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all men, even as we do toward you:">1 Thessalonians 3:12</a>). Here, therefore, two interpretations are possible, <span class="ital">viz.</span>, “wherewith he abounded” (as in Syr., Vulg., Arm., AV, RV marg., etc.), or “which he made to abound” (as in Goth., Eth., RV, etc.). The latter sense, that of furnishing richly so that there is not only enough but much more, is on the whole in better harmony with the context. It is also supported by grammar, inasmuch as it is uncertain whether the NT presents any instance of attraction where the genitive of the relative represents the dative. Such attraction is possible in classical Greek (<span class="ital">cf.</span> G. Krüger, <span class="ital">Untersuch.</span>, p. 274; Jelf, <span class="ital">Gram.</span>, 822; Winer-Moult., <span class="ital">Gram.</span>, p. 204); but the instances referred to in the NT (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-7.htm" title="Saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.">Romans 4:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-6.htm" title="If you put the brothers in remembrance of these things, you shall be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine, whereunto you have attained.">1 Timothy 4:6</a>) may admit of another explanation. It is also possible, indeed, to take the <span class="greekheb">ἧς</span>, not as a case of attraction, but as under the immediate regimen of <span class="greekheb">ἐπερίσσευσεν</span>. For there are at least some instances of <span class="greekheb">περισσεύειν τινος</span> in the sense of abounding <span class="ital">in</span> something; <span class="ital">cf.</span> <span class="greekheb">ἵνα</span> … <span class="greekheb">παντὸς χαρίσματος περισσεύῃς</span> in Ignat., <span class="ital">Pol.</span>, 2, and <span class="greekheb">περισσεύουσιν ἄρτων</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-17.htm" title="And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my father's have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger!">Luke 15:17</a> (the reading of the TR with [47] [48]Q[49], etc.; <span class="greekheb">περισσεύονται</span>, however, being accepted by TrWHRV with [50] [51] [52], etc.). The transitive sense, however, is further favoured by the force of the following <span class="greekheb">γνωρίσας</span>, as Winer points out. The <span class="greekheb">εἰς ἡμᾶς</span>, expressing the objects to whom the “abounding” is directed, is like the <span class="greekheb">εἰς τοὺς πολλούς</span> of <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-15.htm" title="But not as the offense, so also is the free gift. For if through the offense of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, has abounded to many.">Romans 5:15</a>, the <span class="greekheb">εἰς ἡμᾶς</span> of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-5.htm" title="For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also abounds by Christ.">2 Corinthians 1:5</a>, the <span class="greekheb">εἰς ὑμᾶς</span> of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-8.htm" title="And God is able to make all grace abound toward you; that you, always having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work:">2 Corinthians 9:8</a>. In the last-named passage, indeed, <span class="greekheb">περισσεύειν</span> occurs both in the sense of <span class="ital">making</span> to <span class="ital">abound</span> and in that of <span class="ital">abounding</span>, and in both cases, though with different shades of meaning, it is followed by <span class="greekheb">εἰς</span>.—<span class="greekheb">ἐν πάσῃ σοφίᾳ καὶ φρονήσει</span>: <span class="ital">in all wisdom and prudence</span>. The clause expresses the particular forms in which God made His grace to abound towards us, or the gifts in which His abounding grace was to be seen, namely, those of insight and practical intelligence or discernment with regard to the deep things of His saving counsel. There is considerable difference of opinion, however, with respect to the connection of the clause, its application, and the precise import of its terms. By some (Theod., Griesb., etc.) the words are attached to the following <span class="greekheb">γνωρίσας</span> and taken to define the way in which God made known the “mystery of His will”. But the reason already given, drawn from Paul’s usage, for attaching the <span class="greekheb">ἐν ἀγάπῃ</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-4.htm" title="According as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love:">Ephesians 1:4</a>) to the statement preceding it, holds good also here. Not a few (Rückert, De Wette, Alf., etc.) understand the clause to refer to <span class="ital">God</span>, and to express the thought that the supremacy of His wisdom was seen in the bestowal of His grace so abundantly on us, that it was “in His manifold wisdom and prudence, manifested in all ways possible for us, that He poured out His grace upon us” (Alf.). But it is difficult to adjust the terms to such a use. For it is doubtful whether <span class="greekheb">φρόνησις</span> in the sense which it bears here can be predicated of God. The instances which are cited (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-19.htm" title="The LORD by wisdom has founded the earth; by understanding has he established the heavens.">Proverbs 3:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-12.htm" title="He has made the earth by his power, he has established the world by his wisdom, and has stretched out the heavens by his discretion.">Jeremiah 10:12</a>) are extremely few. They are also of doubtful relevancy, inasmuch as the <span class="greekheb">φρόνησις</span> in these passages represents a Hebrew word with a somewhat different idea, rendered by the RV “understanding”. Neither is the <span class="greekheb">πολυποίκιλος σοφία τοῦ Θεοῦ</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-10.htm" title="To the intent that now to the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God,">Ephesians 3:10</a>) a valid analogy, the thought expressed there being that of the many and various ways in which the Divine wisdom is manifested and realised. The same must be said of the phrase <span class="greekheb">φρόνησις θεοῦ</span> in the narrative of Solomon’s decision (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-28.htm" title="And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged; and they feared the king: for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him, to do judgment.">1 Kings 3:28</a>); for it expresses a prudence or intelligence given to Solomon by God or divine in quality. Even were it more certain than it is that there is biblical warrant for affirming <span class="greekheb">φρόνησις</span> of God, the <span class="greekheb">πάσῃ</span> puts that reference out of the question here; <span class="greekheb">πᾶς</span> being an extensive, not an intensive, definition, expressing not the <span class="ital">highest</span> wisdom and prudence, but <span class="ital">all possible</span> wisdom and prudence, <span class="ital">every kind</span> of such attributes (<span class="ital">cf.</span> Winer-Moult., p. 137). It is true that there are cases in classical Greek which might entitle us to take <span class="greekheb">πᾶσα σοφία</span> as equivalent to <span class="greekheb">πᾶσα ἡ σοφία</span>, “the whole of wisdom,” “the sum of wisdom” (<span class="ital">cf.</span> Kühner, <span class="ital">Gram.</span>, ii., § 465; <span class="ital">Anm.</span>, 8). But there does not appear to be any certain example of that in NT Greek. Further, it is the <span class="ital">grace</span> of God that is magnified in the paragraph, and that not in respect of other qualities in God Himself, but in respect of what it does for us. Hence most (Harl., Mey., Ell., Abb., Haupt, etc.) understand the clause to refer not to God the Giver, but to us the receivers. This is borne out also by the <span class="greekheb">ἵνα πληρωθῆτε τὴν ἐπίγνωσιν τοῦ θελήματος αὐτοῦ ἐν πάσῃ σοφίᾳ καὶ συνέσει</span> of <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-9.htm" title=" For this cause we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that you might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding;">Colossians 1:9</a>; by the place assigned to Christian wisdom in the Epistles to the Ephesians and Colossians; and also to some extent by such partial parallels as these: <span class="greekheb">ἐν πάσῃ σοφίᾳ</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-16.htm" title=" Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.">Colossians 3:16</a>); <span class="greekheb">ἐπλουτίσθητε ἐν αὐ</span>-<span class="greekheb">ῷ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἐν παντὶ λόγῳ καὶ πάσῃ γνώσει</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-5.htm" title="That in every thing you are enriched by him, in all utterance, and in all knowledge;">1 Corinthians 1:5</a>), etc.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[47] Codex Sinaiticus (sæc. iv.), now at St. Petersburg, published in facsimile type by its discoverer, Tischendorf, in 1862.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[48] Codex Claromontanus (sæc. vi.), a Græco-Latin MS. at Paris, edited by Tischendorf in 1852.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[49] Codex Cryptoferratensis (sæc. vii.), a palimpsest fragment containing chap. 11:9–19, edited by Cozza in 1867, and cited by Tischendorf.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[50] Codex Vaticanus (sæc. iv.), published in photographic facsimile in 1889 under the care of the Abbate Cozza-Luzi.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[51] Codex Alexandrinus (sæc. v.), at the British Museum, published in photographic facsimile by Sir E.

As in the present passage the two nouns are also conjoined in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-12.htm" title="Behold, I have done according to your words: see, I have given you a wise and an understanding heart; so that there was none like you before you, neither after you shall any arise like to you.">1 Kings 3:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-29.htm" title="And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the sea shore.">1 Kings 4:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-2.htm" title="To know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words of understanding;">Proverbs 1:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-1.htm" title="Does not wisdom cry? and understanding put forth her voice?">Proverbs 8:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/1-17.htm" title="As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.">Daniel 1:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-21.htm" title="And he changes the times and the seasons: he removes kings, and sets up kings: he gives wisdom to the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding:">Daniel 2:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-23.htm" title="I thank you, and praise you, O you God of my fathers, who have given me wisdom and might, and have made known to me now what we desired of you: for you have now made known to us the king's matter.">Daniel 2:23</a>. So, too, in Joseph., <span class="ital">Antiq.</span>, ii., 5, 7, viii., 7, 5. There is a distinction between them which is variously put in Greek and Roman literature, Aristotle, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, defines <span class="greekheb">σοφία</span> as <span class="greekheb">ἐπιστήμη καὶ νοῦς τῶν τιμιωτάτων τῇ φύσει</span>, and <span class="greekheb">φρόνησις</span> as <span class="greekheb">περὶ τὰ ἀνθρώπινα καὶ περὧν ἔστι βουλεύσασθαι</span> (<span class="ital">Eth. Nic.</span>, vi., 7). Plato deals with <span class="greekheb">φρόνησις</span> as the wisdom of action, prudential wisdom or sagacity (<span class="ital">Laws</span>, i., 631 [53]; 632 [54], etc.) and as the faculty by which we judge <span class="greekheb">τί πρακτέον καὶ τί οὐ πρακτέον</span> ([Plato] <span class="ital">Def.</span>, 411). Philo takes <span class="greekheb">σοφία</span> to relate <span class="greekheb">πρὸς θεραπείαν Θεοῦ</span> and <span class="greekheb">φρόνησις</span> to relate <span class="greekheb">πρὸς ἀνθρωπίνου βίου διοίκησι</span> (<span class="ital">De Prom. et Poen.</span>, 14). Cicero again describes the former as <span class="ital">rerum divinarum et humanarum scientia</span> and the latter as <span class="ital">rerum expetendarum fugiendarumque scientia</span> (<span class="ital">Off.</span>, i., 43); while others explain <span class="greekheb">σοφία</span> as <span class="greekheb">ἐπιστήμη θείων τε καἀνθρωπίνων</span> and <span class="greekheb">φρόνησις</span> as <span class="greekheb">ἐπιστήμη ἀγαθῶν καὶ κακῶν</span> (Sext. Emp., p. 720; Plut., <span class="ital">Mor.</span>, 1066 D). In all these definitions <span class="greekheb">σοφία</span> is the larger idea, wisdom in the most general sense, and <span class="greekheb">φρόνησις</span> is the secondary idea, expressing a particular result or application of <span class="greekheb">σοφία</span>. So it seems to be also substantially with the Biblical use of the terms. <span class="greekheb">Σοφία</span> is the collective moral intelligence, “insight into the true nature of things” (Light.), and in the Pauline Epistles it is this intelligence in especial as knowledge of the Divine plan of salvation long hidden and now revealed; while <span class="greekheb">φρόνησις</span> is the practical use of wisdom, the product of wisdom (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-23.htm" title="It is as sport to a fool to do mischief: but a man of understanding has wisdom.">Proverbs 10:23</a>, <span class="greekheb">ἡ δὲ σοφία ἀνδρὶ τίκτει φρόνησιν</span>), “the right use and application of the <span class="greekheb">φρήν</span>” (Trench), the faculty of discerning the proper disposition or action. The riches, the abounding riches, of the grace expended on us stood revealed in the bestowal of these gifts of spiritual comprehension and practical discernment with reference to the deep things of the Divine Counsel and the Divine Revelation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[53] Codex Ephraemi (sæc. v.), the Paris palimpsest, edited by Tischendorf in 1843.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[54] Codex Sangermanensis (sæc. ix.), a Græco-Latin MS., now at St. Petersburg, formerly belonging to the Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés. Its text is largely dependent upon that of D. The Latin version, e (a corrected copy of d), has been printed, but with incomplete accuracy, by Belsheim (18 5).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/ephesians/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">8</span>. <span class="ital">Wherein he hath abounded</span>] Better, probably, <span class="bld">Which He made to abound</span>; at the time of manifestation and impartation, the great crisis of the Gospel proclamation. This time-reference is fixed by the next verse. Ideally, and for the Church as a body, this time was <span class="ital">one;</span> actually, for individuals, it is the time in each case of personal illumination sealed by baptism.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in all wisdom and prudence</span>] In themselves, these words are of ambiguous reference. They may mean either that God largely exercised His wisdom and prudence, or that He largely gave wisdom and prudence to the saints. The context of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-9.htm" title="Having made known to us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he has purposed in himself:">Ephesians 1:9</a> favours the latter; He “made known the mystery,” in part by granting the spiritual power to read it. The word rendered “prudence” is the same as that rendered “the <span class="ital">wisdom</span> of the just,” <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-17.htm" title="And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.">Luke 1:17</a>; a passage in point here. It does not occur again in N. T. On the thought and fact, cp. e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-5.htm" title="If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that gives to all men liberally, and upbraides not; and it shall be given him.">James 1:5</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/ephesians/1.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-8.htm" title="Wherein he has abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence;">Ephesians 1:8</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἧς</span>) [attraction] <span class="ital">for</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἣν</span>, viz. <span class="greekheb">χάριν</span>.—<span class="greekheb">ἐπερίσσευσεν</span>, <span class="ital">hath abounded</span>) viz. <span class="ital">God</span>.—<span class="greekheb">σοφίᾳ</span>) <span class="ital">in wisdom</span>, concerning the past and present, in regard to the things which God does, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-17.htm" title="That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him:">Ephesians 1:17</a>.—<span class="greekheb">φρονήσει</span>) <span class="ital">in prudence</span>, concerning the future, in regard to the things that we may do.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Which he made to abound toward us in all wisdom and prudence</span>. This rendering of the R.V. is better than the A.V., "wherein he hath abounded," for <span class="greek">&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> before <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> can hardly be put for the dative; it is genitive by attraction for the accusative. The wisdom and prudence refer to God; he has not made his grace abound to us in a random manner, but in a carefully regulated manner. This is more fully explained afterwards, in reference to God's concealment for a time of the universality of his grace, but manifestation of it now. Some have found a difference between <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, the one being theoretical wisdom and the other practical, or the one intellectual and the other moral; but possibly they may be meant merely to intensify the idea - the height of wisdom is shown in God's way of making his grace abound toward us (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-33.htm">Romans 11:33</a>, "Oh, the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God!"). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/ephesians/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Wherein He hath abounded (&#x3b7;&#788;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;)<p>Rev., correctly, which He made to abound. The verb is used both transitively and intransitively in the New Testament. The transitive use belongs mainly to later Greek.
