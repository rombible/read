This passage stands alone in St. Paul’s Epistles in its use of this word “chosen” in connection with God’s eternal purpose, “before the foundation of the world”—a phrase only applied elsewhere to the eternal communion of the Son with the Father (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-24.htm" title="Father, I will that they also, whom you have given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which you have given me: for you loved me before the foundation of the world.">John 17:24</a>), and to the foreordaining of His sacrifice in the divine counsels (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-20.htm" title="Who truly was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you,">1Peter 1:20</a>). The word “chosen” itself is used by our Lord of His choice of the Apostles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-70.htm" title="Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?">John 6:70</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-18.htm" title="I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eats bread with me has lifted up his heel against me.">John 13:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/15-16.htm" title="You have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that you should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that whatever you shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.">John 15:16-19</a>); but in one case with the significant addition, “one of you is a devil,” showing that the election was not final. It is similarly used in the Acts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-2.htm" title="Until the day in which he was taken up, after that he through the Holy Ghost had given commandments to the apostles whom he had chosen:">Acts 1:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-24.htm" title="And they prayed, and said, You, Lord, which know the hearts of all men, show whether of these two you have chosen,">Acts 1:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-5.htm" title="And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch:">Acts 6:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-7.htm" title="And when there had been much disputing, Peter rose up, and said to them, Men and brothers, you know how that a good while ago God made choice among us, that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel, and believe.">Acts 15:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-22.htm" title="Then pleased it the apostles and elders with the whole church, to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; namely, Judas surnamed Barsabas and Silas, chief men among the brothers:">Acts 15:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-25.htm" title="It seemed good to us, being assembled with one accord, to send chosen men to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,">Acts 15:25</a>) of His choice or the choice of the Apostles; and once (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-7.htm" title="Which was with the deputy of the country, Sergius Paulus, a prudent man; who called for Barnabas and Saul, and desired to hear the word of God.">Acts 13:7</a>) of the national election of Israel. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/1-27.htm" title="But God has chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God has chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty;">1Corinthians 1:27-28</a> (the only other place where it is used by St. Paul), and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-5.htm" title="Listen, my beloved brothers, Has not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he has promised to them that love him?">James 2:5</a> it refers to choice of men by God’s calling in this world. Clearly in all these cases it is applied to the election of men to privilege by an act of God’s mercy here. In this passage, on the contrary, the whole reference is to the election “in Christ,” by the foreknowledge of God, of those who should hereafter be made His members. From this examination of Scriptural usage it is clear that the visible election to privilege is constantly and invariably urged upon men; the election in God’s eternal counsels only dwelt upon in passages which (like this or Romans 9, 11) have to ascend in thought to the fountain-head of all being in God’s mysterious will. It will be observed that even here it clearly refers to all members of the Church, without distinction.<p><span class= "bld">That we should be holy and without blame before him.</span>—In these words we have the object of the divine election declared, and the co-operation of the elect implied, by the inseparable connection of holiness with election. There is an instructive parallel in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-22.htm" title=" In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and blameless and unreproveable in his sight:">Colossians 1:22</a> :—“He hath reconciled you in the body of His flesh through death, to present you holy and unblamable, and unreprovable in His sight.” The word “without blame,” or “unblamable,” is properly <span class= "ital">without blemish;</span> and the word “unreprovable” more nearly corresponds to our idea of one <span class= "ital">unblamable</span>—<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>one against whom no charge can be brought. Here God is said to have “chosen” us, in the other passage to have “presented” us (comp. the sacrificial use of the word in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-1.htm" title="I beseech you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service.">Romans 12:1</a>), in Christ, to be “holy and without blemish.” It seems clear that the words refer not to justification in Christ, but to sanctification in Him. They express the positive and negative aspects of holiness; the positive in the spirit of purity, the negative in the absence of spot or blemish. The key to their interpretation is to be found in the idea of <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-29.htm" title="For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers.">Romans 8:29</a>, “whom He did foreknow, He did predestinate to be <span class= "ital">conformed to the image of His Son.”</span> The word “without blame” is applied to our Lord (in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-14.htm" title="How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?">Hebrews 9:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-19.htm" title="But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot:">1Peter 1:19</a>) as a lamb “without blemish.” To Him alone it applies perfectly; to us, in proportion to that conformity to His image. The words “before Him” refer us to God’s unerring judgment as contrasted with the judgment of men, and even our own judgment on ourselves. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/4-3.htm" title="But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man's judgment: yes, I judge not my own self.">1Corinthians 4:3-4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_john/3-20.htm" title="For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knows all things.">1John 3:20-21</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">In love.</span>—If these words are connected with the previous verse, they must be taken with “He hath chosen us,” in spite of the awkwardness of the dislocation of order. But it is best to connect them with the verse following, “Having predestinated us in love.”<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:3-8 Spiritual and heavenly blessings are the best blessings; with which we cannot be miserable, and without which we cannot but be so. This was from the choice of them in Christ, before the foundation of the world, that they should be made holy by separation from sin, being set apart to God, and sanctified by the Holy Spirit, in consequence of their election in Christ. All who are chosen to happiness as the end, are chosen to holiness as the means. In love they were predestinated, or fore-ordained, to be adopted as children of God by faith in Christ Jesus, and to be openly admitted to the privileges of that high relation to himself. The reconciled and adopted believer, the pardoned sinner, gives all the praise of his salvation to his gracious Father. His love appointed this method of redemption, spared not his own Son, and brought believers to hear and embrace this salvation. It was rich grace to provide such a surety as his own Son, and freely to deliver him up. This method of grace gives no encouragement to evil, but shows sin in all its hatefulness, and how it deserves vengeance. The believer's actions, as well as his words, declare the praises of Divine mercy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ephesians/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>According as - The importance of this verse will render proper a somewhat minute examination of the words and phrases of which it is composed. The general sense of the passage is, that these blessings pertaining to heaven were bestowed upon Christians in accordance with an eternal purpose. They were not conferred by chance or hap-hazard. They were the result of intention and design on the part of God. Their value was greatly enhanced from the fact that God had designed from all eternity to bestow them, and that they come to us as the result of his everlasting plan. It was not a recent plan; it was not an afterthought; it was not by mere chance; it was not by caprice; it was the fruit of an eternal counsel. Those blessings had all the value, and all the assurance of "permanency," which must result from that fact. The phrase "according as" - &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#768;&#x3c2;  katho&#772;s - implies that these blessings were in conformity with that eternal plan, and have flowed to us as the expression of that plan. They are limited by that purpose, for it marks and measures all. It was as God had chosen that it should be, and had appointed in his eternal purpose.<p>He hath chosen us - The word "us" here shows that the apostle had reference to individuals, and not to communities. It includes Paul himself as one of the "chosen," and those whom he addressed - the mingled Gentile and Jewish converts in Ephesus. That it must refer to individuals is clear. Of no "community" as such can it be said that it was" chosen in Christ before the foundation of the world to be holy." It is not true of the Gentile world as such, nor of anyone of the nations making up the Gentile world. The word rendered here "hath chosen" - &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;  exelexato - is from a word meaning "to lay out together," (Passow,) to choose out, to select. It has the idea of making a choice or selection among different objects or things. It is applied to things, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/10-42.htm">Luke 10:42</a>, Mary "hath chosen that good part;" - she has made a choice, or selection of it, or has shown a "preference" for it. <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27</a>, "God hath chosen the foolish things of the world;" he has preferred to make use of them among all the conceivable things which might have been employed" to confound the wise;" compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/1-2.htm">Acts 1:2</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-24.htm">Acts 1:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-5.htm">Acts 6:5</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/15-22.htm">Acts 15:22</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-25.htm">Acts 15:25</a>.<p>It denotes "to choose out," with the accessary idea of kindness or favor. <a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/13-20.htm">Mark 13:20</a>, "for the elect's sake whom "he hath chosen," he hath shortened the days." <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/13-18.htm">John 13:18</a>, "I know whom I have chosen." <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-17.htm">Acts 13:17</a>, "the God of this people of Israel "chose" our fathers;" that is, selected them from the nations to accomplish important purposes. This is evidently the sense of the word in the passage before us. It means to make a selection or choice with the idea of favor or love, and with a view to impart important benefits on those whom be chose. The idea of making some "distinction" between them and others, is essential to a correct understanding of the passage - since there can be no choice where no such distinction is made. He who chooses one out of many things makes a difference, or evinces a preference - no matter what the ground or reason of his doing it may be. Whether this refers to communities and nations, or to individuals, still it is true that a distinction is made or a preference given of one over another. It may be added, that so far as "justice" is concerned, it makes no difference whether it refers to nations or to individuals. If there is injustice in choosing an "individual" to favor, there cannot be less in choosing a "nation" - for a nation is nothing but a collection of individuals. Every objection which has ever been made to the doctrine of election as it relates to individuals, will apply with equal force to the choice of a nation to unique privileges. If a distinction is made, it may be made with as much propriety in respect to individuals as to nations.<p>In him - In Christ. The choice was not without reference to any means of saving them; it was not a mere purpose to bring a certain number to heaven; it was with reference to the mediation of the Redeemer, and his work. It was a purpose that they should be saved "by" him, and share the benefits of the atonement. The whole choice and purpose of salvation had reference to him, and "out" of him no one was chosen to life, and no one out of him will be saved.<p>Before the foundation of the world - This is a very important phrase in determining the time when the choice was made. It was not an "afterthought." It was not commenced in time. The purpose was far back in the ages of eternity. But what is the meaning of the phrase "before the foundation of the world?" Dr. Clarke supposes that it means "from the commencement "of the religious system of the Jews," which," says he, "the phrase sometimes means." Such principles of interpretation are they compelled to resort to who endeavor to show that this refers to a national election to privileges, and who deny that it refers to individuals. On such principles the Bible may be made to signify anything and everything. Dr. Chandler, who also supposes that it refers to nations, admits, however, that the word "foundation" means the beginning of anything; and that the phrase here means, "before the world began" There is scarcely any phrase in the New Testament which is more clear in its signification than this.<p>The word rendered "foundation" - &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769;  katabole&#772; - means properly a laying down, a founding, a foundation - as where the foundation of a building is laid - and the phrase "before the foundation of the world" clearly means before the world was made, or before the work of creation; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-35.htm">Matthew 13:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-34.htm">Matthew 25:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-50.htm">Luke 11:50</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-26.htm">Hebrews 9:26</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/13-8.htm">Revelation 13:8</a>, in all which places the phrase "the foundation of the world" means the beginning of human affairs; the beginning of the world; the beginning of history, etc. Thus, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/17-24.htm">John 17:24</a>, the Lord Jesus says, "thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world," i. e., from eternity, or before the work of creation commenced. Thus, Peter says <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-20.htm">1 Peter 1:20</a> of the Saviour, "who verily was fore-ordained before the foundation of the world." It was the purpose of God before the worlds were made, to send him to save lost men; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-8.htm">Revelation 17:8</a>. Nothing can be clearer than that the phrase before us must refer to a purpose that was formed before the world was made. it is not a temporary arrangement; it has not grown up under the influence of vacillating purposes; it is not a plan newly formed, or changed with each coming generation, or variable like the plans of people. It has all the importance, dignity, and assurances of stability which necessarily result from a purpose that has been eternal in the mind of God. It may be observed here,<p>(1) that if the plan was formed "before the foundation of the world," all objections to the doctrine of an "eternal" plan are removed. If the plan was formed "before" the world, no matter whether a moment, an hour, a year, or millions of years, the plan is equally fixed, and the event equally necessary. All the objections which will lie against an "eternal" plan, will lie against a plan formed a day or an hour before the event. The one interferes with our freedom of action as much as the other.<p>(2) if the plan was formed "before the foundation of the world," it "was eternal." God has no new plan, He forms no new schemes. He is not changing and vacillating. If we can ascertain what is the plan of God at any time, we can ascertain what his eternal plan was with reference to the event. It has always been the same - for "he is of one MinD, and who can turn him?" <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/23-13.htm">Job 23:13</a>. In reference to the plans and purposes of the Most High, there is nothing better settled than that what he actually does, he always meant to do - which is the doctrine of eternal decrees - "and the whole of it.<p>That we should be holy - Paul proceeds to state the "object" for which God had chosen his people. It is not merely that they should enter into heaven. It is not that they may live in sin. It is not that they may flatter themselves that they are safe, and then live as they please. The tendency among people has always been to abuse the doctrine of predestination and election; to lead people to say that if all things are fixed there is no need of effort; that if God has an eternal plan, no matter how people live, they will be saved if he has elected them, and that at all events they cannot change that plan, and they may as well enjoy life by indulgence in sin. The apostle Paul held no such view of the doctrine of predestination. In his apprehension it is a doctrine suited to excite the gratitude of Christians, and the whole tendency and design of the doctrine, according to him, is to make people holy, and without blame before God in love.<p>And without blame before him in love - The expression "in love," is probably to be taken in connection with the following verse, and should be rendered "In love," having predestinated us unto the adoption of children." It is all to be traced to the love of God.<p>(1) it was love for us which prompted to it.<p>(2) it is the highest expression of love to be ordained to eternal life - for what higher love could God show us?<p>(3) it is love on his part, because we had no claim to it, and had not deserved it. If this be the correct view, then the doctrine of predestination is not inconsistent with the highest moral excellence in the divine character, and should never be represented as the offspring of partiality and injustice. Then too we should give thanks that" God "has, in love," predestinated us to the adoption of children by Jesus Christ, according to the good pleasure of his will." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ephesians/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. hath chosen us&#8212;Greek, "chose us out for Himself" (namely, out of the world, Ga 1:4): referring to His original choice, spoken of as past.<p>in him&#8212;The repetition of the idea, "in Christ" (Eph 1:3), implies the paramount importance of the truth that it is in Him, and by virtue of union to Him, the Second Adam, the Restorer ordained for us from everlasting, the Head of redeemed humanity, believers have all their blessings (Eph 3:11).<p>before the foundation of the world&#8212;This assumes the eternity of the Son of God (Joh 17:5, 24), as of the election of believers in Him (2Ti 1:9; 2Th 2:13).<p>that we should be holy&#8212;positively (De 14:2).<p>without blame&#8212;negatively (Eph 5:27; 1Th 3:13).<p>before him&#8212;It is to Him the believer looks, walking as in His presence, before whom he looks to be accepted in the judgment (Col 1:22; compare Re 7:15).<p>in love&#8212;joined by Bengel and others with Eph 1:5, "in love having predestinated us," &c.

This choice cannot be understood of a national one, as Israel of old were chosen by the Lord; for the persons the apostle writes to were not a nation; nor does he address all the inhabitants of Ephesus, only the saints and faithful in Christ that resided there; nor are they all intended here, if any of them. However, not they only, since the apostle includes himself, and perhaps some others, who did not belong to that place, nor were of that country: nor does this choice regard them as a church; for though the saints at Ephesus were in a church state, yet the apostle does not write to them under that formal consideration, but as saints and faithful; nor are these persons said to be chosen to church privileges, but to grace and glory, to be holy and blameless: besides, from <a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-3.htm">Ephesians 1:3</a>, the apostle seems to speak of himself, and some others, who first trusted in Christ, as distinct from the believers at Ephesus, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13</a>, nor is this choice of persons to an office, for all that are here intended were not apostles, or pastors, or deacons: nor can it design the effectual calling, or the call of persons in time by efficacious grace; because this was before the foundation of the world, as follows: but it intends an eternal election of particular persons to everlasting life and salvation; and which is the first blessing of grace, and the foundation one, upon which all the rest proceed, and <p>according to which they are dispensed; for according to predestination are calling, justification, and glorification. The author of this choice is God, God the Father, who is distinguished from Christ, in whom this act is made; and it is according to his foreknowledge, and is an act of his grace, and is entirely sovereign: the objects of it, us, are not angels, but men, considered as unfallen with respect to the end, and as fallen with respect to the means; and these not all mankind: to choose, implies the contrary; and they that are chosen are distinguished from others, and are represented as few; nor do all men partake either of the means or end appointed in the decree of election; and yet some of all nations, Jews and Gentiles, are included in it; though none for any previous qualifications in them, as not for their good works, faith, holiness, or perseverance therein; for these are fruits and effects of election, and therefore cannot be causes or conditions of it: and this choice is made in Christ; and the persons chosen are chosen in him, and by being chosen they come to be in him; for this refers not to their openly being in him at conversion, as believers, but to their secretly being in him before time. Christ, as Mediator, is the object of election himself; and all the elect were chosen in him as their head, in whose hands their persons, grace, and glory are, and so are safe and secure in him: the Arabic version renders it, "by him"; not as the meritorious cause, for Christ's merits are not the cause of election, though they are of redemption and salvation; but as the means, in order to the end: the Ethiopic version renders it, "to him"; to salvation by him, and to the obtaining of his glory; as if he and his benefits, being the end of this choice, were intended; which was made <p>before the foundation of the world: and that it was so early, is certain, from the love of God to his people, which this is the effect of, and which is an everlasting love; and from the covenant which was made with Christ from everlasting, on account of these chosen ones, when Christ was set up as the head and representative of them; and from the provision of all spiritual blessings for them in it, which proceeds according to this choice; and from the preparation of a kingdom for them from the foundation of the world; and from the nature of God's decrees, which are eternal; for no new will, or act of will, can arise in God, or any decree be made by him, which was not from eternity: God's foreknowledge is eternal, and so is his decree, and is no other than himself decreeing. The end of this choice follows, <p>that we should be holy, and without blame, before him in love; the objects of it are not chosen because they were holy, but that they might partake of the sanctification of the Spirit; that they might be sanctified by him here, and be perfectly holy hereafter; and be without fault and blame, both in this life, as instilled by the righteousness of Christ, and as washed in his blood; and in the life to come, being entirely freed from all sin, and without spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; and appear so in the sight of Christ, who will present them to himself, and in the sight of his Father, to whom they will also be presented by him, even in the sight of divine justice: and this will be all "in love", or "through love", as the Syriac version renders it; or "through his love", as the Arabic version; for the love of God is the source and spring of election itself, and of holiness and happiness, the end of it; and which is shed abroad in the hearts of God's people now, and will be more fully comprehended and enjoyed in the other world; and which causes love again in them to him. A phrase somewhat like this is used by the Targumist on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/11-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 11:6</a> where, speaking of a man's children, he says; <p>"it is not known unto thee which of them  , "is chosen to be good", this, or that, or both of them, to be alike good.'' <p>Some copies put the stop at before him; and read the phrase, "in love"; in connection with the words following, thus, "in love", or "by love hath predestinated us"; so the Syriac version. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/ephesians/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{6}</span> According as he hath chosen us in <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> him before the foundation of the world, <span class="cverse3">{7}</span> that we <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> should <span class="cverse3">{f}</span> be holy and without blame <span class="cverse3">{g}</span> before him in love:</span><p>(6) He declares the efficient cause, or by what means God the Father saves us in his Son: because, he says, he chose us from everlasting in his Son.<p>(d) To be adopted in him.<p>(7) He expounds the next final cause which is twofold, that is, sanctification and justification, of which he will speak later.

The “blessing” proceeded on a Divine election, and took effect in accordance with that. It has its foundation, therefore, in eternity, and is neither an incidental thing nor an afterthought of God.

The verb, which occurs in the NT only in the Middle (except, perhaps, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-35.htm" title="And there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him.">Luke 9:35</a>), is the LXX equivalent for <span class="greekheb">בָּחַר</span>, and expresses the idea of <span class="ital">selecting for oneself out of a number</span>. It is sometimes alleged that we are not entitled to give it so definite a meaning in doctrinal paragraphs like the present, because there are passages in which it appears to express nothing more than the general idea of a, <span class="ital">choice</span>, without reference either to any special relation to the person choosing or to the leaving of others unchosen. (So, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, Abbott.) But the passages adduced in support of this are few in number and by no means bear out the contention. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-35.htm" title="And there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him.">Luke 9:35</a>, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, where <span class="greekheb">ἐκλελεγμένος</span> is said of the Son, the idea of a choice from among others is certainly not an alien idea (<span class="ital">cf.</span> Thayer-Grim., <span class="ital">Lex., sub voc.</span>); and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-5.htm" title="And it came to pass on the morrow, that their rulers, and elders, and scribes,">Acts 4:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-22.htm" title="Then pleased it the apostles and elders with the whole church, to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; namely, Judas surnamed Barsabas and Silas, chief men among the brothers:">Acts 15:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-25.htm" title="It seemed good to us, being assembled with one accord, to send chosen men to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,">Acts 15:25</a>, the point is a choice for oneself in the form of an appointment to a particular service or office. That the verb denotes the choice of one or more out of others is implied in its compound form, and is made abundantly clear by actual usage, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, in the case of the selection of the Twelve (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-70.htm" title="Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?">John 6:70</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-18.htm" title="I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eats bread with me has lifted up his heel against me.">John 13:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-16.htm" title="You have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that you should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that whatever you shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.">John 15:16</a>), the appointment of a successor to Judas (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-24.htm" title="And they prayed, and said, You, Lord, which know the hearts of all men, show whether of these two you have chosen,">Acts 1:24</a>, etc.).

The foundation of the statement is the great OT idea of Israel as a nation chosen by the Lord to be “a peculiar people unto Himself, above all peoples that are upon the face of the earth” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-2.htm" title="For you are an holy people to the LORD your God, and the LORD has chosen you to be a peculiar people to himself, above all the nations that are on the earth.">Deuteronomy 14:2</a>; <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/33-11.htm" title="The counsel of the LORD stands for ever, the thoughts of his heart to all generations....">Psalm 33:11-12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/135-4.htm" title="For the LORD has chosen Jacob to himself, and Israel for his peculiar treasure.">Psalm 135:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/41-8.htm" title="But you, Israel, are my servant, Jacob whom I have chosen, the seed of Abraham my friend....">Isaiah 41:8-9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-1.htm" title="Behold my servant, whom I uphold; my elect, in whom my soul delights; I have put my spirit on him: he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles.">Isaiah 42:1</a>). What is meant, therefore, is that the blessing which God bestowed on these Ephesians was not a thing of the time merely, but the issue of an election prior to their call or conversion, a blessing that came to them in accordance with a definite choice of them out of the mass of others by God for Himself.—<span class="greekheb">ἐν αὐτῷ</span>: <span class="ital">in Him</span>; that is, in Christ, not “through Him” simply. But in what sense? It is true that Christ is the first “Elect” of God, and that our election is contained in His. But His election is not the matter in hand here, and the point, therefore, is not that in electing Christ God also elected us (Calv., Beng., etc.). Nor, again, is it that we are <span class="ital">included</span> in Him (Hofm.), for neither is this the point in view here. The immediate subject is not what <span class="ital">we</span> are or are made, but what <span class="ital">God</span> does—His election and how it proceeds. And the idea is that that election has its ground in Christ, in the sense that apart from Christ and without respect to His special relation to us, and His foreseen work, there would be no election of us. An extraordinary sense is attached to the <span class="greekheb">ἐν αὐτῷ</span> by Beys., who takes the point to be that the “divinely conceived prototypes of perfected believers are from eternity posited by God in the One Prototype of humanity acceptable unto Him” (<span class="ital">Christ. d. N. T.</span>, p. 141). This is a philosophical notion wholly alien to Paul, on which see Meyer, <span class="ital">in loc.</span> The <span class="greekheb">ἐν αὐτῷ</span> might mean that God’s election of us was <span class="ital">in Christ</span> in so far as Christ was contemplated as having the relation of “head and representative of spiritual, as Adam was the representative of natural, humanity” (Ols., Ell.). But it is best taken as expressing again the broad idea that “in Christ lay for God the <span class="ital">causa meritoria</span> of our election” (Mey.).—<span class="greekheb">πρὸ καταβολῆς τοῦ κόσμου</span>: <span class="ital">before the foundation of the world</span>. This is the only occurrence of this particular expression in the Pauline writings, but it occurs also once in John (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-24.htm" title="Father, I will that they also, whom you have given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which you have given me: for you loved me before the foundation of the world.">John 17:24</a>) and once in Peter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-20.htm" title="Who truly was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you,">1 Peter 1:20</a>). It is akin to the form <span class="greekheb">ἀπὸ καταβολῆς</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-35.htm" title="That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world.">Matthew 13:35</a>, omitting <span class="greekheb">κόσμου</span> with LTTrWHR <span class="ital">marg.</span>), <span class="greekheb">ἀπὸ καταβολῆς κόσμου</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-50.htm" title="That the blood of all the prophets, which was shed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation;">Luke 11:50</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-3.htm" title="For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest: although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.">Hebrews 4:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-8.htm" title="And all that dwell on the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.">Revelation 13:8</a>); as also to these phrases: <span class="greekheb">ἀπʼ ἀρχῆς</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-13.htm" title="For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when you received the word of God which you heard of us, you received it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectually works also in you that believe.">1 Thessalonians 2:13</a>), <span class="greekheb">πρὸ τῶν αἰώνων</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-7.htm" title="But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world to our glory:">1 Corinthians 2:7</a>), <span class="greekheb">πρὸ χρόνων αἰωνίων</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-9.htm" title="Who has saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began,">2 Timothy 1:9</a>). It expresses most definitely the fact that the <span class="ital">election</span> in question is not the setting apart of certain persons at a definite period, an act in time, a <span class="ital">historical</span> selection, as some (<span class="ital">e.g.</span>, Beys.) strive to prove, but an eternal choice, a determination of the Divine Mind before all time. The idea of the Divine election in the NT is not a philosophical idea expressing the ultimate explanation of the system of things or giving the <span class="ital">rationale</span> of the story of the human race as such, but a religious idea, a note of grace, expressing the fact that salvation is originally and wholly of God. In Pauline teaching the subjects of this Divine election are neither the Church as such (Ritschl), nor mankind as such (Beck), but Christian men and women, designated as <span class="greekheb">ἡμεῖς</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὑμεῖς</span>. It is, as is here clearly intimated, an eternal determination of the Divine Will, and it has its ground in the freedom of God, not in anything foreseen in its subjects. Of a prevision of faith as the basis or motive of the election there is no indication here. On the contrary, the character or distinguishing inward quality of the subjects of the election is presented in the next clause as the <span class="ital">object</span> of the election, the end it had in view. (See especially Haupt, <span class="ital">in loc.</span>)—<span class="greekheb">εἶναι ἡμᾶς ἁγίους καὶ ἀμώμους</span>: <span class="ital">that we should be holy and without blemish</span>. The election, therefore, had a definite purpose before it—the <span class="ital">making</span> of its subjects <span class="greekheb">ἁγίους καὶ ἀμώμους</span>. The simple infinitive is freely used to express the idea of <span class="ital">purpose</span> or <span class="ital">design</span> not only in the NT but in classical Greek (Soph., <span class="ital">Oed. Col.</span>, 12; Thuc., i., 50, iv., 8; Herod., vii., 208, etc.; <span class="ital">cf.</span> Winer-Moult. <span class="ital">Gram.</span>, p. 399). On the <span class="greekheb">ἁγίους</span> see under <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-1.htm" title="Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the saints which are at Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ Jesus:">Ephesians 1:1</a>. There is a question, however, as to the precise sense of <span class="greekheb">ἀμώμους</span>. The adjective means both “without blame” (<span class="ital">inculpatus</span>) and “without blemish” (<span class="ital">immaculatus</span>). In the LXX it is a sacrificial term, applied in the latter sense to victims (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-1.htm" title="And this is the thing that you shall do to them to hallow them, to minister to me in the priest's office: Take one young bullock, and two rams without blemish,">Exodus 29:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-3.htm" title="If his offering be a burnt sacrifice of the herd, let him offer a male without blemish: he shall offer it of his own voluntary will at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD.">Leviticus 1:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-10.htm" title="And if his offering be of the flocks, namely, of the sheep, or of the goats, for a burnt sacrifice; he shall bring it a male without blemish.">Leviticus 1:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/3-1.htm" title="And if his oblation be a sacrifice of peace offering, if he offer it of the herd; whether it be a male or female, he shall offer it without blemish before the LORD.">Leviticus 3:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/3-6.htm" title="And if his offering for a sacrifice of peace offering to the LORD be of the flock; male or female, he shall offer it without blemish.">Leviticus 3:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/3-9.htm" title="And he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering an offering made by fire to the LORD; the fat thereof, and the whole rump, it shall he take off hard by the backbone; and the fat that covers the inwards, and all the fat that is on the inwards,...">Leviticus 3:9-10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/22-19.htm" title="You shall offer at your own will a male without blemish, of the beeves, of the sheep, or of the goats.">Leviticus 22:19</a>, etc.). It has this sense of “without blemish” also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-14.htm" title="How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?">Hebrews 9:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-19.htm" title="But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot:">1 Peter 1:19</a>; <span class="ital">cf.</span> the use of the noun in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-13.htm" title="And shall receive the reward of unrighteousness, as they that count it pleasure to riot in the day time. Spots they are and blemishes, sporting themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with you;">2 Peter 2:13</a>. In the Pauline writings it is found, in addition to the present passage, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-27.htm" title="That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.">Ephesians 5:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-15.htm" title="That you may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the middle of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom you shine as lights in the world;">Php 2:15</a> (according to the best reading); <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-22.htm" title=" In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and blameless and unreproveable in his sight:">Colossians 1:22</a>. In the first and third of these occurrences it is rendered by the RV “without blemish,” in the second, “blameless”. On the ground of usage, especially in the LXX, many commentators conclude for the second sense. Light., <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, takes the point of the two adjectives to be that the former denotes the <span class="ital">consecration</span> of the victim and the latter its <span class="ital">fitness</span> for the consecration (<span class="ital">Notes on Epistles of Paul</span>, p. 313). The Vulg. gives <span class="ital">immaculati</span>, and Wycl. “without <span class="ital">wene</span>”. On the other hand, there is nothing in the verse to suggest the idea of <span class="ital">sacrifice</span> or a <span class="ital">victim</span>. The parallel passage, also, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-22.htm" title=" In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and blameless and unreproveable in his sight:">Colossians 1:22</a>, where we have not only <span class="greekheb">ἁγίους</span> and <span class="greekheb">ἀμώμους</span> but a third adjective <span class="greekheb">ἀνεγκλήτους</span>, is on the whole on the side of “blameless”. That, too, is the meaning of the word in classical Greek (<span class="ital">e.g.</span>, Herod, ii., 177), and in inscriptions (C. I., 1974). Little indeed depends on the decision between the two senses; for both terms, “without blemish” and “without blame,” may have <span class="ital">ethical</span> applications. There is the further question, however, whether in this statement Paul has in view the <span class="ital">standing</span> of believers or their <span class="ital">character</span>—whether he thinks of them as justified or as designed to be sanctified. The arguments in support of the objective relation to God being a view here (Mey., Haupt, etc.) are weighty. It is held, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, that <span class="greekheb">γίγνεσθαι</span> would be more appropriate than <span class="greekheb">εἶναι</span> if the personal sanctification of believers was in the writer’s mind; that in that case the <span class="greekheb">ἐν ἀγάπῃ</span> would more naturally have come in <span class="ital">before</span> the <span class="greekheb">κατενώπιον αὐτοῦ</span>; above all, that the tenor of the section as a whole is on the side of the first view, the idea all through the paragraph (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/1-3.htm" title="Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ:...">Ephesians 1:3-14</a>) being what God does for us, not what we are now or are meant to be inwardly to Him, and the objective facts of the forgiveness of sin, adoption, etc., being clearly introduced in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-7.htm" title="In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace;">Ephesians 1:7</a> ff. On the other hand the ethical sense is strongly advocated by many (Chrys., Theophy., Alf., Ell., Candl., Abb., etc.) on the broad ground that it is so much Paul’s way to point us to newness and holiness of life as the great end of the Divine purpose and the Divine call (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-15.htm" title="That you may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the middle of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom you shine as lights in the world;">Php 2:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-7.htm" title="For God has not called us to uncleanness, but to holiness.">1 Thessalonians 4:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-13.htm" title="But we are bound to give thanks always to God for you, brothers beloved of the Lord, because God has from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth:">2 Thessalonians 2:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-14.htm" title="Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify to himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.">Titus 2:14</a>). This is supported further by the presence of the qualifying <span class="greekheb">ἐν ἀγάπῃ</span>, if it is attached to <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-4.htm" title="According as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love:">Ephesians 1:4</a>; and by the weighty consideration that the <span class="greekheb">ἁγίους καὶ ἀμώμους καὶ ἀνεγκλήτους</span> in the parallel passage in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-22.htm" title=" In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and blameless and unreproveable in his sight:">Colossians 1:22</a> is followed immediately by a reference to continuing “in the faith, grounded and stedfast, and not moved away from the hope of the Gospel”. Something depends, however, on the position of the following <span class="greekheb">ἐν ἀγάπῃ</span>, on which see below.—<span class="greekheb">κατενώπιον αὐτοῦ</span>: <span class="ital">before Him</span>; that is, before God. Read <span class="greekheb">αὐτοῦ</span>, not (as Harl., etc.) <span class="greekheb">αὑτοῦ</span>; see Winer-Moul., <span class="ital">Gram.</span>, pp. 188, 189. So, too, in the parallel passage <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-22.htm" title=" In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and blameless and unreproveable in his sight:">Colossians 1:22</a>. The present approbation of God is in view, not His future judgment. Light, thinks that God Himself is thus regarded as the great <span class="greekheb">μωμοσκόπος</span>, who inspects the victims and takes cognizance of blemishes. But this is to import a priestly notion which is not expressed in the context. This phrase might be specially appropriate to the idea of the <span class="ital">standing</span> or <span class="ital">relation</span> of believers as supposed to be conveyed by <span class="greekheb">ἀμώμους</span>. But it also suits the idea of <span class="ital">character</span>—<span class="greekheb">ἀμώμους</span> “in God’s sight,” “under the eye of God as Witness and Judge, and so <span class="ital">in truth and reality</span>”. The terms <span class="greekheb">ἐνώπιον</span>, <span class="greekheb">κατενώπιον</span>, <span class="greekheb">κατέναντι</span> are also used in this sense in the NT, and do not appear to occur in profane Greek. They are peculiar to the LXX, the <span class="ital">Apocrypha</span>, and the NT. All three are used by Paul, <span class="greekheb">κατενώπιον</span> and <span class="greekheb">κατέναντι</span> sparingly (the former only here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-22.htm" title=" In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and blameless and unreproveable in his sight:">Colossians 1:22</a>, the latter in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-17.htm" title="(As it is written, I have made you a father of many nations,) before him whom he believed, even God, who vivifies the dead, and calls those things which be not as though they were.">Romans 4:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-17.htm" title="For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ.">2 Corinthians 2:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-19.htm" title="Again, think you that we excuse ourselves to you? we speak before God in Christ: but we do all things, dearly beloved, for your edifying.">2 Corinthians 12:19</a>); most frequently <span class="greekheb">ἐνώπιον</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-20.htm" title="Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.">Romans 3:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-17.htm" title="Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the sight of all men.">Romans 12:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-22.htm" title="Have you faith? have it to yourself before God. Happy is he that comdemns not himself in that thing which he allows.">Romans 14:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-29.htm" title="That no flesh should glory in his presence.">1 Corinthians 1:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-2.htm" title="But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God.">2 Corinthians 4:2</a>, etc.), which is also much employed in Luke and Revelation, never in Matthew or Mark.—<span class="greekheb">ἐν ἀγάπῃ</span>: <span class="ital">in love</span>. What does this qualify? The divine <span class="ital">election</span>, say some (Œc.; etc.). But the remoteness of the <span class="greekheb">ἐν ἀγάπῃ</span> from the <span class="greekheb">ἐξελέξατο</span> makes this, if not an impracticable, at least a less likely connection. It is possible, indeed, also to retain the connection of the <span class="greekheb">ἐν ἀγάπῃ</span> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-4.htm" title="According as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love:">Ephesians 1:4</a> and yet give it the sense of the <span class="ital">Divine</span> love, if we take it to qualify not the <span class="greekheb">ἐξελέξατο</span> alone, but the whole clause which it concludes. In that case the idea would be that the electing act and the object it had in view, namely holiness and blamelessness on our part, were both due to God’s love and had their explanation in it. The choice, however, appears to be between attaching the clause to the preceding <span class="greekheb">ἁγίους καὶ ἀμώμους</span> and attaching it to the following <span class="greekheb">προορίσας</span>. Commentators and Versions are widely divided on the question. The former is the connection in LP, the Goth. and Copt. Vv., the Vulg., the texts of Stephens, WH, and the Revisers, and it is preferred by Eras., Luth., Beza, Calv., Grot., Wetst., Alf., Light. The latter is the connection in the Syr.-P, and is followed by LTTr <span class="ital">marg.</span>, RV <span class="ital">marg.</span>, Orig., Chrys., Thdrt., Theophy., August., Beng., Harl., de Wette, Olsh., Hof., Bleek., Mey., Ell., V. Sod., Haupt, Abbott, etc. The propriety of understanding the <span class="greekheb">ἐν ἀγάπῃ</span> as meant to qualify the <span class="greekheb">προορίσας</span> is urged on such grounds as these—that the Pauline Epistles furnish no other instance of <span class="greekheb">ἄγιος</span> or <span class="greekheb">ἄμωμος</span> having attached to it any <span class="ital">grace</span> or <span class="ital">virtue</span> defined by <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span> as the form in which the holiness or blamelessness shows itself (Haupt); that it is befitting that the <span class="ital">love</span> which is its principle and ground should get emphatic expression when the Divine <span class="greekheb">προορισμός</span> is first introduced (Ell., etc.); that this connection is most in harmony with the ascription of praise (Mey.), and with the genius of the paragraph as a whole, which is concerned with what God is to us rather than what we are required to be to Him. On the other hand in support of attaching the <span class="greekheb">ἐν ἀγάπῃ</span> to the preceding, it is pointed out that in view of the subsequent <span class="greekheb">κατʼ εὐδοκίαν</span> there is less reason for introducing <span class="greekheb">ἐν ἀγάπῃ</span> in so emphatic a position before the <span class="greekheb">προορίσας</span>; that, if not in the Pauline Epistles themselves, yet elsewhere both within and without the NT we have instances analogous to the connection of <span class="greekheb">ἐν ἀγάπῃ</span> with <span class="greekheb">ἀμώμους</span> here—<span class="ital">e.g.</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-14.htm" title="Why, beloved, seeing that you look for such things, be diligent that you may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless.">2 Peter 3:14</a>, <span class="greekheb">ἀμώμητοι</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἐν εἰρήνῃ</span>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-24.htm" title="And the spies saw a man come forth out of the city, and they said to him, Show us, we pray you, the entrance into the city, and we will show you mercy.">Judges 1:24</a>, <span class="greekheb">ἀμώμους ἐν ἀγαλλιάσει</span>; <span class="ital">Clem.

On the whole this connection is to be preferred, and the <span class="greekheb">ἐν ἀγάπῃ</span> will then define the holiness and blamelessness, which are the end and object of God’s election of us, as having their truth and perfection in the supreme Christian grace of love.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/ephesians/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">4</span>. <span class="ital">According as he hath chosen</span>, &c.] Better, <span class="bld">According as He chose</span>, &c. The time-reference is the same as just above; to the Divine premundane deed of purpose.—“<span class="ital">Chosen</span>”:—out of mankind. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-33.htm" title="Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifies.">Romans 8:33</a> and its context for commentary on the idea of the word. The word “elect” (chosen) is generally used in N. T. in connexions where the highest level of Divine purposes, or spiritual privileges, is in view. In the O. T., Israel is “My people, My chosen” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-20.htm" title="The beast of the field shall honor me, the dragons and the owls: because I give waters in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert, to give drink to my people, my chosen.">Isaiah 43:20</a>). In the N. T. the chosen are “the Israel of God” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-16.htm" title="And as many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them, and mercy, and on the Israel of God.">Galatians 6:16</a>; cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-29.htm" title="And if you be Christ's, then are you Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.">Galatians 3:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-11.htm" title="And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed to them also:">Romans 4:11</a>). As with the Old so with the New Israel the choice is emphatically sovereign; “not according to our works” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-9.htm" title="Who has saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began,">2 Timothy 1:9</a>). On the other hand, it <span class="ital">takes effect through means;</span> a truth perfectly harmonious with sovereign purpose, while often conveyed in the language of ordinary contingency. Cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-10.htm" title="Therefore I endure all things for the elect's sakes, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.">2 Timothy 2:10</a>; and, by way of illustration, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-22.htm" title="And now I exhort you to be of good cheer: for there shall be no loss of any man's life among you, but of the ship.">Acts 27:22</a> with 31.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">before the foundation of the world</span>] For the identical phrase, cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-24.htm" title="Father, I will that they also, whom you have given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which you have given me: for you loved me before the foundation of the world.">John 17:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-20.htm" title="Who truly was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you,">1 Peter 1:20</a>. “<span class="ital">From</span> the foundation, &c.” occurs, among other places, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-50.htm" title="That the blood of all the prophets, which was shed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation;">Luke 11:50</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-3.htm" title="For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest: although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.">Hebrews 4:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-26.htm" title="For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world has he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.">Hebrews 9:26</a>, where the apparent meaning is “since the beginning of <span class="ital">human</span> time.” But with the word “before”, as here, the context always suggests the highest reference; “before <span class="ital">any created</span> being began.” Cp. the parallel phrases “before the ages (<span class="ital">œons</span>)” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-7.htm" title="But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world to our glory:">1 Corinthians 2:7</a>); “before eternal (<span class="ital">œonian</span>) times” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-9.htm" title="Who has saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began,">2 Timothy 1:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-2.htm" title="In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began;">Titus 1:2</a>); and see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-25.htm" title="Now to him that is of power to establish you according to my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery, which was kept secret since the world began,">Romans 16:25</a>. Every genuine scientific discovery of vast antiquity in material nature throws a true though faint light on the grandeur of such words of Revelation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">that we should be</span>, &c.] This clause, taken in itself, is of ambiguous reference. It may bear either (1) on the intended personal spiritual <span class="ital">state</span> of the elect, whether in this life, or in the life eternal, or in both; or (2) on their intended <span class="ital">standing</span>, as they are viewed as “in Christ,” their Covenant Head. In the first case it would convey the undoubted truth that the intention of the electing Father is a real and universal personal holiness, perfect in this life in principle and motive (cp. e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-48.htm" title="Be you therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.">Matthew 5:48</a>; below, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-24.htm" title="And that you put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.">Ephesians 4:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-12.htm" title=" Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, long-suffering;">Colossians 3:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-23.htm" title="And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.">1 Thessalonians 5:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_peter/1-15.htm" title="But as he which has called you is holy, so be you holy in all manner of conversation;...">1 Peter 1:15-16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-3.htm" title="And every man that has this hope in him purifies himself, even as he is pure.">1 John 3:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-6.htm" title="Whoever stays in him sins not: whoever sins has not seen him, neither known him.">1 John 3:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-9.htm" title="Whoever is born of God does not commit sin; for his seed remains in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.">1 John 3:9</a>), and, in the life eternal, in attainment (cp. e.g. ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-27.htm" title="That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.">Ephesians 5:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-22.htm" title="And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness.">Romans 4:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-2.htm" title="Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it does not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.">1 John 3:2</a>; Jude 24). Cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-7.htm" title="For God has not called us to uncleanness, but to holiness.">1 Thessalonians 4:7</a> (where the “<span class="ital">call</span>” closely corresponds to the “<span class="ital">choice</span>” here, as to the persons in view), and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-13.htm" title="But we are bound to give thanks always to God for you, brothers beloved of the Lord, because God has from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth:">2 Thessalonians 2:13</a>, a remarkable parallel. In the second case the clause would mean that the elect are to be viewed as holy and spotless because identified, for purposes of acceptance, with their absolutely holy Head and Representative, “in Whom” they stand. Cp. for illustration the whole range of passages where believers are said to have “died and risen with Christ,” in respect of atonement and justification, e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-2.htm" title="God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?">Romans 6:2</a>, &c.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-1.htm" title=" If you then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sits on the right hand of God.">Colossians 3:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-3.htm" title=" For you are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.">Colossians 3:3</a>. (And see Article XI. of the Church of England.) On the whole the powerful argument of context decides the ambiguity for the <span class="ital">second</span> alternative. The thought throughout this passage is of the relation of the elect to Christ as their Head and Representative in the pre-mundane Covenant of the Father and the Son. We may explain accordingly, “that we should stand, in the judgment of eternal and absolute Holiness, accepted and satisfactory because united to Christ.” Such a truth is only one aspect, but an all-important one, of the great Truth of Salvation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in love</span>] I.e., in the embrace of that Divine Love which gave, and sustains, our position (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-1.htm" title="Behold, what manner of love the Father has bestowed on us, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knows us not, because it knew him not.">1 John 3:1</a>). If we connect “in love” with the words previous (as A. V.), and explain those words as above, this must be the meaning. Many expositors, however, ancient and modern, and the important Peshito Syriac Version (cent. 2), connect “in love” with the words <span class="ital">following;</span> “in love having predestinated, &c.” So margin, R.V. But the cadence of the Greek is in favour of the ordinary connexion.—In questions of punctuation in the Greek Testament it must be remembered that the oldest MSS. are scarcely punctuated at all, and the decision must rest accordingly with grammar, context, or the like.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/ephesians/1.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-4.htm" title="According as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love:">Ephesians 1:4</a>. <span class="greekheb">Καθὼς ἐξελέξατο ἡμᾶς</span>, <span class="ital">according as He has chosen us</span>) <span class="ital">The blessing</span> corresponds to <span class="ital">the</span> [prior] <span class="ital">election</span>, and follows upon it and makes it manifest.—<span class="greekheb">ἐν Αὐτῷ</span>, <span class="ital">in Him</span>) <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-11.htm" title="According to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord:">Ephesians 3:11</a>.

The Father chose the heirs of salvation, selected those who were to be quickened from the dead (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-1.htm">Ephesians 2:1</a>) and saved, they chose them <span class="accented">in Christ - in</span> connection with his work and office as Mediator, giving them to him to be re-decreed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-11.htm">John 17:11, 12</a>); not after man was created, nor after man had fallen, but "before the foundation of the world." We are here face to face with a profound mystery. Before even the world was founded, mankind presented themselves to God as lost; the work of redemption was planned and its details arranged from all eternity. Before such a mystery it becomes us to put the shoes from off our feet, and bow reverently before him whose "judgments are unsearchable and his ways past finding out." <span class="cmt_word">That we should be holy and without blame before him in love.</span> This is obviously the design of God's electing act; <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x31;&#x46;&#x43;&#x30;&#x3b;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span> cannot denote the ground, but the purpose, of the choice. God did not choose some because he foresaw their holiness, but in order that they might become "holy and without blame." These two terms denote the positive and negative sides of purity: holy - possessed of all the fruits of the Spirit (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22, 23</a>); without blame, or blemish - marked by no stain or imperfection (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-27.htm">Ephesians 5:27</a>). The terms do not denote justification, but a condition of sanctification which implies justification already bestowed, but goes beyond it; our justification is a step towards our complete final sanctification. This renewal being "before him," must be such as to bear the scrutiny of his eye; therefore not external or superficial merely, but reaching to the very heart and center of our nature (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>). The expression further denotes how it is of the very nature and glory of the new life to be spent in God's presence, our souls flourishing in the precious sunshine which ever beams out there from. For, when thus renewed, we do not fly from his presence like Adam (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-8.htm">Genesis 3:8</a>), but delight in it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-1.htm">Psalm 42:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/63-1.htm">Psalm 63:1</a>). Fear is changed to love (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-18.htm">1 John 4:18</a>); the loving relation between us and God is restored. It has been much disputed whether the words <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x1fc3;</span> ought to be construed with the fourth verse or with <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> in the fifth. The weight of authority seems in favor of the latter; but we prefer the construction which is given both in the Authorized and the Revised Version, first, because if <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x1fc3;</span> qualified <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, it would come more naturally after it; and second, because the scope of the passage, the train of the apostle's thought, seems to require us to keep <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x1fc3;</span> in ver. 4. We never could come to be holy and without blemish before God unless the loving relations between us were restored (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-17.htm">Ephesians 3:17</a>, "Rooted and grounded in love"). The spirit of love, trust, admiration, directed to God helps our complete sanctification - changes us into the same image (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-18.htm">2 Corinthians 3:18</a>). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/ephesians/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Even as (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#768;&#x3c2;)<p>Explaining blessed us, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-3.htm">Ephesians 1:3</a>.
