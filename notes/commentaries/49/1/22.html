In this passage these words fill up the picture of our Lord’s transcendent dignity, by the declaration of the actual subjugation of all the powers of sin and death, rising up against Him, in the spiritual war which is to go on till the appointed end. They therefore form a natural link between the description of His lordship over all created being, and of His headship over the Church, militant on earth, as well as triumphant in heaven.<p><span class= "bld">And gave</span> <span class= "bld">him to be the head over all things to the church, which is his body.</span>—This is the first time that this celebrated phrase is used, describing Christ as the Head, and viewing the Church as a whole as His body. It is characteristic that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-3.htm" title="But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God.">1Corinthians 11:3</a>, Christ is called “the Head of each man,” as “the man of the woman;” whereas in this Epistle Christ is the Head of the whole Church, on occasion of the same comparison (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-23.htm" title="For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the savior of the body.">Ephesians 5:23</a>). The consideration of all Christians as the “body of Christ” is indeed found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-4.htm" title="For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office:">Romans 12:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/12-12.htm" title="For as the body is one, and has many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ.">1Corinthians 12:12-27</a> : but it is notable that in these passages the leading idea is, first, of the individuality of each member, and then, secondarily, of their union in one body; and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-21.htm" title="And the eye cannot say to the hand, I have no need of you: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.">1Corinthians 12:21</a>, “the head and the foot,” just as much as “the eye and the hand,” are simply looked upon as members. (Comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-15.htm" title="Know you not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an harlot? God forbid.">1Corinthians 6:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-17.htm" title="For we being many are one bread, and one body: for we are all partakers of that one bread.">1Corinthians 10:17</a>.) Here, in accordance with the great doctrine of this Epistle—the unity of the whole of humanity and of the whole Church, ideally co-extensive with that humanity, with Christ—the metaphor is changed. The body is looked upon as a whole, Christ as its Head. The idea is wrought out again and again (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/4-15.htm" title="But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ:">Ephesians 4:15-16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-28.htm" title="So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loves his wife loves himself.">Ephesians 5:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-18.htm" title=" And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence.">Colossians 1:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-19.htm" title=" And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increases with the increase of God.">Colossians 2:19</a>) in these Epistles of the Captivity. It is from these that it has become a household word in all Christian theology. With some variation it is expressed also in other metaphors—the building and the corner-stone, the bride and the bridegroom. But under the title of the “Head” Christ is looked upon especially in His ruling, guiding, originating power over the Church. Probably the idea of His being the seat of its life, though not excluded, is secondary; whereas in His own figure of the vine and the branches (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-6.htm" title="But because I have said these things to you, sorrow has filled your heart.">John 16:6</a>) it is primary.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/ephesians/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/1-22.htm" title="And has put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church,...">Ephesians 1:22-23</a></span>. <span class="ital">And hath put </span>— Greek, <span class="greekheb">υπεταξεν</span>, <span class="ital">hath subjected; all things under his feet </span>— This is said in allusion to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110-1.htm" title="The LORD said to my Lord, Sit you at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool.">Psalm 110:1</a>, <span class="ital">Till I make thine enemies thy footstool. </span>The psalm is a prophecy, not only of Christ’s exaltation to universal dominion in the human nature, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-27.htm" title="For he has put all things under his feet. But when he said all things are put under him, it is manifest that he is excepted, which did put all things under him.">1 Corinthians 15:27</a>,) but also of the entire subjection of all his enemies, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-25.htm" title="For he must reign, till he has put all enemies under his feet.">1 Corinthians 15:25</a>. For in ancient times conquerors put their feet on the necks of their enemies in token of their subjection, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/joshua/10-23.htm" title="And they did so, and brought forth those five kings to him out of the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon....">Joshua 10:23-24</a>. <span class="ital">And gave him to be head over all things to the church </span>— As it is here declared that Christ is raised to universal dominion for the sake of his church, that is, for the noble purpose of erecting and establishing it, and uniting the angels who are in heaven, and all the good men, who have lived and are to live on earth, in one harmonious society, that they may worship and serve God together, and be happy in one another’s society to all eternity, it was necessary for accomplishing this grand purpose, that the evil angels should be subjected to him; and even that the material fabric of the world, with every thing it contains, should be under his direction, that he might order all the events befalling his people, in such a manner as to promote their holiness, and prepare them for heaven. Add to this, he is in such a sense made <span class="ital">head over all things to his church, </span>as to cause even its enemies, however undesignedly by them and unwillingly, to serve its interests; and all events, whether apparently prosperous or adverse, and all persons and things, <span class="ital">to work together for </span>the <span class="ital">good </span>of its members. To these he is a head, not merely of government, but likewise of guidance, life, and influence, as is implied in the next clause. <span class="ital">Which is his body </span>— The church is called the body of Christ, to signify that the true and living members thereof are united to, and animated by him; that they are under his direction, and the objects of his care, and that they are united to one another in love, after the manner of the members of the human body, which are governed by the head, and united to one another by various joints, ligaments, nerves, arteries, veins, and other vessels of communication and intercourse. <span class="ital">The fulness of him that filleth all in all </span>— This expression may mean that his church, that is, the spiritual part of it, is <span class="ital">completed, </span>or <span class="ital">completely filled </span>by him, namely, with all sorts of gifts and graces. So Locke understands it. Thus believers are said to receive out of Christ’s fulness, <span class="ital">grace for, </span>or <span class="ital">upon grace. </span>Macknight, however, takes the clause in a different sense, observing, that by calling the church <span class="greekheb">το πληρωμα</span>, <span class="ital">the fulness of Christ, </span>the apostle intimates, that he who is universal Lord would want a principal part of his subjects, if the church among men on earth were not united and subjected to him as its head. <span class="ital">Who filleth all in all </span>— That is, who filleth all his members with all their spiritual gifts and graces, according to the place and office in his body which he hath assigned them. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:15-23 God has laid up spiritual blessings for us in his Son the Lord Jesus; but requires us to draw them out and fetch them in by prayer. Even the best Christians need to be prayed for: and while we hear of the welfare of Christian friends, we should pray for them. Even true believers greatly want heavenly wisdom. Are not the best of us unwilling to come under God's yoke, though there is no other way to find rest for the soul? Do we not for a little pleasure often part with our peace? And if we dispute less, and prayed more with and for each other, we should daily see more and more what is the hope of our calling, and the riches of the Divine glory in this inheritance. It is desirable to feel the mighty power of Divine grace, beginning and carrying on the work of faith in our souls. But it is difficult to bring a soul to believe fully in Christ, and to venture its all, and the hope of eternal life, upon his righteousness. Nothing less than Almighty power will work this in us. Here is signified that it is Christ the Saviour, who supplies all the necessities of those who trust in him, and gives them all blessings in the richest abundance. And by being partakers of Christ himself, we come to be filled with the fulness of grace and glory in him. How then do those forget themselves who seek for righteousness out of him! This teaches us to come to Christ. And did we know what we are called to, and what we might find in him, surely we should come and be suitors to him. When feeling our weakness and the power of our enemies, we most perceive the greatness of that mighty power which effects the conversion of the believer, and is engaged to perfect his salvation. Surely this will constrain us by love to live to our Redeemer's glory.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ephesians/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And hath put all things under his feet - See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-27.htm">1 Corinthians 15:27</a>.<p>And gave him to be the head over all things - Appointed him to be the supreme ruler.<p>To the church - With reference to the church, or for ira benefit and welfare: see the notes or, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-2.htm">John 17:2</a>.

The Greek order is emphatic: "HIM He gave as Head over all things to the Church." Had it been anyone save Him, her Head, it would not have been the boon it is to the Church. But as He is Head over all things who is also her Head (and she the body), all things are hers (1Co 3:21-23). He is OVER ("far above") all things; in contrast to the words, "TO the Church," namely, for her advantage. The former are subject; the latter is joined with Him in His dominion over them. "Head" implies not only His dominion, but our union; therefore, while we look upon Him at the right hand of God, we see ourselves in heaven (Re 3:21).

Hence rather: <span class="ital">and Him He gave as Head over all things</span> (to which position, as just shown, He had exalted Him) <span class="ital">to the church</span> (Christians as a whole). Since He, <span class="ital">as Head over all things</span>, was given to the church, it is obvious that He was to belong to her in a very special sense <span class="ital">as</span> her own <span class="ital">Head</span>; hence it is, in accordance with a well-known <span class="ital">breviloquentia</span> (Matthiae, p. 1533; Kühner, II. p. 602), unnecessary to supply <span class="greekheb">κεφαλήν</span> again before <span class="greekheb">τῇ ἐκκλ</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[117] Hofmann no doubt thinks that, if <span class="greekheb">ἔδωκε τῇ ἐκκλησίᾳ</span>, were to be taken together, Paul would not have inserted <span class="greekheb">κεφαλ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὑπὲρ πάντα</span>. But why not? The very position assigned to <span class="greekheb">κεφ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὑπ</span>. <span class="greekheb">π</span>., as placed apart from <span class="greekheb">αὐτόν</span>, is in keeping with the importance of this definition of quality, which at the same time, so placed, brings together with striking emphasis <span class="greekheb">ὑπὲρ πάντα</span> and <span class="greekheb">τῆ ἐκκλ</span>. Christ has He given as Head over <span class="ital">all things</span> to <span class="ital">the church</span>. So high and august is His esteem for it!<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/ephesians/1.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-22.htm" title="And has put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church,">Ephesians 1:22</a>. <span class="greekheb">καὶ πάντα ὑπέταξεν ὑπὸ τοὺς πόδας αὐτοῦ</span>: <span class="ital">and He put all things under His feet</span>. The <span class="greekheb">ὑπέταξεν</span> is coordinate with the previous <span class="greekheb">ἐνήργησε</span>. These two things God did: He wrought His mighty power in raising and exalting Christ and He subjected all things to Him. The idea expressed by the <span class="greekheb">ὑπέταξεν</span> here is not the limited idea of a subjection of opposing objects, which we have in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-27.htm" title="For he has put all things under his feet. But when he said all things are put under him, it is manifest that he is excepted, which did put all things under him.">1 Corinthians 15:27</a>, but the wider idea of placing all created things under the sovereignty of Christ. The words recall those of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/8-7.htm" title="All sheep and oxen, yes, and the beasts of the field;">Psalm 8:7</a>, but do not give these in the form of a quotation. That Psalm speaks of Man as he was meant by God to be, with dominion over all the creatures. Here that ideal is presented as made real in Christ, the exalted, sovereign Christ. The act referred to, therefore, by the aor. <span class="greekheb">ὑπέταξεν</span> may be the definite gift of absolute dominion consequent on the exaltation. The raising of Christ to God’s right hand was followed by the placing of all things under His feet and making Him, <span class="ital">de facto</span>, sovereign over all.—<span class="greekheb">καὶ αὐτὸν ἔδωκεν κεφαλὴν ὑπὲρ πάντα τῇ ἐκκλησίᾳ</span>: <span class="ital">and gave Him as head over all things to the Church</span>. The RV agrees with the AV and the Bishops’ Bible in rendering it “and gave Him <span class="ital">to be</span> head”. Tynd. and Cran. have “hath made Him above all things the head”; the Rhemish, “hath made Him head over all the Church”. The two ideas of Christ’s Headship over all things and His Headship over the Church appear to be in the statement. The question is how they are related, and what is the precise idea attaching to each of the significant terms. The <span class="greekheb">ἔδωκεν</span> is not to be taken in the technical sense of <span class="ital">appointed, installed</span> (as expressed by <span class="greekheb">נָתַן</span>, <span class="greekheb">τιθέναι</span>), but, as is indicated by the simple dat. <span class="greekheb">ἐκκλησίᾳ</span>, in its ordinary sense of <span class="ital">gave</span>. Christ in the capacity or position here ascribed to Him is presented as a <span class="ital">gift</span> of God to the Church. Having exalted Him to the highest and invested Him with supreme dominion, God <span class="ital">gives</span> Him to the Church. The <span class="greekheb">πάντα</span> in <span class="greekheb">ὑπὲρ πάντα</span> must have the sense it has in <span class="greekheb">πάντα ὑπέταξεν</span>, not “all <span class="ital">authorities</span>,” but “all <span class="ital">things</span>”. The <span class="greekheb">κεφαλή</span>, therefore, must express an absolute headship over all the created world, visible and invisible, not a particular, higher headship over other subordinate headships, Apostles, Bishops, etc., in the Church. Further, as the subsequent statement about the <span class="greekheb">σῶμα</span> shows, it must have the full sense of <span class="ital">head</span>, organic head, and neither that of <span class="ital">sum</span> nor that of <span class="ital">highest dignity</span> only. The term <span class="greekheb">ἐκκλησία</span>, again, obviously has here its widest Christian sense. Used by the Greeks to designate an <span class="ital">assembly of the people called for deliberation</span> (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-39.htm" title="But if you inquire any thing concerning other matters, it shall be determined in a lawful assembly.">Acts 19:39</a>), and by the LXX as the equivalent of the Hebrew <span class="greekheb">קָהָל</span>, the <span class="ital">congregation of Israel</span>, especially when called in religious convention (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-30.htm" title="And Moses spoke in the ears of all the congregation of Israel the words of this song, until they were ended.">Deuteronomy 31:30</a>, etc.), it expresses in the NT the idea of the fellowship or assembly of believers meeting for worship or for administration. And it expresses this in various degrees of extension, ranging from the small company gathering for worship in one’s house (the <span class="greekheb">ἐκκλησία κατʼ οἶκον</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-5.htm" title="Likewise greet the church that is in their house. Salute my well-beloved Epaenetus, who is the first fruits of Achaia to Christ.">Romans 16:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-19.htm" title="The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house.">1 Corinthians 16:19</a>, etc.), or the single congregation of village or city (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-11.htm" title="And great fear came on all the church, and on as many as heard these things.">Acts 5:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-3.htm" title="As for Saul, he made havoc of the church, entering into every house, and haling men and women committed them to prison.">Acts 8:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-17.htm" title="For this cause have I sent to you Timotheus, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ, as I teach every where in every church.">1 Corinthians 4:17</a>, etc.), to the larger Christian communities of provinces and countries (<span class="greekheb">τῆς Ἀσίας</span>, <span class="greekheb">Γαλατίας</span>, <span class="greekheb">Ἰουδαίας</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-1.htm" title="Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, even so do you.">1 Corinthians 16:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-19.htm" title="The churches of Asia salute you.

Here and in the other occurrences in this Epistle the word has this largest extension of meaning, with the further mystical idea of a unity vitally related to Christ, incorporated in Him, and having His life in it. If the terms then are to be so understood, how is their connection in the sentence to be construed? The <span class="greekheb">τῇ ἐκκλησία</span> is immediately dependent on <span class="greekheb">ἔδωκεν</span>, and cannot well be taken as a <span class="ital">dat. commodi</span>=“for the good of the Church” (De Wette), as if it were attached immediately to the <span class="greekheb">ὑπὲρ πάντα</span>. The <span class="greekheb">κεφαλὴν ὑπὲρ πάντα</span> may then be taken either as in <span class="ital">apposition</span> to <span class="greekheb">αὐτόν</span>—“gave Him, head over all things, to the Church,” <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, gave Him, <span class="ital">this</span> head over all things, to the Church (Chrys., Stier, etc.); or as having a predicative force—“gave Him as head overall things” (Ell., etc.). The latter is to be preferred both as the easier construction and as more congruous with the anarthrous <span class="greekheb">κεφαλήν</span>. Thus the purport of the clause is that God, in giving Christ to the Church, gave Him in <span class="ital">the capacity</span> of Head over all things. There is no distinction or comparison, therefore, between two headships, as if one were over the world or over the state, and the other over the Church. Christ’s Headship over the Church, so far as this clause is concerned, is rather implied than expressed. The idea of the Headship over the Church is more distinctly conveyed by the sentence which follows, with the further description of the Church as the <span class="greekheb">σῶμα Χριστου</span>. Here the great idea is still that of the Headship of Christ over all things. Having that supremacy He is given by God to the Church, and as given in the capacity of universal Head He is given to the Church as her Head also.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/ephesians/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">22</span>. <span class="ital">and hath put</span>] Lit. <span class="bld">and did put</span>; at the great act of Enthronement after Resurrection.

The ascended Lord presides over His Church, but more—He is to it the constant Cause and mighty Source of spiritual vitality. “Because He lives, it lives also.” Its organization grows from Him, and refers to Him. Cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-3.htm" title="But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God.">1 Corinthians 11:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-18.htm" title=" And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence.">Colossians 1:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-10.htm" title=" And you are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power:">Colossians 2:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-19.htm" title=" And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increases with the increase of God.">Colossians 2:19</a>; and below, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-15.htm" title="But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ:">Ephesians 4:15</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-23.htm" title="For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the savior of the body.">Ephesians 5:23</a>. The idea, it will be seen, appears in this precise form (the Headship of the <span class="ital">Body</span>) only in Eph. and Col.; unless <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-21.htm" title="And the eye cannot say to the hand, I have no need of you: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.">1 Corinthians 12:21</a> is to be added.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">over all</span> things] I.e., immeasurably <span class="ital">beyond</span> anything else that can seem to claim headship; any fancied Power of quasi-philosophic systems.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the church</span>] This great word appears here in its highest reference, the Company of human beings “called out” (as the word <span class="ital">Ecclêsia</span> implies) from the fallen world into vital union with the glorified Christ. The word occurs nine times in this Epistle (here, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-10.htm" title="To the intent that now to the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God,">Ephesians 3:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-21.htm" title="To him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end.

As it stands here, the word rises above the level of visibility and external organization, and has to do supremely with direct spiritual relations between the Lord and the believing Company. In is, in fact, (see ch. 5), “the Bride, the Lamb’s Wife,” of the Revelation, only not as yet manifested in bridal splendour. It is “the called, justified, and glorified,” of Romans 8; “the Church of the Firstborn,” of Hebrews 12; “the royal priesthood, the people of possession,” of 1 Peter. All other meanings of the word Church are derived and modified from this, but this must not be modified by them. “The Church of Christ, which we properly term His body mystical, can be but one … a body mystical, because the mystery of their conjunction is removed altogether from sense. Whatsoever we read in Scripture concerning the endless love and saving mercy which God sheweth to His Church, the only proper subject thereof is this Church. Concerning this flock it is that our Lord and Saviour hath promised, ‘I give unto them eternal life, and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.’ They who are of this Society have such marks and notes of distinction from all others as are not objects unto our sense; only unto God who seeth their hearts … they are clear and manifest” (Hooker, <span class="ital">Eccles. Polity</span>, III. 1.) See further Appendix B.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">which is his body</span>] A metaphor which suggests not only vital union with the Head, but that the will of the Head is exercised through the members. They are His <span class="ital">instruments</span>.—A kindred but not identical use of the metaphor appears <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-5.htm" title="So we, being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another.">Romans 12:5</a>; “members <span class="ital">one of another;</span>” and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-17.htm" title="For we being many are one bread, and one body: for we are all partakers of that one bread.">1 Corinthians 10:17</a>. For closer parallels cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-24.htm" title=" Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake, which is the church:">Colossians 1:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-19.htm" title=" And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increases with the increase of God.">Colossians 2:19</a>; and below, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-16.htm" title="And that he might reconcile both to God in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby:">Ephesians 2:16</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-4.htm" title="There is one body, and one Spirit, even as you are called in one hope of your calling;">Ephesians 4:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-12.htm" title="For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ:">Ephesians 4:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-16.htm" title="From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplies, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, makes increase of the body to the edifying of itself in love.">Ephesians 4:16</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-23.htm" title="For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the savior of the body.">Ephesians 5:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-30.htm" title="For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.">Ephesians 5:30</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the fulness of him</span>, &c.] This mysterious phrase has been much discussed. On the whole the inferences have taken one or other of two main lines. The word “fulness” (<span class="ital">plerôma</span>), has been (1) explained to mean the <span class="ital">receptacle of fulness</span>, or <span class="ital">filled receptacle;</span> the vehicle, so to speak, in which the resources of the grace of Christ manifest their greatness, and which is filled by them. Among other pleas for this view is the fact that in some schools of the Gnosticism which so soon followed the apostolic age the <span class="ital">Plerôma</span> was the recognized term for the <span class="ital">home</span>, or <span class="ital">sphere</span>, of the great Emanations (<span class="ital">Æons</span>) of the Absolute Being (<span class="ital">Bythus</span>), and in one theory, of the Absolute Being Itself also. The word has been (2) held to mean, in all doctrinal passages of the N. T., substantially, the ideal fulness, or totality, of Divine attributes or graces; as certainly in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-9.htm" title=" For in him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.">Colossians 2:9</a>. Bp Lightfoot (<span class="ital">Colossians</span>, pp. 323–339) discusses the word in an exhaustive essay. He shews that <span class="ital">Plerôma</span> cannot naturally mean (as it has been taken to mean in some passages) <span class="ital">the thing which fills a void</span>. It is <span class="ital">the filled condition of a thing</span>, whether the thing be a rent to be mended, an idea to be realized, or a prophetic plan to be “fulfilled.” He shews further that the word had acquired a technical theological meaning in St Paul’s time, probably in the Palestinian schools of Jewish thought; a meaning connected especially with the eternally realized Ideal of Godhead; the Divine Fulness. This Fulness resides (by the Father’s will, yet necessarily,) in the Eternal Son (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-19.htm" title=" For it pleased the Father that in him should all fullness dwell;">Colossians 1:19</a>); and the Son, Incarnate, Sacrificed, and Risen, is so conjoined in spiritual Union to His regenerate Church that what is true of Him is true, within sacred limits, of her. As He without measure is the Fulfilment, or Ideal, of Divine Attributes, so she in measure is the Fulfilment, or Ideal, of Divine Graces; which are, we may venture to say, the Attributes in their reception and manifestation by the regenerate Church. She is the Body through which is realized the Will of the Head, the Fulfilment in which is realized the Grace of the Head.—It will be observed that the two interpretations of the word indicated in this note have an underlying connexion. See this curiously illustrated by Bp. Lightfoot (<span class="ital">Colossians</span>, pp. 331, &c.), from the history of Gnostic theories.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">that filleth all in all</span>] The reference is to the Son, Who is in view through the immediate context. His vital connexion with His true Church is such that it not only is the Receptacle of His Divine grace, but is actually pervaded everywhere by His spiritual omnipresence. The form (middle) of the verb suggests intensity and richness of action; a power which is indeed living and life-giving.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“<span class="ital">All in all:</span>”—in other words, He is the Cause of all the holiness that is in all His members; whatever in them is filled with grace, He fills it.—It seems needless to seek a remoter meaning, as, “filleth all things (<span class="ital">the universe</span>) with all things” (Alford).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The true Church, in its glorious Ideal, which is meanwhile its proper Reality, only not yet fully manifested, is thus presented in spiritual and eternal union with its exalted Head. The Apostle is now about to descend to the special instance of the bringing into it of its Ephesian members. Cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-21.htm" title=" And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now has he reconciled">Colossians 1:21</a>, &c.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>B. ST AUGUSTINE ON THE CHURCH. (Ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-22.htm" title="And has put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church,">Ephesians 1:22</a>.)<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>He is describing with general approval Tichonius’ <span class="ital">Book of the Seven Rules</span>[42] (for the elucidation of Scripture mysteries), and writes thus (<span class="ital">De Doctrinâ Christianâ</span>, iii. 32):—“The second Rule is that concerning the Lord’s <span class="ital">twofold Body</span> (<span class="ital">de Domini corpore bipartito</span>). The phrase is unsuitable, for that is not really the Lord’s Body which will not be with Him eternally. He should have said, ‘concerning the Lord’s true and commingled Body,’ or ‘true and feigned Body,’ or the like; for not only eternally, but now, hypocrites are not to be described as being with Him, however they may seem (<span class="ital">quamvis videantur</span>) to be in His Church. This rule demands a watchful reader; for [often] the Scripture, turning from one party to speak to, or about, another, seems to be still speaking to, or about, the first, as if the two constituted one Body, by reason of their temporal commingling and their equal share in sacraments.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[42] This book is extant.

It does not refer merely to defeated and arrested enemies, but to the whole of creation and the fullness thereof. They are as thoroughly under Christ and at his disposal as if they were literally under his feet. As a military commander, proceeding even through his own country, has power to requisition everything needful for his army, and deal with all property as may be required for military purposes, so Christ has the whole creation at his disposal, animate and inanimate, hostile and friendly. <span class="cmt_word">And gave him to be Head over all things to the Church.</span> The exaltation of Christ is not merely an honor conferred on himself, but has also a definite practical purpose; it is for the benefit of the Church. God gave him to the Church as Head over all things. The gift of Christ to the Church is the gift of One who has sovereign authority over all things. The official subordination of Christ to the Father is recognized throughout this remarkable passage. So in Philippians, though he was "in the form of God, and thought it not robbery to be equal with God, he made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men." It is this Jesus, in the form of a servant and in the likeness of men, that is now Head over all things, and as such given by the Father to the Church. With such a Head, what need the Church fear, and what can she want? <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/ephesians/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Put all things in subjection<p>Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15-18</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/8-5.htm">Psalm 8:5-8</a>.<p>Gave Him<p>Him is emphatic: and Him He gave.
