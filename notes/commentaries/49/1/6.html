He is pleased to consider His glory best realised in the spectacle of souls redeemed and regenerate by His grace, and to decree that it should be thus realised for our sakes. “Wherefore would He have us praise and glorify Him? It is that our love to Him may be kindled more fervently. He desires not our service, nor our praise, nor anything else except our salvation” (Chrysostom’s <span class= "ital">First Homily</span> on the Ephesians).<p><span class= "bld">Wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved.</span>—The verb here rendered “made us accepted,” is the same verb used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-28.htm" title="And the angel came in to her, and said, Hail, you that are highly favored, the Lord is with you: blessed are you among women.">Luke 1:28</a> (and nowhere else in the New Testament), where we translate “highly favoured.” Etymologically it means to “bestow grace upon;” the tense here is the past tense, not the perfect Hence the meaning is (in connection with the previous clause), “His grace, which He bestowed upon us in the Beloved”—in virtue of our unity with “His beloved Son, in whom He is well pleased” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-17.htm" title="And see a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.">Matthew 3:17</a>). This special title is given to our Lord to mark a connection with the “love” declared in the last verse to be the source of God’s predestination. It is a love to all mankind, as in God’s foreknowledge already made one with His beloved Son. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-23.htm" title="I in them, and you in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that you have sent me, and have loved them, as you have loved me.">John 17:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-25.htm" title="O righteous Father, the world has not known you: but I have known you, and these have known that you have sent me.">John 17:25</a>, “Thou hast loved them, as Thou hast loved Me . . . for Thou lovedst Me before the foundation of the world.”)<p>(2 <span class= "ital">b.</span>) <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/1-7.htm" title="In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace;">Ephesians 1:7-10</a> form the second section of this Introduction to the Epistle, linked to the former by the words, “in the Beloved.” From the declaration in the former section of the source of salvation in God’s love, it leads us on to the mystery of the Mediation of Jesus Christ, in Whom all Being is gathered up for redemption.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:3-8 Spiritual and heavenly blessings are the best blessings; with which we cannot be miserable, and without which we cannot but be so. This was from the choice of them in Christ, before the foundation of the world, that they should be made holy by separation from sin, being set apart to God, and sanctified by the Holy Spirit, in consequence of their election in Christ. All who are chosen to happiness as the end, are chosen to holiness as the means. In love they were predestinated, or fore-ordained, to be adopted as children of God by faith in Christ Jesus, and to be openly admitted to the privileges of that high relation to himself. The reconciled and adopted believer, the pardoned sinner, gives all the praise of his salvation to his gracious Father. His love appointed this method of redemption, spared not his own Son, and brought believers to hear and embrace this salvation. It was rich grace to provide such a surety as his own Son, and freely to deliver him up. This method of grace gives no encouragement to evil, but shows sin in all its hatefulness, and how it deserves vengeance. The believer's actions, as well as his words, declare the praises of Divine mercy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ephesians/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>To the praise of the glory of his grace - This is a Hebraism, and means the same as "to his glorious grace." The object was to excite thanksgiving for his glorious grace manifested in electing love. The real tendency of the doctrine in minds that are properly affected, is not to excite opposition to God, or to lead to the charge of partiality, tyranny, or severity; it is to excite thankfulness and praise. In accordance with this, Paul introduced the statement <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-3.htm">Ephesians 1:3</a> by saying that God was to be regarded as "blessed" for forming and executing this plan. The meaning is, that the doctrine of predestination and election lays the foundation of adoring gratitude and praise. This will appear plain by a few considerations.<p>(1) it is the only foundation of hope for man. If he were left to himself, all the race would reject, the offers of mercy and would perish. History, experience, and the Bible alike demonstrate this.<p>(2) all the joys which any of the human race have, are to be traced to the purpose of God to bestow them. Man has no power of originating any of them, and if God had not intended to confer them, none of them would have been possessed.<p>(3) all these favors are conferred on those who had no claim on God. The Christian who is pardoned had no claim on God for pardon; he who is admitted to heaven could urge no claim for such a privilege and honor; he who enjoys comfort and peace in the hour of death, enjoys it only through the glorious grace of God.<p>(4) "all" that is done by election is suited to excite praise. Election is to life, and pardon, and holiness, and heaven. But why should not a man praise God for these things? God chooses people to be holy, not sinful; to be happy, not miserable; to be pure, not impure; to be saved, not to be lost. For these things he should be praised. He should be praised that he has not left the whole race to wander away and die. Had he chosen but one to eternal life, that one should praise him, and all the holy universe should join in the praise. Should he now see it to be consistent to choose but one of the fallen spirits, and to make him pure, and to readmit him to heaven, that one spirit would have occasion for eternal thanks, and all heaven might join in his praises. How much more is praise due to him, when the number chosen is not one, or a few, but when millions which no man can number, shall be found to be chosen to life; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9</a>.<p>(5) the doctrine of predestination to life has added no pang of sorrow to anyone of the human race. It has made millions happy who would not otherwise have been, but not one miserable. It is not a choice to sorrow, it is a choice to joy and peace.<p>(6) no one has a right to complain of it. Those who are chosen assuredly should not complain of the grace which has made them what they are, and which is the foundation of all their hopes. And they who are "not" chosen, have no right to complain; for,<p>(a) they have no claim to life;<p>(b) they are "in fact" unwilling to come.<p>They have no desire to be Christians and to be saved. Nothing can induce them to forsake their sins and come to the Saviour.<p>Why then should they complain if others are "in fact" willing to be saved? Why should a man complain for being left to take his own course, and to walk in his own way? Mysterious, therefore, as is the doctrine of predestination; and fearful and inscrutable as it is in some of its aspects, yet, in a just view of it, it is suited to excite the highest expressions of thanksgiving, and to exalt God in the apprehension of man. He who has been redeemed and saved by the love of God; who has been pardoned and made pure by mercy; on whom the eye of compassion has been tenderly fixed, and for whom the Son of God has died, has abundant cause for thanksgiving and praise.<p>Wherein he hath made us accepted - Has regarded us as the objects of favor and complacency.<p>In the Beloved - In the Lord Jesus Christ, the well-beloved Son of God; notes, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-17.htm">Matthew 3:17</a>. He has chosen us in him, and it is through him that these mercies have been conferred on us. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ephesians/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6.

The grace of God manifestly appears in the predestination of men to adoption; in that God had no need of sons, he having a dear and well beloved one; in whom he is well pleased; and in that those he adopts are so unworthy of the relation; and in that men, and not angels, should be taken by him into his family; and that some, and not others of the same race; and that this should be before the world was; and in providing Christ as a Redeemer, to open the way for the reception of this grace and happiness; and in appointing the grace of faith to be the receiver of it: and the glory of the grace of God appears herein; the glory of God is the supreme end of all he does; and the glory of his grace, and not his power, or other perfections of his, and the manifestative glory of that is here intended; yea, the "praise" of that glory: and this end is answered, when the children of God ascribe their adoption to the free grace of God; and when they admire it, and are thankful for it, and walk worthy of the relation they are brought into: <p>wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved; the Vulgate Latin and Ethiopic versions read, "his own beloved Son", and so the Claromontane exemplar; the Lord Jesus Christ, who is the beloved of God the Father; and was so from everlasting, and will be so to everlasting; which has appeared by his nearness to him, lying in his bosom; by his being privy to all his counsels, purposes, and designs; in putting all things into his hands, and in showing him all that he does; and by his giving him honour and glory, as man and Mediator: and he is the beloved of the saints, for the transcendent excellencies that are in him, and for his love to them, and for what he has done for them, and is unto them; and in him is their acceptance: which is to be understood of the acceptance of their persons, as founded in the blood and righteousness of Christ, and so of their services in him; of God's act of delight and complacency in them, as considered in Christ; who looks upon them, and is well pleased with them, and rests in his love towards them; which is an amazing instance of grace: it was grace that gave them a being in Christ, and which has provided in predestination everything to make them grateful to God; and the very act of acceptance is of mere grace; for internal grace, or grace infused, is not here meant, but the free favour of God: some read not "in which", but "which"  "he freely gave us in the beloved"; so the Alexandrian copy, and some others, and the Syriac and Arabic versions. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/ephesians/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{9}</span> To the <span class="cverse3">{i}</span> praise of the glory of his grace, <span class="cverse3">{10}</span> wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved.</span><p>(9) The uttermost and chiefest final cause is the glory of God the Father, who saves us freely in his Son.<p>(i) That as his bountiful goodness deserves all praise, so also it should be set forth and proclaimed.<p>(10) Another final cause more near is our justification, in that he freely accounted us as being righteous in his Son.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/ephesians/1.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-6.htm" title="To the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he has made us accepted in the beloved.">Ephesians 1:6</a>.

Here it is the glory specifically of God’s grace, and the praise of that is now stated to be the ultimate end of God’s foreordination of us unto adoption, as our adoption itself has been declared to be the object of the foreordination. God’s final purpose in His eternal determinations, and the supreme end to which all that He wills regarding us looks, are the manifestation and adoring recognition of His grace in its gloriousness. So Chrys. puts it briefly <span class="greekheb">ἵνα ἡ τῆς χάριτος αὐτοῦ δόξα δειχθῇ</span>. The phrase means more than “the praise of his glorious grace”. It expresses the setting forth on God’s part, and the joyful confession on man’s part, of what the Divine grace in these eternal counsels is in the quality of its splendour, its magnificence. That this is the idea is shown by the subsequent mention of the “riches” of the same grace (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-7.htm" title="In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace;">Ephesians 1:7</a>).—<span class="greekheb">ἐν ᾗ ἐχαρίτωσεν ἡμᾶς</span>: <span class="ital">with which he freely gifted us</span>; literally, <span class="ital">with which he graced us</span>. The AV follows Beza’s <span class="ital">in qua nos acceptos sibi effecit</span> in rendering it “wherein he made us accepted”. The RV, which gives “wherewith he endued us” in the margin, deals better with it in the text, “which he freely bestowed on us”. The reading <span class="greekheb">ἐν ᾗ</span> of the TR, supported by such MSS. as [15] [16] [17] [18], the mass of the cursives, the Vulg., etc., must give place to <span class="greekheb">ἧς</span>, which is given by [19] [20] [21], Eth., Syr., etc., and is adopted by LT (eighth ed.)

See Win.-Moult., <span class="ital">Gram.</span>, p. 203; Buttm., <span class="ital">Gram.</span>, p. 289. The verb <span class="greekheb">χαριτόω</span>, following the analogy of other verbs in -<span class="greekheb">οω</span>, means <span class="ital">gratia aliquem afficere</span>. But this may have two senses (<span class="ital">cf.</span> Harl., Ell.), either to <span class="ital">make one agreeable, possessed of grace</span> (<a href="http://apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/18-17.htm" title="Lo, is not a word better than a gift? but both are with a gracious man.">Sir 18:17</a>; Ps. 17:26 (Symmachus), Clem. Alex., <span class="ital">Paed.</span>, iii., 11), or to <span class="ital">bestow grace on one</span>, to <span class="ital">compass one with favour</span> (Test. xii Patr., Jos. i.). The verb is of rare occurrence, whether within or without the NT. It is commonest in ecclesiastical and Byzantine Greek. In the NT it is found only twice, here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-28.htm" title="And the angel came in to her, and said, Hail, you that are highly favored, the Lord is with you: blessed are you among women.">Luke 1:28</a>.

In the present passage, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, Chrys. makes it <span class="greekheb">ἐπεραστοὺς ἐποίησε</span>, and so substantially Cornel, a Lapide, Bisping, and various RC interpreters. The latter sense, however, is rightly preferred by Beng., Ell., Alf., Light., Mey., Haupt, etc., as more in harmony with the general sense of <span class="greekheb">χάρις</span> in the Pauline Epistles, and with the fact that the main idea in the context is what God in His gratuitous goodness does for us.—<span class="greekheb">ἐν τῷ ἠγαπημένῳ</span>: <span class="ital">in the Beloved</span>. The doubtful explanatory term <span class="greekheb">υἱῷ αὐτοῦ</span> is added by some ancient authorities ([22] [23] [24] [25], Vulg., Goth., Jer., etc.). Again it is not “<span class="ital">through</span> him,” but “<span class="ital">in</span> him”. The grace is bestowed in and with Christ Himself. It is in the gift of the Son that the gift of grace becomes ours and that the splendour of the grace is seen. The designation <span class="greekheb">ὁ ἠγαπημένος</span> as applied to Christ is peculiar to this one passage so far as the NT is concerned. In the NT its nearest equivalent is the title <span class="greekheb">τοῦ υἱοῦ τῆς ἀγάπης αὐτοῦ</span> in the somewhat similar passage in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-13.htm" title=" Who has delivered us from the power of darkness, and has translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son:">Colossians 1:13</a>. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> also <span class="greekheb">ὁ υἱός μου ὁ ἀγαπητός</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-17.htm" title="And see a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.">Matthew 3:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/17-5.htm" title="While he yet spoke, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them: and behold a voice out of the cloud, which said, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear you him.">Matthew 17:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/1-11.htm" title="And there came a voice from heaven, saying, You are my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.">Mark 1:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/9-7.htm" title="And there was a cloud that overshadowed them: and a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him.">Mark 9:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-22.htm" title="And the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove on him, and a voice came from heaven, which said, You are my beloved Son; in you I am well pleased.">Luke 3:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-35.htm" title="And there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him.">Luke 9:35</a>), <span class="greekheb">ὁ ἀγαπητός μου</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-18.htm" title="Behold my servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom my soul is well pleased: I will put my spirit on him, and he shall show judgment to the Gentiles.">Matthew 12:18</a>); and in the OT <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-6.htm" title="And now shall my head be lifted up above my enemies round about me: therefore will I offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy; I will sing, yes, I will sing praises to the LORD.">Psalm 27:6</a> (LXX); <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-1.htm" title="Now will I sing to my well beloved a song of my beloved touching his vineyard.

See <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-23.htm" title="For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;">Romans 3:23</a> and note in this Series.

See last note but one. Observe this account of Redemption; it is Forgiveness, Remission. Not that it does not involve immensely more, both for soul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-14.htm" title="Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify to himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.">Titus 2:14</a>) and body (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-3.htm" title="For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:">Romans 8:3</a>); but all else is so inseparably bound up with Forgiveness as its <span class="ital">sine quâ non</span>, (a fact which gives a colour of its own to all the rest,) that the <span class="ital">whole</span> is often practically identified with this great <span class="ital">part</span>.

But this cannot be pressed; and very often, as here, the reference is to all kinds and degrees of sins, which are all “fallings out” of the straight line of the will of God.

The purpose of grace <span class="accented">quoad</span> man, is to make him perfectly holy; <span class="accented">quoad</span> God, is to give to the universe a right conception of his grace, and draw forth corresponding tributes of praise. It is to show that Divine grace is not a limp, shallow attribute, but one of glorious riches, deserving infinite praise. The idea of the richness, fullness, abundance, of God's grace is prominent throughout the Epistle. God desires to draw attention, not only to this attribute, but to the boundlessness of it - thus to draw the love and confidence of his creatures to himself and inspire them with the desire to imitate him (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-21.htm">Matthew 18:21-35</a>). Wherein he abounded toward us in the Beloved. Two slight difficulties are found here - one in the text, the other in the interpretation. After <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, some copies read <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1fc7;</span>, others <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>. A.V. follows the former; R.V. the latter. <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c9;</span> usually means to bestow grace; sometimes, to make gracious or beautiful. The former is more in accordance with New Testament usage (Alford) and with the tenor of the passage. The glory of the grace of which God desires to create a true impression is not an abstraction, not a glory hidden away in stone inaccessible region, but a revealed glory, a communicated glory; it is revealed in the grace wherein he abounded to us, or which he freely bestowed on us, in the Beloved. The grace bestowed on believers exemplifies the glorious quality of the attribute - its glorious riches. The connection of God with Christ in the bestowal of this grace, and of believers in the reception of it, is again noted by the remarkable term, "in the Beloved." That the Father's relation to Christ was one of infinite love is a fact never to be lost sight cf. His having constituted the Beloved One the Kinsman and Mediator of sinners shows the riches of the glory of his grace. "He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he hot, with him also freely give us all things?" Our union to the Beloved, our participating in all the blessings of his purchase, our becoming heirs of God and joint heirs with Jesus Christ, further illustrates the glorious riches of his grace. "Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed on us, that we should be called children of God!" <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/ephesians/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>To the praise of the glory of His grace<p>The ultimate aim of foreordained. Glory is an attribute of grace: that in which grace grandly and resplendently displays itself. Praise is called forth from the children of God by this divine glory which thus appears in grace. The grace is not merely favor, gift, but it reveals also the divine character. In praising God for what He does, we learn to praise Him for what He is. Glory is another of the ruling words of the epistle, falling into the same category with riches and fullness. The apostle is thrilled with a sense of the plenitude and splendor of the mystery of redemption.<p>Wherein He hath made us accepted (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3b7;&#788;&#834;&#837; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c2;)<p>The correct reading is &#x3b7;&#788;&#834;&#x3c2; which, referring to grace. The meaning is not endued us with grace, nor made us worthy of love, but, as Rev., grace - which he freely bestowed. Grace is an act of God, not a state into which He brings us.<p>The beloved<p>Christ. Beloved par excellence.
