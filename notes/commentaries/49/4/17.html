It opens with a striking contrast of the past and the present—the life of the heathen in its “vanity,” with the two-fold result of blindness and callousness of soul; and the Christian life, which has in learning Christ found the secret of regeneration.<p>(17) <span class= "bld">This I say therefore.</span>—The phrase “This I say” seems to be used by St. Paul in returning (so to speak) from some lofty aspiration or profound reasoning, in which some might not be able to follow him, to a solid, practical ground, which all may tread. (See, for example, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-50.htm" title="Now this I say, brothers, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither does corruption inherit incorruption.">1Corinthians 15:50</a>.) Here he is not content to use this phrase simply, but he enforces it by the solemnity of the adjuration “I testify” (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-26.htm" title="Why I take you to record this day, that I am pure from the blood of all men.">Acts 20:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-3.htm" title="For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law.">Galatians 5:3</a>), which properly means, “I call God to witness the truth of what I say”—a phrase found in express terms in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-9.htm" title="For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers;">Romans 1:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-23.htm" title="Moreover I call God for a record on my soul, that to spare you I came not as yet to Corinth.">2Corinthians 1:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-8.htm" title="For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ.">Philippians 1:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-5.htm" title="For neither at any time used we flattering words, as you know, nor a cloak of covetousness; God is witness:">1Thessalonians 2:5</a>. Nor was even this enough, for he adds “in the Lord”—that is, in the name, authority, and spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ Himself. The whole form is therefore one of peculiar force and solemnity.<p><span class= "bld">The vanity of their mind.</span>—In these words St. Paul describes the fundamental condition of heathenism. The “mind,” that is (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-23.htm" title="But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.">Romans 7:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-25.htm" title="I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.">Romans 7:25</a>), the “inner man”—the spiritual intuition of invisible principles of truth and right, which is the true humanity—has become “subject to vanity” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-20.htm" title="For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who has subjected the same in hope,">Romans 8:20</a>),—the vanity of which the Book of Ecclesiastes so often speaks. In losing the living conception of a living God, it has lost also the conception of the true object and perfection of human life; and so wanders on aimless, hopeless, reckless, as in a dream. With what absolute fidelity St. Paul describes the heathen world of his day, its history and its literature alike testify. Compare with the whole passage the picture drawn in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/1-21.htm" title="Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.">Romans 1:21-32</a>, “They became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened,” &c. The difference is that in the latter passage the prominent idea is mainly of “judicial blindness,” sent by God as a penalty on wilful apostasy from Him, whereas here St. Paul rather dwells on self-chosen blindness and hardness of heart.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/ephesians/4.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/4-17.htm" title="This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that you from now on walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind,...">Ephesians 4:17-19</a></span>. <span class="ital">This I say, therefore </span>— For your further instruction, how to walk worthy of your calling; (he returns to the subject which he began, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-1.htm" title="I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that you walk worthy of the vocation with which you are called,">Ephesians 4:1</a>;) <span class="ital">and testify in the Lord </span>— In the name and by the authority of the Lord Jesus, that ye, being now happily brought into the Christian Church, and made partakers of all the privileges and advantages belonging to its members; <span class="ital">henceforth walk not as other Gentiles </span>— That ye live no longer as the unconverted heathen; <span class="ital">in the vanity of their mind </span>— Amused with the empty trifles of this world, and enslaved to low and mean pursuits, utterly unworthy of their rational and immortal nature; <span class="ital">having the understanding darkened </span>— With respect to all spiritual and divine things, which is the source of all foolish desires and pursuits; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-21.htm" title="Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.">Romans 1:21</a>; <span class="ital">being alienated from the life of God </span>— Being estranged in affection, as well as in practice, from the divine and spiritual life, from all union with, and conformity to, the living and true God; or, from that noble principle of all piety and virtue, the life of God in the soul of man, forming it to the love, imitation, and service of him by whom it is implanted; <span class="ital">through the ignorance </span>— Of God and his will, and of their duty and happiness; <span class="ital">that is </span>inherent <span class="ital">in them </span>— Or natural to them, as fallen and depraved creatures; <span class="ital">because of the blindness </span>— <span class="greekheb">Την πωρωσιν</span>, <span class="ital">the callousness, </span>or insensibility; <span class="ital">of their hearts </span>— This is explained by Chrysostom, Whitby, and some other commentators, as referring to their Gentile state; but though there is no doubt but it partly refers to that, yet there can be no sufficient reason to limit such a description to dark and ignorant heathen; it is but too just a representation of all unregenerate men. <span class="ital">Who being past feeling </span>— The original word, <span class="greekheb">απηλγηκοτες</span>, is peculiarly significant, properly meaning, <span class="ital">past feeling pain, </span>or <span class="ital">void of distress </span>— Pain urges the sick to seek a remedy, and distress, the distressed to endeavour, if possible, to procure relief; which remedy or relief is little thought of where pain and distress are not felt. Thus, those who are hardened against all impressions of grief on account of their former sins, are not excited to seek either for the pardon of them or deliverance from them. Some MSS. read <span class="greekheb">απηλπικοτες</span>, <span class="ital">hoping for nothing. </span>These wicked men, disbelieving the resurrection of the body, and the immortality of the soul, have no hope of any happiness after this life, and therefore they have <span class="ital">given themselves over</span> — Have abandoned themselves freely, of their own accord; <span class="ital">to</span> <span class="ital">lasciviousness </span>— To wantonness, to unchaste imaginations and desires, words and actions; <span class="ital">to work all uncleanness </span>— Impurity of every kind; <span class="ital">with greediness </span>— The word <span class="greekheb">εν πλεονεξια</span>, thus rendered, is commonly used to denote <span class="ital">covetousness; </span>because the more the covetous man possesses, the more he desires. Hence the word is used (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-14.htm" title="Having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin; beguiling unstable souls: an heart they have exercised with covetous practices; cursed children:">2 Peter 2:14</a>) to denote inordinate desire in general.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:17-24 The apostle charged the Ephesians in the name and by the authority of the Lord Jesus, that having professed the gospel, they should not be as the unconverted Gentiles, who walked in vain fancies and carnal affections. Do not men, on every side, walk in the vanity of their minds? Must not we then urge the distinction between real and nominal Christians? They were void of all saving knowledge; they sat in darkness, and loved it rather than light. They had a dislike and hatred to a life of holiness, which is not only the way of life God requires and approves, and by which we live to him, but which has some likeness to God himself in his purity, righteousness, truth, and goodness. The truth of Christ appears in its beauty and power, when it appears as in Jesus. The corrupt nature is called a man; like the human body, it is of divers parts, supporting and strengthening one another. Sinful desires are deceitful lusts; they promise men happiness, but render them more miserable; and bring them to destruction, if not subdued and mortified. These therefore must be put off, as an old garment, a filthy garment; they must be subdued and mortified. But it is not enough to shake off corrupt principles; we must have gracious ones. By the new man, is meant the new nature, the new creature, directed by a new principle, even regenerating grace, enabling a man to lead a new life of righteousness and holiness. This is created, or brought forth by God's almighty power.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ephesians/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord - I bear witness in the name of the Lord Jesus, or ministering by his authority.
