By a loving study and knowledge of His person, as set forth to us in the gospel, and brought home to us by His grace, rather than by abstract musing on the office and attributes of “the Christ,” we come to learn the Christ also. The use of the simple name Jesus, so common in the Gospels, is rare indeed in the Epistles, where we constantly find the fuller description “Jesus Christ,” “the Lord Jesus,” “Jesus the Son of God.” Wherever it occurs, it will be found to be distinctive or emphatic. This distinctiveness is most strikingly evident in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-11.htm" title="But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwells in you.">Romans 8:11</a> : “If the Spirit of Him who raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, He that raised up [the] Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies.” The “raising up of Jesus,” is the historical resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth; the “raising up the Christ” points to the mysterious effect of that resurrection on those for whom He is the Mediator. Of the few other passages in which the simple name occurs, some (as <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-26.htm" title="To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believes in Jesus.">Romans 3:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/4-10.htm" title="Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body.">2Corinthians 4:10-11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-10.htm" title="And to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, even Jesus, which delivered us from the wrath to come.">1Thessalonians 1:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-10.htm" title="By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.">Hebrews 10:10</a>) are mere reiterations of the name occurring above with the due title of honour; others are quasi-recitals of a creed declaring the historic Jesus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-3.htm" title="Why I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calls Jesus accursed: and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.">1Corinthians 12:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-14.htm" title="For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.">1Thessalonians 4:14</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-4.htm" title="For if he that comes preaches another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or if you receive another spirit, which you have not received, or another gospel, which you have not accepted, you might well bear with him.">2Corinthians 11:4</a>). In the Epistle to the Hebrews, where, in accordance with one main purpose of the Epistle, this usage is least rare (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-9.htm" title="But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.">Hebrews 2:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-20.htm" title="Where the forerunner is for us entered, even Jesus, made an high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.">Hebrews 6:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-22.htm" title="By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament.">Hebrews 7:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-2.htm" title="Looking to Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.">Hebrews 12:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-24.htm" title="And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaks better things that that of Abel.">Hebrews 12:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-12.htm" title="Why Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people with his own blood, suffered without the gate.">Hebrews 13:12</a>), it will be found that in all cases, either special stress is laid on the lowly and suffering humanity of the Lord, or the historic facts of His ministry on earth are referred to. The modern familiarity of use of the simple name “Jesus” has little authority in apostolic usage.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:17-24 The apostle charged the Ephesians in the name and by the authority of the Lord Jesus, that having professed the gospel, they should not be as the unconverted Gentiles, who walked in vain fancies and carnal affections. Do not men, on every side, walk in the vanity of their minds? Must not we then urge the distinction between real and nominal Christians? They were void of all saving knowledge; they sat in darkness, and loved it rather than light. They had a dislike and hatred to a life of holiness, which is not only the way of life God requires and approves, and by which we live to him, but which has some likeness to God himself in his purity, righteousness, truth, and goodness. The truth of Christ appears in its beauty and power, when it appears as in Jesus. The corrupt nature is called a man; like the human body, it is of divers parts, supporting and strengthening one another. Sinful desires are deceitful lusts; they promise men happiness, but render them more miserable; and bring them to destruction, if not subdued and mortified. These therefore must be put off, as an old garment, a filthy garment; they must be subdued and mortified. But it is not enough to shake off corrupt principles; we must have gracious ones. By the new man, is meant the new nature, the new creature, directed by a new principle, even regenerating grace, enabling a man to lead a new life of righteousness and holiness. This is created, or brought forth by God's almighty power.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ephesians/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>If so be that ye have heard him - If you have listened attentively to his instructions, and learned the true nature of his religion.

The accusative with the infinitive <span class="greekheb">ἀποθέσθαι ὑμᾶς</span> depends on <span class="greekheb">ἐστιν ἀλήθεια ἐν τῷ Ἰησοῦ</span>, so that it appears as subject of the sentence (Kühner, II. p. 347 f.). <span class="ital">Usually</span> <span class="greekheb">ἀποθέσθαι ὑμᾶς</span> is made to depend on <span class="greekheb">ἐδιδάχθητε</span>, in which case <span class="greekheb">καθώς ἐστιν ἀλήθεια ἐν τῷ Ἰησοῦ</span> is very differently explained. <span class="ital">Either</span> it is regarded as a parenthesis (Beza, Er. Schmid, Michaelis), as by Rückert, who takes <span class="greekheb">καθώς</span> augmentatively, so that the sense is: “If ye are rightly instructed concerning Christ, ye have not so learned Him, for that would be false; with Him (there where Christ is, lives and rules) there is, in fact, only truth (moral, religious truth) to be met with.” <span class="ital">Or</span> <span class="greekheb">καθώς ἐστιν κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. is attached to <span class="greekheb">ἐδιδάχθητε</span>, and then <span class="greekheb">ἀποθέσθαι ὑμᾶς</span> is taken as epexegesis of <span class="greekheb">καθώς ἐστιν κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., in which case <span class="greekheb">ἀλήθεια</span> in turn is differently explained.[236] <span class="ital">Or</span> the connection is so conceived of, that a <span class="greekheb">οὕτως</span> is supplied before <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΠΟΘΈΣΘΑΙ</span></span></span>, in which case Jesus appears as <span class="ital">model</span>.[237] So also Harless (followed by Olshausen), who, taking <span class="greekheb">ἀλήθεια</span> as <span class="ital">moral</span> truth (holiness), justifies <span class="greekheb">ὑμᾶς</span> from the comparison of Jesus with the readers (“as truth is in <span class="ital">Jesus</span>, so to lay aside <span class="ital">on your part</span>”), in which case <span class="greekheb">Ἰησοῦ</span>, not <span class="greekheb">Χριστῷ</span>, is held to be used, because the <span class="ital">man</span> Jesus is set forth as pattern. Matthies likewise makes <span class="greekheb">ἀποθέσθαι</span>, depend on <span class="greekheb">ἐδιδάχθητε</span>, but annexes <span class="greekheb">καθώς κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. as more precise definition to <span class="greekheb">ἐν αὐτῷ</span>: “<span class="ital">in Him, as or in as far as the truth is in Jesus</span>, as He is the truth.” So Castalio appears already to have taken it. But all these explanations break down in presence of the <span class="greekheb">ὑμᾶς</span>, which, if <span class="greekheb">ἀποθέσθαι ὑμᾶς</span> belonged to <span class="greekheb">ἐδιδάχθητε</span>, would be quite inappropriate. In particular, it may be further urged (<span class="ital">a</span>) in opposition to Rückert, that according to his explanation the parenthesis <span class="greekheb">καθώς ἐστιν ἀλήθεια ἐν τῷ Ἰησοῦ</span> must logically have had its place already after <span class="greekheb">τὸν Χριστόν</span>; (<span class="ital">b</span>) in opposition to Harless, that the alleged comparison of Jesus with the readers is at variance with the order of the words, since Paul must have written: <span class="greekheb">καθὼς ἐν τῷ Ἰησοῦ ἀλήθειά ἐστιν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὑμᾶς ἀποθέσθαι</span>; (<span class="ital">c</span>) in opposition to Matthies, that <span class="greekheb">καθὼς κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. does not stand beside <span class="greekheb">ἐν αὐτῷ</span>, and that <span class="greekheb">ἀλήθεια</span> must have had the article. De Wette explains it to this effect: In Jesus there is (as inherent quality, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-44.htm" title="You are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father you will do.

But even thus we may expect, instead of <span class="greekheb">ἀποθ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὑμᾶς</span>, merely the simple <span class="greekheb">ἀποθέσθαι</span>. <span class="ital">Others</span> have attached <span class="greekheb">ἀποθέσθαι ὑμᾶς</span> to <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-17.htm" title="This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that you from now on walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind,">Ephesians 4:17</a>, as continuation of the <span class="greekheb">μηκέτι ὑμᾶς περιπατεῖν κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.

On <span class="greekheb">εἴγε</span>, = “if so be that,” “if as I assume it to be the case,” see in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-2.htm" title="If you have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me to you-ward:">Ephesians 3:2</a> above. In the form of a delicate supposition it takes it as certain that they did hear. The <span class="greekheb">αὐτὸν ἠκούσατε</span> is to be understood as the <span class="greekheb">ἐμάθετε τὸν Χριστόν</span>. The pronoun is placed for emphasis before its verb. The point, therefore, is this—“if, as I take it to be the fact, it was He, the Christ, that was the subject and the sum of the preaching which you heard then”.—<span class="greekheb">καὶ ἐν αὐτῷ ἐδιδάχθητε</span>: <span class="ital">and in Him were instructed</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐν αὐτῷ</span> is not to be reduced to “<span class="ital">by</span> Him” (Arm.; also AV “taught by Him”), or “about Him,” or “in His name” (Beng.), but has its proper sense of “<span class="ital">in</span> Him”. The underlying idea is that of union with Christ. The <span class="greekheb">ἐδιδάχθητε</span>, therefore, refers probably to instructions subsequent to those which were given them at their first hearing (<span class="greekheb">ἠκούσατε</span>). It was <span class="ital">in fellowship</span> with Christ that they received these instructions.—<span class="greekheb">καθώς ἐστιν ἀλήθεια ἐν τῷ Ἰησοῦ</span>: <span class="ital">even as truth is in Jesus</span>. WH give <span class="greekheb">καθώς ἐστιν ἀληθείᾳ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἐν τῷ Ἰησοῦ</span> as a marginal reading. The meaning of the clause is much disputed. That it expresses in some way the <span class="ital">manner</span> or <span class="ital">standard</span> of the instructions (<span class="greekheb">ἐδιδάχθητε</span>) is clear from the <span class="greekheb">καθώς</span>. But what the point and connection of the clause are it is by no means easy to determine. Wicl. gives “as is truth in Jesus”; AV and other old English Versions, “as the truth is in Jesus,” as if it were <span class="greekheb">ἡ ἀλήθεια</span>. Some dispose of it as a parenthesis (Bez., Rück., etc.), as if = “if ye were so instructed about Christ, that would be false” (as in Him there is only truth, moral and religious truth). Others (Grot., etc.) make it = “as it really is,” <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, “if ye were instructed in the Gospel as it really is in Jesus”; or (Jer., Erasm., Est., etc.) they supply a <span class="greekheb">οὕτως</span> to the <span class="greekheb">ἀποθέσθαι</span> and understand the <span class="greekheb">καθὼς</span> clause to refer to Jesus as the Pattern of moral truth or holiness. Jerome’s explanation, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, is this—<span class="ital">quomodo est veritas in Jesu sic erit et in vobis qui didicistis Christum</span>. Somewhat similarly others, connecting it with <span class="greekheb">ἀποθέσθαι</span>, take it to mean that as moral truth is in Jesus, so they on their part are to lay aside the old man (Harl., Olsh., etc.). Or, connecting it with <span class="greekheb">ἐδιδάχθητε</span>, they understand the point to be that they were instructed in a way implying a moral change, as in Jesus there is truth and, therefore, holiness (so de Wette substantially). Meyer makes the <span class="greekheb">ἀποθέσθαι</span> dependent on the <span class="greekheb">καθὼς</span> clause, so that the sense becomes this—“truth it is in Jesus that ye put off the old man”; and Abbott appealing to the use of <span class="greekheb">ἀλήθεια</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-24.htm" title="And that you put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.">Ephesians 4:24</a> and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-21.htm" title="But he that does truth comes to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are worked in God.">John 3:21</a>, makes it = “as it is true teaching in Jesus that ye should put off,” etc. All these interpretations involve dubious constructions or impose unjustifiable senses on the <span class="greekheb">ἀλήθεια</span>. Feeling this others have adopted the bolder expedient of making <span class="greekheb">Χριστός</span> the subject of <span class="greekheb">ἐστιν</span>, the sense then becoming “as He (Christ) is truth in Jesus” (Cred., Von Soden). A better turn is given to this by WH, who would read <span class="greekheb">ἀληθείᾳ</span> and so get the sense “as He (Christ) is in Jesus in truth”. In support of this it is urged that the <span class="greekheb">αὐτόν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἐν αὐτῷ</span> show that <span class="ital">Christ</span>, the <span class="ital">Messiah</span>, is the leading subject. But this construction means that it was not enough to be instructed in a Messiah; that they had also to recognise that Messiah in the historical Jesus, and that in Him they would see the life which signified for them a putting off of the old man. There is no indication, however, in the context or in any word of Paul’s belonging to this period of a form of false <span class="ital">Christian</span> teaching which distinguished between <span class="ital">Christ</span> and <span class="ital">Jesus</span>, or of Gentiles professing to believe in a Messiah but not in Jesus as that Messiah. It only remains, therefore, to fall back on the interpretation “if ye were instructed according to that which is truth in Jesus”. The clause will then describe the <span class="ital">nature</span> or <span class="ital">manner</span> of the instruction, as the following clause expresses its substance. In form or character the instruction was in accordance with what was true, with what was true <span class="ital">in Jesus</span>, that is to say, with truth as seen embodied in Him (<span class="ital">cf.</span> Alf., Ell.). And instruction of that kind meant that they should put off the old man.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/ephesians/4.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">21</span>. <span class="ital">if so be</span>] The Gr. interrogative (used also above, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-2.htm" title="If you have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me to you-ward:">Ephesians 3:2</a>) does not imply any doubt, necessarily, but calls the reader to verify the statement.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">have heard him</span>, &c.] Better, as “Him” is emphatic by position, <span class="bld">If it was He whom ye heard</span>. The Gr. construction leads us to explain this not of listening <span class="ital">to</span> the Lord so much as of hearing <span class="ital">about</span> Him, or rather, of hearing “Him” as Truth rather than Teacher. “Christ” had been the Message they had received.—He does indeed, by His Word and Spirit, personally continue the “teaching” which in His earthly ministry He began (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-1.htm" title="The former treatise have I made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach,">Acts 1:1</a>); but that is not the point of the present words.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">have been taught by him</span>] Better, <span class="bld">if it was in Him that ye were taught</span>. The instruction was “in Christ,” if the teacher’s limit and rule was the truth of His Person and Work, and if those who received it were, by living spiritual union, “in Him,” and so capable of “spiritual discernment” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-14.htm" title="But the natural man receives not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness to him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.">1 Corinthians 2:14</a>). This clause defines and explains the previous clause.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">as the truth is in Jesus</span>] Better, <span class="bld">even as in Jesus truth is</span>. See last note, on the relation of spiritual “in-ness” to the standard and reception of spiritual truth. The emphasis here is as if to say, “If you were taught, as I say, in Him; in the lines of eternal <span class="ital">fact</span> and spiritual <span class="ital">reality</span> which do so truly meet in Him.”—The question arises, why does the Lord’s designation change from “Christ,” <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-20.htm" title="But you have not so learned Christ;">Ephesians 4:20</a>, to “<span class="ital">Jesus</span>” here?

But the atonement taught "in Jesus," in connection with the living, loving, dying, risen Savior tells; the blood of redemption in connection with the Son of God incarnate thus loving us, and meekly, patiently suffering the agonies of the cross in our room, is not only a power, but the greatest moral power that can move the heart. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/ephesians/4.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>If so be that ye heard Him (&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#769; &#x3b3;&#x3b5; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b7;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;)<p>The indicative mood implies the truth of the supposition: if ye heard as ye did.
