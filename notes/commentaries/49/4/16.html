It should be, <span class= "ital">by every contact with the supply</span> (of nutriment) from the head. The word employed has commonly the meaning of “joint” (as in the parallel passage, <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-19.htm" title=" And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increases with the increase of God.">Colossians 2:19</a>), and is so used by Greek physiologists; but its original sense is abstract—the “joining” or “touching”—and this appears the simplest here. The supply (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-19.htm" title="For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,">Philippians 1:19</a>, “the supply of the Spirit”) is again almost a technical word for the abundant outflow of strength and nervous energy from the head. (The corresponding verb is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-10.htm" title="Now he that ministers seed to the sower both minister bread for your food, and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your righteousness;)">2Corinthians 9:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-5.htm" title="He therefore that ministers to you the Spirit, and works miracles among you, does he it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?">Galatians 3:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-19.htm" title=" And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increases with the increase of God.">Colossians 2:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-5.htm" title="And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge;">2Peter 1:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-11.htm" title="For so an entrance shall be ministered to you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.">2Peter 1:11</a>.) Hence the phrase seems to stand in closer connection with the “maketh increase “below than the “compacted together” above. The body grows, in every part of its complex unity, through contact with the divine supply of grace through the head.<p><span class= "bld">According to the effectual working in the measure of every part.</span>—In these words is described the method, as in the preceding word the source, of the growth. The “effectiveness” of every part “in measure” (according, that is, to its right capacity and function) is the condition of corporate growth. Such effectiveness comes from direct contact with the central energy.<p><span class= "bld">Maketh increase of the body unto the edifying </span>(<span class= "ital">the building up</span>) <span class= "bld">of itself in love.</span>—Here, lastly, we have the function of the body itself. It is knit together by its divine organisation; it is sustained by the supply from the head; its several parts are kept in life by that supply; but it grows as a whole and builds itself up by the uniting and vivifying power of love, which is the “bond of perfectness.” (Just so St. Paul says of the individual, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-1.htm" title="Now as touching things offered to idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but charity edifies.">1Corinthians 8:1</a>, “Charity edifieth.”) Truth is, no doubt, the basis of unity; but love is its vital power, at once keeping together all who are united, and drawing in those who are as yet separated.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:7-16 Unto every believer is given some gift of grace, for their mutual help. All is given as seems best to Christ to bestow upon every one. He received for them, that he might give to them, a large measure of gifts and graces; particularly the gift of the Holy Ghost. Not a mere head knowledge, or bare acknowledging Christ to be the Son of God, but such as brings trust and obedience. There is a fulness in Christ, and a measure of that fulness given in the counsel of God to every believer; but we never come to the perfect measure till we come to heaven. God's children are growing, as long as they are in this world; and the Christian's growth tends to the glory of Christ. The more a man finds himself drawn out to improve in his station, and according to his measure, all that he has received, to the spiritual good of others, he may the more certainly believe that he has the grace of sincere love and charity rooted in his heart.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ephesians/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>From whom the whole body - The church, compared with the human body. The idea is, that as the head in the human frame conveys vital influence, rigor, motion, etc., to every part of the body; so Christ is the source of life, and rigor, and energy, and increase to the church. The sense is, "The whole human body is admirably arranged for growth and rigor. Every member and joint contribute to its healthful and harmonious action. One part lends vigor and beauty to another, so that the whole is finely proportioned and admirably sustained. All depend on the head with reference to the most important functions of life, and all derive their vigor from that. So it is in the church. It is as well arranged for growth and vigor as the body is. It is as beautifully organized in its various members and officers as the body is. Everything is designed to he in its proper place, and nothing by the divine arrangement is lacking in its organization, to its perfection. Its officers and its members are, in their places, what the various parts of the body are with reference to the human frame. The church depends on Christ, as the head, to sustain, invigorate, and guide it, as the body is dependent on the head" See this figure carried out to greater length in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12-26</a>.<p>Fitly joined together - The body, whose members are properly united so as to produce the most beauty and vigor. Each member is in the best place, and is properly united to the other members. Let anyone read Paley's Natural Theology, or any work on anatomy, and he will find innumerable instances of the truth of this remark; not only in the proper adjustment and placing of the members, but in the manner in which it is united to the other parts of the body. The foot, for instance, is in its proper place. It should not be where the head or the hand is. The eye is in its proper place. It should not be in the knee or the heel. The mouth, the tongue, the teeth, the lungs, the heart, are in their proper places. No other places would answer the purpose so well. The brain is in its proper place. Anywhere else in the body, it would be subject to compressions and injuries which would soon destroy life. And these parts are as admirably united to file other parts of the body, as they are admirably located. Let anyone examine, for instance, the tendons, nerves, muscles, and bones, by which the "foot" is secured to the body, and by which easy and graceful motion is obtained, and he will be satisfied of the wisdom by which the body is "joined together." How far the "knowledge" of the apostle extended on this point, we have not the means of ascertaining; but all the investigations of anatomists only serve to give increased beauty and force to the general terms which he uses here. All that he says here of the human frame is strictly accurate, and is such language as may be used by an anatomist now, The word which is used here (&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c9;  sunarmologeo&#772;) means properly to sew together; to fit together; to unite, to make one. It is applied often to musicians, who produce "harmony" of various parts of music. "Passow." The idea of harmony, or appropriate union, is that in the word.<p>And compacted - &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;  sumbibazomenon. Tyndale renders this, "knit together in every joint." The word properly means, to make to come together; to join or knit together. It means here that the different parts of the body are "united" and sustained in this manner.<p>By that which every joint supplieth - Literally, "through every joint of supply;" that is, which affords or ministers mutual aid. The word "joint" hero - &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#769;  haphe&#772; - (from &#x3b1;&#788;&#834;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;  hapto&#772; to fit) - means anything which binds, fastens, secures; find does not refer to the joint in the sense in which we commonly use it, as denoting "the articulation" of the limbs, or the joining of two or more bones; but rather that which "unites or fastens" together the different parts of the frame - the blood vessels, cords, tendons, and muscles. The meaning is, that every such "means of connecting one part of the body with another" ministers nourishment, and that thus the body is sustained. One part is dependent on another; one part derives nourishment from another; and thus all become mutually useful as contributing to the support and harmony of the whole. Thus, it furnishes an illustration of the "connection" in the members of the church, and of the aid which one can render to another.<p>According to the effectual working - Greek, "According to the energy in the measure of each one part." Tyndale, "According to the operation as every part has its measure." The meaning is, that each part contributes to the production of the whole result, or "labors" for this. This is in proportion to the "measure" of each part; that is, in proportion to its power. Every part labors to produce the great result. No one is idle; none is useless. But, none are overtaxed or overworked. The support demanded and furnished by every part is in exact proportion to its strength. This is a beautiful account of the anatomy of the human frame.<p>(1) nothing is useless. Every part contributes to the general result - the health, and beauty, and vigor of the system. Not a muscle is useless; not a nerve, not an artery, not a vein. All are employed, and all have an important place, and all contribute "something" to the health and beauty of the whole. So numerous are the bloodvessels, that you cannot perforate the skin anywhere without piercing one; so numerous are the pores of the skin, that a grain of sand will cover thousands of them; so minute the ramifications of the nerves, that wherever the point of a needle penetrates, we feel it; and so numerous the absorbents, that million of them are employed in taking up the chyme of the food, and conveying it to the veins. And yet all are employed - all are useful - all minister life and strength to the whole.<p>(2) none are overtaxed. They all work according to the "measure" of their strength. Nothing is required of the minutest nerve or blood-vessel which it is not suited to perform; and it will work on for years without exhaustion or decay. So of the church. There is no member so obscure and feeble that he may not contribute something to the welfare of the whole; and no one is required to labor beyond his strength in order to secure the great object. Each one in "his place," and laboring as he should there, will contribute to the general strength and welfare; "out of his place" - like nerves and arteries out of their place, and crossing and recrossing others - he will only embarrass the whole, and disarrange the harmony of the system.<p>Maketh increase of the body - The body grows in this manner.<p>Unto the edifying of itself - To building itself up that is, it grows up to a complete stature.<p>In love - In mutual harmony. This refers to the "body." The meaning is that it seems to be made on the principle of "love." There is no jar, no collision, no disturbance of one part with another. A great number of parts, composed of different substances, and with different functions - bones, and nerves, and muscles, and blood-vessels - are united in one, and live together without collision; and so it should be in the church. Learn, hence:<p>(1) That no member of the church need be useless, anymore than a minute nerve or blood-vessel in the body need be useless. No matter how obscure the individual may be, he may contribute to the harmony and vigor of the whole,<p>(2) Every member of the church should contribute something to the prosperity of the whole. He should no more be idle and unemployed than a nerve or a blood-vessel should be in the human system. What would be the effect if the minutest nerves and arteries of the body should refuse to perform their office?. Langour, disease, and death. So it is in the church. The obscurest member may do "something" to destroy the healthful action of the church, and to make its piety languish and die.<p>(3) there should be union in the church. It is made up of materials which differ much from each other, as the body is made up of bones, and nerves, and muscles. Yet, in the body these are united; and so it should be in the church. There need be no more jarring in the church than in the body; and a jar in the church produces the same effect as would be produced in the body if the nerves and muscles should resist the action of each other, or as if one should be out of its place, and impede the healthful functions of the other.<p>(4) every member in the church should keep his place, just as every bone, and nerve, and muscle in the human frame should. Every member of the body should be in its right position; the heart, the lungs, the eye, the tongue, should occupy their right place; and every nerve in the system should be laid down just where it is designed to be. If so, all is well If not so, all is deformity, or disorder; just as it, is often in the church. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ephesians/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16.

It is not the <span class="ital">union</span> that is brought about by the <span class="greekheb">ἁφαὶ τῆς ἐπιχορηγ</span>., but the <span class="ital">growth</span>, inasmuch as Christ, from whom as Head the union proceeds, bestows the <span class="greekheb">ἐπιχορηγία</span> for the growth. <span class="greekheb">ἁφή</span> is <span class="ital">usually</span> explained <span class="ital">junctura</span> (Vulgate), <span class="ital">commissura, means of connection, joint</span>, and the like. But without any support from linguistic usage. It may signify, as in Lucian, <span class="ital">de luctu</span> 9, and often in Plutarch, <span class="ital">contact</span>, also <span class="ital">holding fast, adhesion</span>, and the like[229] (comp. Augustine, <span class="ital">de civ. Dei</span>, xxii. 18: “<span class="ital">tactum subministrationis</span>,” and see Oecumenius: <span class="greekheb">ἡ ἀπὸ τοῦ Χριστοῦ κατιοῦσα πνευματικὴ δύναμις ἑνὸς ἑκάστου μέλους αὐτοῦ ἁπτομένη</span>), but it never means <span class="ital">vinculum</span> (<span class="greekheb">συναφή</span>). Rightly Chrysostom and Theodoret have already explained it by <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΑἼΣΘΗΣΙς</span></span></span>, <span class="ital">feeling, perception</span>. See Plato, <span class="ital">Locr</span>. p. 100 D, E; <span class="ital">Pol</span>. vii. p. 523 E; and the passages in Wetstein. So also <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-19.htm" title=" And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increases with the increase of God.">Colossians 2:19</a>. Hofmann, <span class="ital">Schriftbew</span>. II. 2, p. 132, prefers the signification: <span class="ital">contact</span>, and understands the connection of the several parts of the body, whereby the one supplies to the other that which is necessary to growth, which supply in the case of the recipient takes place by means of contact with it. In this way <span class="greekheb">πᾶσα ἁφὴ τῆς ἐπιχορηγ</span>. would be every contact <span class="ital">which serves for supplying</span>, and the <span class="greekheb">ἐπιχορηγία</span> would be the communication of the requisites for growth <span class="ital">by one part of the body to the other</span>. But the former Paul would have very indistinctly expressed by the mere genitive (instead of <span class="greekheb">τῆς ἐπιχορ</span>. he might have written <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Τῆς ΠΡῸς ΤῊΝ ἘΠΙΧΟΡΗΓΊΑΝ</span></span></span>), and the latter is imported, since the reader after <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΞ ΟὟ</span></span></span> could only understand the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΠΙΧΟΡΗΓΊΑ</span></span></span> proceeding <span class="ital">from Christ</span>. If we were to take <span class="greekheb">ἁφή</span> in the sense of <span class="ital">contact</span>, the above explanation of Oecumenius would be the simplest (every contact, which the body experiences through the <span class="greekheb">ἐπιχορηγία</span> of Christ); but there may be urged against it, that the expression instead of the mere <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΙᾺ ΠΆΣΗς ἘΠΙΧΟΡΗΓΊΑς</span></span></span> would be only diffuse and circumstantial without special reason, while the expression: “<span class="ital">sensation</span> of the <span class="greekheb">ἐπιχορηγία</span>,” very appropriately points to the growth through the influence of Christ <span class="ital">from within outward</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τῆς ἐπιχορηγ</span>.] Genit. <span class="ital">objecti</span>: every feeling in which the supply is perceived, experienced. <span class="ital">What</span> supply is meant by the <span class="greekheb">ἐπιχορηγία</span> with the article becomes certain from the context, namely, that which is <span class="ital">afforded by Christ</span> (through the Holy Spirit), <span class="ital">i.e.</span> the influence of Christ, by which He supplies to His body the powers of life and development necessary to a growth in keeping with its destiny (<span class="greekheb">ἐπιχορηγεῖ</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-10.htm" title="Now he that ministers seed to the sower both minister bread for your food, and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your righteousness;)">2 Corinthians 9:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-5.htm" title="He therefore that ministers to you the Spirit, and works miracles among you, does he it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?">Galatians 3:5</a>, <span class="ital">exhibet</span>; the substantive occurs only further at <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-19.htm" title="For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,">Php 1:19</a>, not in Greek writers). Those who understand <span class="greekheb">ἁφή</span> as <span class="ital">bond</span>, take <span class="greekheb">τῆς ἐπιχορηγ</span>., partly correctly in this same sense (Rückert, Harless, Olshausen), save that they explain the genitive as a genitive of <span class="ital">apposition</span>, partly (so Luther and most expositors, including Matthies, Meier, Baumgarten-Crusius, de Wette) of the <span class="ital">reciprocal</span> service-rendering of the <span class="ital">members</span>,—an explanation which,[230] originating in the erroneous interpretation of <span class="greekheb">ἁφή</span>, introduces into the context something heterogeneous.

(Koppe, Meier, de Wette, and many), in which case, it is true, the non-repetition of the article, might be justified on the ground of a blending of <span class="greekheb">ἡ ἐπιχορηγία κατʼ ἐνέργειαν κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. into <span class="ital">one</span> conception, but on the other hand may be urged the fact that <span class="greekheb">ἐν μέτρῳ κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., as a specification of <span class="ital">measure</span>, points of itself to the <span class="ital">growth</span>, not to the <span class="greekheb">ἐπιχορηγία</span>; nor to <span class="greekheb">συμβιβαζ</span>. (Harless), to which even what precedes did not belong, but: after Paul has stated <span class="ital">whereby</span> the body grows (<span class="greekheb">διὰ πάσ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἁφῆς τῆς ἐπιχορηγ</span>.), he now also adds the <span class="ital">relation in which</span> it brings about its growth, namely, <span class="ital">according to an efficacy in keeping with the measure of each several part</span>, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> so that the growing body in its growth follows an activity of development in keeping with the measure peculiar to each several part of the body,—consequently no disproportioned monstrous growth results, but one which is <span class="ital">pursuant to proportion</span>, adapted to the varied measure of the several parts (so that, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, the hand does not grow disproportionately larger than the foot, etc.). <span class="ital">Without figure</span>: From Christ the church accomplishes its progressive development according to an efficacy, which is not equal in all individuals, but appropriate to the degree of development appointed for each several individual. Rückert and Bretschneider take <span class="greekheb">κατʼ ἐνέργειαν</span> adverbially: <span class="ital">after a powerful manner</span>. But <span class="greekheb">ἐνέργεια</span> <span class="ital">in itself</span> does not denote <span class="ital">powerful</span> working, but <span class="ital">efficacy, activity</span> in general, so that it would need a more precise definition for the sense supposed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-19.htm" title="And what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power,">Ephesians 1:19</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-7.htm" title="Whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God given to me by the effectual working of his power.">Ephesians 3:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-21.htm" title="Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like to his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things to himself.">Php 3:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-20.htm" title=" And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things to himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven.">Colossians 1:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-12.htm" title=" Buried with him in baptism, wherein also you are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who has raised him from the dead.">Colossians 2:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-9.htm" title="Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders,">2 Thessalonians 2:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-11.htm" title="And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie:">2 Thessalonians 2:11</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐν μέτρῳ</span>] <span class="ital">according to measure, pro mensura</span>; see Bernhardy, p. 211; Winer, p. 345 [E.

All growth in the body has its source in Christ, the Head.—<span class="greekheb">συναρμολογούμενον καὶ συμβιβαζόμενον</span>: <span class="ital">being fitly framed together and compacted</span>. Or, as RV, “fitly framed and knit together”. The participles are presents, as expressing a process that is going on. For the former see on chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-21.htm" title="In whom all the building fitly framed together grows to an holy temple in the Lord:">Ephesians 2:21</a> above. The latter, to which TWH give the form <span class="greekheb">συνβιβαζόμενον</span>, expresses the general idea of <span class="ital">putting together</span>, but with various shades of meaning, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, reconciling one to another (Herod., i., 74); <span class="ital">considering</span> or <span class="ital">concluding</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-10.htm" title="And after he had seen the vision, immediately we endeavored to go into Macedonia, assuredly gathering that the Lord had called us for to preach the gospel to them.">Acts 16:10</a>); <span class="ital">demonstrating</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-22.htm" title="But Saul increased the more in strength, and confounded the Jews which dwelled at Damascus, proving that this is very Christ.">Acts 9:22</a>); <span class="ital">instructing</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-16.htm" title="For who has known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.">1 Corinthians 2:16</a>); and (as here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-19.htm" title=" And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increases with the increase of God.">Colossians 2:19</a>) <span class="ital">compacting</span> or <span class="ital">knitting together</span> into one whole. Distinctions have been drawn between the two terms; <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, by Bengel, who took the <span class="greekheb">συναρμολογουμένη</span> to express specially the <span class="ital">harmony</span> of the building and the <span class="greekheb">συμβιβαζόμενον</span> its solidity; and by Ellicott, who thinks the idea of the former is that of the <span class="ital">aggregation</span> of the parts, and of the latter that of their <span class="ital">inter-adaption</span>. But at the most the difference does not seem to go beyond the notions of <span class="ital">joining</span> (<span class="greekheb">ἁρμός</span> = a <span class="ital">joint</span>) and <span class="ital">compacting</span> or <span class="ital">making to coalesce</span>.—<span class="greekheb">διὰ πἅσης ἁφῆς τῆς ἐπιχορηγίας</span>: <span class="ital">by means of every joint of the supply</span>. Here the AV and the RV are in substantial agreement, the former giving “by that which every joint supplieth”; the latter, “through that which every joint supplieth,” with the marginal rendering “through every joint of the supply”. The Vulgate gives <span class="ital">per omnem juncturam</span>. The old English Versions vary, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, Wicl., “by each jointure of under serving”; Tynd., “in every joint wherewith one ministereth to another”; Cov., “every joint of subministration”; Gen., “by every joint for the furniture thereof”; Bish., “by every joint yielding nourishment”. The clause is one of much difficulty, especially as regards the <span class="greekheb">ἁφῆς</span>. The word occurs only twice in the NT, here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-19.htm" title=" And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increases with the increase of God.">Colossians 2:19</a>. The question is whether it means <span class="ital">joint, contact</span>, or <span class="ital">sensation</span>. In classical Greek it has a variety of meanings, <span class="ital">e.g., touch</span> (Aeschyl., <span class="ital">Prom.</span>, 850), the <span class="ital">sense of touch</span> (Plato, <span class="ital">Rep.</span>, 523 E), <span class="ital">grasp</span> (Plut., 2, 86 F), a <span class="ital">junction</span> or <span class="ital">joint</span> in the body (Arist., <span class="ital">De Gen. et Corr.</span>, i., 8, 24), and also, it is contended, <span class="ital">feeling</span> (Plato, <span class="ital">Locr.</span>, p. 100 D, E; <span class="ital">Pol.</span>, vii., p. 523 E, etc.). In the present passage Chrys. and Theod. give it this last sense, <span class="greekheb">αἴσθησις</span>, <span class="ital">feeling, perception</span>; and among others Mey. follows this, rendering the clause “by means of such sensation of the supply” and denying indeed that <span class="greekheb">ἁφή</span> ever has the sense of <span class="greekheb">συναγή</span>, <span class="ital">vinculum</span>. But it seems clear that in the passage in Aristotle referred to above and in others, (<span class="ital">e.g.</span>, Arist., <span class="ital">De Coelo</span>, i., 11; Plato, <span class="ital">Axioch.</span>, p. 365 A) it has the sense of <span class="ital">joining, juncture, joint</span>. It is also clear that it has the sense of <span class="ital">adhesion, contact</span> (Arist., <span class="ital">Metaphys.</span>, iv., 4, x., 3; <span class="ital">Phys. Ausc.</span>, iv., 6; <span class="ital">De Gen. et Corr.</span>, i., 6). The meaning indeed for which Mey. contends seems to have little or no foundation in ancient Greek use. The choice lies between the other two. The sense of <span class="ital">contact</span> is preferred by some (<span class="ital">e.g.</span>, Oec, von Hofm.), the idea then being “by means of every contact which serves for supplying,” or “by means of every contact of each member of the body with the power which Christ supplies”. But most prefer the sense of “joint,” both because all the most ancient Versions understand the clause to have the members of the body and their relation one to another in view, and because in the parallel passage (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-19.htm" title=" And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increases with the increase of God.">Colossians 2:19</a>) <span class="greekheb">ἁφῶν</span> is coupled with <span class="greekheb">συνδέσμων</span>. If the sense of <span class="ital">feeling</span> is adopted the clause will naturally be attached to the following <span class="greekheb">αὔξησιν</span> … <span class="greekheb">ποιεῖται</span>, and will specify the way in which the <span class="ital">growth</span> is to be made. With the sense of <span class="ital">joint</span> the clause will be best attached to the participles preceding it (especially in view of the clause in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-19.htm" title=" And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increases with the increase of God.">Colossians 2:19</a>), and will define the means by which the <span class="ital">framing</span> and <span class="ital">compacting</span> are effected. (See especially Light. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-19.htm" title=" And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increases with the increase of God.">Colossians 2:19</a>.) The term <span class="greekheb">ἐπιχορηγία</span>, which occurs again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-19.htm" title="For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,">Php 1:19</a>, means <span class="ital">supply</span>, perhaps with something of the idea of the <span class="ital">large</span> and <span class="ital">liberal</span>, as Ell. suggests, belonging to the primary use of <span class="greekheb">ἐπιχορηγεῖν</span>. The <span class="greekheb">τῆς</span> points to the particular supply that comes from Christ, and the gen. may be taken as that of <span class="ital">inner relation</span> or <span class="ital">destination</span> (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <span class="greekheb">σκεύη τῆς λειτουργίας</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-21.htm" title="Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all the vessels of the ministry.">Hebrews 9:21</a>; see Win.-Moult., p. 235). The idea, therefore, appears to be that the body is fitly framed and knit together by means of the joints, every one of them in its own place and function, as the points of connection between member and member and the points of communication between the different parts and the supply which comes from the Head. The joints are the constituents of union in the body and the media of the impartation of the life drawn by the members from the head. Precisely so in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-19.htm" title=" And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increases with the increase of God.">Colossians 2:19</a> the <span class="ital">joints</span> and <span class="ital">ligaments</span> are mentioned together and are described as the parts by which the body receives its supplies (<span class="greekheb">ἐπιχορηγούμενον</span>) and is kept compact together (<span class="greekheb">συμβιβαζόμενον</span>).—<span class="greekheb">κατʼ ἐνέργειαν ἐν μέτρῳ ἑνὸς ἑκάστου μέρους</span>: <span class="ital">according to an efficiency in the measure of each individual part</span>. For <span class="greekheb">μέρους</span> some good MSS., etc., read <span class="greekheb">μέλους</span> (AC, Syr., Boh., Vulg., etc.), and WH give it a place in their margin. But <span class="greekheb">μέρους</span> is to be preferred, as supported by such authorities as [418] [419] [420] [421] [422] [423] [424], Arm., etc. <span class="greekheb">ἐνέργειαν</span> = <span class="ital">energy</span> in the sense of <span class="ital">activity, working</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐν μέτρῳ</span> = <span class="ital">in the measure, i.e., proportionate to, in keeping with</span> (Mey.), or <span class="ital">commensurate with</span> (Ell.). <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span> can never have the sense of <span class="greekheb">κατά</span>. But it is used occasionally like the Heb. <span class="greekheb">בְּ</span>, in phrases expressing the <span class="ital">proportion</span> or <span class="ital">law in accordance</span> with which something is done (Thuc., i., 77, 8:89; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-11.htm" title="Let us labor therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.">Hebrews 4:11</a>; see Win.-Moult., p. 483). The clause is connected by some (de Wette, etc.) with <span class="greekheb">τῆς ἐπιχορηγίας</span>; by others (Harl., etc.) with the <span class="greekheb">συναρμολογούμενον καὶ συμβιβαζόμενον</span>; but it is best attached to the <span class="greekheb">αὔξησιν</span> … <span class="greekheb">ποιεῖται</span>. So it defines the <span class="ital">nature, law</span>, or <span class="ital">order</span> of the growth, describing it as proceeding in accordance with an inward operation that adapts itself to the nature and function of each several part and gives to each its proper measure. It is a growth that is neither monstrous nor disproportioned, but normal, harmonious, careful of the capacity and suited to the service of each individual member of Christ’s body.—<span class="greekheb">τὴν αὔξησιν τοῦ σώματος ποιεῖται</span>: <span class="ital">maketh the growth of the body</span>. <span class="greekheb">αὔξησις</span>, common enough, together with <span class="greekheb">αὔξη</span>, in classical Greek, occurs only twice in the NT, here and <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-19.htm" title=" And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increases with the increase of God.">Colossians 2:19</a>. The Mid. <span class="greekheb">ποιεῖται</span> conveys the idea of making <span class="ital">for oneself</span>; or it may rather <span class="ital">strengthen</span> the sense, suggesting “the energy with which the process is carried on” (Ell.). See especially Donaldson, <span class="ital">Greek Gram.</span>, p. 438, for the use of the <span class="ital">appropriative</span> and <span class="ital">intensive</span> Middle. The repetition of the <span class="greekheb">σῶμα</span>, “the whole body … makes the increase of the body,” is due probably to the desire to avoid ambiguity, as the pronoun might have been taken to refer to the <span class="greekheb">μέρους</span>.—<span class="greekheb">εἰς οἰκοδομὴν ἑαυτοῦ ἐν ἀγάπῃ</span>: <span class="ital">unto the building up of itself in love</span>. <span class="greekheb">εἰς</span> expresses the <span class="ital">object</span> and <span class="ital">end</span> of the carrying on of the growth, <span class="ital">viz.</span>, the completion of the body. The <span class="greekheb">ἐν ἀγάπῃ</span> might qualify the <span class="greekheb">αὔξησιν ποιεῖται</span> (so Mey.); but it is more fitly connected with the <span class="greekheb">οἰκοδομήν</span>, as denoting the ethical element or condition of that consummation and completion of the Church which is the object of the long-continued process of growth.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[418] Codex Vaticanus (sæc. iv.), published in photographic facsimile in 1889 under the care of the Abbate Cozza-Luzi.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[419] Codex Sinaiticus (sæc. iv.), now at St. Petersburg, published in facsimile type by its discoverer, Tischendorf, in 1862.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[420] Codex Claromontanus (sæc. vi.), a Græco-Latin MS. at Paris, edited by Tischendorf in 1852.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[421] Codex Boernerianus (sæc. ix.), a Græco-Latin MS., at Dresden, edited by Matthæi in 1791.

The Body, vitalized from and by the Head, is <span class="ital">evermore acquiring</span> a deeper and truer contact of part with part, a more harmonious (“<span class="ital">fitly</span>”) inner union and action. See above on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-21.htm" title="In whom all the building fitly framed together grows to an holy temple in the Lord:">Ephesians 2:21</a>, where the same Gr. word occurs.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">compacted</span>] Again a present participle. (The same word recurs <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-19.htm" title=" And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increases with the increase of God.">Colossians 2:19</a>.) The idea of growth in harmony of structure (see last note) here merges into that of growth in solidity and strength.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">by that which every joint supplieth</span>] Lit., <span class="bld">by</span> or <span class="bld">through every joint of the supply</span>. It is possible to render “by every <span class="ital">contact</span> of the supply”; i.e., as explained by St Chrysostom here, “as the Spirit touches, in order to supply grace, each limb of the Body”; or, perhaps, as each limb, each believer, touches (by faith) the source of supply. But the parallel passage <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-19.htm" title=" And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increases with the increase of God.">Colossians 2:19</a> is decisive for the explanation “joint.” So the Latin Versions, <span class="ital">junctura</span>. The thought is of “supply” passing to the limbs through the <span class="ital">nexus</span> of each with the source of life. Each such <span class="ital">nexus</span> is thus a “joint <span class="ital">of</span> supply,” “a junction designed for, made for, conveyance” of life and power; as we speak of “a bond <span class="ital">of</span> union.” The metaphor must not be elaborately pressed. The essential idea is mutual coherence and common growth of the limbs through individual connexion with the Head (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-17.htm" title="But he that is joined to the Lord is one spirit.">1 Corinthians 6:17</a>), not through connexion with other limbs. The “joint” thus represents the man’s spiritual union with Christ, not union with church-organization, which is a thing, however sacred, of another order. The life-flow from the Head to each spiritual Limb is individual and direct. The product of this, not the cause or means of it, is the life of the Body.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">according to the effectual working</span>] Better, simply, <span class="bld">[the] working</span>. The process in view takes place “according to,” in the manner and on the scale of, the life-power of the Head acting in the Limb. The original noun (whence our “energy” is derived) occurs in N. T. only in St Paul; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-19.htm" title="And what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power,">Ephesians 1:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-7.htm" title="Whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God given to me by the effectual working of his power.">Ephesians 3:7</a> (where see note), and here; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-21.htm" title="Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like to his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things to himself.">Php 3:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-29.htm" title=" Whereunto I also labor, striving according to his working, which works in me mightily.">Colossians 1:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-12.htm" title=" Buried with him in baptism, wherein also you are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who has raised him from the dead.">Colossians 2:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-9.htm" title="Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders,">2 Thessalonians 2:9</a> (of the working of the Evil Power). The article is omitted before the word here, perhaps because the power referred to is unmistakable. Alford renders “according to vital working.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in the measure of every part</span>] Each limb has its own conditions of larger or smaller capacity; age, circumstances, training, and the like occasion very various “measures” in the allotments of the Divine life-power which adjusts itself to each real need, while it can always fully meet that need.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">maketh</span>] The form of the Gr. verb (middle) indicates fulness and intensity of action.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">increase</span>] Lit., <span class="bld">the increase</span>, <span class="ital">the</span> growth contemplated as taking place.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">unto the edifying of itself</span>] For illustration, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-21.htm" title="In whom all the building fitly framed together grows to an holy temple in the Lord:">Ephesians 2:21</a>, and notes.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><span class="ital">in</span> love<span class="bld"></span></span>] The inmost condition of the whole process. All takes place “in,” under the power and after the action of, “love”; for the Source of the life-energy is “the Son of the Father’s love” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-13.htm" title=" Who has delivered us from the power of darkness, and has translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son:">Colossians 1:13</a>, Gr.), and the recipients are “rooted and grounded in the love” of the Father in Him (see above on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-17.htm" title="That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that you, being rooted and grounded in love,">Ephesians 3:17</a>); from which “no created thing shall separate them” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-39.htm" title="Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.">Romans 8:39</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/ephesians/4.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-16.htm" title="From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplies, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, makes increase of the body to the edifying of itself in love.">Ephesians 4:16</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἐξ</span>, <span class="ital">from</span>) The source of growth.—<span class="greekheb">συναρμολογούμενον καὶ συμβιβαζόμενον</span>) the body <span class="ital">fitly joined together and compacted;</span> the concrete for the abstract; <span class="ital">i.e.</span> the compacting and joining together of the body by right conformation and solid compacting together: <span class="greekheb">συναρμολογούμενον</span> refers to what is according to rule, so that all the parts may be rightly fitted in their proper position and in mutual relation; <span class="greekheb">συμβιβαζόμενον</span> denotes at once firmness and consolidation.—<span class="greekheb">διὰ πάσης ἀφῆς τῆς ἐπιχορηγίας</span>) [“By every handle of mutual assistance.” Engl.

Not, however, in a mere <span class="accented">individual</span> sense, but as an organization, the parts being adapted and articulated to one another (this process being continuous; see present participles, (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>). In the Church there are babes in Christ, also young men and old men; some are clear in intellect, some strong in faith, some warm in love, some excel in passive virtues, some in active; but in a well-ordered Church these should be getting jointed together, and learning to work with and for one another, no one despising gifts which he has not but another has; in tiffs sense, there ought to be a spiritual communism, for all are one spiritual body. But spiritual communism does not involve social communism or even social equality, nor will social distinctions be obliterated in a pure Church, except so far as they hinder spiritual communion. <span class="cmt_word">According to the energy in the measure</span> (or, <span class="accented">proportion</span>) <span class="cmt_word">of each individual part.</span> This clause seems to be most naturally connected with what follows. In the fit framing of the body, channels as it were are laid for the propagation and working of the vital force throughout the body; this force is not alike, but of various amount in the different parts; some members have much of it, some little, but the measure of this vital three regulates the growth. <span class="cmt_word">Carries on the growth of the body.</span> The middle voice, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, indicates that it is a growth from within, while depending on the energy furnished by Christ. <span class="cmt_word">For building up of itself in love.</span> This is the end, <span class="accented">so far as the body itself is concerned</span>, though, of course, the completed spiritual body, like the completed natural body, has work to do outside itself. In a healthy Church there is a continual work of building up: construction, not destruction, is its proper business - promoting peace, purity, prayerfulness, trust, activity in the work of the Lord, but all in love, the absence of which makes winter instead of summer, declension instead of progress, death instead of life. In illustration of the various measure of grace, and yet its real efficiency in all the members of the Church, Eadie says, "No member or ordinance is superfluous. The widow's mite was commended by him who sat over against the treasury. Solomon built a temple. Joseph provided a tomb. Mary the mother gave birth to the child, and the other Marys wrapped the corpse in spices. Lydia entertained the apostle, and Phoebe carried an Epistle of old, the princes and heroes went to the field, and wise-hearted women did spin. While Joshua fought, Moses prayed. The snuffers and trays were as necessary as the magnificent lampstand.... The result is that the Church is built up, for love is the element of spiritual progress. That love fills the renewed nature." The Church has been defined as an institution that has truth for its nourishment, love for its atmosphere, and Christ for its Head. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/ephesians/4.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Fitly joined - compacted (&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;  - &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;)<p>The present participles denote present, continuous progress.
