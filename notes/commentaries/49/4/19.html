They are (he says) “past feeling”; or, literally, carrying on the metaphor of callousness, <span class= "ital">they have lost the capacity of pain</span>—the moral pain which is the natural and healthful consequence of sin against our true natures. Consequently, losing in this their true humanity, they give themselves over to “lasciviousness.” The word used here (as also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/7-22.htm" title="Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness:">Mark 7:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-13.htm" title="Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying.">Romans 13:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-21.htm" title="And lest, when I come again, my God will humble me among you, and that I shall mourn many which have sinned already, and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed.">2Corinthians 12:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-19.htm" title="Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,">Galatians 5:19</a>) signifies a lust devoid of all sense of decency, recklessly and grossly animal. Hence its result is not only to work out uncleanness of every kind, but to do so “with greediness,” with a reckless delight in foulness for its own sake. The union of this brutality of sensual sin with intellectual acuteness and æsthetic culture was the most horrible feature of that corrupt Greek civilisation, tainted with Oriental grossness, of which he was especially writing.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:17-24 The apostle charged the Ephesians in the name and by the authority of the Lord Jesus, that having professed the gospel, they should not be as the unconverted Gentiles, who walked in vain fancies and carnal affections. Do not men, on every side, walk in the vanity of their minds? Must not we then urge the distinction between real and nominal Christians? They were void of all saving knowledge; they sat in darkness, and loved it rather than light. They had a dislike and hatred to a life of holiness, which is not only the way of life God requires and approves, and by which we live to him, but which has some likeness to God himself in his purity, righteousness, truth, and goodness. The truth of Christ appears in its beauty and power, when it appears as in Jesus. The corrupt nature is called a man; like the human body, it is of divers parts, supporting and strengthening one another. Sinful desires are deceitful lusts; they promise men happiness, but render them more miserable; and bring them to destruction, if not subdued and mortified. These therefore must be put off, as an old garment, a filthy garment; they must be subdued and mortified. But it is not enough to shake off corrupt principles; we must have gracious ones. By the new man, is meant the new nature, the new creature, directed by a new principle, even regenerating grace, enabling a man to lead a new life of righteousness and holiness. This is created, or brought forth by God's almighty power.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ephesians/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Who being past feeling - Wholly hardened in sin.

Their giving themselves to it was punished in kind, God giving them up to it by withdrawing His preventing grace; their sin thus was made their punishment. They gave themselves up of their own accord to the slavery of their lust, to do all its pleasure, as captives who have ceased to strive with the foe. God gave them up to it, but not against their will; for they give themselves up to it [Zanchius].<p>lasciviousness&#8212;"wantonness" [Alford]. So it is translated in Ro 13:13; 2Pe 2:18.

These two things <span class="greekheb">ἀκαθαρσία</span> and <span class="greekheb">πλεονεξία</span> ranked as the two great heathen vices. So the Gentiles, darkened and alienated from the life of God, had become men of such a character that they gave themselves wilfully over to wanton sensuality, in order that they might practise every kind of uncleanness and do that with unbridled greedy desire.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[443] Codex Claromontanus (sæc. vi.), a Græco-Latin MS. at Paris, edited by Tischendorf in 1852.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[444] Codex Augiensis (sæc. ix.), a Græco-Latin MS., at Trinity College, Cambridge, edited by Scrivener in 1859.

The perverted <span class="ital">will</span> is the traitor, the “giver over.” However deep the mystery of its perversion, it is always <span class="ital">the will</span>, and speaks as such the decisive “yes” to temptation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">lasciviousness</span>] The Gr. word occurs in N.T. 11 times. See <span class="ital">e.g.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/7-22.htm" title="Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness:">Mark 7:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-13.htm" title="Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying.">Romans 13:13</a> (A.V., “wantonness”); <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-19.htm" title="Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,">Galatians 5:19</a>. The root-idea of the word is not specially fleshly impurity, but rebellion against restraint as such; petulance, wantonness, as shewn <span class="ital">e.g.</span> in violence. Abp Trench (<span class="ital">N. T. Synonyms</span>, on this word), recommends accordingly <span class="bld">wantonness</span> as a better rendering than “lasciviousness,” which is but one manifestation of the tendency denoted.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">to work</span>] Lit., <span class="bld">to the working of.</span> The Gr. noun occurs elsewhere in N.T. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-58.htm" title="When you go with your adversary to the magistrate, as you are in the way, give diligence that you may be delivered from him; lest he hale you to the judge, and the judge deliver you to the officer, and the officer cast you into prison.">Luke 12:58</a> (A.V., “diligence”); <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-16.htm" title="And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain damsel possessed with a spirit of divination met us, which brought her masters much gain by soothsaying:">Acts 16:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-19.htm" title="And when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone, they caught Paul and Silas, and drew them into the marketplace to the rulers,">Acts 16:19</a> (A.V., “gain”); <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-24.htm" title="For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, which made silver shrines for Diana, brought no small gain to the craftsmen;">Acts 19:24</a> (A.V., “gain”), Rom 25 (A.V., “craft”). The idea of business thus adheres to the word. The suggestion conveyed by it here is that sin becomes to the deliberate sinner an earnest pursuit, an occupation. Cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-14.htm" title="But put you on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfill the lusts thereof.">Romans 13:14</a> (“<span class="ital">forethought</span> for the flesh”). The R.V. gives in its margin here, “to make a trade of.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">uncleanness</span>] The connexion of the Gr. word is mainly with fleshly impurity, and so probably here. But it is not quite confined to this; one passage (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-3.htm" title="For our exhortation was not of deceit, nor of uncleanness, nor in guile:">1 Thessalonians 2:3</a>) giving the thought rather of “impure motives” in the sense of insincerity.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">greediness</span>] The Gr. word is rendered “covetousness,” <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-15.htm" title="And he said to them, Take heed, and beware of covetousness: for a man's life consists not in the abundance of the things which he possesses.">Luke 12:15</a>. But it means much more than the desire of <span class="ital">money</span>, or <span class="ital">property</span>, with which we specially associate “covetousness.” It occurs (or its cognate verb or adjective) in close connexion with the subject of <span class="ital">fleshly impurity</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-11.htm" title="But now I have written to you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or an extortionist; with such an one no not to eat.">1 Corinthians 5:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-6.htm" title="That no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter: because that the Lord is the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned you and testified.">1 Thessalonians 4:6</a>; and below, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-3.htm" title="But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becomes saints;">Ephesians 5:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-5.htm" title="For this you know, that no fornicator, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.">Ephesians 5:5</a>. See too <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-5.htm" title=" Mortify therefore your members which are on the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry:">Colossians 3:5</a>. “Greed” has a strong and terrible connexion with impurity, as is obvious. Bp Lightfoot shews (on <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-5.htm" title=" Mortify therefore your members which are on the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry:">Colossians 3:5</a>) that the present word never <span class="ital">of itself</span> denotes “lust,” while it is, of course, rightly used to denote the horrible grasp and plunder which lust involves.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In this verse the Apostle depicts, as universal among “the Gentiles,” an abandoned licentiousness. Contemporary literature gives mournful testimony to the charge, as regards society in general, indicating a large social toleration of the most hideous vices, and a significant readiness to import vicious imagery into refined spheres of thought. But the accusation of this passage, surely, transcends the limits of any one age, or state of society; it is levelled at unregenerate Man. And the explanation of it, so viewed, is to be sought in the study of those <span class="ital">tendencies</span> of evil which reside in the fallen “heart” as such. The action of outrageous <span class="ital">sinning</span> does but illustrate the underlying principle of <span class="ital">sin;</span> a principle with which absolutely nothing but “the life of God” can effectually deal. See further <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/3-10.htm" title="As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:...">Romans 3:10-18</a>, and notes in this Series.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/ephesians/4.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-19.htm" title="Who being past feeling have given themselves over to lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness.">Ephesians 4:19</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἀπηλγηκότες</span>) A very significant term, in which pain (<span class="greekheb">ἄλγος</span>) is used by Synecdoche for the whole sensibility of the affections and understanding, whether painful or pleasant. For pain urges us to seek the means of a cure; and when the pain is removed, not only hope, but also the desire and thought of good things are lost, so that a man becomes senseless, shameless, hopeless. That constitutes <span class="ital">hardness</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-18.htm" title="Having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart:">Ephesians 4:18</a>. <span class="ital">Despairing</span> (Desperantes), in the Vulgate and Syriac Version, is worthy of consideration, and illustrates its signification. In this way <span class="greekheb">ἡ ἀναλγησία</span> (<span class="ital">insensibility</span>) and <span class="greekheb">ἡ ἀπόγνωσις</span> (<span class="ital">despair</span>) are conjointly noted by Chrysostom, Homil. vi., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-13.htm" title="But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.">Hebrews 3:13</a>. But the very word <span class="greekheb">ἀπαλγεῖν</span> Cicero seems to paraphrase, lib. 2. famil. Ep. 16, when he says, “Diuturna DESPERATIONE rerum obduruisse animum ad DOLOREM novum,” <span class="ital">that by long-continued</span> DESPAIR <span class="ital">at existing circumstances the mind has become hardened to new</span> PAIN. Therefore <span class="greekheb">ἀπαλγεῖν</span> is more than <span class="ital">to despair</span>. Raphelius has given a beautiful disquisition on this word out of Polybius, where, of two examples ascribed to Polybius by Suidas, the oneexists in the same words in Xiphilinus.—<span class="greekheb">ἑαυτοὺς παρέδωκαν</span>, they <span class="ital">gave themselves over</span>) of their own accord, willingly.—<span class="greekheb">πάσης</span>, <span class="ital">of all</span>) <span class="greekheb">ἀσέλγεια</span>, <span class="ital">lasciviousness</span>, the species; <span class="greekheb">ἀκαθαρσία</span>, <span class="ital">impurity</span>, the genus. Those who are occupied with these works of the flesh, as being hurried away (seized) with the heated desire of material objects, fall also into <span class="ital">greediness</span> [<span class="greekheb">πλεονεξίᾳ</span>, avarice, covetousness]; and gain made by unchastity was frequent among the Gentiles.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who being past feeling.</span> Without sense of shame, without conscience, without fear of God or regard for man, without any perception of the dignity of human nature, the glory of the Divine image, or the degradation of sin. <span class="cmt_word">Have given themselves over to lasciviousness to work all uncleanness</span> (fourth point of difference). This is the climax - heathenism in its worst and fullest development, yet by no means rare. The sensuality of the heathen was and is something dreadful. Many of them gave themselves to it as a business, worked at it as at a trade or employment (see Uhlmann's 'Conflict of Christianity with Heathenism,' etc.). Details, such as even the walls of Pompeii furnish, are unfit for the public eye. <span class="cmt_word">With greediness</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> means the desire of having more, and has reference to the insatiable character of sensual sins. Sometimes it is translated (A.V.) "covetousness," as <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-3.htm">Ephesians 5:3</a>. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/ephesians/4.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Who (&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;)<p>Explanatory and classifying: men of the class which.<p>Being past feeling (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;)<p>Only here in the New Testament.

It indicates a complete surrender. Meyer says, "with frightful emphasis." Where men persistently give themselves up to evil, God gives them up to its power.
