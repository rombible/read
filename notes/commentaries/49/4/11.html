The word “gave,” instead of the more obvious word <span class= "ital">set, </span>or <span class= "ital">appointed</span> (used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-28.htm" title="And God has set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.">1Corinthians 12:28</a>), is, of course, suggested by <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-8.htm" title="Why he said, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts to men.">Ephesians 4:8</a>. They who are ministers of His gifts are themselves gifts from Him to the Church.<p><span class= "bld">Some, apostles; and some, prophets . . .</span>—With this passage we must compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-28.htm" title="And God has set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.">1Corinthians 12:28</a>, “God hath set some in the Church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings,” &c.; and, perhaps, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/12-6.htm" title="Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith;">Romans 12:6-8</a>, “Having then gifts . . . whether prophecy . . . or ministry . . . or teaching . . . or exhortation . . .,” although this last passage is lass formally apposite. In all three cases there is the same general idea, first of the one body, and then of the one Spirit, guiding and animating it through various ministries. The parallel between this passage and the passage in 1 Cor. is very close; for in the latter all that follows the words “after that” may be put aside, as describing, not special offices or ministries, but special gifts. We have, therefore, in both, “first apostles, secondly prophets.” Then come, in the earlier Epistle, “teachers;” and this class, in our own later Epistle, is subdivided into “evangelists” and “pastors,” both being teachers—the one in conversion of those still aliens from Christ, the other in edification of those already brought into His flock.<p><span class= "bld">Some, apostles.</span>—The name “apostles” is certainly used here in its technical and restricted sense, as applying to the Twelve, whom “the Apostle” of God Himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-1.htm" title="Why, holy brothers, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus;">Hebrews 3:1</a>) named as His Apostles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-13.htm" title="And when it was day, he called to him his disciples: and of them he chose twelve, whom also he named apostles;">Luke 6:13</a>), and with whom St. Paul claims equality (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-1.htm" title="Am I not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? are not you my work in the Lord?">1Corinthians 9:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/15-9.htm" title="For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.">1Corinthians 15:9-11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-1.htm" title="Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead;)">Galatians 1:1</a>) on the ground of his own special mission and revelation from the same Lord. It is, indeed, used in a wider sense; sometimes with words distinctly implying a derivation and human mission, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-23.htm" title="Whether any do inquire of Titus, he is my partner and fellow helper concerning you: or our brothers be inquired of, they are the messengers of the churches, and the glory of Christ.">2Corinthians 8:23</a>, “apostles (or, <span class= "ital">messengers</span>) of the churches;” <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-25.htm" title="Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, and companion in labor, and fellow soldier, but your messenger, and he that ministered to my wants.">Philippians 2:25</a>, “Epaphroditus, your apostle (or, <span class= "ital">messenger</span>)<span class= "ital">;</span>” sometimes without such qualification, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-5.htm" title="For I suppose I was not a whit behind the very most chief apostles.">2Corinthians 11:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-13.htm" title="For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ.">2Corinthians 11:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/12-11.htm" title="I am become a fool in glorying; you have compelled me: for I ought to have been commended of you: for in nothing am I behind the very most chief apostles, though I be nothing.">2Corinthians 12:11-12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-7.htm" title="But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherishes her children:">1Thessalonians 2:7</a>; and, perhaps, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-7.htm" title="Salute Andronicus and Junia, my kinsmen, and my fellow-prisoners, who are of note among the apostles, who also were in Christ before me.">Romans 16:7</a>. But such use is rare, and cannot be applied to a passage like this, which is distinctive of a special and primary class. In direct charge from the Lord, universal scope of mission, special inspiration and power of miracle, which are “the signs of an apostle” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-12.htm" title="Truly the signs of an apostle were worked among you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds.">2Corinthians 12:12</a>), the Apostles, properly so called, stood out in office absolutely unique and supreme. What was said of the first age of the Church is true of all ages—“of the rest durst no man join himself unto them” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-13.htm" title="And of the rest dared no man join himself to them: but the people magnified them.">Acts 5:13</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Some, prophets.</span>—For the nature and function of prophecy in the Church, see the detailed treatment of the subject by St. Paul in 1 Corinthians 14. It is sufficient here to note (1) that from very early times the “prophets” are mentioned as a separate class (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-27.htm" title="And in these days came prophets from Jerusalem to Antioch.">Acts 11:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-32.htm" title="And Judas and Silas, being prophets also themselves, exhorted the brothers with many words, and confirmed them.">Acts 15:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-10.htm" title="And as we tarried there many days, there came down from Judaea a certain prophet, named Agabus.">Acts 21:10</a>), distinguished from teachers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-1.htm" title="Now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers; as Barnabas, and Simeon that was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen, which had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.">Acts 13:1</a>), and that, in this Epistle especially, they are spoken of, in connection with the Apostles, as receiving the revealed mystery of the gospel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-5.htm" title="Which in other ages was not made known to the sons of men, as it is now revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit;">Ephesians 3:5</a>), and being (or, <span class= "ital">laying</span>) “the foundation of the Church;” (2) that their office, like the Apostolate, is clearly extraordinary, distinct from the ordinary and permanent teaching of the evangelists and pastors, and, probably, best described by the two phrases so constantly applied to the prophets of the Old Testament—“the word of the Lord came to me;” “the Spirit of the Lord was upon me.” As all God’s extraordinary gifts and workings are closely correlated with His ordinary laws of operation, so in this case the apostolic and prophetic offices gradually melt away into the regular functions of government and teaching, belonging in all times to the ministry of the Church.<p><span class= "bld">Some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers.</span>—In these two phrases (corresponding to the simple word “teachers” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-28.htm" title="And God has set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.">1Corinthians 12:28</a>) we find described the two-fold office of the regular ministry of the Church—first, to preach the gospel to the heathen or the unconverted, and next, to fulfil our Lord’s pastoral charge (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/21-15.htm" title="So when they had dined, Jesus said to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonas, love you me more than these? He said to him, Yes, Lord; you know that I love you. He said to him, Feed my lambs.">John 21:15-17</a>) of feeding and shepherding those who are already His sheep. It is clear that the same person may be invested with the two offices, as Timothy, when in pastoral charge at Ephesus, is bidden “to do the work of an evangelist” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-5.htm" title="But watch you in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of your ministry.">2Timothy 4:5</a>); and that in some degree the two offices must always be united, for the evangelist, like the apostle, is generally called upon to organise and “confirm the churches” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/14-22.htm" title="Confirming the souls of the disciples, and exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God.">Acts 14:22-23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-41.htm" title="And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches.">Acts 15:41</a>), and the pastor must always find men unconverted, to whom he must be an evangelist. But the two elements of duty will co-exist in different proportions in different persons. Some were then, and are now, especially called to be “evangelists”—that is, as is shown by the career of Philip, to whom the name is first given (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-8.htm" title="And the next day we that were of Paul's company departed, and came to Caesarea: and we entered into the house of Philip the evangelist, which was one of the seven; and stayed with him.">Acts 21:8</a>), to be, under the apostolic guidance, missionaries to the unconverted; others to be “pastors and teachers,” feeding now with “pure milk of the word,” now with “solid meat” (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-2.htm" title="I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for till now you were not able to bear it, neither yet now are you able.">1Corinthians 3:2</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-12.htm" title="For when for the time you ought to be teachers, you have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat.">Hebrews 5:12</a>), those already gathered into the fold, and exercising over them the pastoral authority solemnly committed by our Lord to His ministers. Yet both can discharge only under limitation the functions which in the Apostles were practically unlimited.<p>On the question whether this celebrated passage describes the regular orders or the functions, ordinary and extraordinary, of the ministry, we may fairly say that while no doubt the very genius of the passage points to the latter alternative, yet the ultimate appeal must be made to history. It is clear, from the nature of the case, that none could inherit the direct and universal commission from Christ held by the Apostles; it is certain historically that the supernatural gifts of prophecy and miracle passed away; it is hardly less indisputable that the two functions of evangelism and pastorate were always shared among the three orders of bishops, priests, and deacons after the close of the Apostolic age.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/ephesians/4.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-11.htm" title="And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;">Ephesians 4:11</a></span>. <span class="ital">And </span>— Among other his free gifts; <span class="ital">he gave some, apostles </span>— His chief ministers and special witnesses, as having seen him after his resurrection, and received their commission immediately from him.

All is given as seems best to Christ to bestow upon every one. He received for them, that he might give to them, a large measure of gifts and graces; particularly the gift of the Holy Ghost. Not a mere head knowledge, or bare acknowledging Christ to be the Son of God, but such as brings trust and obedience. There is a fulness in Christ, and a measure of that fulness given in the counsel of God to every believer; but we never come to the perfect measure till we come to heaven. God's children are growing, as long as they are in this world; and the Christian's growth tends to the glory of Christ. The more a man finds himself drawn out to improve in his station, and according to his measure, all that he has received, to the spiritual good of others, he may the more certainly believe that he has the grace of sincere love and charity rooted in his heart.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ephesians/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And he gave some, apostles - He gave some to be apostles.

The word does not elsewhere occur in the New Testament. What was the precise office of the evangelist in the primitive church, it is now impossible to determine. The evangelist "may" have been one whose main business was "preaching," and who was not particularly engaged in the "government" of the church. The word properly means "a messenger of good tidings;" and Robinson (Lexicon) supposes that it denotes a minister of the gospel who was not located in any place, but who traveled as a missionary to preach the gospel, and to found churches. The word is so used now by many Christians; but it cannot be proved that it is so used in the New Testament. An explanation of the words which here occur may be found in Neander on the Primitive Church, in the Biblical Repository, vol. iv. pp. 258ff The office was distinct from that of the "pastor," the teacher, and the "prophet:" and was manifestly an office in which "preaching" was the main thing.<p>And some, pastors - Literally, "shepherds" - &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;  poimenas; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-36.htm">Matthew 9:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-32.htm">Matthew 25:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-31.htm">Matthew 26:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-34.htm">Mark 6:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/14-27.htm">Mark 14:27</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/2-8.htm">Luke 2:8</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/2-15.htm">Luke 2:15</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/2-18.htm">Luke 2:18</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-20.htm">Luke 2:20</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/10-2.htm">John 10:2</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11-12</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/10-14.htm">John 10:14</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/10-16.htm">John 10:16</a>, where it is rendered "shepherd and shepherds;" also <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-20.htm">Hebrews 13:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-25.htm">1 Peter 2:25</a>; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-31.htm">Matthew 26:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/14-27.htm">Mark 14:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-20.htm">Hebrews 13:20</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-25.htm">1 Peter 2:25</a>, it is applied to the Lord Jesus as the great shepherd of the flock - the church. It is rendered "pastors" only in the place before us. The word is given to ministers of the gospel with obvious propriety, and with great beauty. They are to exercise the same watchfulness and care river the people of their charge which a shepherd does over his flock; compare the notes on <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/21-15.htm">John 21:15-16</a>. The meaning here is, that Christ exercised a special care for his church by appointing "pastors" who would watch over it as a shepherd does over his flock.<p>And teachers - see the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-7.htm">Romans 12:7</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ephesians/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11. Greek, emphatical. "Himself" by His supreme power. "It is He that gave," &c.<p>gave some, apostles&#8212;Translate, "some to be apostles, and some to be prophets," &c. The men who filled the office, no less than the office itself, were a divine gift [Eadie]. Ministers did not give themselves. Compare with the list here, 1Co 12:10, 28. As the apostles, prophets, and evangelists were special and extraordinary ministers, so "pastors and teachers" are the ordinary stated ministers of a particular flock, including, probably, the bishops, presbyters, and deacons. Evangelists were itinerant preachers like our missionaries, as Philip the deacon (Ac 21:8); as contrasted with stationary "pastors and teachers" (2Ti 4:5). The evangelist founded the Church; the teacher built it up in the faith already received. The "pastor" had the outward rule and guidance of the Church: the bishop. As to revelation, the "evangelist" testified infallibly of the past; the "prophet," infallibly of the future. The prophet derived all from the Spirit; the evangelist, in the special case of the Four, recorded matter of fact, cognizable to the senses, under the Spirit's guidance. No one form of Church polity as permanently unalterable is laid down in the New Testament though the apostolical order of bishops, or presbyters, and deacons, superintended by higher overseers (called bishops after the apostolic times), has the highest sanction of primitive usage. In the case of the Jews, a fixed model of hierarchy and ceremonial unalterably bound the people, most minutely detailed in the law. In the New Testament, the absence of minute directions for Church government and ceremonies, shows that a fixed model was not designed; the general rule is obligatory as to ceremonies, "Let all things be done decently and in order" (compare Article XXXIV, Church of England); and that a succession of ministers be provided, not self-called, but "called to the work by men who have public authority given unto them in the congregation, to call and send ministers into the Lord's vineyard" [Article XXIII]. That the "pastors" here were the bishops and presbyters of the Church, is evident from Ac 20:28; 1Pe 5:1, 2, where the bishops' and presbyters' office is said to be "to feed" the flock. The term, "shepherd" or "pastor," is used of guiding and governing and not merely instructing, whence it is applied to kings, rather than prophets or priests (Eze 34:23; Jer 23:4). Compare the names of princes compounded of "pharnas," Hebrew, "pastor," Holophernes, Tis-saphernes (compare Isa 44:28).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ephesians/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">And he gave; </span> distributed several gifts, (which are spoken of in general, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-7.htm" title="In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace;">Ephesians 1:7</a></span>), according to his Father’s appointment, who is said to set in the church what Christ is here said to give, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-28.htm" title="And God has set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.">1 Corinthians 12:28</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Objection.</span> Nothing is here said of gifts, but only of offices. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Answer.</span> Christ never gave offices without suitable furniture; this diversity therefore of offices includes diversity of respective gifts. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Apostles; </span> extraordinary officers, with an immediate call, universal commission, infallibility in teaching, and power of working miracles, appointed for the first founding the Christian church in all parts of the world, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-19.htm" title="Go you therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:">Matthew 28:19</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-6.htm" title="And when Paul had laid his hands on them, the Holy Ghost came on them; and they spoke with tongues, and prophesied.">Acts 19:6</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Objection.</span> The apostles were appointed by Christ before his death. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Answer.</span> The apostle here speaks not of Christ’s first calling them, but: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

That is, he gave them gifts by which they were qualified to be apostles; who were such as were immediately called by Christ, and had their doctrine from him, and their commission to preach it; and were peculiarly and infallibly guided by the Spirit of God, and had a power to work miracles for the confirmation of their doctrine; and had authority to go everywhere and preach the Gospel, and plant churches, and were not confined to anyone particular place or church; this was the first and chief office in the church, and of an extraordinary kind, and is now ceased; and though the apostles were before Christ's ascension, yet they had not received till then the fulness of the Spirit, and his extraordinary gifts to fit them for their office; nor did they enter upon the discharge of it in its large extent till that time; for they were not only to bear witness of Christ in Jerusalem, in Judea and Samaria, but in the uttermost parts of the earth: <p>and some prophets; by whom are meant, not private members of churches, who may all prophesy or teach in a private way; nor ordinary ministers of the word; but extraordinary ones, who had a peculiar gift of interpreting the Scriptures, the prophecies of the Old Testament, and of foretelling things to come; such were Agabus and others in the church of Antioch, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-27.htm">Acts 11:27</a><p>and some evangelists; by whom are designed, not so much the writers of the Gospels, as Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, some of which were also apostles; as preachers of the Gospel, and who yet were distinct from the ordinary ministers of it; they were below the apostles, and yet above pastors and teachers; they were the companions of the apostles, and assistants to them, and subserved them in their work; such were Philip, Luke, Titus, Timothy, and others; these were not fixed and stated ministers in anyone place, as the following officers be, but were sent here and there as the apostles thought fit: <p>and some pastors and teachers, or doctors; these may be thought to differ, but not so much on account of the place where they perform their work, the one in the church, the other in the school; nor on account of the different subject of their ministry, the one attending to practical, the other to doctrinal points; but whereas the pastors are the shepherds of the flock, the overseers of it, and the same with the bishops and elders, and the teachers may be the gifted brethren in the church, assistants to the pastors, bare ministers of the word; so the difference lies here, that the one has the oversight, and care, and charge of the church, and the other not; the one can administer all ordinances, the other not; the one is fixed and tied to some certain church, the other not: though I rather think they intend one and the same office, and that the word "teachers" is only explanative of the figurative word "pastors" or shepherds; and the rather because if the apostle had designed distinct officers, he would have used the same form of speaking as before; and have expressed himself thus, "and some pastors, and some teachers"; whereas he does not make such a distribution here as there; though the Syriac version reads this clause distributively as the others; and among the Jews there were the singular men or wise men, and the disciples of the wise men, who were their companions and assistants; and it is asked (y), <p>"who is a singular man? and who is a disciple? a singular man is everyone that is fit to be appointed a pastor or governor of a congregation; and a disciple is one, that when he is questioned about any point in his doctrine, gives an answer:'' <p>wherefore if these two, pastors and teachers, are different, it might be thought there is some reference to this distinction, and that pastors answer to the wise men, and teachers to their disciples or assistants; and so Kimchi in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-15.htm">Jeremiah 3:15</a> interprets the pastors there of , "the pastors of Israel", which shall be with the King Messiah, as is said in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/5-5.htm">Micah 5:5</a> and undoubtedly Gospel ministers are meant: from the whole it may be observed, that as there have been various officers and offices in the Gospel dispensation, various gifts have been bestowed; and these are the gifts of Christ, which he has received for men, and gives unto them; and hence it appears that the work of the ministry is not an human invention, but the appointment of Christ, for which he fits and qualifies, and therefore to be regarded; and that they only are the ministers of Christ, whom he makes ministers of the New Testament, and not whom men or themselves make and appoint. <p>(y) T.

The appointing to the service of the individual congregations (as <span class="greekheb">ποιμένας καὶ διδασκ</span>.) of such persons given by Christ lay in the choice of the congregations themselves, which choice, conducted by apostles or apostolic men, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-23.htm" title="And when they had ordained them elders in every church, and had prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom they believed.">Acts 14:23</a>, took place under the influence of the Holy Spirit, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-28.htm" title="Take heed therefore to yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost has made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he has purchased with his own blood.">Acts 20:28</a>.

Thus the church (or whoever has to represent the rights and duties of the church) has not in any way arbitrarily to choose the subjects, but to discern those endowed by Christ as those thereby given to it by Him, to acknowledge and to induct them into the ministry; hence the highest idea of the ecclesiastical scrutiny is, to test whether the persons in question have been <span class="ital">given by Christ</span>, without prejudice, we may add, to the other existing requirements of ecclesiastical law.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/ephesians/4.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-11.htm" title="And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;">Ephesians 4:11</a>. <span class="greekheb">καὶ αὐτὸς ἔδωκε τοὺς μὲν ἀποστόλους</span>: <span class="ital">and He gave some Apostles</span>. That is, “He gave some <span class="ital">as</span> Apostles,” or (with RV) “some <span class="ital">to be</span> Apostles”. At this point Paul reverts to the statement in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-7.htm" title="But to every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ.">Ephesians 4:7</a>, and having shown that the declaration in Psalms 68. applies to Christ, he proceeds to set forth the purpose (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-12.htm" title="For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ:">Ephesians 4:12</a>) with which the gifts of the exalted Giver are bestowed and His grace given to such. But before he explains that purpose he specifies a series of gifts given with that in view. We have a somewhat similar enumeration in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-28.htm" title="And God has set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.">1 Corinthians 12:28</a>. But while the ruling idea there is that of <span class="ital">appointments</span> (<span class="greekheb">ἔθετο</span>) and the subject is <span class="ital">God</span>, here the particular idea is that of <span class="ital">gifts</span> (<span class="greekheb">ἔδωκε</span>) and the subject is Christ. Further, while the list in Ephesians begins with <span class="ital">Apostles, prophets, evangelists, teachers</span>, and continues in terms of <span class="ital">persons</span>, the statement in 1 Cor. takes note indeed of <span class="ital">Apostles, prophets</span>, and <span class="ital">teachers</span>, but thereafter passes from <span class="ital">persons</span> to <span class="ital">gifts</span> or <span class="ital">ministries</span>—miracles, healings, helps, governments, tongues. This has its significance, as we shall see. The <span class="greekheb">αὐτός</span> is again emphatic, = “he himself,” “he and no other”. The <span class="greekheb">ἔδωκε</span> is not to be taken as = <span class="greekheb">ἔθετο</span>, <span class="ital">appointed</span> or <span class="ital">set</span>. That it has its proper sense of <span class="ital">gave</span> is clear from its relation to the preceding <span class="greekheb">ἔδωκε δόματα</span>. The “giving” refers to the <span class="ital">call</span> of the Church’s Head, the point being the gift of Christ to the Church in the form of certain men chosen by Him and equipped by Him to do service toward the building up of His body and the bringing of all its members to the measure of the stature of His fulness. Further, the exhortation to unity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-3.htm" title="Endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.">Ephesians 4:3</a>) is still in view, Christ having given these “Apostles” and others in order that all His disciples may come to the unity of the faith (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-13.htm" title="Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ:">Ephesians 4:13</a>). All through the statement, too, the primary thing is the <span class="ital">persons</span>, not the offices. Nothing is said of any special order or orders in the Church possessing exceptional prerogatives, or any office or rank to which peculiar or exclusive powers of grace were attached. The <span class="ital">men</span> are Christ’s gifts to the Church and to every member of it; and they are given to do a certain work looking to a great end, <span class="ital">viz.</span>, to furnish His people and every individual believer among them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-7.htm" title="But to every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ.">Ephesians 4:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-16.htm" title="From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplies, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, makes increase of the body to the edifying of itself in love.">Ephesians 4:16</a>) for their particular service and their particular contribution to the building up of Christ’s body.

With NT prophets we have also NT prophetesses. Agabus, those of Antioch Judas and Silas, the four daughters o Philip, are mentioned as having the gift of prophecy. As in the case of Agabus this gift of prophecy included the prediction of events (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-28.htm" title="And there stood up one of them named Agabus, and signified by the Spirit that there should be great dearth throughout all the world: which came to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar.">Acts 11:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-10.htm" title="And as we tarried there many days, there came down from Judaea a certain prophet, named Agabus.">Acts 21:10</a>), but its chief function was edification. The prophets were preachers or exhorters, to whom revelations of spiritual truth were imparted, and who spoke in the Spirit (<span class="greekheb">ἐν πνεύματι</span>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-5.htm" title="Which in other ages was not made known to the sons of men, as it is now revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit;">Ephesians 3:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-10.htm" title="I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet,">Revelation 1:10</a>), but not in ecstacy or as one in a trance (<span class="greekheb">ἐν ἐκστάσει</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-10.htm" title="And he became very hungry, and would have eaten: but while they made ready, he fell into a trance,">Acts 10:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-17.htm" title="And it came to pass, that, when I was come again to Jerusalem, even while I prayed in the temple, I was in a trance;">Acts 22:17</a>). Further, he was usually, if not always, itinerant. This order of prophets continued to have a place in the Church for a considerable period. Large mention is made of it in the <span class="ital">Didaché</span>, and in Eusebius, <span class="ital">Hist. Eccles.</span>, v., 17, reference is made to Quadratus and Ammia in Philadelphia. This may take the order on to Hadrian’s time; <span class="ital">cf.</span> Selwyn, <span class="ital">The Christian Prophets</span>, and Gwatkin’s article in Hastings’ <span class="ital">Dictionary of the Bible</span>, iv., p. 127.

In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-28.htm" title="And God has set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.">1 Corinthians 12:28</a> the <span class="ital">evangelist</span> is not mentioned. Here he is distinguished from the <span class="ital">Apostle</span> and the <span class="ital">prophet</span> and named as the third in the order of Christ’s gifts to the Church. The <span class="greekheb">εὐαγγελιστής</span> is mentioned only twice again in the NT, <span class="ital">viz.</span>, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-8.htm" title="And the next day we that were of Paul's company departed, and came to Caesarea: and we entered into the house of Philip the evangelist, which was one of the seven; and stayed with him.">Acts 21:8</a>, where Philip, one of the seven deacons is so designated; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-5.htm" title="But watch you in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of your ministry.">2 Timothy 4:5</a>, where Timothy is charged to “do the work of an evangelist”. Like the <span class="ital">prophets</span> the <span class="ital">evangelists</span> were generally itinerant preachers or missionaries, though sometimes they had a stated place of abode or ministry. The term seems, therefore, to belong to the Pauline vocabulary. These <span class="ital">evangelists</span> were inferior to the Apostles, assisting them or delegated by them, but without their authority. They had the gift (<span class="greekheb">χάρισμα</span>) of the Spirit, as in the case of Timothy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-14.htm" title="Neglect not the gift that is in you, which was given you by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.">1 Timothy 4:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-6.htm" title="Why I put you in remembrance that you stir up the gift of God, which is in you by the putting on of my hands.">2 Timothy 1:6</a>); but, if we may judge by Philip’s case (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/8-5.htm" title="Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ to them....">Acts 8:5-18</a>), they could not impart the Holy Ghost. Nor do they seem to have had the special revelations which were given to the prophets.—<span class="greekheb">τοὺς δὲ ποιμένας καὶ διδασκάλους</span>: <span class="ital">and some as pastors and teachers</span>. The <span class="greekheb">ποιμένες</span> and <span class="greekheb">διδάσκαλοι</span> are distinguished from the former orders as being connected with particular churches, resident and not missionary or itinerant. The absence of the <span class="greekheb">τοὺς δέ</span> before <span class="greekheb">διδασκάλους</span> indicates also that the <span class="greekheb">ποιμένες</span> and the <span class="greekheb">διδάσκαλοι</span> were not two distinct orders, but designations of the same men (<span class="ital">cf.</span> the <span class="greekheb">πρεσβύτεροι</span> or <span class="greekheb">ἐπίσκοποι</span>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-28.htm" title="Take heed therefore to yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost has made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he has purchased with his own blood.">Acts 20:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-25.htm" title="For you were as sheep going astray; but are now returned to the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.">1 Peter 2:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-2.htm" title="Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind;">1 Peter 5:2</a>), in different functions, the former defining them according to their office of oversight, the latter according to their office of instruction and guidance. The <span class="greekheb">ποιμήν</span> would naturally also be a <span class="greekheb">διδάσκαλος</span>; but there is not the same reason for supposing that every <span class="greekheb">διδάσκαλος</span> would also be a <span class="greekheb">ποιμήν</span>. Nothing is said here of <span class="greekheb">πρεσβύτεροι</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἐπίσκοποι</span>, <span class="greekheb">διάκονοι</span>. The absence of such official terms points perhaps to the comparatively early date of the Epistle.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/ephesians/4.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">11</span>. <span class="ital">And he gave</span>] The “<span class="ital">He</span>” is emphatic; <span class="bld">it was He who gave</span>.

It seems, like our word “missionary,” to indicate not a defined ecclesiastical order (for Timothy “does the work of an evangelist,” while also an authoritative superintendent of pastors and churches), but rather a special kind of personal function in the ministry; the work of one called and devoted to direct proclamation of the Gospel message. It was thus an elastic word, like “missionary,” sometimes and oftenest denoting a minister’s special function, sometimes one only of his functions. “This passage,” our present passage, “would lead us to think of the evangelists as standing between the two groups,” (apostles and prophets, pastors and teachers,) “sent forth, as missionary preachers of the Gospel, by the first, and as such preparing the way for the labours of the second” (Smith’s <span class="ital">Dict. of the Bible</span>, under the word <span class="ital">Evangelist</span>). “The omission of evangelists in the list of 1 Corinthians 12 may be explained on the hypothesis that the nature of St Paul’s argument there led him to speak of the settled organization of a given local Church” (<span class="ital">Ibidem</span>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">pastors and teachers</span>] Not, “some pastors and some teachers.” The two functions are regarded as coinciding and combining in the one settled guardian of a local flock; an instructive fact.—Such a “pastor-teacher” had St Paul himself been at Ephesus (Acts 20), where indeed he had also been so conspicuously the “evangelist.”—On the pastoral aspect of the Christian ministry cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/21-16.htm" title="He said to him again the second time, Simon, son of Jonas, love you me?

All the apostles had also at the same time the prophetic power. Only that the very high degree of prophecy, by which the <span class="ital">Apocalypse</span> was written, was peculiar to John. But prophets and evangelists were not also at the same time apostles. The prophet takes precedence of the evangelist; for the prophet testifies infallibly of the future, the evangelist infallibly of the past: the prophet derives all from the Spirit; the evangelist puts on record a matter which has been perceived by the senses of sight and hearing, and yet he is fitted for an office of the highest importance, by a gift superior to that of pastors and teachers. <span class="ital">Workers of miracles</span> are not added here; for their actions have now somewhat less reference to the <span class="ital">perfecting</span>, etc. And perhaps already, before the last days of the apostles, the gift of miracles was more rarely exercised; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-4.htm" title="God also bearing them witness, both with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will?">Hebrews 2:4</a>.—<span class="greekheb">ποιμένας καὶ διδασκάλους</span>, <span class="ital">pastors and teachers</span>) The appellation of <span class="ital">shepherd</span> (pastor) is everywhere else given to the Lord alone.

The organization of the Church is not a mere human arrangement; its officers are of Divine appointment. The first gift is, his apostles. It is not meant that he gave to some the gifts needed to constitute them apostles, though that is true; but that, having qualified some to be apostles, he gave them to the Church. An apostle had his commission direct from Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-5.htm">Matthew 10:5</a>); he possessed supernatural gifts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-8.htm">Matthew 10:8</a>); it was necessary for him to have seen the Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-22.htm">Acts 1:22</a>); his diocese was the whole world (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/16-15.htm">Mark 16:15</a>). The apostles were the constituent body of the Church - they had all necessary gifts for setting it up, and as all Christian history has testified, they were a marvelous gift of Christ to his Church. <span class="cmt_word">And some, prophets.</span> Next to the apostles in point of value, as gifts to the Church, having supernatural knowledge of God's will present and future (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-11.htm">Acts 21:11</a>). Prophets were indispensable before the New Testament was given as the Church's infallible guide to the will of God, but not apparently necessary after the will of God was fully recorded. <span class="cmt_word">And some, evangelists.</span> The nature of this office is known only from the meaning of the term and the work of those who bore the designation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-8.htm">Acts 21:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-5.htm">2 Timothy 4:5</a>) - persons not attached to a particular congregation, but who went about preaching the glad tidings, and otherwise building up the Church, but without the full powers of apostles. <span class="cmt_word">And some, pastors and teachers.</span> The more ordinary settled ministers of congregations, called pastors, because they watched over the flock, trying to lead all in right ways; and teachers, because they communicated Divine knowledge. Some have thought that each expression denotes a separate office, but, coupled as they are together, it is better to regard them as indicating two functions of one office (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-17.htm">1 Timothy 5:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-1.htm">Acts 13:1</a>). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/ephesians/4.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>The gifts specified.<p>He gave<p>He is emphatic.

The omission of the article from teachers seems to indicate that pastors and teachers are included under one class. The two belong together. No man is fit to be a pastor who cannot also teach, and the teacher needs the knowledge which pastoral experience gives. </body></html>
