Such faith always goes on to knowledge, that is (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-17.htm" title="That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him:">Ephesians 1:17</a>) “full knowledge” of Him in whom we have believed. So in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-17.htm" title="For he received from God the Father honor and glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.">2Peter 1:17</a>, “Add to your faith virtue” (that is, energy in well-doing), “and to virtue knowledge.” This knowledge (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/3-17.htm" title="That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that you, being rooted and grounded in love,">Ephesians 3:17-19</a>) is gained mainly through the love in which faith is made perfect.<p><span class= "bld">Of the Son of God.</span>—These words should be connected with the word “faith” (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-20.htm" title="I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ lives in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.">Galatians 2:20</a>) as well as “knowledge.” They are probably to be considered as a distinctive phrase, designating our Lord especially as glorified and exalted to the right hand of the Father in “the glory which he had with the Father before the world was.” So in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-4.htm" title="And declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead:">Romans 1:4</a>, He is “declared to be the Son of God by the Resurrection;” and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-14.htm" title="Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession.">Hebrews 4:14</a>, “Jesus the Son of God” is “the High Priest ascended into the heavens.” Compare also our Lord’s declaration that “if any man speaks against the Son of Man it shall be forgiven him” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-32.htm" title="And whoever speaks a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but whoever speaks against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come.">Matthew 12:32</a>) with the declaration of the certain vengeance on him who “treads under foot the Son of God” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-29.htm" title="Of how much sorer punishment, suppose you, shall he be thought worthy, who has trodden under foot the Son of God, and has counted the blood of the covenant, with which he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and has done despite to the Spirit of grace?">Hebrews 10:29</a>). Note again, in St. John’s First Epistle, the constant reference to the belief in and confession of Jesus as “the Son of God” as the one thing needful (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-15.htm" title="But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ:">Ephesians 4:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-5.htm" title="For this you know, that no fornicator, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.">Ephesians 5:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/5-10.htm" title="Proving what is acceptable to the Lord.">Ephesians 5:10-12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-20.htm" title="Giving thanks always for all things to God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ;">Ephesians 5:20</a>). For on the belief not only of what He was on earth, but of what He is in heaven, all distinctive Christianity depends. If He is only “Son of Man” He cannot be the universal Saviour.<p><span class= "bld">Unto a perfect</span> (that is, <span class= "ital">full-grown</span>) <span class= "bld">man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ.</span>—In these words are described the second great object of the ministries of the Church—not only the production of faith and knowledge of the Son of God, but the formation of Christ in the soul, as “dwelling in the heart through faith.” This image of Christ in “fullness” is the absolutely perfect humanity, showing forth the image of God. Each can partake of it only up to “the measure” which God gives him. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-7.htm" title="But to every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ.">Ephesians 4:7</a>.) When he so partakes of it to the utmost, he is “full-grown” (relatively, not absolutely, perfect) up to the spiritual “stature” assigned to him, although (as in the body) that stature may vary in different persons, and in none can perfectly attain to the whole “fulness” of Christ. The rendering, “stature” is preferable to <span class= "ital">age, </span>as suiting better the context, though both are fully admissible under New Testament usage. On the word “fulness,” see Note to <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-23.htm" title="Which is his body, the fullness of him that fills all in all.">Ephesians 1:23</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/maclaren/ephesians/4.htm">MacLaren's Expositions</a></div>EPHESIANS<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">THE GOAL OF PROGRESS</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-13.htm" title="Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ:">Ephesians 4:13</a>The thought of the unity of the Church is much in the Apostle’s mind in this epistle. It is set forth in many places by his two favourite metaphors of the body and the temple, by the relation of husband and wife and by the family. It is contemplated in its great historical realisation by the union of Jew and Gentile in one whole. In the preceding context it is set forth as already existing, but also as lying far-off in the future. The chapter begins with an earnest exhortation to preserve this unity and with an exhibition of the oneness which does really exist in body, spirit, hope, lord, faith, baptism. But the Apostle swiftly passes to the corresponding thought of diversity. There are varieties in the gifts of the one Spirit; whilst each individual in the one whole receives his due portion, there are broad differences in spiritual gifts. These differences do not break the oneness, but they may tend to do so; they are not causes of separation and do not necessarily interfere with unity, but they may be made so. Their existence leaves room for brotherly helpfulness, and creates a necessity for it. The wiser are to teach; the more advanced are to lead; the more largely gifted are to encourage and stimulate the less richly endowed. Such outward helps and brotherly impartations of gifts is, on the one hand, a result of the one gift to the whole body, and is on the other a sign of, because a necessity arising from, the imperfect degree in which each individual has received of Christ’s fulness; and these helps of teaching and guidance have for their sole object to make Christian men able to do without them, and are, as the text tells us, to cease when, and to last till, we all attain to the fulness of Christ. To Paul, then, the manifest unity of the Church was to be the end of its earthly course, but it also was real, though incomplete, in the present, and the emphasis of our text is not so much laid on telling us when this oneness was to be manifested as in showing us in what it consists. We have here a threefold expression of the true unity, as consisting in a oneness of relation to Christ, a consequent maturity of manhood and a perfect possession of all which is in Christ.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. The true unity is oneness of relation to Christ.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Revised Version is here to be preferred, and its ‘attain unto’ brings out the idea which the Authorised Version fails to express, that the text is intended to point to the period at which Christ’s provision of helpful gifts to the growing Church is to cease, when the individuals composing it have come to their destined unity and maturity in Him. The three clauses of our text are each introduced by the same preposition, and there is no reason why in the second and third it should be rendered ‘unto’ and in the first should be watered down to ‘in.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>There are then two regions in which this unity is to be realised. These are expressed by the great words, ‘the unity of the faith and knowledge of the Son of God.’ These words are open to a misunderstanding, as if they referred to a unity as between faith and knowledge; but it is obvious to the slightest reflection that what is meant is the unity of all believers in regard to their faith, and in regard to their knowledge. It is to be noted that the Apostle has just said that there is one faith, now he points to the realisation of that oneness as the very end and goal of all discipline and growth. I suppose that we have to think here of the manifold and sad differences existing in Christian men, in regard to the depth and constancy and formative power of their faith. There are some who have it so strong and vigorous that it is a vision rather than a faith, a trust, deep and firm and settled, to which the present is but the fleeting shadow, and the unseen the eternal and only reality; but, alas! there are others in whom the light of faith burns feebly and flickers. Nor are these differences the attributes of different men, but the same man varies in the power of his faith, and we all of us know what it is to have it sometimes dominant over our whole selves, and sometimes weak and crushed under the weight of earthly passions. To-day we may be all flame, to-morrow all ice. Our faith may seem to us to be strong enough to move mountains, and before an hour is past we may find it, by experience, to be less than a grain of mustard seed. ‘Action and reaction are always equal and contrary,’ and that law is as true in reference to our present spiritual life as it is true in regard to physical objects. We have, then, the encouragement of such a word as that of our text for looking forward to and straining towards the reversal of these sad alterations in a fixed and continuous faith which should grasp the whole Christ and should always hold Him. There may still be diversities and degrees, but each should have his measure always full. ‘Thy Sun shall no more go down’; there will no longer be the contrast between the flashing waters of a flood-tide and the dreary mud-banks disclosed at low water. We shall stand at different points, but the faces of all will be turned to Him who is the Light of all, and every face will shine with the likeness of His, when we see Him as He is.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But our text points us to another form of unity-the oneness of the knowledge of the Son of God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Apostle uses an emphatic term which is very familiar on his lips to designate this knowledge. It means not a mere intellectual apprehension, but a profound and vital acquaintance, dependent indeed upon faith, and realised in experience. It is the knowledge for which Paul was ready to ‘count all things but loss’ that he might know Jesus, and winning which he would count himself to ‘have apprehended.’ The unity in this deep and blessed knowledge has nothing to do with identity of opinion on the points which have separated Christians. It is not to be sought by outward unanimity, nor by aggregation in external communities. The Apostle’s great thought is made small and the truth of it is falsified when it is over-hastily embodied in institutions. It has been sought in a uniformity which resembles unity as much as a bundle of faggots, all cut to the same length, and tied together with a rope, resemble the tree from which they were chopped, waving in the wind and living one life to the tips of its furthest branches. Men have made out of the Apostle’s divine vision of a unity in the faith and knowledge of the Son of God ‘a staunch and solid piece of framework as any January could freeze together,’ and few things have stood more in the way of the realisation of his glowing anticipations than the formation of the great Corporation, imposing from its bulk and antiquity, to part from which was branded as breaking the unity of the spirit.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Paul gives no clear definition here of the time when the one body of Christian believers should have attained to the unity of the faith and knowledge of the Son of God, and the question may not have presented itself to him. It may appear that in view of the immediate context he regards the goal as one to be reached in our present life, or it may be that he is thinking rather of the Future, when the Master ‘should bring together every joint and member and mould them into an immortal feature of loveliness and perfection.’ But the time at which this great ideal should be attained is altogether apart from the obligation pressing upon us all, at all times, to work towards it. Whensoever it is reached it will only be by our drawing ‘nearer, day by day, each to his brethren, all to God,’ or rather, each to God and so all to his brethren. Take twenty points in a great circle and let each be advanced by one half of its distance to the centre, how much nearer will each be to each? Christ is our unity, not dogmas, not polities, not rituals: our oneness is a oneness of life. We need for our centre no tower with a top reaching to heaven, we have a living Lord who is with us, and in Him, we being many, are one.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. Oneness in faith and knowledge knits all into a ‘perfect man.’</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>‘Perfect,’ the Apostle here uses in opposition to the immediately following expression in the next verse, of ‘children.’ It therefore means not so much moral perfection as maturity or fulness of growth. So long as we fall short of the state of unity we are in the stage of immaturity. When we come to be one in faith and knowledge we have reached full-grown manhood. The existence of differences belongs to the infancy and boyhood of the Church, and as we grow one we are putting away childish things. What a contrast there is between Paul’s vision here and the tendency which has been too common among Christians to magnify their differences, and to regard their obstinate adherence to these as being ‘steadfastness in the faith’! How different would be the relations between the various communities into which the one body has been severed, if they all fully believed that their respective shibboleths were signs that they had not yet attained, neither were already perfect! When we began to be ashamed of these instead of glorying in them we should be beginning to grow into the maturity of our Christian life.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But the Apostle speaks of ‘a perfect man’ in the singular and not of ‘men’ in the plural, as he has already described the result of the union of Jew and Gentile as being the making ‘of twain one new man.’ This remarkable expression sets forth, in the strongest terms, the vital unity which connects all members of the one body so closely that there is but one life in them all. There are many members, but one body. Their functions differ, but the life in them all is identical. The eye cannot say to the hand, ‘I have no need of thee,’ nor again the head to the feet, ‘I have no need of you.’ Each is necessary to the completeness of the whole, and all are necessary to make up the one body of Christ. It is His life which manifests itself in every member and which gives clearness of vision to the eye, strength and deftness to the hand. He needs us all for His work on the world and for His revelation to the world of the fulness of His life. In some parts of England there are bell-ringers who stand at a table on which are set bells, each tuned to one note, and they can perform most elaborate pieces of music by swiftly catching up and sounding each of these in the right place. All Christian souls are needed for the Master’s hand to bring out the note of each in its place. In the lowest forms of life all vital functions are performed by one simple sac, and the higher the creature is in the scale the more are its organs differentiated. In the highest form of all, ‘as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of the body, being many, are one body, so also is Christ.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">III. This perfect manhood is the possession of all who are in Christ.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The fulness of Christ is the fulness which belongs to Him, or that of which He is full. All which He is and has is to be poured into His servants, and when all this is communicated to them the goal will be reached. We shall be full-grown men, and more wonderful still, we all shall make one perfect man, and individual completenesses will blend into that which is more complete than any of these, the one body, which corresponds to the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This is the goal of humanity in which, and in which alone, the dreams of thinkers about perfectibility will become facts, and the longings that are deeply rooted in every soul will find their fulfilment. By our personal union with Jesus Christ through faith, our individual perfection, both in the sense of maturity and in that of the realisation of ideal manhood, is assured, and in Him the race, as well as the individual, is redeemed, and will one day be glorified. The Utopias of many thinkers are but partial and distorted copies of the kingdom of Christ. The reality which He brings and imparts is greater than all these, and when the New Jerusalem comes down out of heaven, and is planted on the common earth, it will outvie in lustre and outlast in permanence all forms of human association. The city of wisdom which was Athens, the city of power which was Rome, the city of commerce which is London, the city of pleasure which is Paris, ‘pale their ineffectual fires’ before the city in the light whereof the nations should walk.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The beginning of the process, of which the end is this inconceivable participation in the glory of Jesus, is simple trust in Him. ‘He that is joined to the Lord is one spirit,’ and he who trusts in Him, loves Him, and obeys Him, is joined to Him, and thereby is started on a course which never halts nor stays so long as the faith which started him abides, till he ‘grows up into Him in all things which is the head, even Christ.’ The experience of the Christian life as God means it to be, and by the communication of His grace makes it possible for it to become, is like that of men embarked on some sun-lit ocean, sailing past shining headlands, and ever onwards, over the boundless blue, beneath a calm sky and happy stars. The blissful voyagers are in full possession at every moment of all which they need and of all of His fulness which they can contain, but the full possession at every moment increases as they, by it, become capable of fuller possession. Increasing capacity brings with it increasing participation in the boundless fulness of Him who filleth all in all.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:7-16 Unto every believer is given some gift of grace, for their mutual help. All is given as seems best to Christ to bestow upon every one. He received for them, that he might give to them, a large measure of gifts and graces; particularly the gift of the Holy Ghost. Not a mere head knowledge, or bare acknowledging Christ to be the Son of God, but such as brings trust and obedience. There is a fulness in Christ, and a measure of that fulness given in the counsel of God to every believer; but we never come to the perfect measure till we come to heaven. God's children are growing, as long as they are in this world; and the Christian's growth tends to the glory of Christ. The more a man finds himself drawn out to improve in his station, and according to his measure, all that he has received, to the spiritual good of others, he may the more certainly believe that he has the grace of sincere love and charity rooted in his heart.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ephesians/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Till we all come - Until all Christians arrive at a state of complete unity, and to entire perfection.<p>In the unity of the faith - Margin, into.

This figure is obvious. The apostle compares their condition then to a state of childhood. The perfect man here refers to the man "grown up," the man of mature life. He says that Christ had appointed pastors and teachers that the infant church might be conducted to "maturity;" or become strong - like a man. He does not refer to the doctrine of "sinless perfection" - but to the state of manhood as compared with that of childhood - a state of strength, vigor, wisdom, when the full growth should be attained; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-20.htm">1 Corinthians 14:20</a>.<p>Unto the measure of the stature - Margin, or age. The word "stature" expresses the idea. It refers to the growth of a man. The stature to be attained to was that of Christ. He was the standard - not in size, not in age - but in moral character. The measure to be reached was Christ; or we are to grow until we become like him.<p>Of the fulness of Christ - see the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-23.htm">Ephesians 1:23</a>. The phrase "the measure of the fulness," means, probably, the "full measure" - by a form of construction that is common in the Hebrew writings, where two nouns are so used that one is to be rendered as an adjective - "as trees of greatness" - meaning great trees. Here it means, that they should so advance in piety and knowledge as to become wholly like him. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ephesians/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13. come in&#8212;rather, "attain unto."

The <span class="greekheb">ἡλικία</span> in question, namely, is conceived of as the section of a dimension in space, beginning at a definite place, so that the <span class="greekheb">ἡλικία</span> is attained only after one has traversed the measured extent, whose terminal point is the entrance into the <span class="greekheb">ἡλικία</span>. Comp. Hom. Il. xi. 225: <span class="greekheb">ἐπὶ ῥʼ ἥβης ἐρικυδέος ἵκετο μέτρον</span>, <span class="ital">Od.</span> xi. 317: <span class="greekheb">εἰ ἥβης μέτρον ἵκοιτο</span>, 18:21. <span class="greekheb">ἡλικία</span>, however, is not <span class="ital">statura</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-3.htm" title="And he sought to see Jesus who he was; and could not for the press, because he was little of stature.">Luke 19:3</a>), as is supposed by Erasmus, Beza, Homberg, Grotius, Calixtus, Erasmus Schmid, Wolf, Bengel, Zachariae, Rückert, and others, which would be suitable only if the <span class="greekheb">ἀνὴρ τέλειος</span> always had a definite measure of <span class="ital">bodily size</span>; but it is equivalent to <span class="ital">aetas</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-27.htm" title="Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit to his stature?">Matthew 6:27</a>), and that not, as it might in itself imply (Dem. 17. 11; 1352. 11; Xen. <span class="ital">Mem.</span> iv. 2. 3), specially <span class="ital">aetas virilis</span> (so Morus, Koppe, Storr, Flatt, Matthies, Holzhausen, Harless, and others), since, on the contrary, the more precise definition of the <span class="ital">aetas</span> in itself indefinite is only given by <span class="greekheb">τοῦ πληρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Χρ</span>., which belongs to it (Winer, p. 172 [E. T. 238]); so that <span class="greekheb">ἡλικία τοῦ πληρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Χρ</span>. <span class="ital">taken together characterizes</span> the adult age of the Christians.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τοῦ πληρώματος τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Χρ</span>.] defines the age which is meant, as that to which the fulness of Christ is peculiar, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> <span class="ital">in which one receives the fulness of Christ</span>. Before the attainment thereof, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> before one has attained to this degree of Christian perfection, one has received, indeed, individual and partial charismatic endowment from Christ, but not yet the <span class="ital">fulness</span>, the whole <span class="ital">largas capias</span> of gifts of grace, which Christ communicates. <span class="greekheb">πλήρωμα</span> is here, just as at <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-19.htm" title="And to know the love of Christ, which passes knowledge, that you might be filled with all the fullness of God.">Ephesians 3:19</a>, not the <span class="ital">church of Christ</span> (Storr, Koppe, Stolz, Flatt, Baumgarten-Crusius), which in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-23.htm" title="Which is his body, the fullness of him that fills all in all.">Ephesians 1:23</a> is doubtless so characterized, but not so named. This also in opposition to Baur, p. 438, according to whom <span class="greekheb">τὸ πλήρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Χρ</span>. means: “Christ’s being filled, or the contents with which Christ fills Himself, thus the church.” All explanations, moreover, which resolve <span class="greekheb">πλήρωμα</span> into an adjectival notion (<span class="greekheb">πληρωθείς</span>) are arbitrary changes of the meaning of the word and of its expressive representation, whether this adjectival notion be connected with <span class="greekheb">ἡλικίας</span>[221] or with <span class="greekheb">τοῦ Χριστοῦ</span>.[222] Grotius, doubtless, leaves <span class="greekheb">πλήρ</span>. as a substantive; but, at variance with linguistic usage, makes of it the <span class="ital">being full</span>, and of <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Χρ</span> (so already Oecumenius), the <span class="ital">knowledge of Christ</span> (“ad eum staturae modum, qui est plenus Christi, i. e. cognitionis de Christo”). Rückert takes <span class="greekheb">πλήρωμα</span> as <span class="ital">perfection</span>, and <span class="greekheb">τοῦ Χριστοῦ</span> as genitive of the <span class="ital">possessor</span>. The meaning of the word he takes to be: “We are to become just as perfect a man as Christ is.” Christ stands before us as the ideal of manly greatness and beauty, the church not yet grown to maturity, but destined to be like Him, as perfect as He is,—which is a figure of <span class="ital">spiritual</span> perfection and completion. But <span class="greekheb">πλήρωμα</span> nowhere signifies <span class="ital">perfection</span> (<span class="greekheb">τελειότης</span>), and nowhere is Christ set forth, even in a merely figurative way, as an ideal of manly greatness and beauty. He stands there as <span class="ital">Head</span> of His body (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-12.htm" title="For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ:">Ephesians 4:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/4-15.htm" title="But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ:...">Ephesians 4:15-16</a>). As little, finally, as at <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-19.htm" title="And to know the love of Christ, which passes knowledge, that you might be filled with all the fullness of God.">Ephesians 3:19</a>, does <span class="greekheb">πλήρωμα τοῦ Χρ</span>. here signify <span class="ital">the full gracious presence of Christ</span> (Harless; comp. Holzhausen). So also Matthies: “the fulness of the Divinity manifest in Christ and through Him also embodied in the church.” Where the <span class="greekheb">πλήρωμα τοῦ Χρ</span>. is communicated, there the full gracious presence of Christ <span class="ital">is</span> in man’s heart (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-10.htm" title="And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness.">Romans 8:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-20.htm" title="Now a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one.">Galatians 3:20</a>), but <span class="greekheb">τὸ πλήρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τοῦ Χρ</span>. does not <span class="ital">mean</span> this.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[219] The <span class="ital">sum</span> of the confession, in which all are to become one in faith and knowledge,—not merely, as Bleek turns it, are to <span class="ital">feel</span> themselves <span class="ital">one</span> in the communion of faith and of the knowledge of Christ.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[220] The most involved way, in which the whole following passage can be taken, is to be found in Hofmann, <span class="ital">Schriftbew</span>. II. 2, p. 129 ff. He begins, in spite of the absence of a particle (<span class="greekheb">οὖν</span> or <span class="greekheb">δέ</span>), with <span class="greekheb">εἰς ἄνδρα τέλειον</span> a new sentence, of which the verb is <span class="greekheb">αὐξήσωμεν</span>, ver. 15; the latter is a self-encouragement to growth; but <span class="greekheb">ἵνα μηκέτι κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. is dependent on <span class="greekheb">αὐξήσωμεν</span>. In this way, in place of the simple evolution of the discourse, such as is so specially characteristic of this Epistle, there is forced upon it an artificially-involved period, and there is introduced an exhortation as yet entirely foreign to the connection (only with ver. 17 does Paul return to the hortatory address).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[221] So Luther: “of the perfect age of Christ.” Comp. Castalio, Calvin (“plena aetas”), Estius, Michaelis, and others; in which case <span class="greekheb">τοῦ Χριστοῦ</span> has by some been taken <span class="ital">sensu mystico</span> of the church, by others (see Morus and Rosenmüller) <span class="ital">ad quam Chr. nos ducit</span>, or the like, has been inserted.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[222] So most expositors, who take <span class="greekheb">ἡλικία</span> as <span class="ital">stature</span>. It is explained: <span class="ital">stature of the full-grown Christ</span>, as to which Beza says, “Dicitur … Christus non in sese, sed <span class="ital">in nobis</span> adolescere;” Wolf, on the other hand: “Christus … in exemplum proponitur corpori suo mystico, … ut, quemadmodum ipse qua homo se ostendit sapientia crescentem, prout annis et statura auctus fuit, ita fideles quoque sensim incrementa capiant in fide et cognitione, tandemque junctim perfectum virum Christo … similem sistunt.” Comp. Erasmus, <span class="ital">Paraphr</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>REMARK 1.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The question whether the goal to be attained, indicated by Paul in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-13.htm" title="Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ:">Ephesians 4:13</a>, is thought of by him as occurring in the <span class="ital">temporal</span> life, or only in the <span class="greekheb">αἰὼν μέλλων</span>, is answered in the <span class="ital">former</span> sense by Chrysostom, Theophylact, Oecumenius, Jerome, Ambrosiaster, Thomas, Luther, Cameron, Estius, Calovius, Michaelis, Morcs, and others, including Flatt (who thinks of the last times of the church on earth), Rückert, Meier, de Wette, Schenkel; in the <span class="ital">latter</span> sense,[223] by Theodoret (<span class="greekheb">τῆς δὲ τελειότητος ἐν τῷ μέλλοντι βίῳ τευξόμεθα</span>), Calvin, Zanchius, Koppe, and others, including Holzhausen; while Harless judges that Paul sets forth the goal as the goal of the life of Christian fellowship here upon earth, but says nothing on the question as to “whether it is to be attained here or in the life to come; as also Olshausen is of opinion that Paul had not even thought of the contrast between <span class="ital">here below</span> and <span class="ital">there</span>. But <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/4-14.htm" title="That we from now on be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive;...">Ephesians 4:14-15</a> show most distinctly that Paul thought of the goal in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-13.htm" title="Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ:">Ephesians 4:13</a> as setting in even <span class="ital">before the Parousia;</span> and to this points also the comparison of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-19.htm" title="And to know the love of Christ, which passes knowledge, that you might be filled with all the fullness of God.">Ephesians 3:19</a>, where, in substance, the same thing as is said at our passage by <span class="greekheb">εἰς μέτρον ἡλικίας κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., is expressed by <span class="greekheb">ἵνα πληρωθῆτε εἰς πᾶν τὸ πλήρωμα τοῦ Θεοῦ</span>.

The AV wrongly makes it “come in”; Tynd., “grow up unto”; Cran., better, “come to”. But best, “arrive at,” or (with RV) “attain unto”.

It is when the members of the Church have all come to their proper unity and maturity in their Head. The tendency of late Greek to use the subj. without <span class="greekheb">ἄν</span>, especially after temporal particles, renders it doubtful whether much may be made of the unconditioned <span class="greekheb">μέχρι</span> here. The absence of <span class="greekheb">ἄν</span>, however, and the use of the <span class="ital">subj.</span>, seem to point to the event as <span class="ital">expected</span>, and not as a mere hypothetical possibility; <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/13-30.htm" title="Truly I say to you, that this generation shall not pass, till all these things be done.">Mark 13:30</a>; and see Hartung, <span class="ital">Partikl.</span>, ii., p. 291; Hermann, <span class="ital">Part.</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἄν</span>, p. 66; Win.-Moult., pp. 378, 387. <span class="greekheb">καταντάω</span>, followed in NT by <span class="greekheb">εἰς</span>, elsewhere also by <span class="greekheb">ἐπί</span>, conveys the idea of arriving at a goal (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-7.htm" title="To which promise our twelve tribes, instantly serving God day and night, hope to come. For which hope's sake, king Agrippa, I am accused of the Jews.">Acts 26:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-11.htm" title="If by any means I might attain to the resurrection of the dead.">Php 3:11</a>), the aor. subj. also having the force of “shall have attained”. <span class="greekheb">οἱ πάντες</span> evidently refers not to men generally, but to <span class="ital">Christians</span> and to these in their totality. The article goes appropriately with the <span class="greekheb">ἑνότητα</span>, the unity in view being the <span class="ital">definite</span> unity denoted by the words that follow.—<span class="greekheb">τῆς πίστεως καὶ τῆς ἐπιγνώσεως τοῦ υἱοῦ τοῦ Θεοῦ</span>: <span class="ital">of the faith and the knowledge of the Son of God</span>. <span class="greekheb">τοῦ υἱοῦ</span> is the <span class="ital">gen. obj.</span>, and it is best taken as dependent on both nouns. Some (<span class="ital">e.g.</span>, Haupt), however, are of opinion that the repetition of the article before <span class="greekheb">ἐπιγνώσεως</span> implies that the <span class="greekheb">τοῦ υἱοῦ τοῦ Θεοῦ</span> is dependent only on the latter. The <span class="greekheb">καί</span> shows that the <span class="greekheb">ἐπιγνώσεως</span> is not an epexegesis of the <span class="greekheb">πίστεως</span>; and the <span class="greekheb">πίστις</span> (here in its usual Pauline sense of trusting, saving faith) and the <span class="greekheb">ἐπίγνωσις</span> express distinct, though related, ideas (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/philippians/3-9.htm" title="And be found in him, not having my own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith:...">Php 3:9-10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-16.htm" title="And we have known and believed the love that God has to us. God is love; and he that dwells in love dwells in God, and God in him.">1 John 4:16</a>). The <span class="ital">unity</span> in view, therefore, is oneness in faith in Christ and oneness also in the full experimental knowledge of Him. The point of the clause is not any unity between faith and knowledge themselves, to the effect, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, of rising from the former to the latter as a higher Christian endowment (Olsh.), but a unity which shall make all the members of Christ’s body at one in believing in Him and knowing Him. The title <span class="greekheb">υἱὸς τοῦ Θεοῦ</span> as applied to Christ occurs frequently in the Pauline as well as in the Johannine writings, but never in 2 Thess., Phil., Philem., or the Pastoral Epistles. In passages like the present, if they stood by themselves, it might be difficult to say whether the metaphysical, the theocratic, or the ethical idea is in view. But the analogy of such statements as those in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-4.htm" title="And declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead:">Romans 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-3.htm" title="For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:">Romans 8:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-32.htm" title="He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?">Romans 8:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-4.htm" title="But when the fullness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law,">Galatians 4:4</a>, and the general Pauline conception of Christ as a transcendent Personality, different from men as such, and to be named together with God, point to a relation to God in respect of nature as the force of the designation here.—<span class="greekheb">εἰς ἄνδρα τέλειον</span>: <span class="ital">unto a perfect man</span>. <span class="greekheb">τέλειος</span>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-6.htm" title="However, we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nothing:">1 Corinthians 2:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-20.htm" title="Brothers, be not children in understanding: however, in malice be you children, but in understanding be men.">1 Corinthians 14:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-14.htm" title="But strong meat belongs to them that are of full age, even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.">Hebrews 5:14</a>, and as is suggested by the subsequent <span class="greekheb">νήπιοι</span>, means <span class="ital">perfect</span> in the sense of <span class="ital">full grown</span>. The state in which <span class="ital">unity</span> is lacking is the stage of immaturity; the state in which oneness in faith and knowledge is reached is the state of mature manhood in Christ (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-11.htm" title="When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things.">1 Corinthians 13:11</a>). The singular <span class="greekheb">ἄνδρα</span> instead of <span class="greekheb">ἄνδρας</span> is appropriately used (as we have already had <span class="greekheb">ὁ καινὸς ἄνθρωπος</span>) when the idea of <span class="ital">unity</span> is in view. The goal to be reached is that of a new Humanity, regenerated and spiritually mature in all its members.—<span class="greekheb">εἰς μέτρον ἡλικίας</span>: <span class="ital">unto the measure of the stature</span>. A clause in apposition to the former, further defining the <span class="greekheb">τέλειον</span>, and giving a fuller and yet more precise description of the goal which is to be reached. Is <span class="greekheb">ἡλικίας</span>, however, to be rendered <span class="ital">age</span> or <span class="ital">stature?</span> The noun appears to have both senses. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-3.htm" title="And he sought to see Jesus who he was; and could not for the press, because he was little of stature.">Luke 19:3</a> it is certainly = <span class="ital">stature</span>, and probably so also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-52.htm" title="And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man.">Luke 2:52</a>; while in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-21.htm" title="But by what means he now sees, we know not; or who has opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall speak for himself.">John 9:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-23.htm" title="Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him.">John 9:23</a> it is clearly = <span class="ital">age</span>, and most probably so also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-27.htm" title="Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit to his stature?">Matthew 6:27</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-25.htm" title="And which of you with taking thought can add to his stature one cubit?">Luke 12:25</a>, altho’ the latter two are held by some to be referable to the other meaning; <span class="ital">cf.</span> Field, <span class="ital">Otium Norv.</span>, iii., p. 4. The adj. <span class="greekheb">ἥλικος</span> in the NT has the idea of <span class="ital">magnitude</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-1.htm" title=" For I would that you knew what great conflict I have for you, and for them at Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh;">Colossians 2:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/3-5.htm" title="Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasts great things. Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindles!">Jam 3:5</a>), and that is its most frequentsense in non-Biblical Greek. Much depends, therefore on the context. The antithesis between <span class="greekheb">τέλειον</span> and <span class="greekheb">νήπιοι</span> favours the idea of <span class="ital">age</span> (so Mey., Harl., Abb., etc.). But the idea of <span class="ital">stature</span> is suggested by the <span class="greekheb">μέτρον</span>, the <span class="greekheb">πληρώματος</span>, the <span class="greekheb">αὐξήσωμεν</span> and the <span class="greekheb">αὔξησιν</span>, and is on the whole to be preferred (so Syr., Goth., Copt., Eth. prob., AV., RV., Erasm., Grot., Beng., Rück., Alf., Ell., etc.).—<span class="greekheb">τοῦ πληρώματος τοῦ Χριστοῦ</span>: <span class="ital">of the fulness of Christ</span>. The <span class="greekheb">πλήρωμα</span> here is taken by some in the sense of <span class="ital">perfection</span>. So Rück., who makes it “the perfection possessed by Christ,” and Oltramare who renders it “the measure of the height of the perfection of Christ”. But <span class="greekheb">τελείοτης</span> is one idea, and <span class="greekheb">πλήρωμα</span> another. Not less foreign to the real meaning of the noun are such interpretations as “the gracious presence of Christ” (Harl.); “the perfect age of Christ” (Luth.; <span class="ital">cf.</span> Calvin’s <span class="ital">plena aetas</span>); “the stature of the <span class="ital">full grown Christ</span>,” etc. Nor can the phrase be taken as a designation of the <span class="ital">Church</span> (Storr; also Baur, who holds it = that with which Christ fills Himself or is completed, <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, the Church). For that would give the incongruous idea that we are to <span class="ital">attain to the Church</span>. The <span class="greekheb">Χριστοῦ</span> is the <span class="ital">poss. gen.</span>, and the phrase means the fulness that belongs to Christ, the sum of the qualities which make Him what He is. These are to be imaged in the Church (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-23.htm" title="Which is his body, the fullness of him that fills all in all.">Ephesians 1:23</a>), and when these are in us we shall have reached our maturity and attained to the goal set before us. Thus the whole idea will be this—“the measure of the age, or (better) the stature, that brings with it the full possession on our side of that which Christ has to impart—the embodiment in us the members, of the graces and qualities which are in Him the Head”. It has also been asked whether the goal thus set before us is regarded as one to be reached in our present temporal life by way of development, or one to be attained to only in the future life. As between these two ideas the preference must be given (with Chrys., Oec, Jer., Luth., de Wette, etc.) to the former, in view of the general tenor of the exhortation introducing the paragraph, the point of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-19.htm" title="And to know the love of Christ, which passes knowledge, that you might be filled with all the fullness of God.">Ephesians 3:19</a>, the place given to <span class="ital">unity</span> and <span class="ital">maturity</span>, etc. So Mey. thinks it refers to the Christian condition to be reached “after the last storms and before the Parousia”. Not a few of the Fathers, however, take the <span class="ital">resurrection</span> to be specially in view, and interpreters like Theod., Calv., etc., think it looks to the perfected life of the other world. But Paul gives no clear indication of the <span class="ital">time</span>, and it may be, therefore, that he has in view only the goal itself and the attainment of it at whatever time that may take effect.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/ephesians/4.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">13</span>. <span class="ital">till we all come in</span>] Render, <span class="bld">come unto</span>. The thought is of the holy Community converging into the spiritual harmony of a developed, equal, identical faith in and knowledge of the Son of God, under the mutual influence of individual believers stimulated and guided by the spiritual ministry. This would take place by growth and development in the faith and knowledge of individuals; but the cohesion of the true Church would bring these individual growths to converge and result in the maturity of the collective faith and knowledge, so to speak, of the whole Body, the ideal “fullgrown Man” of which the “fullgrown men” were the elements and miniatures.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">of the faith, and of the knowledge of</span>] I.e., faith <span class="ital">in</span> Him and knowledge <span class="ital">of</span> Him. “Faith <span class="ital">of</span>” often, in the N.T., means “faith <span class="ital">in</span>”; <span class="ital">e.g.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-20.htm" title="I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ lives in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.">Galatians 2:20</a> (A.V., “the faith of the Son of God,” identically as here). See above on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-12.htm" title="In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him.">Ephesians 3:12</a>.—“<span class="ital">Knowledge</span>”<span class="ital">:</span>—the Gr. word indicates true, full, developed spiritual knowledge, but too delicately, perhaps, to admit translation. See above on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-17.htm" title="That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him:">Ephesians 1:17</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the Son of God</span>] This sacred Title belongs to the Saviour specially, among other respects, as He is the Head of the Church, the Firstborn, “in Whom” the “children” have adoption and regeneration; “in Whom” they are one with the Father.

It indicates <span class="ital">man</span> as against <span class="ital">child</span>. See next verse.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">unto the measure of the stature</span>] The metaphor is of height, not age, though the word rendered “stature” means “age” as readily, by itself. The imagery of <span class="ital">growth</span> in this passage decides the alternative here.—“<span class="ital">The measure</span>”<span class="ital">:</span>—the allotted, proper, standard.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the fulness of Christ</span>] Cp. the phrases “fulness of the Gentiles” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-25.htm" title="For I would not, brothers, that you should be ignorant of this mystery, lest you should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles be come in.">Romans 11:25</a>), and “fulness of the time” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-4.htm" title="But when the fullness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law,">Galatians 4:4</a>), and note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-23.htm" title="Which is his body, the fullness of him that fills all in all.">Ephesians 1:23</a>. The phrase here appears to be analogous: <span class="ital">the total, at length attained, of what is meant by Christ</span>. And “Christ” in this passage (so full of the idea of the oneness in and with the Lord of His mystical Body) is, in effect, Christ and His Church (see above on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-23.htm" title="Which is his body, the fullness of him that fills all in all.">Ephesians 1:23</a>); as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-12.htm" title="For as the body is one, and has many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ.">1 Corinthians 12:12</a>, “as the body is one, and hath many limbs … so also <span class="ital">is Christ</span>.” The Lord the Son becomes in accomplished fact all that He wills, and is willed, to be, only when He is the Head of a perfected mystical Body which lives by His sacred Life and is His incorporate “limbs,” His immortal vehicle of action, if we may so speak. So He and they are guardedly and reverently spoken of here and there as One Christ, with full reservation, from other Scriptures, of the truth of the undying personality of each individual “limb” of the glorious Head, and of His Divine Personality.—See further above on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-22.htm" title="And has put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church,">Ephesians 1:22</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is possible to explain the present phrase to mean “the fulness which flows from Christ,” the full, ideal, supply of grace and glory derived to the members from the Head. But we think this less probable, in view of the passage above quoted, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-12.htm" title="For as the body is one, and has many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ.">1 Corinthians 12:12</a>.

They had always to go forward, not to stand still, much less to fall behind. And now the Church must not contemplate from behind the idea of its own excellence, but keep before its eyes that idea as a future one, which is yet to be attained.

Some maintain that it implies that <span class="accented">all</span> these offices are to continue in the Church until the result specified is obtained (Catholic Apostolic or Irvingite Church): this is contradicted by Scripture and by experience, so far as apostles and prophets are concerned, for the gifts for these offices were not continued, and without the gifts the offices are impossible. The meaning is that, till the event specified, there is to be a provision in the Church of the offices that are needed, and the apostle, in using "until," probably had in view the last office in his list - pastors and teachers. <span class="cmt_word">To the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God.</span> Both genitives are governed by unity; already there is one faith (ver. 5), but we all, <span class="accented">i.e</span>. all who compose or are yet to compose the body of Christ, the totality of this body, have to be brought to this faith. As in ver. 5 "faith" is not equivalent to "creed," or truth believed, but the act of believing; so here the consummation which the ministers of the Church are given to bring about is a state in which faith in the Son of God shall characterize all, and that, not a blind faith, but a faith associated with knowledge. Usually faith and knowledge are opposed to each other; but here faith has more the meaning of trust than of mere belief - trust based on knowledge, trust in the Son of God based on knowledge of his Person, his work, and his relation to them that receive him. To bring all the elect to this faith is the object of the ministry; when they are all brought to it, the body of Christ will be complete, and the functions of the Christian ministry will cease. <span class="cmt_word">Unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.</span> The idea of organic completeness is more fully expressed by these two clauses; the consummation is the completeness of the whole body of Christ as <span class="accented">such</span>; but that involves the maturity of each individual who is a constituent part of that body; and the measure or sign of maturity, both for the individual and for the whole, is the stature of the fullness of Christ (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-29.htm">Romans 8:29</a>, "<span class="accented">Whom</span> he did foreknow, them he also foredained to be <span class="accented">conformed to the image of his Son"</span>). The question has been put - Will this consummation be in this life or the next? The one seems to melt into the other; the idea of a complete Church and that of a new economy seem inseparable; as the coming of Christ will terminate the observance of the Lord's Supper, so it will terminate the ministries ordained by Christ for the completion of his Church. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/ephesians/4.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Till (&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;)<p>Specifying the time up to which this ministry and impartation of gifts are to last.<p>Come (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;)<p>Arrive at, as a goal.
