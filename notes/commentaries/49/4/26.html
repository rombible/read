Selah.">Psalm 4:4</a>. Anger itself is not sin, for our Lord Himself felt it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-5.htm" title="And when he had looked round about on them with anger, being grieved for the hardness of their hearts, he said to the man, Stretch forth your hand. And he stretched it out: and his hand was restored whole as the other.">Mark 3:5</a>) at the “hardness of men’s hearts;” and it is again and again attributed to God Himself, in language no doubt of human accommodation, but, of course, accommodation to what is sinless in humanity. In the form of resentment, and above all of the resentment of righteous indignation, it performs (as Butler has shown in his sermon on “Resentment”) a stimulating and inspiring function in the strife against evil. But it is a dangerous and exceptional weapon: and hence the exhortation “sin not,” and the practical enforcement of that exhortation in the next clause.<p><span class= "bld">Let not the sun go down upon your wrath.</span>—In this command (for which a Pythagorean parallel may be found) St. Paul gives a two-fold safeguard against abuse of even righteous anger. (1) It is not to be prolonged beyond the sunset—beyond the sleep which ends the old day and leads in the freshness of the new, and which by any godly man must be prepared for in commendation of himself to God, and in prayer for His forgiveness, “as we forgive those who trespass against us.” (2) It is not to be brooded over and stimulated; for the word “wrath” is properly <span class= "ital">self-exasperation, </span>being similar to the “contention” of <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-30.htm" title="So when they were dismissed, they came to Antioch: and when they had gathered the multitude together, they delivered the letter:">Acts 15:30</a>, described as alien to the spirit of love in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-5.htm" title="Does not behave itself unseemly, seeks not her own, is not easily provoked, thinks no evil;">1Corinthians 13:5</a>. It is that “nursing of wrath to keep it warm,” which can be checked even by those who cannot control the first outburst, and which constantly corrupts righteous indignation into selfish personal anger, if not into malignity.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:25-28 Notice the particulars wherewith we should adorn our Christian profession. Take heed of every thing contrary to truth. No longer flatter or deceive others. God's people are children who will not lie, who dare not lie, who hate and abhor lying. Take heed of anger and ungoverned passions. If there is just occasion to express displeasure at what is wrong, and to reprove, see that it be without sin. We give place to the devil, when the first motions of sin are not grievous to our souls; when we consent to them; and when we repeat an evil deed. This teaches that as sin, if yielded unto, lets in the devil upon us, we are to resist it, keeping from all appearance of evil. Idleness makes thieves. Those who will not work, expose themselves to temptations to steal. Men ought to be industrious, that they may do some good, and that they may be kept from temptation. They must labour, not only that they may live honestly, but that they may have to give to the wants of others. What then must we think of those called Christians, who grow rich by fraud, oppression, and deceitful practices! Alms, to be accepted of God, must not be gained by unrighteousness and robbery, but by honesty and industry. God hates robbery for burnt-offerings.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ephesians/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Be ye angry and sin not - It has been remarked that the direction here is conformable to the usage of the Pythagoreans, who were bound, when there were any differences among them, to furnish some token of reconciliation before the sun set. Burder, in Ros. Alt. u. neu. Morgenland, in loc. It is implied here:<p>(1) that there "may" be anger without sin; and,<p>(2) that there is special danger in all cases where there is anger that it will be accompanied with sin. "Anger" is a passion too common to need any description. It is an excitement or agitation of mind, of more or less violence, produced by the reception of a real or supposed injury, and attended commonly with a desire or purpose of revenge. The desire of revenge, however, is not essential to the existence of the passion, though it is probably always attended with a disposition to express displeasure, to chide, rebuke, or punish; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-5.htm">Mark 3:5</a>. To a great extent the sudden excitement on the reception of an injury is involuntary, and consequently innocent. Anger is excited when a horse kicks us; when a serpent hisses; when we dash our foot against a stone - and so when a man raises his hand to strike us. The "object or final cause" of implanting this passion in the mind of man is, to rouse him to an immediate defense of himself when suddenly attacked, and before his reason would, have time to suggest the proper means of defense. It prompts at once to self-protection; and when that is done its proper office ceases. If persevered in; it becomes sinful malignity. or revenge - always wrong. Anger may be excited against a "thing" as well as a "person;" as well against an act as a "man." We are suddenly excited by a wrong "thing," without any malignancy against the "man;" we may wish to rebuke or chide "that," without injuring "him." Anger is sinful in the following circumstances:<p>(1) When it is excited without any sufficient cause - when we are in no danger, and do not need it for a protection. We should be safe without it.<p>(2) when it transcends the cause, if any cause really exists. All that is beyond the necessity of immediate self-protection, is apart from its design, and is wrong.<p>(3) when it is against "the person" rather than the "offence." The object is not to injure another; it is to protect ourselves.<p>(4) when it is attended with the desire of "revenge." That is always wrong; <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/12-17.htm">Romans 12:17</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-19.htm">Romans 12:19</a>.<p>(5) when it is cherished and heightened by reflection. And,<p>(6) When there is an unforgiving spirit; a determination to exact the utmost satisfaction for the injury which has been done. If people were perfectly holy, that sudden "arousing of the mind" in danger, or on the reception of an injury; which would serve to prompt us to save ourselves from danger, would exist, and would be an important principle of our nature. As it is now, it is violent; excessive; incontrollable; persevered in - and is almost always wrong. If people were holy, this excitement of the mind would obey the first injunctions of "reasons," and be wholly under its control; as it is now, it seldom obeys reason at all - and is wholly wrong. Moreover, if all people were holy; if there were none "disposed" to do an injury, it would exist only in the form of a sudden arousing of the mind against immediate danger - which would all be right. Now, it is excited not only in view of "physical" dangers, but in view of the "wrongs" done by others - and hence it terminates on the "person" and not the "thing," and becomes often wholly evil.<p>Let not the sun go down - Do not cherish anger. Do not sleep upon it. Do not harbor a purpose of revenge; do not cherish ill-will against another. "When the sun sets on a man's anger, he may be sure it is wrong." The meaning of the whole of this verse then is, "If you be angry, which may be the case, and which may be unavoidable, see that the sudden excitement does not become sin. Do not let it overleap its proper bounds; do not cherish it; do not let it remain in your bosom even to the setting of the sun. Though the sun be sinking in the west, let not the passion linger in the bosom, but let his last rays find you always peaceful and calm." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ephesians/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>26. Be ye angry, and sin not&#8212;So the Septuagint, Ps 4:4. Should circumstances arise to call for anger on your part, let it be as Christ's "anger" (Mr 3:5), without sin. Our natural feelings are not wrong when directed to their legitimate object, and when not exceeding due bounds. As in the future literal, so in the present spiritual, resurrection, no essential constituent is annihilated, but all that is a perversion of the original design is removed. Thus indignation at dishonor done to God, and wrong to man, is justifiable anger. Passion is sinful (derived from "passio," suffering: implying that amidst seeming energy, a man is really passive, the slave of his anger, instead of ruling it).<p>let not the sun go down upon your wrath&#8212;"wrath" is absolutely forbidden; "anger" not so, though, like poison sometimes used as medicine, it is to be used with extreme caution. The sense is not, Your anger shall not be imputed to you if you put it away before nightfall; but "let no wrath (that is, as the Greek, personal 'irritation' or 'exasperation') mingle with your 'anger,' even though, the latter be righteous, [Trench, Greek Synonyms of the New Testament]. "Put it away before sunset" (when the Jewish day began), is proverbial for put it away at once before another day begin (De 24:15); also before you part with your brother for the night, perhaps never in this world to meet again. So Jona, "Let not night and anger against anyone sleep with you, but go and conciliate the other party, though he have been the first to commit the offense." Let not your "anger" at another's wickedness verge into hatred, or contempt, or revenge [Vatablus].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ephesians/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Be ye angry and sin not:</span> by way of concession, rather than by way of command: q.d.

There is anger which is not sinful; for anger is fouled in God himself, in Jesus Christ, in the holy angels, and in God's people; and a man may be said to be angry and not sin, when his anger arises from a true zeal for God and religion; when it is kindled not against persons, but sins; when a man is displeased with his own sins, and with the sins of others: with vice and immorality of every kind; with idolatry and idolatrous worship, and with all false doctrine; and also when it is carried on to answer good ends, as the good of those with whom we are angry, the glory of God, and the promoting of the interest of Christ: and there is an anger which is sinful; as when it is without a cause; when it exceeds due bounds; when it is not directed to a good end; when it is productive of bad effects, either in words or actions; and when it is soon raised, or long continues: the Jews have a like distinction of anger; they say (e), <p>"there is an anger and an anger; there is an anger which is blessed above and below, and it is called blessed, as it is said <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-19.htm">Genesis 14:19</a> and there is an anger which is cursed above and below, as it is said <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-14.htm">Genesis 3:14</a>'' <p>And these two sorts are compared to "Ebal" and "Gerizzim", from the one of which proceeded blessing, and from the other cursing: anger for the most part is not only sinful, but it tends to sin, and issues in it; hence that saying of the Jews,   , "be not angry, and thou wilt not sin" (f): the spring of it is a corrupt heart, it is stirred up by Satan, encouraged by pride, and increased by grievous words and reproachful language: <p>let not the sun go down upon your wrath; there is an allusion to  <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-10.htm">Deuteronomy 24:10</a> it seems to be a proverbial expression; and the design of it is to show, that anger should not be continued; that it should not last at furthest more than a day; that when the heat of the day is over, the heat of anger should be over likewise; and that we should not sleep with it, lest it should be cherished and increased upon our pillows; and besides, the time of the going down of the sun, is the time of evening prayer, which may be greatly interrupted and hindered by anger. R. Jonah (g) has an expression or two like to this; <p>"let not the indignation of anyone abide upon thee; and let not a night sleep with thee, and anger be against any one:'' <p>it should be considered, that as God is slow to anger, so he does not retain it for ever; and that to retain anger, is to gratify the devil; wherefore it follows, <p>(e) Zohar in Gen. fol. 104. 1.((f) T.

To the right understanding of the sense (which Paul would have expressed by <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὈΡΓΙΖΌΜΕΝΟΙ ΜῊ ἉΜΑΡΤΆΝΕΤΕ</span></span></span>, or something similar, if that definite form of expression in the LXX. had not presented itself to him) the observation of Bengel guides us: “Saepe vis modi cadit super partem duntaxat sermonis, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-24.htm" title="O LORD, correct me, but with judgment; not in your anger, lest you bring me to nothing.">Jeremiah 10:24</a>” (comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/12-1.htm" title="And in that day you shall say, O LORD, I will praise you: though you were angry with me, your anger is turned away, and you comforted me.">Isaiah 12:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-25.htm" title="At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank you, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hid these things from the wise and prudent, and have revealed them to babes.">Matthew 11:25</a>; and see Buttmann, <span class="ital">neut.

Here, namely, the <span class="ital">vis modi</span> lies upon the second imperative (comp. passages like <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-47.htm" title="Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and said of him, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!">John 1:47</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-52.htm" title="They answered and said to him, Are you also of Galilee? Search, and look: for out of Galilee rises no prophet.">John 7:52</a>): be angry <span class="ital">and sin not</span>, i.e. <span class="ital">in anger do not fall into transgression</span>; so that Paul forbids the <span class="ital">combination</span> of the <span class="greekheb">ἁμαρτάνειν</span> with the <span class="greekheb">ὀργίζεσθαι</span>. Comp. Matthies: “In the being angry let it not come to sin;” Harless: “Be angry in the right way, without your sinning.”[245] Paul, therefore, does not forbid the <span class="greekheb">ὀργίζεσθαι</span> in itself, and could not forbid it, because there is (see Wuttke, <span class="ital">Sittenl</span>. II. § 243) a <span class="ital">holy</span> anger,[246] which is “<span class="ital">calcar virtutis</span>” (Seneca, <span class="ital">de ira</span>, iii. 3), as there is also a <span class="ital">divine</span> anger; the <span class="greekheb">ὀργίζεσθαι καὶ ἁμαρτάνειν</span>, however; is not to take place, but, on the contrary, the <span class="greekheb">ὀργίζεσθαι</span> is to be <span class="ital">without</span> sin, consequently an <span class="greekheb">ὀργίζεσθαι καὶ μὴ ἁμαρτάνειν</span>. As regards the substantial sense, the same result is brought out with the <span class="ital">usual</span> explanation, but it is usually believed (and already in the <span class="ital">Constitutt. Apost.</span> ii. 53. 2, the passage of the Psalm is so taken) that the imperative may be resolved <span class="ital">conditionaliter</span> in accordance with Hebrew usage: <span class="ital">if ye are angry, do not sin</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-9.htm" title="Associate yourselves, O you people, and you shall be broken in pieces; and give ear, all you of far countries: gird yourselves, and you shall be broken in pieces; gird yourselves, and you shall be broken in pieces.">Isaiah 8:9</a> f.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-4.htm" title="For thus said the LORD to the house of Israel, Seek you me, and you shall live:">Amos 5:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-6.htm" title="Seek the LORD, and you shall live; lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph, and devour it, and there be none to quench it in Bethel.">Amos 5:6</a>, <span class="ital">al.</span>). So also Koppe, Flatt, Rückert, Holzhausen, Meier, Olshausen, Zyro, Baumgarten-Crusius, Bleek. But the combination of two imperatives connected by <span class="ital">and</span>, like: <span class="ital">do this, and live</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/42-18.htm" title="And Joseph said to them the third day, This do, and live; for I fear God:">Genesis 42:18</a>, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-9.htm" title="Associate yourselves, O you people, and you shall be broken in pieces; and give ear, all you of far countries: gird yourselves, and you shall be broken in pieces; gird yourselves, and you shall be broken in pieces.">Isaiah 8:9</a>, and similar passages,—a combination, moreover, which is not a Hebraism, but a general idiom of language (comp. <span class="ital">divide et impera</span>),—is not at all in point here, because it would lead to the in this case absurd analysis: “if ye are angry, ye shall not sin.” Winer, p. 279 [E. T. 391 f.], allows the taking of the first imperative in a <span class="ital">permissive</span> sense; comp. Krüger, § 54, 4. 2. In this way we should obtain as result: “<span class="ital">be angry</span> (I cannot hinder it), <span class="ital">but only do not sin</span>.” So also de Wette. No doubt a permission of anger, because subsequently <span class="greekheb">καὶ μὴ ἁμαρτ</span>. follows, would not be in conflict with <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-31.htm" title="Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamor, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice:">Ephesians 4:31</a>, where manifestly all <span class="ital">hostile</span> anger is forbidden; but the mere <span class="greekheb">καί</span> is only logically correct when both imperatives are thought of in the <span class="ital">same</span> sense, not the former as permitting and the latter as enjoining, in which case the combination becomes <span class="ital">exceptive</span> (“only, however”), which would be expressed by <span class="greekheb">ἀλλά</span>, <span class="greekheb">πλήν</span>, or <span class="greekheb">μόνον</span>.[247] Beza, Piscator, Grotius, and others take <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὈΡΓΊΖ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> <span class="ital">interrogatively:</span> “<span class="ital">irascimini? et ne peccate</span>.” Against this we cannot urge—the objection usually taken since the time of Wolf—the <span class="greekheb">καί</span>, which often in rapid emotion strikes in with some summons (Hartung, <span class="ital">Partikell</span>. I. p. 148); but we may urge the fact that Paul <span class="ital">reproduces a passage of the LXX</span>. (which, it is true, is quite arbitrarily denied by Beza and Koppe) in which <span class="greekheb">ὀργίζ</span>. is <span class="ital">imperative</span>, and that such an abrupt and impassioned question and answer would not be in keeping with the whole calm and sober tone of the discourse.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">μὴ ἁμαρτάνετε</span>] forbids <span class="ital">every kind</span> of sinning, to which anger may lead.

We may add that Zanchius and Holzhausen are mistaken in holding the <span class="greekheb">παρά</span> in the word to indicate <span class="ital">unrighteous</span> irritation.

Hence Erasmus (not in the <span class="ital">Paraphr</span>.), Luther, Erasmus Schmid, Michaelis, Zachariae, Moras, Stolz, Flatt, and others (Koppe is undecided) are in error in holding that <span class="greekheb">διάβολος</span> is here equivalent to <span class="ital">calumniator</span>; in which view Erasmus thought of the <span class="ital">heathen</span> slandering the Christians, to whom they were to furnish no material; and most expositors thought of the <span class="ital">tale-bearers</span> nursing disputes, to whom they were not to lend an ear. In an irritated frame of mind passion easily gains the ascendancy over sobriety and watchfulness, and <span class="ital">that</span> physical condition is favourable to the <span class="ital">devil</span> for his work of seducing into everything that is opposed to God.

But this, as not implied in the context, must have been <span class="ital">said</span> by an addition (<span class="greekheb">ἐν τῇ ἐκκλησίᾳ</span>, or the like, after <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΌΠΟΝ</span></span></span>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The name <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΙΆΒΟΛΟς</span></span></span> does not occur elsewhere in the undoubtedly genuine Epistles of the apostle; but this, considering the equally general currency of the two names devil and Satan, may be accidental Comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-10.htm" title="And said, O full of all subtlety and all mischief, you child of the devil, you enemy of all righteousness, will you not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord?">Acts 13:10</a>. We may add that the citation of the Clementines (<span class="ital">Hom.</span> xix. 2): <span class="greekheb">μὴ δότε πρόφασιν τῷ πονηρῷ</span>, has nothing to do with our passage (in opposition to Schwegler, <span class="ital">l.c.</span> p. 394 f.).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[244] The words of the original, רִנְזוּ וְאַל־תֶּחֱטָאוּ, mean: tremble, and err not (Ewald), with which David calls upon his enemies to tremble on account of their iniquities towards him, the favourite of God, and not further to sin. Comp. also Hupfeld in loc. Yet other recent scholars, including Hitzig, have translated, in harmony with the LXX.: Be angry, but offend not.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[245] When, however, Harless would assign to our passage a place “not under the head of anger, but under that of placability,” he overlooks the fact that in anger one may commit sin otherwise than by implacability; and that the following <span class="greekheb">ὁ ἥλιος κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. brings into prominence only a <span class="ital">single</span> precept <span class="ital">falling under</span> the <span class="greekheb">μὴ ἁμαρτ</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[246] That this, however, is not meant in ver. 31, see on that verse.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[247] This is no “philological theorizing,” but is based on logical necessity. No instance can be adduced in which, of two imperatives coupled by <span class="greekheb">καί</span>, the former is to be taken as concessive and the second as preceptive, in contrast to the former. To refer to <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-24.htm" title="O LORD, correct me, but with judgment; not in your anger, lest you bring me to nothing.">Jeremiah 10:24</a> as a parallel, as Winer does, is erroneous, for the very reason that in that passage—which, however, in general is very different from ours<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">πλήν</span>, not <span class="greekheb">καί</span>, is used.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/ephesians/4.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-26.htm" title="Be you angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down on your wrath:">Ephesians 4:26</a>. <span class="greekheb">ὀργίζεσθε καὶ μὴ ἁμαρτάνετε</span>: <span class="ital">be ye angry, and sin not</span>. The words are taken from <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/4-4.htm" title="Stand in awe, and sin not: commune with your own heart on your bed, and be still. Selah.">Psalm 4:4</a>, and follow the LXX rendering. The original Hebrew, <span class="greekheb">רִגְזוּ וְאַל־תֶּחֱטָאוּ</span>, is rendered by some “Tremble and sin not” (Ewald; AV, “Stand in awe and sin not”), <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, = “let wholesome fear keep you from this sinful course”; by others, as the LXX gives it (Hitz., Del., etc.). As used by Paul here the words recognise the fact that <span class="ital">anger</span> has its rightful place and may be a duty, while they indicate also how easily it may pass into the sinful. Great difficulty has been felt with this, and in various ways it has been sought to empty the injunction of its obvious meaning. Some take the first imperative <span class="ital">conditionally</span>, as if = “if ye are angry, do not sin” (Olsh., Bleek, etc.); others, in a way utterly at variance with the quotation, take <span class="greekheb">ὀργίζεσθε</span> as an <span class="ital">interrogative</span> (Beza, Grot.); others declare it impossible to take the first command as <span class="ital">direct</span> (Buttm., <span class="ital">Gram. of N. T. Greek</span>, p. 290), or deal with the first imper. as <span class="ital">permissive</span>, and with the second as <span class="ital">jussive</span> (Winer, De Wette, etc.), as if = “be ye angry if it must be so, but only do not sin”. Such a construction might be allowable if the first imper. were followed by <span class="greekheb">ἀλλὰ καί</span> or some similar disjunctive: but with the simple <span class="greekheb">καί</span> it is inadmissible. Both impers. are real jussives, the only difference between them being in the <span class="greekheb">μή</span>—which also throws some emphasis on the second. The <span class="greekheb">καί</span> has here the rhetorical sense which is found also in <span class="ital">atque</span>, adding something that seems not quite consistent with the preceding or that qualifies it, = “and yet” (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-14.htm" title="But John forbade him, saying, I have need to be baptized of you, and come you to me?">Matthew 3:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-26.htm" title="Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much better than they?">Matthew 6:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-29.htm" title="Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father.">Matthew 10:29</a>, etc.). Nor is the difficulty in admitting <span class="greekheb">ὀργίζεσθε</span> to be a real injunction of anger anything more than a self-made difficulty. Moralists of different schools, the Stoics excepted. have recognised the place of <span class="ital">anger</span> in a moral nature; <span class="ital">cf., e.g.</span>, Plato’s <span class="greekheb">τὸ θυμοειδές</span>; Butler’s statement of the function of anger in a moral system as “a balance to the weakness of pity” and a “counterpoise to possible excess in another part of our nature,” <span class="ital">Sermons</span>, Carmichael’s ed., pp. 126, 128. A righteous wrath is acknowledged in Scripture as something that not only <span class="ital">may</span> be but <span class="ital">ought</span> to be, and is seen in Christ Himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-5.htm" title="And when he had looked round about on them with anger, being grieved for the hardness of their hearts, he said to the man, Stretch forth your hand. And he stretched it out: and his hand was restored whole as the other.">Mark 3:5</a>). So Paul speaks here of an anger that is approvable and to be enjoined, while in the <span class="greekheb">καὶ μὴ ἁμαρτάνετε</span> he forbids only a particular form or measure of anger. As the following clause suggests, even a righteous wrath by over-indulgence may pass all too easily into sin.—<span class="greekheb">ὁ ἥλιος μὴ ἐπιδυέτω ἐπὶ τῷ παροργισμῷ ὑμῶν</span>: <span class="ital">let not the sun go down upon your provocation</span>. For the expression <span class="greekheb">ὁ ἥλιος μὴ ἐπιδυέτω</span> <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-13.htm" title="In any case you shall deliver him the pledge again when the sun goes down, that he may sleep in his own raiment, and bless you: and it shall be righteousness to you before the LORD your God.">Deuteronomy 24:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-15.htm" title="At his day you shall give him his hire, neither shall the sun go down on it; for he is poor, and sets his heart on it: lest he cry against you to the LORD, and it be sin to you.">Deuteronomy 24:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-9.htm" title="She that has borne seven languishes: she has given up the ghost; her sun is gone down while it was yet day: she has been ashamed and confounded: and the residue of them will I deliver to the sword before their enemies, said the LORD.">Jeremiah 15:9</a>; also Hom., <span class="ital">Il.</span>, ii., 413, and Plutarch’s statement of the Pythagorean custom—<span class="greekheb">εἴποτε προαχθεῖεν εἰς λοιδορίας ὑπ ὀργῆς</span>, <span class="greekheb">πρὶν ἢ τὸν ἥλιον δῦναι τὰς δεξιὰς ἐμβάλλοντες ἀλλήλοις καὶ ἀσπασάμενοι διέλυοντο</span> (<span class="ital">De Am. frat.</span>, p. 488 B). <span class="greekheb">τῷ</span>, inserted by the TR, is supported by [454] [455] [456] [457] [458]3, etc.; it is omitted by the best critics (LTTrWHRV) on the authority of [459] [460]1[461], etc. The noun <span class="greekheb">παροργισμός</span> occurs only here in the NT; never, as it would appear, in non-biblical Greek; but occasionally in the LXX (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-30.htm" title="Because of the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned, and which he made Israel sin, by his provocation with which he provoked the LORD God of Israel to anger.">1 Kings 15:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-26.htm" title="Notwithstanding the LORD turned not from the fierceness of his great wrath, with which his anger was kindled against Judah, because of all the provocations that Manasseh had provoked him with.">2 Kings 23:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-18.htm" title="Yes, when they had made them a molten calf, and said, This is your God that brought you up out of Egypt, and had worked great provocations;">Nehemiah 9:18</a>). It differs from <span class="greekheb">ὀργή</span> in denoting not the <span class="ital">disposition</span> of anger or anger as a lasting mood, but <span class="ital">provocation, exasperation</span>, sudden, violent anger. Such anger cannot be indulged long, but must be checked and surrendered without delay. To suppose any allusion here to sunset as the time for <span class="ital">prayer</span> or to night as increasing wrath by giving opportunity of brooding, is to import something entirely foreign to the simplicity of the words as a statement of <span class="ital">limitation</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[454] Codex Claromontanus (sæc. vi.), a Græco-Latin MS. at Paris, edited by Tischendorf in 1852.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[455] Codex Augiensis (sæc. ix.), a Græco-Latin MS., at Trinity College, Cambridge, edited by Scrivener in 1859.

Anger, as the mere expression of wounded personality, is sinful; for it means that self is in command. Anger, as the pure expression of repugnance to wrong in loyalty to God, is sinless, where there is true occasion for it. The Apostle practically says, let anger, when you feel it, be <span class="ital">never</span> from the former motive, always from the latter. “Ebullitions of temper,” alike the greatest and smallest, the seen and unseen, are wholly forbidden here.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The words are verbatim the LXX. version of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/4-4.htm" title="Stand in awe, and sin not: commune with your own heart on your bed, and be still. Selah.">Psalm 4:4</a>. The lit. Hebrew there is, “tremble, <span class="ital">and sin not</span>.” And the verb rendered “tremble” may denote the tremor of grief, awe, or anger indifferently. The question of interpretation thus becomes one of context, and it has been suggested (by Dr Kay) that the reference is to the temptation to David’s followers, during Absalom’s rebellion, to give way to unholy wrath against the rebels. Dean Perowne, though saying that the LXX. Gr. is “certainly a possible rendering,” refers the words to the tremor of awe before God. And he remarks that St Paul here gives the Gr. version “not in the way of direct citation.” This last remark is important. The N.T. does not necessarily endorse a certain version of the O.T. by adopting its wording for a special purpose, <span class="ital">without</span> the decisive formula “it is written,” or the like. Still, the suggestion of Dr Kay is noteworthy in itself, and its adoption would give a peculiar point and force to the words here.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">let not the sun go down</span>] Wetstein quotes a curious parallel from Plutarch, (<span class="ital">De Fraterno Amore</span>, p. 488 b.), who says of the Pythagoreans that it was their rule, if betrayed into angry reviling, to shake hands before the sun set.—It is possible that we have Psalms 4 still in view here; “commune with your own heart <span class="ital">upon your bed</span>, and be still.” As if to say, “if you <span class="ital">have</span> sinned in the way here forbidden, see that at least the sin is reversed and renounced before night calls you to bid your brother farewell and to meet your God in solitude.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">your wrath</span>] Better, perhaps, <span class="bld">your provocation</span>, as R.V. margin. The Gr. denotes an occasion of anger, rather than the feeling. See further on the cognate verb, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-4.htm" title="And, you fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.">Ephesians 6:4</a>. The reasons, as well as the acts, of quarrel were to be done with by set of sun.—The Gr. word is one often used by the LXX. of the provocation of God by His unfaithful people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/ephesians/4.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-26.htm" title="Be you angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down on your wrath:">Ephesians 4:26</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ὀργίζεσθε καὶ μὴ ἁμαρτάνετε</span>, <span class="ital">be angry and sin not</span>) So the LXX, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/4-5.htm" title="Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, and put your trust in the LORD.">Psalm 4:5</a>. Anger is neither commanded, nor quite prohibited; but this is commanded, not to permit sin to enter into anger: it is like poison, which is sometimes used as medicine, but must be managed with the utmost caution.

Anger, the feeling and expression of displeasure, is not wholly forbidden, but is guarded by two checks. Our Lord did not make anger a breach of the sixth commandment, but being angry with a brother <span class="accented">without cause</span>. The first check is to beware of sinning; to keep your anger clear of bitterness, spite, malevolence, and all such evil feelings. The second is, <span class="cmt_word">Let not the sun go down on your irritation</span>; examine yourself in the evening, and see that you are tranquil. Eadie quotes Thomas Fuller: "St. Paul saith, 'Let not the sun go down upon your wrath,' to carry news to the antipodes in another world of thy revengeful nature. Yet let us take the apostle's meaning rather than his words - with all possible speed to depose our passion; not understanding him so literally that we may take leave to be angry till sunset; then might our wrath lengthen with the days, and men in Greenland, where day lasts above a quarter of a year, have plentiful scope of revenge. And as the English, by command of William the Conqueror, always raked up their fire, and put out their candles when the curfew bell was rung, let us then also quench all sparks of anger and heat of passion." It is especially becoming in men, when about to sleep the sleep of death, to see that they are in peace and charity with all men; it were seemly always to fall asleep in the same temper. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/ephesians/4.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Be ye angry and sin not (&#x3bf;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;)<p>Cited from <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/4-5.htm">Psalm 4:5</a>, after the Septuagint.
