Here the first symptom of the temper forbidden is “bitterness,” or <span class= "ital">sharpness</span>—a word seldom used, and generally in half-poetical passages (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-23.htm" title="For I perceive that you are in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of iniquity.">Acts 8:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-14.htm" title="Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness:">Romans 3:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-15.htm" title="Looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby many be defiled;">Hebrews 12:15</a>)—that is, an acerbity of temper, ready to take offence and break out in anger. The next stage is “wrath and anger,” that is, passionate outburst, and the deeper anger of which it is at once effect and cause. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-8.htm" title="But to them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath,">Romans 2:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-8.htm" title=" But now you also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth.">Colossians 3:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-15.htm" title="And out of his mouth goes a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treads the wine press of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God.">Revelation 19:15</a>.) In these the smouldering bitterness kindles into flame. The last stage is “clamour and evil speaking”—“clamour” (used in this sense only here) being the loud fury of the first burst of wrath, passing into the more deliberate evil-speaking, as the temper cools down without losing its settled anger.<p><span class= "bld">With all malice.</span>—All are various exhibitions of “malice”—that is, evil mindedness or malignity—the general disposition which is the opposite of goodness, graciousness, and sympathy.

By the law of human nature they rise out of this temper, and react upon it so as to intensify its bitterness. Both it generally, and they in particular, must be resisted and cast out.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/ephesians/4.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/4-31.htm" title="Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamor, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice:...">Ephesians 4:31-32</a></span>. <span class="ital">Let all bitterness </span>— Of disposition or expression, or, as some render the word, <span class="ital">all peevishness; and wrath </span>— Or indignation, as <span class="greekheb">θυμος </span>seems here to signify; that is, anger mingled with contempt or disgust; the next expression in the original, <span class="greekheb">οργη</span>, rather signifying wrath, or lasting displeasure; <span class="ital">and clamour </span>— Loud threatenings, brawlings, or other intemperate speeches, whereby inward anger vents itself. <span class="ital">And evil speaking </span>— Mentioning the faults of absent persons, be it in ever so mild and soft a tone, or with ever such professions of kindness; <span class="ital">with all malice</span> — Every unkind disposition, every temper contrary to love.

Or perhaps, as Dr. Doddridge observes, “it was not the apostle’s intention that a different idea should be annexed to each different word here used: Possibly it might only be his intention, in amassing so many almost synonymous expressions together, to show that he would have them to be on their guard against all the malevolent passions, and those outrages of speech and expression which they tend to produce.

It is the duty of Christians to seek, by the blessing of God, to bring persons to think seriously, and to encourage and warn believers by their conversation. Be ye kind one to another. This sets forth the principle of love in the heart, and the outward expression of it, in a humble, courteous behaviour. Mark how God's forgiveness causes us to forgive. God forgives us, though we had no cause to sin against him. We must forgive, as he has forgiven us. All lying, and corrupt communications, that stir up evil desires and lusts, grieve the Spirit of God. Corrupt passions of bitterness, wrath, anger, clamour, evil-speaking, and malice, grieve the Holy Spirit. Provoke not the holy, blessed Spirit of God to withdraw his presence and his gracious influences. The body will be redeemed from the power of the grave at the resurrection day. Wherever that blessed Spirit dwells as a Sanctifier, he is the earnest of all the joys and glories of that redemption day; and we should be undone, should God take away his Holy Spirit from us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ephesians/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Let all bitterness - see the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-2.htm">Ephesians 4:2</a>.<p>And wrath - The word here does not differ essentially from anger.<p>Anger - see the note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-26.htm">Ephesians 4:26</a>.

The context points to the latter here.

The word rendered “wrath” denotes rather the <span class="ital">acute</span> passion, and the other the <span class="ital">chronic</span>.

The aim there was to limit the admission of anger only to the rare cases where it could be present “without sin.” Here the question is not of the exception but of the rule.

Our word “blasphemy” is now confined to “evil speaking” against God and Divine things, but the Gr. word includes all kinds of slander and opprobrium.

The verb is in the aorist imperative, enjoining a decisive act, a definite and total rejection of these phases of evil.

See the parallel passage, <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-8.htm" title=" But now you also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth.">Colossians 3:8</a>, where the precept is as decisive and as inclusive as here.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">malice</span>] The Gr. word sometimes bears the sense of “evil,” “ill,” in general; <span class="ital">e.g.</span> “<span class="ital">the evil</span>” of “<span class="ital">the day</span>,” <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-34.htm" title="Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself.

But where, as here, it forms one of a list of vices (cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-29.htm" title="Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,">Romans 1:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-8.htm" title=" But now you also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth.">Colossians 3:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-3.htm" title="For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another.">Titus 3:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-1.htm" title="Why laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, all evil speakings,">1 Peter 2:1</a>), it tends to mean the bitter and unjust habit of mind which we denote by malice. (See Trench, <span class="ital">Synonyms</span>, § xi.) It is here mentioned last, as the deeper and more subtle sin of which those just mentioned are manifestations.
