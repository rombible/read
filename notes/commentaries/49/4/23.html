It is properly “to be made young again,” and the process of recovery is described as the natural effect of putting off the decrepitude of the old man, and the decay engendered by fleshly lusts. The effect is seen in “the spirit of the mind”—that is, “in the spiritual nature of the inner man.” The “spirit” of man is the mind or inner man, considered in its true relation as quickened and sustained by the Spirit of God. (See Romans 8, and especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-16.htm" title="From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplies, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, makes increase of the body to the edifying of itself in love.">Ephesians 4:16</a>.) We note, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-18.htm" title=" Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels, intruding into those things which he has not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,">Colossians 2:18</a>, the opposite condition of “the mind of the flesh,” in those who do not “hold the Head.” This spirit is spoken of as regaining its undying youth, as it were, naturally, when “the muddy vesture of decay” is cast off.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:17-24 The apostle charged the Ephesians in the name and by the authority of the Lord Jesus, that having professed the gospel, they should not be as the unconverted Gentiles, who walked in vain fancies and carnal affections. Do not men, on every side, walk in the vanity of their minds? Must not we then urge the distinction between real and nominal Christians? They were void of all saving knowledge; they sat in darkness, and loved it rather than light. They had a dislike and hatred to a life of holiness, which is not only the way of life God requires and approves, and by which we live to him, but which has some likeness to God himself in his purity, righteousness, truth, and goodness. The truth of Christ appears in its beauty and power, when it appears as in Jesus. The corrupt nature is called a man; like the human body, it is of divers parts, supporting and strengthening one another. Sinful desires are deceitful lusts; they promise men happiness, but render them more miserable; and bring them to destruction, if not subdued and mortified. These therefore must be put off, as an old garment, a filthy garment; they must be subdued and mortified. But it is not enough to shake off corrupt principles; we must have gracious ones. By the new man, is meant the new nature, the new creature, directed by a new principle, even regenerating grace, enabling a man to lead a new life of righteousness and holiness. This is created, or brought forth by God's almighty power.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ephesians/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And be renewed - That is, it is necessary that a man who has been following these should become a new man; see the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-3.htm">John 3:3</a> ff., compare the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-16.htm">2 Corinthians 4:16</a>.

They need renovated strength every day.<p>(3) that it is a matter of "obligation" to be renewed.

The "spirit" of man in New Testament is only then used in its proper sense, as worthy of its place and governing functions, when it is one spirit with the Lord. The natural, or animal man, is described as "not having the Spirit" (Jude 19) [Alford].

Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-5.htm" title="Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;">Titus 3:5</a>. But, in opposition to this view, we may urge, first, that the Holy Spirit bestowed on man is never in the N.T. designated in such a way that man appears as the subject of the Spirit (thus never: <span class="greekheb">τὸ πνεῦμα ὑμῶν</span> and the like, or as here: <span class="greekheb">τὸ πνεῦμα τοῦ νοὸς ὑμῶν</span>); and secondly, that it was the object of the apostle to put forward the aspect of the moral self-activity of the Christian life, and hence, he had no occasion expressly to introduce the point, which, moreover, was obvious of itself: <span class="ital">through the Holy Spirit</span>. Accordingly, there remains as the right explanation only the <span class="ital">usual</span> one (dative of reference), according to which the <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span> is the <span class="ital">human</span> spirit, different from the divine (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-16.htm" title="The Spirit itself bears witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God:">Romans 8:16</a>). Consequently: <span class="ital">in respect of the spirit of your</span> <span class="greekheb">νοῦς</span>, that is, of the spirit by which your <span class="greekheb">νοῦς</span> is governed. The <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span>, namely, is the <span class="ital">higher life-principle</span> in man, the <span class="ital">moral power akin to God</span> in him, the seat of moral self-consciousness and of moral self-determination. This <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span>, which forms the moral personality of man, the Ego of his higher <span class="greekheb">ζωή</span> turned towards God, has as the organ of its vital exercise—as the faculty of its moral operation—the <span class="greekheb">νοῦς</span>, that is, the reason in its ethical quality and activity (comp. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-23.htm" title="But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.">Romans 7:23</a>), and puts the <span class="greekheb">νοῦς</span>[242] at the service of the divine will (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-25.htm" title="I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.">Romans 7:25</a>), in an assent to the moral practice of this divine will revealed in the law and a hatred of the contrary (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-14.htm" title="For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.">Romans 7:14</a> ff.). But, since this Ego of the higher life, the substratum of the inward man—the <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span>, in which the <span class="greekheb">νοῦς</span> has its support and its determining agent—is under the preponderant strength of the power of sin in the flesh non-free, bound, and weak, so that man under the fleshly-psychical influence of the natural character drawing him to sin becomes liable to the slavery of immoral habit, the <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα τοῦ νοός</span> needed renewal unto moral freedom and might, which consecration of power it receives in regeneration by means of the Holy Spirit, in which case, however, even the regenerate has always to contend against the <span class="greekheb">σάρξ</span> still remaining in him, but contends victoriously under the guidance of the divine <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/galatians/5-16.htm" title="This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh....">Galatians 5:16-18</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[241] He might have written, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-2.htm" title="And be not conformed to this world: but be you transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.">Romans 12:2</a>, merely <span class="greekheb">τῷ νοῒ ὑμῶν</span>; but his conception here penetrates deeper, namely, to the fountainhead of the vital activity of the <span class="greekheb">νοῦς</span>, to the inner agent and mover in that activity.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[242] Bengel excellently puts it: “<span class="ital">Spiritu mentis</span>: <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-14.htm" title="For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prays, but my understanding is unfruitful.">1 Corinthians 14:14</a>, <span class="ital">Spiritus est intimum mentis</span>.” Delitzsch consequently errs (<span class="ital">Psychol</span>, p. 184) in thinking that expositors have here <span class="ital">neglected</span> to seek instruction from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-14.htm" title="For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prays, but my understanding is unfruitful.">1 Corinthians 14:14</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/ephesians/4.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-23.htm" title="And be renewed in the spirit of your mind;">Ephesians 4:23</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἀνανεοῦσθαι δέ</span>: <span class="ital">and that ye be renewed</span>. For <span class="greekheb">ἀνανεοῦσθαι</span> a few MSS. ([446]2 17, 47, etc.) and some Versions (Syr., Copt., Vulg.) read <span class="greekheb">ἀνανεοῦσθε</span>, while <span class="greekheb">δέ</span> is omitted by [447]. In such connections <span class="greekheb">δέ</span> expresses both <span class="ital">addition</span> and <span class="ital">contrast</span>. It introduces a statement connected with the foregoing but giving the other side of that. Here it is the positive change which must follow the <span class="ital">putting off</span>. As the middle of this verb has the active sense, <span class="greekheb">ἀνανεοῦσθαι</span> must be taken as passive here, = “be renewed,” not “renew yourselves” (Luth.). The verb expresses a spiritual change, a transformation from old to new. Whether it also conveys the idea of <span class="ital">restoration</span> to a <span class="ital">former</span> or a <span class="ital">primal</span> state is doubtful, so many compounds with <span class="greekheb">ἀνά</span> (<span class="greekheb">ἀναπληροῦν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀνακοινοῦν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀνισοῦν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀνιεροῦν</span>, etc.) expressing nothing more than <span class="ital">change</span>. For the supposed distinction between <span class="greekheb">ἀνανεοῦσθαι</span> as expressing <span class="ital">renovation</span>, making new, or giving a fresh beginning, and <span class="greekheb">ἀνακαινοῦσθαι</span> as referring to <span class="ital">regeneration</span> or change of nature, see Haupt and Ell. <span class="ital">in loc.</span>, and Meyer on <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-10.htm" title=" And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him:">Colossians 3:10</a>.—<span class="greekheb">τῷ πνεύματι τοῦ νοὸς ὑμῶν</span>: <span class="ital">in the spirit of your mind</span>. The position of the <span class="greekheb">ὑμῶν</span> gives it a measure of emphasis, “<span class="ital">your</span> mind,” “the mind that is in <span class="ital">you</span>,” unless it be taken (with Haupt) to be placed last because it qualifies not the <span class="greekheb">νοὸς</span> only but the whole idea in <span class="greekheb">τῷ πνεύματι τοῦ νοός</span>. This difficult sentence has been understood to refer to the <span class="ital">Holy Spirit</span>, the <span class="greekheb">νοός</span> being dealt with as some form of the <span class="ital">poss. gen.</span> or the <span class="ital">gen. subj.</span>, and the <span class="greekheb">πνεύματι</span> as <span class="ital">dat. instr.</span> Thus the sense would be “renewed by the Holy Spirit <span class="ital">bestowed on</span>, or <span class="ital">possessed by</span>, your mind” (Œc., Theophy., Bull, Waterland, Fritz., etc.). This proceeds on the NT doctrine that it is by the Spirit of God that we are regenerated or renewed. But it leaves the point of the addition of <span class="greekheb">τοῦ νοός</span> obscure. This ancient interpretation has been adopted by some recent exegetes with certain modifications. Thus Ellicott is of opinion that the <span class="greekheb">πνεύματι</span> refers not to the <span class="ital">Holy Spirit</span> distinctly and separately as the Divine Agent, but to that Spirit as <span class="ital">united with the human spirit</span>. In this way he thinks the <span class="ital">poss. gen.</span> is in point, and the introduction of the <span class="greekheb">νοός</span> accounted for as the <span class="ital">receptaculum</span> of the <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span>. But, while it is true that it is often difficult to say whether the regenerated mind of man or the Divine Spirit is particularly in view in the Pauline use of <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span>, there seems to be no case in which the NT speaks of the Holy Spirit as <span class="ital">man’s</span> Spirit, or attaches to <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span> in the sense of the Divine Spirit any such defining term as <span class="greekheb">ὑμῶν</span> or <span class="greekheb">τοῦ νοὸς ὑμῶν</span>. Nor can it be said that <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span>, in the sense of the Divine Spirit in union with man’s spirit, has anywhere else any such designation as the one in the text. Nor, again, does the interpretation which turns upon this idea of <span class="ital">union</span> between God’s Spirit and our spirit, and not simply on the <span class="ital">indwelling</span> of the Divine Spirit in us, really account in any satisfactory way for the <span class="greekheb">νοός</span>. It is necessary, therefore, to take <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span> here as = <span class="ital">our</span> spirit, and that as at once distinguished from and related to the <span class="greekheb">νοῦς</span>. The <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span>, then, appears to be the higher faculty in man, the faculty that makes him most akin to God, the organ of his spiritual life and his fellowship with God, under the bondage of sin by nature, but set free from that and made fit for the purposes of the Divine life by the Holy Spirit. The <span class="greekheb">νοῦς</span> (<span class="ital">cf.</span> on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-17.htm" title="This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that you from now on walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind,">Ephesians 4:17</a> above) is the faculty of understanding, feeling, and determining, distinguished by Paul from the <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-14.htm" title="For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prays, but my understanding is unfruitful.">1 Corinthians 14:14</a>), represented as capable of approving the law, but incapable of withstanding the motions of sin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-23.htm" title="But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.">Romans 7:23</a>), and itself the subject or seat of renewal (<span class="greekheb">ἀνακαίνωσις</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-2.htm" title="And be not conformed to this world: but be you transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.">Romans 12:2</a>). Further the regenerate human spirit and the Divine Spirit are described as distinct and yet co-operant (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-16.htm" title="The Spirit itself bears witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God:">Romans 8:16</a>). Here then the <span class="greekheb">πνεύματι</span> must be taken not as the <span class="ital">instrumental</span> dative (for renewal does not take effect by means of our spirit), but as the <span class="ital">dat. of ref.</span>, and the <span class="greekheb">νοός</span> will be the <span class="ital">gen. subj.</span> Thus the sense becomes “renewed in respect of the spirit by which your mind is governed” (Mey.), that is, in respect of the spiritual faculty, the moral personality whose organ is the mind or reason. Some, holding by the interpretation of <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span> as <span class="ital">our</span> spirit, take the <span class="greekheb">νοός</span> to be the gen. of <span class="ital">appos.</span> (<span class="ital">e.g.</span>, August., <span class="ital">de Trin.</span>, xiv., 16, <span class="ital">spiritus quae mens vocatur</span>), or the <span class="ital">part. gen.</span>, = “the governing spirit of your mind” (De Wette). But the above construction is better, and it is the one adopted substantially by the AV and the other old English Versions, the RV, Mey., Haupt, Abb., and most commentators.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[446] Codex Claromontanus (sæc. vi.), a Græco-Latin MS. at Paris, edited by Tischendorf in 1852.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[447] Codex Augiensis (sæc. ix.), a Græco-Latin MS., at Trinity College, Cambridge, edited by Scrivener in 1859. Its Greek text is almost identical with that of G, and it is therefore not cited save where it differs from that MS. Its Latin version, f, presents the Vulgate text with some modifications.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/ephesians/4.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">23</span>. <span class="ital">be renewed</span>] A present infinitive in the Gr. The idea is thus of progress and growth, the antithesis to the “corrupting” just above. The decisive fact of new position in and connexion with Christ was to result, and was resulting, in an ever developed spiritual experience, with its ever new disclosures both of need and of grace.

It is the human spirit, as the substratum, so to speak, of every activity of the “inner man,” and now specially of the activity which sees and grasps truth (“your <span class="ital">mind</span>”). See above, last note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-17.htm" title="This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that you from now on walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind,">Ephesians 4:17</a>.—The Gr. may be rendered “<span class="ital">by</span> the spirit of your mind,” as the instrument, or avenue, used by the Eternal Spirit in the process of renewal. And cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-2.htm" title="And be not conformed to this world: but be you transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.">Romans 12:2</a> for a good parallel. But usage is on the whole in favour of the rendering “in,” in the sense of “with reference to.”<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/ephesians/4.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-23.htm" title="And be renewed in the spirit of your mind;">Ephesians 4:23</a>. <span class="greekheb">Τῷ πνεύματι τοῦ νοὸς</span>, <span class="ital">in the spirit of the mind</span>) <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-14.htm" title="For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prays, but my understanding is unfruitful.">1 Corinthians 14:14</a>.

This renewal is the work of the Holy Spirit; how, then, can it be the subject of an exhortation to us? In this sense, that we are to prize, long for, encourage, watch, this work of the Holy Spirit, feeling it to be most vital and essential, not to be neglected without awful sin and danger. Usually the Holy Spirit works in us by stirring up our spirit to desire and endeavor after holiness; to resist these strivings of the Spirit, or even to be indifferent to them, is a deadly and most dangerous sin. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/ephesians/4.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>In the spirit of your mind (&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;)<p>The spirit is the human spirit, having its seat in and directing the mind. In the New Testament the Holy Spirit is never designated so as that man appears as the subject of the Spirit. We have Spirit of adoption, of holiness, of God, but never Holy Spirit of man. Furthermore, the apostle's object is to set forth the moral self-activity of the christian life. Hence &#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; spirit, is here the higher life-principle in man by which the human reason, viewed on its moral side - the organ of moral thinking and knowing is informed. The renewal takes place, not in the mind, but in the spirit of it. "The change is not in mind psychologically, either in its essence or in its operation; and neither is it in the mind as if it were a superficial change of opinion either on points of doctrine or practice: but it is in the spirit of the mind; in that which gives mind both its bent and its materials of thought. It is not simply in the spirit as if it lay there in dim and mystic quietude; but it is in the spirit of the mind; in the power which, when changed itself, radically alters the entire sphere and business of the inner mechanism" (Eadie). </body></html>
