For St. Paul is simply arguing that the use of the phrase “ascended” from earth to heaven implies a previous corresponding descent, which must be from heaven to earth; exactly as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-13.htm" title="And no man has ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven.">John 3:13</a>, “No man hath ascended into heaven, but He that came down from heaven.” But form and usage of the phrase itself seem to point to the other meaning, which is held by almost all ancient interpreters and most moderns. It agrees with the strong expression of “filling all things,” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-10.htm" title="He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens, that he might fill all things.)">Ephesians 4:10</a>, and is possibly suggested by the leading captive of the powers of hell and death. Though, perhaps, injurious to the strictness of the antithesis, it is quite accordant with St. Paul’s manner to introduce thus a fresh idea beyond the simple idea of descent, which is sufficient for his argument: “He descended—yea, even to the realms below.” For this idea is most apposite to that frequent reference to spiritual powers of evil found in this Epistle, and it may be thought to correspond by antithesis to the “far above all heavens” of the next verse.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:7-16 Unto every believer is given some gift of grace, for their mutual help. All is given as seems best to Christ to bestow upon every one. He received for them, that he might give to them, a large measure of gifts and graces; particularly the gift of the Holy Ghost. Not a mere head knowledge, or bare acknowledging Christ to be the Son of God, but such as brings trust and obedience. There is a fulness in Christ, and a measure of that fulness given in the counsel of God to every believer; but we never come to the perfect measure till we come to heaven. God's children are growing, as long as they are in this world; and the Christian's growth tends to the glory of Christ. The more a man finds himself drawn out to improve in his station, and according to his measure, all that he has received, to the spiritual good of others, he may the more certainly believe that he has the grace of sincere love and charity rooted in his heart.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ephesians/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Now that he ascended - That is, it is affirmed in the Psalm that he "ascended" - "Thou hast ascended on high." This implies that there must have been a previous "descent;" or, as applicable to the Messiah, "it is a truth that he previously descended." It is by no means certain that Paul meant to say that the "word" "ascended" demonstrated that there must have been a previous descent; but he probably means that in the case of Christ there was, "in fact," a descent into the lower parts of the earth first. The language used here will appropriately express his descent to earth.<p>Into the lower parts of the earth - To the lowest state of humiliation. This seems to be the fair meaning of the words. Heaven stands opposed to earth. One is above; the other is beneath. From the one Christ descended to the other; and he came not only to the earth, but he stooped to the most humble condition of humanity here; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-6.htm">Philippians 2:6-8</a>; compare notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-23.htm">Isaiah 44:23</a>. Some have understood this of the grave; others of the region of departed spirits; but these interpretations do not seem to be necessary. It is the "earth itself" that stands in contrast with the heavens; and the idea is, that the Redeemer descended from his lofty eminence in heaven, and became a man of humble rank and condition; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-15.htm">Psalm 139:15</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ephesians/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. Paul reasons that (assuming Him to be God) His ascent implies a previous descent; and that the language of the Psalm can only refer to Christ, who first descended, then ascended. For God the Father does not ascend or descend. Yet the Psalm plainly refers to God (Eph 4:8, 17, 18). It must therefore be God the Son (Joh 6:33, 62). As He declares (Joh 3:13), "No man hath ascended up to heaven, but He that came down from heaven." Others, though they did not previously descend, have ascended; but none save Christ can be referred to in the Psalm as having done so; for it is of God it speaks.<p>lower parts of the earth&#8212;The antithesis or contrast to "far above all heavens," is the argument of Alford and others, to show that this phrase means more than simply the earth, namely, the regions beneath it, even as He ascended not merely to the visible heavens, but "far above" them. Moreover, His design "that He might fill all things" (Eph 4:10, Greek, "the whole universe of things") may imply the same. But see on [2368]Eph 4:10 on those words. Also the leading "captive" of the "captive hand" ("captivity") of satanic powers, may imply that the warfare reached to their habitation itself (Ps 63:9). Christ, as Lord of all, took possession first of the earth the unseen world beneath it (some conjecture that the region of the lost is in the central parts of our globe), then of heaven (Ac 2:27, 28). However, all we surely know is, that His soul at death descended to Hades, that is, underwent the ordinary condition of departed spirits of men. The leading captive of satanic powers here, is not said to be at His descent, but at His ascension; so that no argument can be drawn from it for a descent to the abodes of Satan. Ac 2:27, 28, and Ro 10:7, favor the view of the reference being simply to His descent to Hades.

Solesmense</span>, I. p. 7; Tertullian, Jerome, Pelagius, Ambrosiaster, Erasmus, Estius, Calovius, Bengel, and many others, including Rückert, Olshausen, Delitzsch, Lechler, Ewald, Hoelemann, Bleek; Baur scenting Gnosticism) is therefore the right one,[211] because the object was to present Christ as the One who fills the whole universe, so that, with a view to His entering upon this His all-filling activity, He has previously with His victorious presence passed through the whole world, having descended from heaven into the <span class="ital">utmost depth</span>, and ascended from this depth to the <span class="ital">utmost height</span>—a view, which of necessity had to extend not merely to the earth, but even into the <span class="ital">nether world</span>, just because Christ, as was historically certain for every believer, <span class="ital">had been</span> in the nether world, and consequently, by virtue of His exaltation to the right hand of God, really had the two <span class="ital">utmost</span> limits of the universe, from below upwards, as the <span class="ital">terminos a quo</span> and <span class="ital">ad quem</span> of His triumphal progress. Further, had Paul intended only the descent <span class="ital">to earth</span> (Thomas, Beza, Calvin, Grotius, Hammond, Michaelis, Fischer, <span class="ital">de vitiis Lex. N.T.</span>, and many, including Winer, p. 470 [E.

II. p. 291, Reiche, <span class="ital">Comm. crit.</span> p. 174 f., Beyschlag, <span class="ital">Christol. d. N.T.</span> p. 228), it would not be easy to see why he should not have written merely <span class="greekheb">κατέβη</span>, or at any rate simply <span class="greekheb">κατέβη εἰς τὴν γῆν</span> or <span class="greekheb">κατέβη εἰς τὴν γῆν κάτω</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-19.htm" title="And I will show wonders in heaven above, and signs in the earth beneath; blood, and fire, and vapor of smoke:">Acts 2:19</a>), instead of employing the circumstantial and affected, but yet only feebly paraphrasing expression: <span class="ital">into the lower regions, which are the earth</span> (for so we should have to explain <span class="greekheb">εἰς τὰ κατώτερα τῆς γῆς</span>, understood only of the earth; see Winer, <span class="ital">l.c.</span> [E. T. 666]). This expression is only accounted for, sharp and telling, when it points the reader to a region <span class="ital">lower than the earth</span>, to that <span class="ital">Hades</span>, whither every reader knew that Christ had descended. Doubtless the apostle might have written simply <span class="greekheb">εἰς ᾅδου</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-27.htm" title="Because you will not leave my soul in hell, neither will you suffer your Holy One to see corruption.">Acts 2:27</a>) or <span class="greekheb">ἕως ᾅδου</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-23.htm" title="And you, Capernaum, which are exalted to heaven, shall be brought down to hell: for if the mighty works, which have been done in you, had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.">Matthew 11:23</a>), or also <span class="greekheb">εἰς τὴν ἄβυσσον</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-7.htm" title="Or, Who shall descend into the deep?

The ordinary objection, that, in fact, Christ did not ascend from Hades, but from earth to heaven, is of no effect, because He has in reality returned, arisen and ascended from Hades, consequently Hades was the deepest <span class="ital">terminus a quo</span> of His ascension, as it had previously been the deepest <span class="ital">terminus ad quem</span> of His descent, and on this deepest turning-point all here depended, even apart from the fact that the long interval of forty days between resurrection and ascension is historically very problematic (see Remark subjoined to <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-51.htm" title="And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven.">Luke 24:51</a>). Nearest to our view come Chrysostom, Theodoret, Oecumenius, Bullinger, Drusius, Zachariae, and others, who, however, refer the passage only to the <span class="ital">death</span> and the <span class="ital">burial</span> (comp. also <span class="ital">Erlang.

As in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-3.htm" title="And, behold, certain of the scribes said within themselves, This man blasphemes.">Matthew 9:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-6.htm" title="This parable spoke Jesus to them: but they understood not what things they were which he spoke to them.">John 10:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-17.htm" title="Then said some of his disciples among themselves, What is this that he said to us, A little while, and you shall not see me: and again, a little while, and you shall see me: and, Because I go to the Father?">John 16:17</a>, the <span class="greekheb">τί ἐστιν</span> has the force of—<span class="ital">What does it mean? What is implied in the statement?</span> And the reply given by Paul in <span class="greekheb">ὅτι καὶ κατέβη</span> is that the <span class="ital">ascent</span> presupposes a previous <span class="ital">descent</span>. This of course is not given as an inference of universal application, but as one that holds good in the case in view, and one which gives Paul the warrant to use the quotation as he does. In the Psalm it was Jehovah that ascended, but that was only after He had first descended to earth in behalf of His people from His proper habitation in heaven. And so the Giver of gifts to whom Paul desires to direct his readers was One who had first come down to earth before He ascended. It was the belief of those whom Paul addressed (<span class="ital">cf.</span> the express statement in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-13.htm" title="And no man has ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven.">John 3:13</a>) that Christ’s proper abode was in heaven. That belief is here taken for granted, and the conclusion consequently is drawn that the Giver who ascended is Christ.—<span class="greekheb">εἰς τὰ κατώτερα μέρη τῆς γῆς</span>: <span class="ital">into the lower parts of the earth</span>. The <span class="ital">locality</span> or the <span class="ital">extent</span> of the descent is now defined. The question is whether the locality in view is this world as a scene of existence lower than heaven, or the under world as a deeper depth than earth itself. Does the sentence refer to Christ’s <span class="ital">incarnation</span> and the subjection to which He humbled Himself on earth even unto death? Or does it point to His <span class="ital">descent to Hades?</span> And if the latter is the case, in what aspect and with what particular significance is His visit to the world of the dead presented? On these questions there has been and there continues to be great diversity of opinion. Both interpretations have large support. That the “lower parts of the earth” mean simply earth itself in distinction from heaven is the view of Calv., Grot., Mich., Winer., Harl., Thom., Reiche, de Wette, Hofm., Beyschlag, Schweitzer, Weiss, Pfleid., Bisping, Abb., Haupt and others. That they mean Hades is the view favoured by the Copt. and Eth. Versions, and by such interpreters as Iren., Tertull., Jer., Erasm., Estius, Beng., Rück., Olsh., Del., Bleek, Mey., Alf., Ell. (on the whole), etc. Those who adopt this latter view, however, are not wholly at one. The great majority indeed, especially among Patristic and Lutheran exegetes, understand Paul to affirm that Christ after His death made a manifestation of Himself in triumph to the world of the departed, and fulfilled a certain ministry there. That ministry is understood by some, especially among the Fathers, to have been concerned with the release of the souls of OT saints from the <span class="ital">Limbus Patrim</span>; by others, especially among certain classes of modern commentators, to have been a new proclamation of grace to the whole world of the departed or to certain sections of the dead; <span class="ital">cf.</span> Pearson on the <span class="ital">Creed, sub</span> Art. v.; Salmond’s <span class="ital">Christian Doctrine of Immortality</span>, p. 421, etc. But there are those, especially Calvinistic theologians, who take the writer to mean nothing more, if he refers to Hades at all, than that like other men Christ passed at death into the world of the departed and had experience there of the power of death for a time. Some (<span class="ital">e.g.</span>, Chrys., Theod., Oec.) are of opinion that the phrase points to the <span class="ital">death</span> or the <span class="ital">burial</span> of Christ, but do not press it beyond that. On the other hand, there are those (<span class="ital">e.g.</span>, Von Soden, Abb.) who take the descent to be to <span class="ital">earth</span> and not to Hades, but instead of identifying it with the incarnation regard it as <span class="ital">subsequent</span> to the ascension. What then is the most reasonable interpretation?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[389] Codex Vaticanus (sæc. iv.), published in photographic facsimile in 1889 under the care of the Abbate Cozza-Luzi.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[390] Codex Sinaiticus (sæc. iv.), now at St. Petersburg, published in facsimile type by its discoverer, Tischendorf, in 1862.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[391] Codex Ephraemi (sæc. v.), the Paris palimpsest, edited by Tischendorf in 1843.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[392] Codex Mosquensis (sæc. ix.), edited by Matthæi in 1782.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[393] Codex Angelicus (sæc. ix.), at Rome, collated by Tischendorf and others.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[394] Codex Porphyrianus (sæc. ix.), at St. Petersburg, collated by Tischendorf.

The Latin text, g, is based on the O.L. translation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It must be said in the first place that neither grammar nor textual criticism gives a decisive answer. The <span class="greekheb">τῆς γῆς</span> may be taken equally well as the <span class="ital">appos.</span> gen., = “the lower parts which <span class="ital">are</span> or <span class="ital">make</span> the earth”; the <span class="ital">poss.</span> gen., = “the lower parts <span class="ital">belonging</span> to earth,” Hades being conceived to be part of the earth, but its lower part; or the <span class="ital">comp.</span> gen., = “the parts lower than the earth”. But the <span class="ital">comparative</span> idea is not more pertinent to the one main line of interpretation than to the other. The <span class="greekheb">κατώτερα</span> may mean the parts lower than the earth itself, <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, Hades; but it may also mean the parts lower than heaven, <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, the earth. Nor does the variety in reading affect the sense, though much has been made of it. The word <span class="greekheb">μέρη</span> is inserted after <span class="greekheb">κατώτερα</span> by [401] [402] [403] [404]3[405] [406] [407], Syr.-P., Boh., Vulg., Arm., Chrys., etc. It is omitted by [408]*[409], Goth., Eth., Iren., etc. It must be held, therefore, to belong to the text, but it is not inconsistent with either interpretation. The main arguments in favour of <span class="ital">Hades</span> being in view are these; that if <span class="ital">earth</span> were meant, it is difficult to understand why some simpler form such as <span class="greekheb">εἰς τὴν γῆν</span> or <span class="greekheb">εἰς τὴν γῆν κάτω</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-19.htm" title="And I will show wonders in heaven above, and signs in the earth beneath; blood, and fire, and vapor of smoke:">Acts 2:19</a>) was not chosen; that the use of so singular a phrase as <span class="greekheb">τὰ κατώτερα</span>, which recalls the LXX rendering for <span class="greekheb">תַּחְתִּיּוֹת הָאָרֶץ</span>, one of the OT expressions for the underworld, suggests at once that something lower than earth itself, a yet deeper depth, was intended (Mey.); that the accompanying phrases <span class="greekheb">ὑπεράνω πάντων τῶν οὐρανῶν</span> and <span class="greekheb">ἵνα πληρώσῃ τὰ πάντα</span>, being expressions of largest extension, make it reasonable to give the widest possible sense also to the <span class="greekheb">κατώτερα</span>; and that justice is done to the peculiarity and the amplitude of the various expressions only by taking Paul’s idea to be that as Christ rose in order to fill the whole world, He had first to pass in His victorious power through all the great divisions of the universe—heaven above, earth beneath, and even the subterranean world, in the assertion of His universal sovereignty. But there is much to be said on the other side. The superlative formula to, <span class="greekheb">τὰ κατώτατα</span> would have been more in point if the idea to be expressed had been that of a depth than which there was none deeper (Abb.), or that of a descent embracing all the several parts of the universe. In point of fact, too, it is not <span class="greekheb">τὰ κατώτερα</span>, but <span class="greekheb">τὰ κατώτατα</span>, that the LXX employs in reproducing the Hebrew <span class="greekheb">הָאָרֶץ תַּחְתִּיּוֹת</span>. If <span class="ital">Hades</span> had been intended, it is strange that Paul did not select one or other of the more familiar and quite unambiguous phrases which are used elsewhere, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἕως ᾅδου</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-23.htm" title="And you, Capernaum, which are exalted to heaven, shall be brought down to hell: for if the mighty works, which have been done in you, had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.">Matthew 11:23</a>), <span class="greekheb">εἰς ᾅδου</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-27.htm" title="Because you will not leave my soul in hell, neither will you suffer your Holy One to see corruption.">Acts 2:27</a>), or such a formula as <span class="greekheb">εἰς τὴν καρδίαν τῆς γῆς</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-40.htm" title="For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.">Matthew 12:40</a>), <span class="greekheb">εἰς τὴν ἄβυσσον</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-7.htm" title="Or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that is, to bring up Christ again from the dead.)">Romans 10:7</a>). It is also to be considered that, granting it is the <span class="ital">Ascension</span> and not merely the <span class="ital">Resurrection</span> of Christ that is expressed by the <span class="greekheb">ἀνέβη</span>, it was not from Hades, but from earth that He did ascend. Further, the point immediately in view is not any work that Christ did in the world and its several parts, but the identity of the Person who descended, and ascended, and gave gifts. This is made sufficiently clear by the repeated <span class="greekheb">αὐτός</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/4-10.htm" title="He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens, that he might fill all things.)...">Ephesians 4:10-11</a>), and the idea of a Hades-visit or a Hades-ministry has no obvious relation to that. The great paragraph in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/philippians/2-5.htm" title="Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:...">Php 2:5-10</a>, which is in some sense a parallel, has also to be taken into account. There again the whole statement turns upon the two great ideas of the incarnation with the humiliation involved in it and the exaltation, and nothing is said about any visit of Christ to the underworld. Here, too, the whole idea of a descent to Hades appears to be foreign to the thought. It is not suggested by the passage in the Psalm; for there is not a word about Sheol in it. Neither is there any indication of it in the context in the Epistle. For there the bestowal of gifts is referred not to Christ’s descent, but to His ascension, and no hint is given of any work done by Him in Hades with a view to that bestowal, or of any relation in which the world of the dead stands to His prerogative of <span class="ital">giving</span>. For these reasons we conclude that the phrase <span class="greekheb">τὰ κατώτερα μέρη τῆς γῆς</span> means the <span class="ital">earth</span> as a scene of existence, lower than His native heavens, to which Christ descended.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[401] Codex Vaticanus (sæc. iv.), published in photographic facsimile in 1889 under the care of the Abbate Cozza-Luzi.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[402] Codex Sinaiticus (sæc. iv.), now at St. Petersburg, published in facsimile type by its discoverer, Tischendorf, in 1862.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[403] Codex Ephraemi (sæc. v.), the Paris palimpsest, edited by Tischendorf in 1843.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[404] Codex Claromontanus (sæc. vi.), a Græco-Latin MS. at Paris, edited by Tischendorf in 1852.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[405] Codex Mosquensis (sæc. ix.), edited by Matthæi in 1782.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[406] Codex Angelicus (sæc. ix.), at Rome, collated by Tischendorf and others.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[407] Codex Porphyrianus (sæc. ix.), at St. Petersburg, collated by Tischendorf.

It implies a previous descent, from the seat of royalty. And, in the light of the Fulfilment, this implied descent was ‘to the lower parts of the earth.’ ” The Apostle does not mean that the Psalm teaches anything special about the Descent, but that it implies <span class="ital">a</span> Descent, and that what that Descent was, Christians know. And the interest of the implied reference is, its supernatural correspondence in outline to Gospel facts; its imagery being of One who has <span class="ital">left His throne</span> and now returns upward.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">first</span>] Evidence is divided as to the right of this word to a place in the text. It is obviously, at worst, explanatory of the sense.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the lower parts of the earth</span>] Does this mean “the lower regions, even the earth,” as distinct from heaven? Or, “the lower regions of the earth,” i.e. the region underground, the grave and its world? Our great theologian and critical scholar, Bp Pearson (<span class="ital">Exposition of the Creed</span>, Art. V.), inclines to the former view, with a reference to the Incarnation only. The phrase, so taken, may perhaps be illustrated by <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-23.htm" title="Sing, O you heavens; for the LORD has done it: shout, you lower parts of the earth: break forth into singing, you mountains, O forest, and every tree therein: for the LORD has redeemed Jacob, and glorified himself in Israel.">Isaiah 44:23</a>; where, however, “lower parts of the earth” (LXX. “foundations of the earth”) may be contrasted with “mountains.” (Cp. also, perhaps, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-15.htm" title="My substance was not hid from you, when I was made in secret, and curiously worked in the lowest parts of the earth.">Psalm 139:15</a>.) On the other hand <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/63-9.htm" title="But those that seek my soul, to destroy it, shall go into the lower parts of the earth.">Psalm 63:9</a> is distinctly in favour of a reference to “the grave.” Our judgment is on the whole for the second view, with a reference to the Death and Burial of the Incarnate Lord. Such a reference seems better to <span class="ital">balance</span>, in a sense, the phrase just below, “far <span class="ital">above all heavens</span>”; it falls in better with the amplitude of the words, “that He might fill all things” (cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-9.htm" title="For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living.">Romans 14:9</a>); and it is in the manner of the N. T. to connect the <span class="ital">Resurrection</span> and Ascension as parts of one great whole. And the Lord’s Death is so profoundly concerned with the procurement of blessings to His Church that an allusion to it is <span class="ital">à priori</span> likely here.—Many of the Fathers (see Pearson’s notes under Art. V. of the Creed) take this passage to refer to a definite work done by the Lord in the under-world, a deliverance of the spirits of the Old Testament saints from a “Limbus” there. But certainly the words here <span class="ital">teach</span> nothing of the kind; only that He who suffered for us entered the state of disembodied souls, “the Grave,” “Sheol,” “Hades.” The mysterious passage <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_peter/3-18.htm" title="For Christ also has once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:...">1 Peter 3:18-19</a>, will at once occur in the question. But upon it we can only say here that it is too isolated, and involves too many problems of interpretation, to allow any great and <span class="ital">peculiar</span> article of belief to be built upon it; and, upon any view, its only <span class="ital">explicit</span> reference is to the generation of the Flood. See again Pearson. And for a different view from his, stated with great ability and insight, see Note II. to <span class="ital">The Unsafe Anchor</span>, by the Rev. C. F. Childe.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/ephesians/4.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-9.htm" title="(Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth?">Ephesians 4:9</a>. <span class="greekheb">Τὸ δὲ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀνέβη</span>, <span class="ital">Now this</span> fact, namely, <span class="ital">that He ascended</span>) Paul proves that the language of the psalm is to be referred to Christ; and the ascension is inferred from the descent; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-13.htm" title="And no man has ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven.">John 3:13</a>.

This was the climax of Christ's humiliation; to be removed out of men's sight, as too offensive for them to look on - to be hidden away in the depths of the earth, in the grave, was indeed supremely humbling. The object is to show that, in bestowing gifts on men, Christ did not merely bring into play his inherent bountifulness as the Son of God, but acted as Mediator, by right of special purchase, through his work of humiliation on earth; and thus to lead us to think the more highly both of the Giver and of his gifts. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/ephesians/4.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Now that He ascended<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-9.htm">Ephesians 4:9</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-10.htm">Ephesians 4:10</a> are parenthetical, showing what the ascension of Christ presupposes.
