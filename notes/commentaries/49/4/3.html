By lowliness, understand humility, which is opposed to pride. By meekness, that excellent disposition of soul, which makes men unwilling to provoke, and not easily to be provoked or offended. We find much in ourselves for which we can hardly forgive ourselves; therefore we must not be surprised if we find in others that which we think it hard to forgive. There is one Christ in whom all believers hope, and one heaven they are all hoping for; therefore they should be of one heart. They had all one faith, as to its object, Author, nature, and power. They all believed the same as to the great truths of religion; they had all been admitted into the church by one baptism, with water, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, as the sign of regeneration. In all believers God the Father dwells, as in his holy temple, by his Spirit and special grace.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ephesians/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The unity of the Spirit - A united spirit, or oneness of spirit. This does not refer to the fact that there is one Holy Spirit; but it refers to unity of affection, of confidence, of love. It means that Christians should be united in temper and affection, and not be split up into factions and parties. It may be implied here, as is undoubtedly true, that such a unity would be produced only by the Holy Spirit; and that, as there was but one Spirit which had acted on their hearts to renew them, they ought to evince the same feelings and views. There was occasion among the Ephesians for this exhortation; for they were composed of Jews and Gentiles, and there might be danger of divisions and strifes, as there had been in other churches. There is "always" occasion for such an exhortation; for:<p>(1) "unity" of feeling is eminently desirable to honor the gospel (see the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-21.htm">John 17:21</a>); and,<p>(2) there is always danger of discord where people are brought together in one society. There are so many different tastes and habits; there is such a variety of intellect and feeling; the modes of education have been so various, and the temperament may be so different, that there is constant danger of division. Hence, the subject is so often dwelt on in the Scriptures (see the notes on <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2.htm">1 Corinthians 2</a>ff), and hence, there is so much need of caution and of care in the churches.<p>In the bond of peace - This was to be by the cultivation of that peaceful temper which binds all together. The American Indians usually spoke of peace as a "chain of friendship" which was to be kept bright, The meaning here is, that they should be bound or united together in the sentiments and affections of peace. It is not mere "external" unity; it is not a mere unity of creed; it is not a mere unity in the forms of public worship; it is such as the Holy Spirit produces in the hearts of Christians, when it fills them all with the same love, and joy, and peace in believing. The following verses contain the reasons for this. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ephesians/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2, 3. lowliness&#8212;In classic Greek, the meaning is meanness of spirit: the Gospel has elevated the word to express a Christian grace, namely, the esteeming of ourselves small, inasmuch as we are so; the thinking truly, and because truly, therefore lowlily, of ourselves [Trench].<p>meekness&#8212;that spirit in which we accept God's dealings with us without disputing and resisting; and also the accepting patiently of the injuries done us by men, out of the thought that they are permitted by God for the chastening and purifying of His people (2Sa 16:11; compare Ga 6:1; 2Ti 2:25; Tit 3:2). It is only the lowly, humble heart that is also meek (Col 3:12). As "lowliness and meekness" answer to "forbearing one another in love" (compare "love," Eph 4:15, 16), so "long-suffering" answers to (Eph 4:4) "endeavoring (Greek, 'earnestly' or 'zealously giving diligence') to keep (maintain) the unity of the Spirit (the unity between men of different tempers, which flows from the presence of the Spirit, who is Himself 'one,' Eph 4:4) in (united in) the bond of peace" (the "bond" by which "peace" is maintained, namely, "love," Col 3:14, 15 [Bengel]; or, "peace" itself is the "bond" meant, uniting the members of the Church [Alford]).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ephesians/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The unity of the Spirit; </span> either unity of mind, or spiritual unity, as being wrought by the Spirit, and then he means that unity he spoke of, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/2-14.htm" title="For he is our peace, who has made both one, and has broken down the middle wall of partition between us;...">Ephesians 2:14-16</a></span>, and <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-6.htm" title="That the Gentiles should be fellow heirs, and of the same body, and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel:">Ephesians 3:6</a></span>, whereby is intended the mystical body of Christ. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">In the bond of peace; </span> i.e. in peace as the bond which keeps the members or parts of the church together, which by dissensions are dissipated and scattered. The first step to this unity is humility, for where that is not, there will be no meekness nor forbearance, without which unity cannot be maintained. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/ephesians/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit,.... That is, a spiritual union: there is an union between God and his people, and between Christ and his members, and between saints and saints, and the bond of each union is love; and that it is which knits and cements them together; and it is the last of these which is here intended: the saints are united under one head, and are members of one and the same body, and should be of the same mind and judgment, and of one accord, heart, and affection: and this may be called "the unity of the Spirit"; because it is an union of spirits, of the spirits or souls of men; and that in spiritual affairs, in the spiritual exercises of religion; and it is effected by the Spirit of God, by whom they are baptized into one body. Now to endeavour or study to keep and preserve this, supposes that this union does already exist; that it is very valuable, as making much for the glory of God, the mutual comfort and delight of saints, and is worth taking some pains about; and that it is very difficult to secure, there being so many things which frequently arise, and break in upon it, through the devices of Satan, and the corruptions of men's hearts: but though it is difficult, and may sometimes seem to be impossible, yet it becomes the saints to be diligent in the use of means to keep it up, and continue it; and which they may be said to endeavour after, when they abide with one another, and do not forsake each other upon every occasion; when they perform all offices of love to one another, and stir up each other to the like: and the way and manner in which this is to be kept, is <p>in the bond of peace: the Arabic version reads, "by the bond of love and peace": by maintaining peace among themselves, and seeking those things which tend to, and make for peace, and spiritual edification; and which is called a bond, in allusion to the Greek word used, which comes from one that signifies to knit, join, and bind together, and because it is of a knitting and uniting nature. Now so to act is to walk worthy of calling grace, or agreeably to it: peace is what the saints are called unto in the effectual calling: and what is suitable to God, who is the God of peace; and to Christ, who is the Prince of peace; and to the Holy Spirit, whose fruit is peace; and to the Gospel, which is the Gospel of peace; and to the character which the saints bear, which is that of sons of peace. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/ephesians/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{3}</span> Endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.</span><p>(3) Thirdly he requires perfect agreement, but yet such that is joined with the band of the Holy Spirit.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/ephesians/4.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-3.htm" title="Endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.">Ephesians 4:3</a>.

Expositors would not have sought for another explanation, had they not taken <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span> as instrumental, in which case the difficulty obtruded itself, that the unity of the Spirit is not preserved by means of peace, but peace by means of the unity of the Spirit.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>That, moreover, no inference may be drawn from <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-3.htm" title="Endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.">Ephesians 4:3</a> as to divisions prevailing in the church, Bengel has already rightly observed: “etiam ubi nulla fissura est, monitis opus est.” And particularly was such exhortation natural for the apostle, even in the absence of special occasion, considering the many saddening experiences which he had met with elsewhere on this point!<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[199] What de Wette observes in opposition to this view—that the peacefulness, to which the readers are exhorted, is to preserve the unity of the Spirit by the fact that it holds all enveloped with the bond of peace—is not sufficient; since this peacefulness, which encircles all with the bond of peace, at any rate <span class="ital">presupposes</span> the unity of the Spirit.

Further description of the mutual forbearance in respect of the <span class="ital">inward effort</span> required, but introducing also the larger, fundamental idea of <span class="ital">unity</span>. <span class="greekheb">σπουδάζω</span>, which conveys the idea of <span class="ital">exertion</span>, is better rendered “giving diligence” (RV) or “earnestly striving” (Alf.), than “endeavouring” (AV). <span class="greekheb">τηρεῖν</span> = <span class="ital">keep</span>, in the sense of maintaining with watchful care; suggesting also that what is to be <span class="ital">kept</span> is something already in our possession. <span class="greekheb">τοῦ Πνεύματος</span> is the gen. of <span class="ital">originating cause</span>, = the unity which the Spirit produces or works, and here the oneness in feeling, interest and purpose which is appropriate to the oneness in doctrine and privilege whereof the readers are immediately reminded. Commentators, even of the rank of Calvin, have interpreted the <span class="greekheb">πνεύματος</span> here as the <span class="ital">human spirit</span>, the Christian spirit of concord; while others (De Wette, etc.) have taken it to denote the spirit of the Christian community. But the <span class="greekheb">ἓν Πνεῦμα</span> of the following verse, the general NT doctrine of the Spirit of God as operating in the believer and in the Church (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-22.htm" title="In whom you also are built together for an habitation of God through the Spirit.">Ephesians 2:22</a>), and the analogy of such passages as <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-13.htm" title="For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.">1 Corinthians 12:13</a>, point clearly to the Holy Spirit.—<span class="greekheb">ἐν τῷ συνδέσμῳ τῆς εἰρήνης</span>: <span class="ital">in the bond of peace</span>. This is not to be attached to the next verse (Lach.), a connection which would again disturb the symmetry of the participial sentences and rob some of the statements which follow of their appropriateness. It defines the way in which the unity is to be kept. The <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span> is not the <span class="ital">instrumental</span> <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span>, = “by means of the bond of peace”; but, as in <span class="greekheb">ἐν ἀγάπῃ</span>, the <span class="ital">local</span> <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span> or that of <span class="ital">relation</span> specifying the <span class="ital">sphere</span> (Ell.), or the <span class="ital">ethical relation</span> (Mey.) in which the unity is to be maintained. The <span class="greekheb">εἰρήνης</span> might be the <span class="ital">gen. obj.</span>, = “the bond by which peace is kept,” to wit, <span class="ital">love</span> (Beng., etc.). But it is best understood as the gen. of <span class="ital">apposition</span> (Mey.), or <span class="ital">identity</span> (Ell.), = “the bond which <span class="ital">is</span> peace”. The unity, therefore, which is wrought among these Ephesians by the Spirit of God will be theirs in so far as they make peace the relation which they maintain one to another, or the bond in which they walk together. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-14.htm" title=" And above all these things put on charity, which is the bond of perfection.">Colossians 3:14</a> <span class="ital">love</span> is the “bond of perfectness”; but the construction and the idea are different here.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/ephesians/4.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">3</span>. <span class="ital">endeavouring</span>] R.
