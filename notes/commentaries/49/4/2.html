It is, indeed, a word new coined in Christian terminology, and even the root from which it comes is mostly used by the heathen moralists in a bad sense (of meanness and slavishness), of which there is still a trace in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-18.htm" title=" Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels, intruding into those things which he has not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,">Colossians 2:18</a>. “Meekness” is mostly “gentleness”—“the meek and quiet spirit” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-4.htm" title="But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.">1Peter 3:4</a>)—the natural, though not the invariable, fruit of humility, winning souls by its very absence of bitter self-assertion, and so “inheriting the earth.” “Longsuffering” is the manifestation of such meekness, with something of especial effort and struggle, in the bearing of injury.<p>(2, 3) <span class= "bld">Forbearing one another in love</span> <span class= "bld">. . .</span>—The word rendered “endeavouring” is, in the original, a word expressing “earnestness” of thought and exertion to secure a thing not lightly obtained. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_timothy/4-9.htm" title="Do your diligence to come shortly to me:">2Timothy 4:9-21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-11.htm" title="Let us labor therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.">Hebrews 4:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-10.htm" title="Why the rather, brothers, give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if you do these things, you shall never fall:">2Peter 1:10</a>.) It shows that St. Paul here passes from the negative aspects of love, summed up in forbearance, to the more positive and energetic enthusiasm for unity and peace. Love is in both aspects, the “uniting bond” of peace. In the parallel passage of <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-14.htm" title=" And above all these things put on charity, which is the bond of perfection.">Colossians 3:14</a>, it is “put on over” all else, and is the uniting “bond of perfectness.” In the celebrated thirteenth chapter of the First Epistle to Corinthians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/4-4.htm" title="There is one body, and one Spirit, even as you are called in one hope of your calling;">Ephesians 4:4-7</a>) it is made to include “long-suffering” and “kindness,” and all forms of humility and gentleness. But, if it be real, it must necessarily pass into active energy; if it is to win the final beatitude of “blessing to the peacemakers,” it must “labour for peace,” and “follow after the things which make for peace” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/120-7.htm" title="I am for peace: but when I speak, they are for war.">Psalm 120:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-19.htm" title="Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things with which one may edify another.">Romans 14:19</a>).<p><span class= "bld">The unity of the Spirit</span> is certainly the unity given by the indwelling of the Holy Ghost. This we cannot create, for it is the gift of God; but we can “keep” it: that is, cherish it, guard it, and make it effectual by love; and all experience proves that, if we would so keep it, we need the positive earnestness of exertion against evils without and within.<p>-2<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/4-7.htm" title="But to every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ.">Ephesians 4:7-11</a> pass from the unity of the Church to the diversity of graces and offices in its members, all being gifts of the ascended Lord, and results of that universal mediation which fills all things.<p>(2) From this general description of the regeneration of the soul out of the death of sin, in the Lord Jesus Christ, St. Paul now passes on to deal with special moral duties (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/4-25.htm" title="Why putting away lying, speak every man truth with his neighbor: for we are members one of another.">Ephesians 4:25-30</a>)—the casting out of falsehood, wrath, dishonesty, and impurity, which are the four typical sins forbidden in the four general Commandments of the Second Table—the Ninth, the Sixth, the Eighth, and the Seventh. But he treats all with a marked and striking peculiarity of treatment—in relation to the great principle of unity in Christ, rather than in relation to a man’s own nature or his individual responsibility to God. In this treatment he shows the vivid practical application of the characteristic doctrine of this Epistle.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/ephesians/4.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/4-2.htm" title="With all lowliness and meekness, with long-suffering, forbearing one another in love;...">Ephesians 4:2-3</a></span>. <span class="ital">With all lowliness </span>— Or humility of mind, having mean thoughts of yourselves because of your former sinfulness and guilt, depravity, weakness, and misery, and your unworthiness of that mercy which God hath exercised toward you; <span class="ital">and meekness </span>— Maintaining calmness, serenity, and peace of mind, amid the infirmities and indiscretions of your Christian friends, and even amid the affronts and injuries of your enemies; <span class="ital">with long-suffering </span>— Toward all men, whether saints or sinners, always possessing your souls in patience, and whatever provocations you receive, never seeking revenge, or yielding to resentment or ill-will toward any. <span class="ital">Forbearing </span>— Greek, <span class="greekheb">ανεχομενοι</span>, <span class="ital">bearing with; one another in love </span>— That is, out of a principle of love to God, your fellow-Christians, and all men; <span class="ital">endeavouring, </span>so far as in you lies, <span class="ital">to keep the unity of the Spirit </span>— That mutual union, concord, and harmony, which is the fruit of the Spirit; <span class="ital">in the bond of peace </span>— In a peaceable, kind, and affectionate disposition toward one another.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:1-6 Nothing is pressed more earnestly in the Scriptures, than to walk as becomes those called to Christ's kingdom and glory. By lowliness, understand humility, which is opposed to pride. By meekness, that excellent disposition of soul, which makes men unwilling to provoke, and not easily to be provoked or offended. We find much in ourselves for which we can hardly forgive ourselves; therefore we must not be surprised if we find in others that which we think it hard to forgive. There is one Christ in whom all believers hope, and one heaven they are all hoping for; therefore they should be of one heart. They had all one faith, as to its object, Author, nature, and power. They all believed the same as to the great truths of religion; they had all been admitted into the church by one baptism, with water, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, as the sign of regeneration. In all believers God the Father dwells, as in his holy temple, by his Spirit and special grace.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ephesians/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>With all lowliness - Humility; see the notes on <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/20-19.htm">Acts 20:19</a>, where the same Greek word is used; compare also the following places, where the same Greek word occurs: <a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-3.htm">Philippians 2:3</a>, "in lowliness of mind, let each esteem other better than themselves;" <a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/2-18.htm">Colossians 2:18</a>, "in a voluntary humility;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-23.htm">Colossians 2:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-12.htm">Colossians 3:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-5.htm">1 Peter 5:5</a>. The word does not elsewhere occur in the New Testament. The idea is, that humility of mind becomes those who are "called" <a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-1.htm">Ephesians 4:1</a>, and that we walk worthy of that calling when we evince it.<p>And meekness - see the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-5.htm">Matthew 5:5</a>. Meekness relates to the manner in which we receive injuries. We are to bear them patiently, and not to retaliate, or seek revenge. The meaning here is, that; we adorn the gospel when we show its power in enabling us to bear injuries without anger or a desire of revenge, or with a mild and forgiving spirit; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-1.htm">2 Corinthians 10:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-23.htm">Galatians 5:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-1.htm">Galatians 6:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-25.htm">2 Timothy 2:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-2.htm">Titus 3:2</a>; where the same Greek word occurs.<p>With longsuffering, ... - Bearing patiently with the foibles, faults, and infirmities of others; see the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-4.htm">1 Corinthians 13:4</a>. The virtue here required is that which is to be manifested in our manner of receiving the provocations which we meet with from our brethren. No virtue, perhaps, is more frequently demanded in our contact with others. We do not go far with any fellow-traveler on the journey of life, before we find there is great occasion for its exercise. He has a temperament different from our own. He may be sanguine, or choleric, or melancholy; while we may be just the reverse. He has peculiarities of taste, and habits, and disposition, which differ much from ours. He has his own plans and purposes of life, and his own way and time of doing things. He may be naturally irritable, or he may have been so trained that his modes of speech and conduct differ much from ours. Neighbors have occasion to remark this in their neighbors; friends in their friends; kindred in their kindred; one church-member in another.<p>A husband and wife - such is the imperfection of human nature - can find enough in each other to embitter life, if they choose to magnify imperfections, and to become irritated at trifles; and there is no friendship that may not be marred in this way, if we will allow it. Hence, if we would have life move on smoothly, we must learn to bear and forbear. We must indulge the friend that we love in the little peculiarities of saying and doing things which may be important to him, but which may be of little moment to us. Like children, we must suffer each one to build his play-house in his own way, and not quarrel with him because he does not think our way the best. All usefulness, and all comfort, may be prevented by an unkind, a sour, a crabbed temper of mind - a mind that can bear with no difference of opinion or temperament. A spirit of fault-finding; an unsatisfied temper; a constant irritability; little inequalities in the look, the temper, or the manner; a brow cloudy and dissatisfied - your husband or your wife cannot tell why - will more than neutralize all the good you can do, and render life anything but a blessing.<p>It is in such gentle and quiet virtues as meekness and forbearance, that the happiness and usefulness of life consist, far more than in brilliant eloquence, in splendid talent, or illustrious deeds, that shall send the name to future times. It is the bubbling spring which flows gently; the little rivulet which glides through the meadow, and which runs along day and night by the farmhouse, that is useful, rather than the swollen flood or the roaring cataract. Niagara excites our wonder; and we stand amazed at the power and greatness of God there, as he "pours it from his hollow hand." But one Niagara is enough for a continent or a world; while that same world needs thousands and tens of thousands of silver fountains, and gently flowing rivulets, that shall water every farm, and every meadow, and every garden, and that shall flow on, every day and every night, with their gentle and quiet beauty. So with the acts of our lives. It is not by great deeds only, like those of Howard - not by great sufferings only, like those of the martyrs - that good is to be done; it is by the daily and quiet virtues of life - the Christian temper, the meek forbearance, the spirit of forgiveness in the husband, the wife, the father, the mother, the brother, the sister, the friend, the neighbor - that good is to be done; and in this all may be useful. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ephesians/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2, 3. lowliness&#8212;In classic Greek, the meaning is meanness of spirit: the Gospel has elevated the word to express a Christian grace, namely, the esteeming of ourselves small, inasmuch as we are so; the thinking truly, and because truly, therefore lowlily, of ourselves [Trench].<p>meekness&#8212;that spirit in which we accept God's dealings with us without disputing and resisting; and also the accepting patiently of the injuries done us by men, out of the thought that they are permitted by God for the chastening and purifying of His people (2Sa 16:11; compare Ga 6:1; 2Ti 2:25; Tit 3:2). It is only the lowly, humble heart that is also meek (Col 3:12). As "lowliness and meekness" answer to "forbearing one another in love" (compare "love," Eph 4:15, 16), so "long-suffering" answers to (Eph 4:4) "endeavoring (Greek, 'earnestly' or 'zealously giving diligence') to keep (maintain) the unity of the Spirit (the unity between men of different tempers, which flows from the presence of the Spirit, who is Himself 'one,' Eph 4:4) in (united in) the bond of peace" (the "bond" by which "peace" is maintained, namely, "love," Col 3:14, 15 [Bengel]; or, "peace" itself is the "bond" meant, uniting the members of the Church [Alford]).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ephesians/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">With all lowliness, </span> or humility; submissiveness of mind, whereby we esteem others better than ourselves, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-3.htm" title="Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves.">Philippians 2:3</a></span>.

Lachmann, Holzhausen, and Olshausen attach it to <span class="greekheb">σπουδάζοντες</span>. The reason given by Olshausen, that, as the <span class="greekheb">μακροθ</span>. is only a form of expression of love, <span class="greekheb">ἐν ἀγάπῃ</span> could not belong to what precedes, would be set aside, even if it were in itself valid, by the correct separation of <span class="greekheb">μετὰ μακροθ</span>. from <span class="greekheb">ἀνεχόμ</span>. And <span class="greekheb">ἀνεχόμ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἀλλήλ</span>., taken <span class="ital">alone</span>, renders the discourse simply abrupt. How harmonious is the structure, when both participial clauses begin with the participle and close with the definitions attached by <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span>, in which definitions there is opened up the whole ethical domain (<span class="ital">love</span> and <span class="ital">peace</span>) to which the before-named special virtues belong (1 Corinthians 13)!<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/ephesians/4.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-2.htm" title="With all lowliness and meekness, with long-suffering, forbearing one another in love;">Ephesians 4:2</a>. <span class="greekheb">μετὰ πάσης ταπεινοφροσύνης καὶ πρᾳότητος</span>: <span class="ital">with all lowliness and meekness</span>.

Krüger (<span class="ital">Sprachl.</span>, § 68, 13, 1) puts the distinction thus—“<span class="greekheb">σύν τινι</span> denotes rather <span class="ital">coherence</span>, <span class="greekheb">μετά τινος</span> rather <span class="ital">coexistence</span>” (<span class="ital">cf.</span> Win.-Moult., pp. 470, 488). As in the case of <span class="greekheb">πᾶσα σοφία</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-8.htm" title="Wherein he has abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence;">Ephesians 1:8</a>), <span class="greekheb">πᾶσα ταπεινοφροσύνη</span> can mean only “all lowliness,” “all <span class="ital">possible</span> lowliness,” or “<span class="ital">every kind</span> of lowliness,” not <span class="ital">summa humilitas</span>. The word <span class="greekheb">ταπεινοφροσύνη</span> is of very rare occurrence in non-biblical Greek, and when it does occur it has the sense of <span class="ital">pusillanimity</span> (Epictet., Diss., 3, 24, 56; Joseph., <span class="ital">Jewish Wars</span>, iv., 9, 2). It is not used in the OT; but in the NT it denotes one of the <span class="ital">passive</span> graces, unrecognised or repudiated in Græco-Roman ethics, which Christianity has glorified—the lowliness of mind which springs from a true estimate of ourselves—a deep sense of our own moral smallness and demerit (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-19.htm" title="Serving the LORD with all humility of mind, and with many tears, and temptations, which befell me by the lying in wait of the Jews:">Acts 20:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-3.htm" title="Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves.">Php 2:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-12.htm" title=" Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, long-suffering;">Colossians 3:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-5.htm" title="Likewise, you younger, submit yourselves to the elder.

T. Greek</span>, p. 26 (who regards the form <span class="greekheb">πρᾷος</span> as apparently “unknown to the language of the NT”); and Blass, <span class="ital">Gram. of N. T. Greek</span>, p. 7 (who thinks there is not sufficient evidence to decide between <span class="greekheb">πραότης</span> and <span class="greekheb">πρᾳότης</span>). It means more than <span class="ital">modestia</span> (Vulg.), <span class="ital">mansuetudo</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀταραξία</span>, <span class="ital">gentleness</span>, or <span class="ital">equanimity</span>, inasmuch as it has regard to our attitude towards God as well as towards men, and includes more than outward behaviour or natural disposition. It is a grace of the Spirit, the disposition of loving submissiveness in the first place to God and His dealings with us, and, as the consequence of that, of quiet restraint, mildness and patient abnegation of self in face of the provocations of others. It is a moral quality, therefore, with a far wider scope, a larger significance, a deeper and more vital relation to character than was thought of by the philosophers and moralists of the old world, who regarded it only as the opposite of <span class="greekheb">ἀγριότης</span>, <span class="ital">savageness</span> (Plato, <span class="ital">Symp.</span>, 197 <span class="ital">d</span>), <span class="greekheb">χαλεπότης</span>, <span class="ital">harshness</span> (Arist., <span class="ital">Hist.

This is best taken as an independent clause, which is developed in the following sentence. Some (Theod., Beng., etc.) attach both the <span class="greekheb">μετὰ πάσης ταπ</span>., etc., and the <span class="greekheb">μετὰ μακρ</span>. to the <span class="greekheb">ἀνεχόμενοι</span> clause. But this gives one long sentence, which obscures the transition from idea to idea and makes the several clauses less distinctive. Others (Calv., Harl., Rück., Ols., etc.) attach the <span class="greekheb">μετὰμακρ</span>. to <span class="greekheb">ἀνεχόμενοι</span>; but to make it part of that clause takes from the point of the <span class="greekheb">μακροθυμία</span> and disturbs the balance of the clauses, in which we have first the general idea of worthiness of walk, then certain particulars involved in that, and then the further explanation (in the <span class="greekheb">ἀνεχόμενοι</span> clause) of these various particulars or of the one last noticed. The term <span class="greekheb">μακροθυμία</span> means both <span class="ital">endurance</span> or <span class="ital">constancy</span> in presence of illness and trouble (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-11.htm" title=" Strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, to all patience and long-suffering with joyfulness;">Colossians 1:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-10.htm" title="But you have fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, long-suffering, charity, patience,">2 Timothy 3:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-12.htm" title="That you be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises.">Hebrews 6:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-10.htm" title="Take, my brothers, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of the Lord, for an example of suffering affliction, and of patience.">Jam 5:10</a>), and, as here (<span class="ital">cf.</span> also <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-4.htm" title="Or despise you the riches of his goodness and forbearance and long-suffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leads you to repentance?">Romans 2:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-2.htm" title="That I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart.">Romans 9:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-6.htm" title="By pureness, by knowledge, by long-suffering, by kindness, by the Holy Ghost, by love unfeigned,">2 Corinthians 6:6</a>, etc.), the abnegation of revenge in presence of wrong—the opposite of <span class="greekheb">ὀργή</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-32.htm" title="He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; and he that rules his spirit than he that takes a city.">Proverbs 16:32</a>), <span class="greekheb">ὀξοθυμία</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-19.htm" title="Why, my beloved brothers, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:">Jam 1:19</a>), etc., and akin to <span class="greekheb">ὑπομονή</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-4.htm" title="But in all things approving ourselves as the ministers of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses,">2 Corinthians 6:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-6.htm" title="By pureness, by knowledge, by long-suffering, by kindness, by the Holy Ghost, by love unfeigned,">2 Corinthians 6:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-11.htm" title=" Strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, to all patience and long-suffering with joyfulness;">Colossians 1:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-10.htm" title="But you have fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, long-suffering, charity, patience,">2 Timothy 3:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/james/5-10.htm" title="Take, my brothers, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of the Lord, for an example of suffering affliction, and of patience....">Jam 5:10-11</a>). The word belongs to later Greek (Plut., Macc., etc.), and the LXX; but in neither has it the exact sense it gets in the NT.—<span class="greekheb">ἀνεχόμενοι ἀλλήλων ἐν ἀγάπῃ</span>: <span class="ital">forbearing one another in love</span>. Explanation and application of the <span class="greekheb">μακροθυμία</span>.

To attach <span class="greekheb">ἐν ἀγάπῃ</span> (Orig., Lachm., Olsh., etc.) to the following <span class="greekheb">σπουδάζοντες</span> is to make the <span class="greekheb">ἀνεχόμενοι</span> abrupt and bare, and to disturb the harmonious form of the participial sentences. The duty of mutual forbearance is to be practised <span class="ital">in love</span>. It was to be a <span class="ital">loving</span> forbearance—a forbearance having its motive, its inspiration, its life, in love.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/ephesians/4.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">2</span>. <span class="ital">with all lowliness</span>] So, exactly, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-19.htm" title="Serving the LORD with all humility of mind, and with many tears, and temptations, which befell me by the lying in wait of the Jews:">Acts 20:19</a>, in St Paul’s review of his own “walk” <span class="ital">at Ephesus</span>; “serving the Lord <span class="ital">with all lowliness</span>.”—“<span class="ital">With</span>”<span class="ital">:</span>—the idea is strictly of accompaniment, attendance. But in view of actual N. T. usage of the preposition this must not be pressed. Lowliness was to <span class="ital">characterize</span> them.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Observe the moral lesson here. The first and most characteristic effect of the heights and depths of Divine privilege and spiritual experience just unfolded is to be the sincerest and most unselfish <span class="ital">humility</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">lowliness</span>] The Gr. word imports an unaffected lowly estimate of self. See Trench’s <span class="ital">Synonyms of the N. T.</span>, under <span class="greekheb">ταπεινοφροσύνη</span>, <span class="greekheb">πραότης</span>. It is a distinctively Christian grace, viewed as a thing always to be sought and cherished. Pagan ethics, at best, just recognized it as right where necessary, but not as good and happy <span class="ital">per se</span>. The Gospel puts its obligation and its blessedness on the same footing for <span class="ital">all</span> believers, as all absolutely dependent for all true good upon the mercy of Another.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The corresponding adjective is used (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-29.htm" title="Take my yoke on you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and you shall find rest to your souls.">Matthew 11:29</a>) by our Lord of Himself. Trench remarks that we have Him there recognizing His entire dependence as Man on the Father. Not moral defect but “creatureliness,” he says, is the thought there. “In His human nature He must be the pattern of all … creaturely dependence.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Observe the force of the phrase; “<span class="ital">all</span> lowliness.” The grace was to have the most unreserved scope and exercise.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">meekness</span>] See Trench again, as just above. The Gr. word imports gentle and entire submission under trial, whatever the trial be, in the consciousness that no other attitude can be right for self. Meekness thus rests “on deeper foundations than its own, namely on those which lowliness has laid for it, and it can only continue while it continues to rest on these.” In this respect “it is a grace in advance of lowliness” (Trench).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">longsuffering</span>] Grouped with “meekness,” <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-22.htm" title="But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,">Galatians 5:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-12.htm" title=" Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, long-suffering;">Colossians 3:12</a>.
