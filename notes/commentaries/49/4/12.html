The preposition (<span class= "ital">eis</span>) used in the two latter clauses (which should be <span class= "ital">unto work of ministration, unto edification of the body of Christ</span>) properly signifies “contact with a thing,” and the preposition (<span class= "ital">pros</span>) used in the first clause, “direction towards a thing.” The two are often apparently interchanged; but in close juxtaposition here can hardly be intended to be identical or exactly parallel; and, if distinction is to be drawn, the former must signify immediate consequence, and the other the remoter object to which such immediate consequence is designed to minister. The construction would be greatly simplified, if inversion of the first two clauses could be allowed. For it would then run, “unto work of ministration with a view to perfecting of saints, unto building up of the body of Christ;” and so would plainly represent the two-fold operation of the ministry: first, its work in its various offices for the perfecting of individual souls; and next, its general direction to the building up of the whole body. But whether this construction be grammatically possible or not, this appears to be in any case the general sense of the passage.<p><span class= "bld">The perfecting of the saints.</span>—The word rendered “perfecting” (akin to the “perfection” of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-9.htm" title="For we are glad, when we are weak, and you are strong: and this also we wish, even your perfection.">2Corinthians 13:9</a>) is derived from a root which signifies either to “mend” what is broken (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-21.htm" title="And going on from there, he saw other two brothers, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a ship with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called them.">Matthew 4:21</a>), or to “complete” what is unfinished (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-40.htm" title="The disciple is not above his master: but every one that is perfect shall be as his master.">Luke 6:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-22.htm" title="What if God, willing to show his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much long-suffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction:">Romans 9:22</a>); and hence is used spiritually for to “restore” the fallen (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-1.htm" title="Brothers, if a man be overtaken in a fault, you which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering yourself, lest you also be tempted.">Galatians 6:1</a>), or to “perfect” the imperfect Christian (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-21.htm" title="Make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is well pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.">Hebrews 13:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-10.htm" title="Night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face, and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith?">1Thessalonians 3:10</a>). Both processes are necessarily implied in that perfection of the individual saints here spoken of, and more fully described in the next verses.<p><span class= "bld">The edifying of the body of Christ.</span>—This is that part of the work of the ministry (as in preaching and ministering in public worship) which tells upon the Church or congregation as a whole. It is here represented as subsequent, perhaps as subordinate, to the individual pastoral dealing with souls. But each has his own gift. Some ministries are more blessed to the individual perfecting of the saints; others to the building up of the whole Church.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/ephesians/4.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/4-12.htm" title="For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ:...">Ephesians 4:12-13</a></span>. <span class="ital">For the perfecting </span>— <span class="greekheb">Προς τον καταρτισμον των αγιων</span>; <span class="ital">in order to, </span>or, for the sake of; <span class="ital">completing of the saints </span>— Both in number, and in the various branches of true Christianity, namely, in the knowledge of all Christian doctrines, the possession of all Christian graces, the enjoyment of all Christian privileges, the performance of all Christian duties.

All is given as seems best to Christ to bestow upon every one. He received for them, that he might give to them, a large measure of gifts and graces; particularly the gift of the Holy Ghost. Not a mere head knowledge, or bare acknowledging Christ to be the Son of God, but such as brings trust and obedience. There is a fulness in Christ, and a measure of that fulness given in the counsel of God to every believer; but we never come to the perfect measure till we come to heaven. God's children are growing, as long as they are in this world; and the Christian's growth tends to the glory of Christ. The more a man finds himself drawn out to improve in his station, and according to his measure, all that he has received, to the spiritual good of others, he may the more certainly believe that he has the grace of sincere love and charity rooted in his heart.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ephesians/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For the perfecting of the saints - On the meaning of the word rendered here as "perfecting" - &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd;  katartismon - see the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-9.htm">2 Corinthians 13:9</a>. It properly refers to "the restoring of anything to its place;" then putting in order, making complete, etc. Here it means that these various officers were appointed in order that everything in the church might be well arranged, or put into its proper place; or that the church might be "complete." It is that Christians may have every possible advantage for becoming complete in love, and knowledge, and order.<p>For the work of the ministry - All these are engaged in the work of the ministry, though in different departments. Together they constituted the "ministry" by which Christ meant to establish and edify the church. All these offices had an existence at that time, and all were proper; though it is clear that they were not all designed to be permanent. The apostolic office was of course to cease with the death of those who were "the witnesses" of the life and doctrines of Jesus (compare notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-1.htm">1 Corinthians 9:1</a>); the office of "prophets" was to cease with the cessation of inspiration; and in like manner it is possible that the office of teacher or evangelist might be suspended, as circumstances might demand. But is it not clear from this that Christ did not appoint "merely" three orders of clergy to be permanent in the church? Here are "five" orders enumerated, and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-28.htm">1 Corinthians 12:28</a>, there are "eight" mentioned; and how can it be demonstrated that the Saviour intended that there should be "three" only, and that they should be permanent? The presumption is rather that he meant that there should be but one permanent order of ministers, though the departments of their labor might be varied according to circumstances, and though there might be helpers, as occasion should demand. In founding churches among the pagan, and in instructing and governing them there, there is need of reviving nearly all the offices of teacher, helper, evangelist, etc., which Paul has enumerated as actually existing in his time.<p>For the edifying - For building it up; that is, in the knowledge of the truth and in piety; see the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-19.htm">Romans 14:19</a>.<p>The body of Christ - The Church; see the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-23.htm">Ephesians 1:23</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ephesians/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12.

Observe, withal, the expression of <span class="ital">perfection:</span> <span class="greekheb">καταρτ</span>., and the expression of <span class="ital">development:</span> <span class="greekheb">οἰκοδομή</span>. Many others, including de Wette, have made the two clauses with <span class="greekheb">εἰς</span> dependent on <span class="greekheb">καταρτισμόν</span>, so that the sense would be: “for the qualifying of believers that they may in each and every way themselves labour for the advancement and edification of the church,” Meier; comp. Flatt, Schott, Rückert, Schenkel, and others, as already Erasmus. But (<span class="ital">a</span>) <span class="greekheb">διακονία</span>, where the context is speaking of those engaged in the service of the church, always denotes the <span class="ital">official</span> service (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-13.htm" title="For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify my office:">Romans 11:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-1.htm" title="Therefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we faint not;">2 Corinthians 4:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-3.htm" title="Giving no offense in any thing, that the ministry be not blamed:">2 Corinthians 6:3</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-4.htm" title="But we will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the ministry of the word.">Acts 6:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-7.htm" title="But if the ministration of death, written and engraved in stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not steadfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which glory was to be done away:">2 Corinthians 3:7</a> ff; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-12.htm" title="For the administration of this service not only supplies the want of the saints, but is abundant also by many thanksgivings to God;">2 Corinthians 9:12</a>, <span class="ital">al.</span>), and hence may not here be transmuted into the general notion of <span class="ital">rendering service to, furthering</span> (see especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-10.htm" title="As every man has received the gift, even so minister the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.">1 Peter 4:10</a>).

(<span class="ital">b</span>) But if he had merely meant to say: “to make the individual Christians jointly and severally meet for co-operating to the furtherance of the church” (Rückert), then <span class="greekheb">πάντων</span> would have been to <span class="greekheb">τῶν ἁγίων</span> an <span class="ital">essential</span> element, which could not have been left out. Olshausen regards the two clauses introduced by <span class="greekheb">εἰς</span> as a partition of the <span class="greekheb">καταρτισμὸς τῶν ἁγίων</span>: “for the perfecting of the saints, and that, on the one hand, of those furnished with gifts of teaching for the fulfilment of the teacher’s office; on the other hand, as regards the hearers, for the edifying of the church.” Incorrectly, seeing that <span class="greekheb">οἱ ἅγιοι</span> are the <span class="ital">objects</span> of the teaching labours mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-11.htm" title="And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;">Ephesians 4:11</a> and consequently cannot include the teachers themselves, and seeing, moreover, that the <span class="greekheb">οἰκοδομὴ τοῦ σώμ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τοῦ Χρ</span>. most appropriately describes the working of the <span class="ital">teacher</span>, so that no reader could, especially after <span class="greekheb">εἰς ἔργ</span>. <span class="greekheb">διακ</span>., conjecture that <span class="greekheb">εἰς οἰκοδ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. was to apply to the <span class="ital">hearers</span>, inasmuch as no one could read the “on the one hand” and the “on the other” between the lines.

The expression <span class="greekheb">οἰκοδομὴ τοῦ σώματος</span> is a blending of two figures, both of which were, from what precedes, present in the conception of the apostle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-23.htm" title="Which is his body, the fullness of him that fills all in all.">Ephesians 1:23</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-20.htm" title="And are built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone;">Ephesians 2:20</a> ff., <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-6.htm" title="That the Gentiles should be fellow heirs, and of the same body, and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel:">Ephesians 3:6</a>),—the church as the <span class="ital">body</span> of Christ and as an <span class="ital">edifice.</span> Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-16.htm" title="From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplies, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, makes increase of the body to the edifying of itself in love.">Ephesians 4:16</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[216] If the three elements were parallel, Paul must logically have thus arranged them: (1) <span class="greekheb">εἰς ἔργον διακονίας</span>, (2) <span class="greekheb">πρὸς τὸν καταρτισμὸν τῶν ἁγίων</span>, (3) <span class="greekheb">εἰς οἰκοδομὴν τοῦ σώματος τοῦ Χριστοῦ</span>,—advancing from the less definite to the more definite.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[217] Grotius: “ut sanctis ministrent eos perficiendo magis et magis … ut ad eum modum illi quoque sancti apti fiant aedificandae ecclesiae, i.e. docendis aliis.” Michaelis: “that they should be able ministers of His church, in order that the saints might become more perfect, and His church, which is His body, might attain its due magnitude.” Koppe: “<span class="greekheb">ἔδωκε εἰς ἔργον διακονίας</span> (<span class="greekheb">εἰς τὸ διακονεῖν τοῖς ἁγίοις</span>) <span class="greekheb">πρὸς τὸ καταρτίζειν αὐτούς</span>,”—and <span class="greekheb">εἰς οἰκοδ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., is supposed to belong again to <span class="greekheb">ἔδωκε</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[218] With strange inappropriateness, Pelagius and Vatablus have referred the <span class="greekheb">καταρτισμός</span> to the <span class="ital">number</span> of the Christians: “ad complendum numerum electorum.”<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/ephesians/4.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-12.htm" title="For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ:">Ephesians 4:12</a>. <span class="greekheb">πρὸς τὸν καταρτισμὸν τῶν ἁγίων</span>: <span class="ital">with a view to the full equipment of the saints</span>. The object with which Christ gave some men as Apostles, and some as prophets, etc., is now stated in a sentence consisting of three clauses. The precise construction and meaning of these clauses are by no means easy to determine. The main difficulty is the relation in which they stand to each other and to the preceding <span class="greekheb">ἔδωκε</span>. What that relation is will be best seen when the several terms have been examined. The sentence begins with <span class="greekheb">πρός</span>, but the two clauses which follow are introduced each by <span class="greekheb">εἰς</span>. Little can be made, however, of that. The nice distinctions of the classical period were not maintained in later Greek; and, while Paul’s use of prepositions is for the most part remarkably precise, it is his habit to vary them, without any obvious difference in sense. Especially is this his way with those of kindred meaning and followed by the same case: <span class="ital">cf.</span> <span class="greekheb">εἰς</span> and <span class="greekheb">πρός</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-25.htm" title="Whom God has set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;">Romans 3:25</a>, and see Win.-Moult., pp. 512, 513. The noun <span class="greekheb">καταρτισμός</span> occurs only here in the NT; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-9.htm" title="For we are glad, when we are weak, and you are strong: and this also we wish, even your perfection.">2 Corinthians 13:9</a> we have <span class="greekheb">κατάρτισις</span>. The verb <span class="greekheb">καταρτίζω</span> which is found more frequently and expresses the general idea of making <span class="greekheb">ἄρτιος</span>, <span class="ital">fit, complete</span>, is used in the sense of <span class="ital">repairing</span> literally (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-21.htm" title="And going on from there, he saw other two brothers, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a ship with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called them.">Matthew 4:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/1-19.htm" title="And when he had gone a little farther there, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the ship mending their nets.">Mark 1:19</a>), <span class="ital">restoring</span> in a spiritual or disciplinary sense (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-1.htm" title="Brothers, if a man be overtaken in a fault, you which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering yourself, lest you also be tempted.">Galatians 6:1</a>), <span class="ital">perfecting</span> or <span class="ital">making perfect</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-16.htm" title="And said to him, Hear you what these say?

The noun, therefore, may well have the meaning of <span class="ital">equipment</span> here.—<span class="greekheb">εἰς ἔργον διακονίας</span>: <span class="ital">for the work of ministration</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἔργον</span> has the simple sense of <span class="ital">business</span>—the work done in ministration. <span class="greekheb">διακονίας</span> is taken by most in the specific sense of <span class="ital">ministerial</span> service, service of an <span class="ital">official</span> kind in the Church. But, while this is a very frequent use (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-17.htm" title="For he was numbered with us, and had obtained part of this ministry.">Acts 1:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-25.htm" title="That he may take part of this ministry and apostleship, from which Judas by transgression fell, that he might go to his own place.">Acts 1:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-24.htm" title="But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear to myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God.">Acts 20:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-19.htm" title="And when he had saluted them, he declared particularly what things God had worked among the Gentiles by his ministry.">Acts 21:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-13.htm" title="For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify my office:">Romans 11:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-7.htm" title="Or ministry, let us wait on our ministering: or he that teaches, on teaching;">Romans 12:7</a>, etc.), the word has also the more general sense of <span class="ital">service</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-14.htm" title="Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation?">Hebrews 1:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-11.htm" title="Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with you: for he is profitable to me for the ministry.">2 Timothy 4:11</a>). Its cognates <span class="greekheb">διακονέω</span>, <span class="greekheb">διάκονος</span> have also the same sense (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-28.htm" title="Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered to, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.">Matthew 20:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-45.htm" title="For even the Son of man came not to be ministered to, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.">Mark 10:45</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-26.htm" title="If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will my Father honor.">John 12:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-22.htm" title="So he sent into Macedonia two of them that ministered to him, Timotheus and Erastus; but he himself stayed in Asia for a season.">Acts 19:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-13.htm" title="Whom I would have retained with me, that in your stead he might have ministered to me in the bonds of the gospel:">Philemon 1:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-25.htm" title=" Whereof I am made a minister, according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you, to fulfill the word of God;">Colossians 1:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-4.htm" title="But in all things approving ourselves as the ministers of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses,">2 Corinthians 6:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-15.htm" title="Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.">2 Corinthians 11:15</a>, etc.). It is quite legitimate, therefore, to give the noun here the non-official sense, if the contest points to that. This also is in harmony with the <span class="ital">anarthrous</span> <span class="greekheb">διακονίας</span>.—<span class="greekheb">εἰς οἰκοδομὴν τοῦ σώματος τοῦ Χριστοῦ</span>: <span class="ital">for the building up of the body of Christ. Cf.</span> <span class="greekheb">πρὸς οἰκοδομήν</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-29.htm" title="Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace to the hearers.">Ephesians 4:29</a>, and <span class="greekheb">πρὸς οἰκοδομὴν τῆς ἐκκλησίας</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-12.htm" title="Even so you, for as much as you are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek that you may excel to the edifying of the church.">1 Corinthians 14:12</a>. The two figures of the Church as a <span class="ital">building</span> and a <span class="ital">body</span> are combined here. But in what relation do these clauses stand to each other and to the <span class="greekheb">ἔδωκε</span>? This is very differently put. Some take them to be three <span class="ital">parallel</span> or <span class="ital">coordinate</span> clauses dependent on <span class="greekheb">ἔδωκε</span>, as if = “Christ gave some as Apostles, and some as prophets, etc., with a view to these three things—the perfecting of the saints <span class="ital">and</span> the work of the ministry, <span class="ital">and</span> the edifying of the body of Christ. So substantially Chrys., Theophy., Oec., Calv., Beng., Klöp., etc., and the AV. To this it is objected that the <span class="greekheb">εἰς ἔργον διακονίας</span> would occupy an awkward position, and that the natural order would have been <span class="greekheb">εἰς ἔργον διακονίας</span>, <span class="greekheb">πρὸς καταρτισμὸν</span>, etc. With this sense of maladjustment of the clauses some (Grot., etc.) have even supposed a trajection. Others (Lachm., Harl., Tisch., Bleek, Hofm., Mey., Von Soden, Ell., Alf., Abb., etc.) take the second and third clauses, each introduced by <span class="greekheb">εἰς</span>, to be parallel to each other, and directly dependent on the <span class="greekheb">ἔδωκε</span>. They thus express the <span class="ital">immediate</span> object, while <span class="greekheb">πρὸς καταρτισμὸν κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. denotes the <span class="ital">ultimate</span> end; as if = “Christ, with a view to the full, final perfecting of the saints, gave Apostles, prophets, etc. for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ”. But this gives a somewhat awkward and involved construction, and reduces the force of the third clause, which would naturally be expected to bring us to the larger, ultimate purpose of Christ’s giving. Olshausen modifies this interpretation to the effect of taking the second and third clauses as subdivisions of the first, = “Christ gave Apostles, etc., for the perfecting of the saints, on the one hand for the fulfilment of the teacher’s office, and on the other hand, as regards the hearers, for edification”. But no such distinction is in view here between <span class="ital">teachers</span> and <span class="ital">hearers</span>, the subjects being the <span class="greekheb">ἅγιοι</span> generally. None of these adjustments of the clauses quite meets the case. The proper construction, recognised so far by Erasm., Luther, De Wette, Rückert, Weiss, and more recently accepted by Haupt, is the simplest. It takes the sentence to be dependent as a whole on the <span class="greekheb">ἔδωκε</span>, and understands the three clauses as successive, the first looking to the second, the second to the third, the third forming the climax and expressing the ultimate object of the giving on the part of the ascended Christ. Thus the sense becomes—“Christ gave some men as Apostles, some as prophets, etc., with a view to the full equipment of the saints for the work of ministration or service they have each to do in order to the building up of the body of Christ”. The building up of the Church—that is the great aim and final object; to that every believer has his contribution to make; and to qualify all for this is the purpose of Christ in giving “Apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors and teachers”. In this way each clause fits in naturally with the next, and the ultimate object is expressed last. This, too, is the only construction which does justice to the <span class="greekheb">ἑνὶ δὲ ἑκάστῳ</span> at the beginning of the statement (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-7.htm" title="But to every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ.">Ephesians 4:7</a>) and the <span class="greekheb">ἑνὸς ἑκάστου</span> at its close. These are the terms which convey the ruling idea, <span class="ital">viz.</span>, that each member gets the gift of grace, and each has his part to do towards that upbuilding of the Church which is the great object of Christ’s bestowments; and these Apostles, prophets, etc., are the means provided by Christ whereby all the members shall be made capable of performing their several parts in order that at last the whole Church may be built up in its completeness as the body of Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/ephesians/4.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">12</span>. <span class="ital">for the perfecting of the saints</span>, &c.] More lit., <span class="bld">with a view to the equipment of the saints for [their] work of service</span>.

The idea is of mending a breach, completing a connexion, putting the dislocated in order.—The practical suggestion here is most important. The Divine gift of a Christian Ministry is to have its effect above all things in the fitting of “the saints” (true believers in general) for active “service” for the common Lord. Government, preaching, teaching, is to bear upon this. Nothing will be a more lawful result of a Divine ministerial commission than energetic efforts for Christ and His cause on the part of private Christians. These efforts, on the other hand, will never be made (in the true ideal of Christian work) in neglect or contempt of the ordered ministry.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">for the edifying of the body</span>] A special aspect of the “work of service” just mentioned. Each true believer is, by the spiritually enabled ministry, to be “equipped” to act as a “builder up” of the Lord’s Body (on which see above, on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-4.htm" title="There is one body, and one Spirit, even as you are called in one hope of your calling;">Ephesians 4:4</a>); to gather in new “living stones,” new “members,” by holy influence of word and work; and to compact and consolidate the cohesion.
