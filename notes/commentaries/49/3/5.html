The phrase “the sons of men” (except that it is once used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-28.htm" title="Truly I say to you, All sins shall be forgiven to the sons of men, and blasphemies with which soever they shall blaspheme:">Mark 3:28</a>) is peculiar to the Old Testament, where it is of frequent use in the poetical books, and it is notable that in Ezekiel it is the name by which the prophet himself is constantly addressed. Hence, although it is probably wrong to restrict to the children of Israel, or to the prophets, words which by their very nature apply to all mankind, yet the phrase seems to be used with a suggestion of the contrast between the old dispensation and the new. (Comp. our Lord’s words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-11.htm" title="Truly I say to you, Among them that are born of women there has not risen a greater than John the Baptist: notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.">Matthew 11:11</a>, “Among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist: notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.”)<p><span class= "bld">As it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit.</span>—The application of the epithet “holy” to the Apostles has been thought strange as coming from one of their number; and it is worth notice that this exceptional application is certainly more appropriate to the comparatively impersonal style of an encyclical epistle. But the epithet (applied to the Old Testament prophets in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-70.htm" title="As he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets, which have been since the world began:">Luke 1:70</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-21.htm" title="Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God has spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began.">Acts 3:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-2.htm" title="That you may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Savior:">2Peter 3:2</a>), like the frequent use of it as the substantive “saints,” in application to all Christians, refers not to personal character, but to official call and privilege. In this passage it is clear that it is used thus, in emphatic contrast with “the sons of men” above, and in connection with the following words, “in the Spirit.” The contrast here briefly conveyed is the same which is drawn out in 1 Corinthians 2 between the “wisdom of men,” and the “wisdom of God,” sanctifying, and so enlightening, the Christian soul.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:1-7 For having preached the doctrine of truth, the apostle was a prisoner, but a prisoner of Jesus Christ; the object of special protection and care, while thus suffering for him. All the gracious offers of the gospel, and the joyful tidings it contains, come from the rich grace of God; it is the great means by which the Spirit works grace in the souls of men. The mystery, is that secret, hidden purpose of salvation through Christ. This was not so fully and clearly shown in the ages before Christ, as unto the prophets of the New Testament. This was the great truth made known to the apostle, that God would call the Gentiles to salvation by faith in Christ. An effectual working of Divine power attends the gifts of Divine grace. As God appointed Paul to the office, so he qualified him for it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ephesians/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Which in other ages - The great purposes of God in regard to the salvation of mankind were not revealed; see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-25.htm">Romans 16:25</a>.<p>And prophets - Those who exercised the office of a prophet or inspired teacher in the Christian church; see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-1.htm">1 Corinthians 12:1</a>.<p>By the Spirit - This proves that those who exercised the office of prophet in the Christian church were inspired. They were persons endowed in this manner for the purpose of imparting to the newly formed churches the doctrines of the Christian system. There is no evidence that this was designed to be a permanent order of people in the church. They were necessary for settling the church on a permanent basis, in the absence of a full written revelation, and when the apostles were away. When the volume of revelation was finished, and the doctrines of the gospel were fully understood, the functions of the office ceased. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ephesians/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. in other ages&#8212;Greek, "generations."<p>not made known&#8212;He does not say, "has not been revealed."

But they did not know it with the same explicit distinctness "As" it has been now known (Ac 10:19, 20; 11:18-21). They probably did not know that the Gentiles were to be admitted without circumcision or that they were to be on a level with the Jews in partaking of the grace of God. The gift of "the Spirit" in its fulness was reserved for the New Testament that Christ might thereby be glorified. The epithet, "holy," marks the special consecration of the New Testament "prophets" (who are here meant) by the Spirit, compared with which even the Old Testament prophets were but "sons of men" (Eze 2:3, and elsewhere).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ephesians/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Which in other ages; </span> in the times before Christ’s coming in the flesh. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Was not made known unto the sons of men:</span> that the Gentiles should be called was formerly known and foretold, but not as since, viz. as to the time and manner of it, and the means whereby it should be effected. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Prophets; </span> New Testament prophets, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-11.htm" title="And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;">Ephesians 4:11</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-6.htm" title="Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith;">Romans 12:6</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-1.htm" title="Follow after charity, and desire spiritual gifts, but rather that you may prophesy.">1 Corinthians 14:1</a>,3</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">By the Spirit; </span> either by the Spirit’s being poured out on the Gentiles, it was known that they should be co-heirs with the believing Jews; or rather, by the Spirit instructing the apostles and prophets, and immediately acquainting them with this mystery. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/ephesians/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Which in other ages was not made known unto, the sons of men,.... That is, which mystery of Christ, and of the Gospel, was not made known to men in general, nor so clearly as under the Gospel dispensation. Some hints were given of it to Adam, immediately after his fall; and the Gospel was before preached to Abraham, Moses, and David, and others knew something of it; and it was still more fully dispensed in the times of the prophet Isaiah, and other following prophets: but then the knowledge of it was not so extensive, nor so clear as now; it lay hid in types and shadows, in obscure prophecies and short hints. Moreover, this may have respect particularly to the calling of the Gentiles, as appears from the following words; this was, in some measure, made known, as that in Christ all the nations of the earth should be blessed; that when Shiloh came, to him should the gathering of the people be; that the Messiah should be an ensign of the people, and to him should the Gentiles seek; that he should be the covenant of the people, and a leader and a commander of them; and that there should be great flockings to him; but then this was not known to many, and the time, mode, and circumstances of it were but little understood, and comparatively speaking, it was not known: however, it was not so known, <p>as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the spirit. The apostles and prophets were the superior officers in the Gospel dispensation; the former design the twelve apostles of Christ, and the latter such who had the gift of interpreting the prophecies of the Old Testament, and of foretelling things to come, having received gifts from Christ to fit them for such offices, some apostles, some prophets; and to these a revelation was made of the mystery of the Gospel in general, and of the calling of the Gentiles in particular, by the Spirit, who searches the deep things of God, and reveals them, and leads into all truth; and who, by falling upon the Gentiles, as upon Cornelius and his family, and by the success which he gave to the Gospel in the Gentile world, made their calling clear and manifest.

The <span class="greekheb">νῦν</span> = “now,” <span class="ital">in these Christian times</span>, and the aor. <span class="greekheb">ἀπεκαλύφθη</span> defines the fuller revelation as made definitely at a former period in these times. The verb also has its proper force, as distinguished from the <span class="greekheb">ἐγνωρίσθη</span> and as describing the way, <span class="ital">viz.</span>, by <span class="ital">revelation</span>, that the truth was made known. The prophets of the OT dispensation were designated <span class="greekheb">ἅγιοι</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-9.htm" title="And she said to her husband, Behold now, I perceive that this is an holy man of God, which passes by us continually.">2 Kings 4:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-20.htm" title="And, behold, you shall be dumb, and not able to speak, until the day that these things shall be performed, because you believe not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their season.">Luke 1:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-21.htm" title="For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spoke as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.">2 Peter 1:21</a>). Those of these Christian times are in like manner designated <span class="greekheb">ἅγιοι</span>, as men separated and consecrated to the office and distinguished from the mass of the <span class="greekheb">υἱοὶ τῶν ἀνθρώπων</span>. They are further described as <span class="ital">His</span> (<span class="greekheb">αὐτοῦ</span>), <span class="ital">i.e., God’s</span> Apostles and prophets, God being the subject implied in the <span class="greekheb">ἐγνωρίσθη</span> and the <span class="greekheb">ἀπεκαλύφθη</span>. The terms <span class="greekheb">ἀποστόλοις</span> and <span class="greekheb">προφήταις</span> have the same sense here as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-20.htm" title="And are built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone;">Ephesians 2:20</a>, <span class="ital">viz.</span>, the <span class="ital">Christian</span> Apostles and prophets. The clause <span class="greekheb">ἐν Πνεύματι</span> defines the <span class="greekheb">ἀπεκαλύφθη</span>; not the <span class="greekheb">προφήταις</span>, as if = <span class="greekheb">προφῆται θεόπνευστοι</span> (Holzh., Koppe), for the <span class="greekheb">προφῆται</span> need no such definition. As in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-22.htm" title="In whom you also are built together for an habitation of God through the Spirit.">Ephesians 2:22</a> the <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span> here is the Holy Spirit, and the <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span> would most naturally be taken in the same sense as these. Here, however, most understand it as the <span class="ital">instrumental</span> <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span>. It seems to combine the two ideas of <span class="ital">agency</span> and <span class="ital">element</span> or <span class="ital">condition</span>, and describes the revelation as having been made <span class="ital">in and by</span> the Spirit.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[219] Codex Vaticanus (sæc. iv.), published in photographic facsimile in 1889 under the care of the Abbate Cozza-Luzi.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[220] Codex Sinaiticus (sæc. iv.), now at St. Petersburg, published in facsimile type by its discoverer, Tischendorf, in 1862.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[221] Codex Alexandrinus (sæc. v.), at the British Museum, published in photographic facsimile by Sir E.

That it was in <span class="ital">some measure</span> revealed is suggested by the phrase here, “<span class="ital">As</span> it is <span class="ital">now</span> &c.” On the present scale, in the present mode, it was not then revealed; but not therefore quite concealed.

He speaks of their former state in the idiom of the Hebrew language. Moreover, the antithesis of the <span class="ital">apostles and prophets of the New Testament</span> to the sons of men leads to the conclusion, that by this appellation the ancient <span class="ital">prophets</span> are principally intended; for example, Ezekiel, who is often called <span class="greekheb">בן אדם</span>, son of man, and has copiously described the city and house of God, as Paul does in this place.—<span class="greekheb">ἐν Πνεύματι</span>, in the Spirit) the gift of whom was reserved for the New Testament, with a view to the glorifying of Christ.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Which was not made known to the sons of men in other generations.</span> Though not a new purpose, the knowledge of it is new. Abraham, David, and the prophets, however much they knew of Christ and the fullness of blessing in him for all the families of the earth, did not know the full extent of God's grace to the Gentiles - did not know that the middle wall was to be wholly broken down, and all inequality removed. This might seem to throw some doubt on the reality of this doctrine; but it was on purpose that God kept it secret, and those by whom he has now revealed it are worthy of all regard. <span class="cmt_word">As it has now been revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit.</span> It is not revealed to Paul only, although he has got the privilege of announcing it to the Gentiles, but to the whole body of "holy apostles and prophets." The designation, "holy apostles," is rare; it is used here to magnify the office, to show that those whom the Head of the Church had set apart for himself were fit instruments to receive so important a revelation. "Prophets" here are undoubtedly New Testament prophets (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-20.htm">Ephesians 2:20</a>), the contrast being with "sons of men in other generations." Reference may be made to the experience and decree of the Council of Jerusalem, guided by the Holy Spirit (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-28.htm">Acts 15:28</a>). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/ephesians/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Other generations (&#x3b5;&#788;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;)<p>Other and different.
