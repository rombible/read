He asks for spiritual blessings, which are the best blessings. Strength from the Spirit of God in the inner man; strength in the soul; the strength of faith, to serve God, and to do our duty. If the law of Christ is written in our hearts, and the love of Christ is shed abroad there, then Christ dwells there. Where his Spirit dwells, there he dwells. We should desire that good affections may be fixed in us. And how desirable to have a fixed sense of the love of God in Christ to our souls! How powerfully the apostle speaks of the love of Christ! The breadth shows its extent to all nations and ranks; the length, that it continues from everlasting to everlasting; the depth, its saving those who are sunk into the depths of sin and misery; the height, its raising them up to heavenly happiness and glory. Those who receive grace for grace from Christ's fulness, may be said to be filled with the fulness of God. Should not this satisfy man? Must he needs fill himself with a thousand trifles, fancying thereby to complete his happiness?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ephesians/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For this cause - Some suppose that this is a resumption of what he had commenced saying in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-1.htm">Ephesians 3:1</a>, but which had been interrupted by a long parenthesis. So Bloomfield explains it. But it seems to me more probable that he refers to what immediately precedes. "Wherefore, that the great work may be carried on, and that the purposes of these my sufferings may be answered in your benefit and glory, I bow my knees to God, and pray to him."<p>I bow my knees - I pray. The usual, and the proper posture of prayer is to kneel; Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/6-13.htm">2 Chronicles 6:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/6-10.htm">Daniel 6:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-21.htm">Luke 22:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-60.htm">Acts 7:60</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-40.htm">Acts 9:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-26.htm">Acts 20:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-5.htm">Acts 21:5</a>. It is a posture which indicates reverence, and should, therefore, be assumed when we come before God. It has been an unhappy thing that the custom of kneeling in public worship has ever been departed from in the Christian churches.<p>Unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ - To whom, undoubtedly, prayer should ordinarily be addressed. But this does not make it improper to address the Lord Jesus in prayer; see the notes; 7:59-60 on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-24.htm">Acts 1:24</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ephesians/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14.

In the latter sense here; for every <span class="ital">gens</span> in the heavens can only apply to the various <span class="ital">classes of angels</span> (which are called <span class="greekheb">πατριαί</span>, not as though there were propagation among them, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-30.htm" title="For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven.">Matthew 22:30</a>, but because they have God as their Creator and Lord for a Father); as a suitable analogue, however, to the classes of angels, appear on earth not the particular families, but the <span class="ital">nationalities</span>. Rightly Chrysostom and his successors explain the word by <span class="greekheb">γενεαί</span> or <span class="greekheb">γένη</span>. The Vulgate has <span class="ital">paternitas</span>, a sense indicated also by Jerome, Theodoret, and others. Theodoret says: <span class="greekheb">ὃς ἀληθῶς ὑπάρχει πατὴρ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὃς οὐ παρʼ ἄλλου τοῦτο λοβὼν ἔχει</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀλλʼ αὐτὸς τοῖς ἄλλοις μεταδέδωκε τοῦτο</span>. This view (comp. Goth.: “all <span class="ital">fadreinis</span>”) is expressed by Luther (approved in the main by Harless): <span class="ital">Who is the true Father over all that are called children, etc</span>. But <span class="greekheb">πατριά</span> never means <span class="ital">fathership</span> or fatherliness (<span class="greekheb">πατρότης</span>), and what could be the meaning of that. fathership <span class="ital">in heaven?</span>[184] <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠᾶΣΑ</span></span></span>, <span class="ital">every</span>, shows that Paul did not think only of <span class="ital">two</span> <span class="greekheb">πατριαί</span>, the totality of the angels and the totality of men (Calvin, Grotius, Wetstein, Koppe, and others), or of the blessed in heaven and the elect on earth (Calovius, Wolf), but of a <span class="ital">plurality</span>, as well of angelic as of human <span class="greekheb">πατριαί</span>; and to this extent his conception is, as regards the <span class="ital">numerical form</span>, though not as regards the <span class="ital">idea</span> of <span class="greekheb">πατριά</span>, different from that of the Rabbins, according to which the angels (with the Cabbalists, the Sephiroth) are designated as <span class="ital">familia superior</span> (see Wetstein, p. 247 f.; Buxtorf, <span class="ital">Lex. Talm.</span> p. 1753; Schoettgen, <span class="ital">Horae</span>, p. 1237 f.). Some have even explained <span class="greekheb">πᾶσα πατριά</span> as <span class="ital">the whole family</span>, in which case likewise either the <span class="ital">angels and men</span> (Michaelis, Zachariae, Morus, Meier, Olshausen, and earlier expositors), or <span class="ital">the blessed in heaven and Christians on earth</span> (Beza), have been thought of: but this is on the ground of linguistic usage erroneous.

The text does not yield anything else;[185] and if many (Beza, Piscator, Grotius, Wolf, Bengel, Michaelis, Zachariae, Morus, Koppe, and others, including Flatt and Olshausen) have understood the name <span class="ital">children of God</span>, this is purely imported. Others have taken “<span class="ital">nomen pro re</span>” (Zanchius, Menochius, Estius, <span class="ital">et al.</span>), so that <span class="greekheb">ὀνομάζεσθαι</span> would denote <span class="ital">existere.</span> So, too, Rückert, according to whom Paul designs to express the thought that God is called the Father, inasmuch as all that lives in heaven and upon earth has from Him existence and name (<span class="ital">i.e.</span> dignity and peculiarity of nature). Contrary to linguistic usage; <span class="greekheb">εἶναι ὀνομάζεται</span> must at least have been used in that case instead of <span class="greekheb">ὀνομάζεται</span> (comp. Isaeus, <span class="ital">de Menecl. her.</span> 41: <span class="greekheb">τὸν πατέρα</span>, <span class="greekheb">οὗ εἶναι ὠνομάσθην</span>, Plat. <span class="ital">Pol</span>. iv. p. 428 E: <span class="greekheb">ὀνομάζονταί τινες εἶναι</span>). Incorrectly also Holzhausen: <span class="greekheb">ὀνομάζειν</span> means <span class="ital">to call into existence</span>. Reiche takes <span class="greekheb">ἐξ οὗ ὀνομάζεται</span> (<span class="ital">of whom it bears the name</span>) as the expression of the highest <span class="ital">dominion</span> and of the befitting <span class="ital">reverence</span> due, and refers <span class="greekheb">πᾶσα πατριὰ ἐν οὐρ</span>. <span class="ital">to the pairings of the Aeons</span>.

See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-4.htm" title="And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judaea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem; (because he was of the house and lineage of David:)">Luke 2:4</a>.

Nor is it to be objected, with Reiche, that the human <span class="greekheb">πατριά</span> bears the name not from God, but from the human ancestor. This <span class="ital">historical</span> relation remains entirely unaffected by the <span class="ital">higher</span> thought, that they are called <span class="greekheb">πατριά</span> from the universal, heavenly Father.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>REMARK 1.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In <span class="greekheb">ἐξ οὗ</span> … <span class="greekheb">ὀνομάζεται</span> God is certainly characterized as <span class="ital">universal Father, as Father of all angel-classes in heaven and all peoples upon earth</span>. Comp. Luther’s gloss: “All angels, all Christians, yea, all men, are God’s children, for He created them all.” But it is not at all meant by the apostle in the bare sense of creation, nor in the rationalistic conception of the all-fatherhood, when he says that every <span class="greekheb">πατριά</span> derives this name <span class="greekheb">ἐκ Θεοῦ</span>, as from its father; but in the higher spiritual sense of the divine Fatherhood and the sonship of God. He thinks, in connection with the <span class="greekheb">ἐξ οὗ</span>, of a higher <span class="greekheb">πατρόθεν</span> than that of the mere creation. For <span class="greekheb">πατριαί</span>, so termed from God as their <span class="greekheb">πατήρ</span>, are not merely all the communities of <span class="ital">angels</span>, since these were indeed <span class="greekheb">υἱοὶ Θεοῦ</span> from the beginning, and have not fallen from this <span class="greekheb">υἱότης</span>; but also all nationalities among <span class="ital">men</span>, inasmuch as not only the Jews, but also all Gentile nations, have obtained part in the Christian <span class="greekheb">υἱοθεσία</span>, and the latter are <span class="greekheb">συγκληρονόμα καὶ σύσσωμα καὶ συμμέτοχα τῆς ἐπαγγελίας ἐν τῷ Χριστῷ</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-6.htm" title="That the Gentiles should be fellow heirs, and of the same body, and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel:">Ephesians 3:6</a>). If this has not yet become completely realized, it has at any rate already been so partially, while Paul writes; and in God’s counsel it stands ideally as an accomplished fact. <span class="ital">On that account</span> Paul says with reason also of <span class="ital">every</span> nationality upon earth, that it bears the name <span class="greekheb">πατριά</span>, because God is its Father. Without cause, therefore, Harless has taken offence at the notion of the All-fatherhood, which is here withal clearly though ideally expressed, and given to the passage a limitation to which the all-embracing mode of expression is entirely opposed: “whose name every child [<span class="ital">i.e.</span> every <span class="ital">true</span> child] in heaven and upon earth bears.” Consequently, as though Paul had written something like: <span class="greekheb">ἐξ οὗ πᾶσα ἀληθινὴ πατριὰ κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. With a like imported limitation Erasmus, <span class="ital">Paraphr</span>.: “omnis cognatio <span class="ital">spiritualis</span>, qua conglutinantur sive angeli in coelis, sive <span class="ital">fideles</span> in terris.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>REMARK 2.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>With the non-genuineness of <span class="greekheb">τοῦ κυρίου ἡμῶν Ι</span>. <span class="greekheb">Χ</span>. (see the critical remarks) falls also the possibility of referring <span class="greekheb">ἐξ οὗ</span> to <span class="ital">Christ</span> (Beza, although with hesitation, Calvin, Zanchius, Hammond, Cramer, Reiche, and others). But if those words were genuine (de Wette, among others, defends them), <span class="greekheb">ἐξ οὗ</span> would still apply to <span class="ital">God</span>, because <span class="greekheb">ἐξ οὗ κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. characterizes the <span class="ital">fatherly</span> relation, and <span class="greekheb">ἵνα δῷ κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. applies to the Father.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Lastly, <span class="ital">polemic</span> references, whether in opposition to the <span class="ital">particularism of the Jews</span> (Chrysostom, Calvin, Zanchius, and others), or even in opposition to “scholam <span class="ital">Simonis</span>, qui plura principia velut plures Deos introducebat” (Estius), or in opposition to the <span class="ital">worship of angels</span> (Michaelis), or in opposition to the Gnostic doctrine of Syzygies (Reiche), are to be utterly dismissed, because arbitrary in themselves and inappropriate to the character and contents of the prayer before us.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/ephesians/3.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/3-14.htm" title="For this cause I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,...">Ephesians 3:14-19</a>.

The “permanent habitation of God” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-22.htm" title="In whom you also are built together for an habitation of God through the Spirit.">Ephesians 2:22</a>) is still in the Apostle’s mind, but in another aspect. The thought of the eternal totality, the Church glorified, gives place in a measure to that of the present individuality, the saint’s experience now and here of the consciously welcomed “permanent habitation of Christ in the heart,” with all its spiritual concomitants. The two aspects are complements of each other. Each “living Stone” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-5.htm" title="You also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.">1 Peter 2:5</a>) is, as it were, a miniature of the living Temple. In each of them, as if it were an integral microcosm, yet with a view not to itself only but to the final harmony of the whole, Christ works, manifests Himself, and dwells. So, as by the primary and most vital condition, is approached that “far-off divine Event, to which the whole creation moves,”[35] (and the <span class="ital">New</span> Creation most directly of all,) and with which the close of ch. 2 has dealt. Meanwhile this prospect, and the present <span class="ital">community</span> of the saints, is not absent from this passage, in which we have the great “<span class="ital">Family</span>” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-15.htm" title="Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named,">Ephesians 3:15</a>), and “<span class="ital">all</span> the saints” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-18.htm" title="May be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height;">Ephesians 3:18</a>); in which plurals are used throughout; and in which the closing sentences (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/3-20.htm" title="Now to him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that works in us,...">Ephesians 3:20-21</a>) point by the vastness of their language to a more than individual sphere of realization.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[35] <span class="ital">In Memoriam</span>, at the end.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">I bow my knees</span>] The attitude of prayer, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-41.htm" title="And he was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast, and kneeled down, and prayed,">Luke 22:41</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-60.htm" title="And he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge. And when he had said this, he fell asleep.">Acts 7:60</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-40.htm" title="But Peter put them all forth, and kneeled down, and prayed; and turning him to the body said, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes: and when she saw Peter, she sat up.">Acts 9:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-36.htm" title="And when he had thus spoken, he kneeled down, and prayed with them all.">Acts 20:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-5.htm" title="And when we had accomplished those days, we departed and went our way; and they all brought us on our way, with wives and children, till we were out of the city: and we kneeled down on the shore, and prayed.">Acts 21:5</a>. See too <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-11.htm" title="For it is written, As I live, said the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.">Romans 14:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-10.htm" title="That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth;">Php 2:10</a>. The words, doubtless, do not impose a special bodily posture as a necessity in spiritual worship; physical conditions may make kneeling impossible, or undesirable, on occasion. But they do impose the spiritual attitude of which the bodily is type and expression; profound and submissive reverence, perfectly harmonious with the “boldness” and “confidence” of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-12.htm" title="In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him.">Ephesians 3:12</a>. And so far as body and spirit work in concord, this <span class="ital">recommends</span> the corresponding bodily attitude where there is no distinct reason against it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the Father</span>] The words, “<span class="ital">of our Lord Jesus Christ</span>,” are to be omitted. They appear in very ancient documents, including the Syriac and Latin versions. But the great Latin Father and critic, St Jerome (cent. 4–5), in his comment on this verse, expressly says that the “Latin copies” are in error; and the evidence of both Greek MSS. and patristic quotations preponderates for the omission.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/ephesians/3.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-14.htm" title="For this cause I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,">Ephesians 3:14</a>. <span class="greekheb">Κάμπτω τὰ γόνατά μου</span>, <span class="ital">I bend my knees</span>) If Paul had been present, he would have bent his knees with a breast kindling into a glow of devotion. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-36.htm" title="And when he had thus spoken, he kneeled down, and prayed with them all.">Acts 20:36</a>.—<span class="greekheb">πατέρα</span>) Its conjugate is <span class="greekheb">πατριά</span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 14-21.</span> - PRAYER FOR THEIR SPIRITUAL ENRICHMENT. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For this cause.</span> The digression being ended, the apostle takes up the thread broken at ver. 1. We must seek the "cause" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2.htm">Ephesians 2</a>. Seeing that the Gentiles have now equal privileges with the Jews; seeing that by faith in Christ Gentile Christians have been brought as near to God, and have as good a right to the good things of the covenant; - I take the steps now to be specified for enabling them actually to possess these good things. On the one hand, the apostle saw the believing Ephesians still comparatively poor and needy; on the other hand, he saw all spiritual stores provided for them: the question was how to get the one into contact with the other. For this cause, he says, <span class="cmt_word">I bow my knees unto the Father.</span> An emphatic way of denoting prayer; but not incidental, occasional prayer, inspired by some passing feeling; the attitude "bow my knees" denotes <span class="accented">deliberate</span> prayer (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/6-10.htm">Daniel 6:10</a>), making a business of it, approaching God with reverence and holy fear, with all the solemnities suitable to the occasion of making a specific and important request. In the A.V. it is "unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ." The R.V., some of the oldest manuscripts, and most recent commentators omit the latter words, which are supposed to have been taken from <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-3.htm">Ephesians 1:3</a>. On internal grounds, the omission of the wends seems to yield the best sense, for in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-18.htm">Ephesians 2:18</a> our having access to "the Father" is spoken of, and when the apostle proceeded to show how he availed himself of that privilege, he is not likely to have used more than that expression. Further, there is such a close connection between <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;</span> in ver. 15, that they are not likely to have been far separated as the apostle used them. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/ephesians/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>For this cause<p>Resuming the interrupted clause in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-1.htm">Ephesians 3:1</a>, and having still in mind the closing thought of ch. 2.
