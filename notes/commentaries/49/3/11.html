How highly he speaks of Jesus Christ; the unsearchable riches of Christ! Though many are not enriched with these riches; yet how great a favour to have them preached among us, and to have an offer of them! And if we are not enriched with them it is our own fault. The first creation, when God made all things out of nothing, and the new creation, whereby sinners are made new creatures by converting grace, are of God by Jesus Christ. His riches are as unsearchable and as sure as ever, yet while angels adore the wisdom of God in the redemption of his church, the ignorance of self-wise and carnal men deems the whole to be foolishness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ephesians/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>According to the eternal purpose - see the note, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-4.htm">Ephesians 1:4</a>. Literally, "the purpose of ages," or of eternity. Locke, Chandler, and Whitby render this, "according to that disposition or arrangement of the ages which he made in Jesus Christ, or through him." The object of such an interpretation seems to be to avoid the doctrine that God had a purpose or plan in the salvation of people, and hence such expositors suppose it refers to the arrangement of the "ages" of the world by which the plan of redemption was introduced. On the word rendered here as "purpose" - &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;  prothesis - see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-11.htm">Ephesians 1:11</a>.

It does not occur elsewhere in the New Testament. In most of these cases it refers to the "purpose or intention" of God; in not a single case does it mean "arrangement or disposition" in any sense like that of making an arrangement of "ages" or periods of the world; and the interpretation proposed by Whitby, Locke, Clarke, and others, is wholly at variance with the settled use of the word.<p>The word rendered "eternal" - &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;  aio&#772;no&#772;n - may mean "ages;" but it also most usually means eternity; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-9.htm">Ephesians 3:9</a>. Here it may mean "the purpose of ages;" i. e., the purpose formed in past ages; but the word is most commonly used in the New Testament in the sense of "ever, and forever;" compare the following places, where it is so rendered in our common version, and beyond a doubt correctly; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-13.htm">Matthew 6:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-19.htm">Matthew 21:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-29.htm">Mark 3:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/11-14.htm">Mark 11:14</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-33.htm">Luke 1:33</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-55.htm">Luke 1:55</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-14.htm">John 4:14</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-51.htm">John 6:51</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-58.htm">John 6:58</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-35.htm">John 8:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-16.htm">John 14:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-25.htm">Romans 1:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-5.htm">Romans 9:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-36.htm">Romans 11:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-27.htm">Romans 16:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-9.htm">2 Corinthians 9:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-31.htm">2 Corinthians 11:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-5.htm">Galatians 1:5</a>. The fair meaning of the passage here is, that God had formed a plan which was "eternal" in reference to the salvation of people; that that plan had reference to the Lord Jesus; and that it was now executed by the gospel. It is impossible to get away from the idea that God has a "plan." It is too often affirmed in the Scriptures, and is too consonant with out' reason to be disputed. It is as "undesirable" as it is impossible to escape from that idea. Who could respect or honor an intelligent being that had no plan, no purpose, no intention, and that did all things by caprice and hap-hazard? If God has any plan, it must he eternal. He has no new schemes; he has no intentions which he did not always have.<p>Which he purposed - Literally, "which he made."<p>In Christ Jesus - With reference to him; or which were to be executed through him.

The whole of salvation, in which is displayed the great wisdom of God, is according to a purpose of his; the scheme of it is fixed in the council of peace; the thing itself is effected in pursuance of it; Christ, the Redeemer, was set forth in it; his incarnation, the time of his coming into the world, his sufferings and death, with all their circumstances, were decreed by God; and the persons for whom Christ became incarnate, suffered, and died, were appointed unto salvation by him; and the application of it to them is according to his purpose; the time when, the place where, and the means whereby souls are converted, are all settled in the decrees of God; the Gospel itself, the preaching of it by such and such persons, its use to make men see the mysteries of grace, and the fellowship of them, and to make known these things to the angels of heaven, are all according to a divine purpose: and this purpose is eternal, or was in the mind of God from all eternity; for no new will can arise in him; no purpose, resolution, or decree can be made by him in time, which was not in his breast from everlasting; and his purpose concerning the salvation of men must be eternal, since a council of peace was held, a covenant of peace was made, a promise of life was given, persons were fixed upon to be saved, a Saviour was appointed for them, and grace, and the blessings of it were put into his hands before the world began. <p>Which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord; the constitution of it was in him; God was in Christ contriving the scheme of salvation; eye was upon him, his thoughts centred in him, in him are all his promises, and blessings of grace designed and provided for his people; and the execution of this purpose is by him; though some refer this clause to the church in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-10.htm">Ephesians 3:10</a> which he has made in Christ, or by Christ, has built upon him, and united to him; and others, to the manifold wisdom of God displayed in Christ, who is the wisdom of God, and in whom all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hid. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/ephesians/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">According to the <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord:</span><p>(d) Which was before all things.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/ephesians/3.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-11.htm" title="According to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord:">Ephesians 3:11</a>. <span class="greekheb">Κατὰ πρόθεσιν τῶν αἰώνων</span>] belongs neither to <span class="greekheb">πολυποίκιλος</span> (Holzhausen) nor to <span class="greekheb">σοφία</span> (Koppe, Baumgarten-Crusius), nor does it relate to <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-9.htm" title="And to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning of the world has been hid in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ:">Ephesians 3:9</a> (Michaelis), nor yet to all that precedes from <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-3.htm" title="How that by revelation he made known to me the mystery; (as I wrote before in few words,">Ephesians 3:3</a> or <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-5.htm" title="Which in other ages was not made known to the sons of men, as it is now revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit;">Ephesians 3:5</a> (Flatt, comp.

The term <span class="greekheb">πρόθεσις</span> must be taken here as elsewhere in the proper sense of <span class="ital">purpose</span>, not in that of <span class="ital">foreknowledge</span> (Chrys.); and the clause is to be connected neither with the <span class="greekheb">σοφία</span> nor with the <span class="greekheb">πολυποίκιλος</span> in particular, but with the <span class="greekheb">γνωρισθῇ</span>. The disclosure of the manifold wisdom of God to the angelic world, contemplated in the commission given by God’s grace to Paul, was of further-reaching moment than that.

Thus “in the Christ,” the Eternal and Anointed Son and Word, the Idea stood forth formed; and in that Christ, as “Jesus our Lord,” incarnate, sacrificed, glorified, the Idea is carried into realization.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/ephesians/3.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-11.htm" title="According to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord:">Ephesians 3:11</a>. <span class="greekheb">Πρόθεσιν τῶν αἰώνων</span>, <span class="ital">the purpose of the ages</span> [<span class="ital">eternal purpose</span>]) concerning the ages, and before the ages, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-9.htm" title="Who has saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began,">2 Timothy 1:9</a>.—<span class="greekheb">ἣν</span>, <span class="ital">which</span>) This refers to <span class="greekheb">πρόθεσιν</span>, <span class="ital">purpose</span>.—<span class="greekheb">ἡμῶν</span>, <span class="ital">our, of us</span>) viz. believers, who are the <span class="ital">Church</span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">According to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord.</span> The apostle is ever anxious that we should connect these operations, of God with the profundity, deliberation, and awfulness of an eternal decree, and that we should thus contrast them in our minds with many even of the most important works of man which are often determined, on his part, by a passing event or other trivial cause. The verb in this clause is <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>, which he made, and it has been debated whether it denotes the original formation of the purpose, or the execution of it under Christ. With A.V. and R.V., we prefer the former. The object of the apostle is to indicate that the purpose existed from eternity; but, besides, the meaning of "fulfilled" or "executed" can hardly be sustained by <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>. The closing formula, "in Christ Jesus," is perfectly applicable to the eternal formation of the purpose; it is the constantly returning indication of the element in which the whole scheme of grace had its beginning, its progress, and its end. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/ephesians/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Eternal purpose (&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;)<p>Lit., the purpose of the ages.<p>He wrought (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;)<p>Carried into effect.
