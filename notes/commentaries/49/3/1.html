The first (carrying on what is implied in the contrast drawn out in Ephesians 2) is the absolute newness of this dispensation to the Gentiles—a mystery hidden from the beginning in God, but now at last revealed. The second, an emphatic claim for St. Paul himself, “less than the least” although he is, of a special apostleship to the Gentiles, proclaiming this mystery by word and deed.<p>(1) <span class= "bld">For this cause . . .</span>—After much discussion of the construction of this verse, there seems little doubt that the nominative, “I, Paul,” must be carried on beyond the digression upon the mystery of the gospel, and his part in ministering it, which follows. The only question which can well be raised is whether the resumption takes place at <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-13.htm" title="Why I desire that you faint not at my tribulations for you, which is your glory.">Ephesians 3:13</a>, “I desire that ye faint not;” or at <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-14.htm" title="For this cause I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,">Ephesians 3:14</a>, “I bow my knees;” and this seems decided for the latter alternative, both by the emphatic repetition of “for this cause,” and by the far greater weight and finality of the latter sentence.<p><span class= "bld">The prisoner of Jesus Christ.</span>—The phrase (repeated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-1.htm" title="I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that you walk worthy of the vocation with which you are called,">Ephesians 4:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-9.htm" title="Yet for love's sake I rather beseech you, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.">Philemon 1:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-8.htm" title="Be not you therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but be you partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God;">2Timothy 1:8</a>) is dwelt upon with an emphasis, explained by St. Paul’s conviction that “his bonds” tended to “the furtherance of the gospel”—not merely by exciting a sympathy which might open the heart to his words, but even more (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/philippians/1-13.htm" title="So that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace, and in all other places;">Philippians 1:13-14</a>) by showing the victorious power of God’s word and grace—which “is not bound”—to triumph over captivity and the danger of death. The expression itself is notable. When St. Paul calls himself the “prisoner of Jesus Christ,” he represents our Lord’s own will, as ordaining his captivity for His own transcendent purposes of good, making him an “ambassador in chains” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-20.htm" title="For which I am an ambassador in bonds: that therein I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.">Ephesians 6:20</a>), and these “the bonds of the gospel.” (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-13.htm" title="Whom I would have retained with me, that in your stead he might have ministered to me in the bonds of the gospel:">Philemon 1:13</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/28-20.htm" title="For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see you, and to speak with you: because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.">Acts 28:20</a>, “For the hope of Israel I am bound in this chain.”) Hence in this passage St. Paul seems to speak of his captivity as a special proof of the reality of his mission, and a new step in its progress; and appeals to it accordingly, just as in the final salutation of the Colossian Epistle, “Remember my bonds.” The whole idea is a striking instance of the spiritual alchemy of faith, turning all things to good—not unlike the magnificent passage (in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/11-23.htm" title="Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool) I am more; in labors more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths oft.">2Corinthians 11:23-30</a>) of his “glorying in his infirmities.”<p><span class= "bld">For you Gentiles.</span>—This was literally true of the origin of his captivity, proceeding as it did from the jealousy of the Jews, excited by the free admission of the Gentiles to the Church; but the reference is not to be limited to this. St. Paul regards the captivity as only one incident in a mission sending him entirely to the Gentiles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-21.htm" title="And they are informed of you, that you teach all the Jews which are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying that they ought not to circumcise their children, neither to walk after the customs.">Acts 21:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-13.htm" title="For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify my office:">Romans 11:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-9.htm" title="And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given to me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we should go to the heathen, and they to the circumcision.">Galatians 2:9</a>).

All the gracious offers of the gospel, and the joyful tidings it contains, come from the rich grace of God; it is the great means by which the Spirit works grace in the souls of men. The mystery, is that secret, hidden purpose of salvation through Christ. This was not so fully and clearly shown in the ages before Christ, as unto the prophets of the New Testament. This was the great truth made known to the apostle, that God would call the Gentiles to salvation by faith in Christ. An effectual working of Divine power attends the gifts of Divine grace. As God appointed Paul to the office, so he qualified him for it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ephesians/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For this cause - On account of preaching this doctrine; that is, the doctrine that the gospel was to be proclaimed to the Gentiles.<p>I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ - A prisoner in the service of the Lord Jesus; or made a prisoner in his cause. Not a prisoner for crime or debt, or as a captive in war, but a captive in the service of the Redeemer. This proves that at the time of writing this, Paul was in bonds, and there can he no question that he was in Rome. This would be more correctly rendered, "For this cause I, Paul, am the prisoner," etc. So Tyndale renders it, "For this cause I, Paul, the servant of Jesus, am in bonds." So also Locke, Rosenmuller, Doddridge, Whitby, Koppe, and others understand it. By this construction the abruptness now manifest in our common version is avoided.<p>For you Gentiles - Made a prisoner at Rome on your behalf, because I maintained that the gospel was to be preached to the Gentiles; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/22-21.htm">Acts 22:21-23</a>. He was taken first to Cesarea, and then to Rome. The cause of his imprisonment and of all his difficulties was, that he maintained that the gospel was to be preached to the Gentiles; that when the Jews rejected it God rejected them; and that he was specially called to carry the message of salvation to the pagan world. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ephesians/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 3<p>Eph 3:1-21. His Apostolic Office to Make Known the Mystery of Christ Revealed by the Spirit: Prayer that by the Same Spirit They May Comprehend the Vast Love of Christ: Doxology Ending This Division of the Epistle.<p>As the first chapter treated of THE Father's office; and the second, THE Son's, so this, that of THE Spirit.<p>1. of Jesus Christ&#8212;Greek, "Christ Jesus." The office is the prominent thought in the latter arrangement; the person, in the former. He here marks the Messiahship of "Christ," maintained by him as the origin of his being a "prisoner," owing to the jealousy of the Jews being roused at his preaching it to the Gentiles. His very bonds were profitable to ("for" or "in behalf of you") Gentiles (Eph 3:13; 2Ti 2:10). He digresses at "For this cause," and does not complete the sentence which he had intended, until Eph 3:14, where he resumes the words, "For this cause," namely, because I know this your call of God as Gentiles (Eph 2:11-22), to be "fellow-heirs" with the Jews (Eph 3:6), "I bow my knees to" the Father of our common Saviour (Eph 3:14, 15) to confirm you in the faith by His Spirit.

(Syriac, Chrysostom, Theophylact, Erasmus, Cajetanus, Beza, Elsner, Calovius, Wolf, Michaelis, <span class="ital">Paraphr</span>.; Moras, Koppe, Rosenmüller, and others), so that <span class="greekheb">ὁ δέσμιος τοῦ Χ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Ἰ</span>. is <span class="ital">predicate</span>, in connection with which some have neglected the article, others have rightly had regard to it (see especially Beza). He is, however, the <span class="greekheb">δέσμιος</span> of Christ <span class="ital">on behalf of the Gentiles</span>; and this thought leads him in the sequel to explain himself more fully regarding his vocation as Apostle of the Gentiles, whereupon he only briefly returns to the point of his imprisonment in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-13.htm" title="Why I desire that you faint not at my tribulations for you, which is your glory.">Ephesians 3:13</a>, after having been led away from it by the detailed exposition of the theme, to which he had been incited by the <span class="greekheb">ὑπὲρ τῶν ἐθνῶν</span>. Free movement of thought natural in a letter. Supplementary additions, such as <span class="ital">legatione fungor</span> (Ambrosiaster, Castalio, Calvin, Vatablus), or <span class="ital">hoc scribo</span> (Camerarius, and the like),[165] are not implied in the context, and are therefore erroneous. <span class="ital">Others</span> have regarded the discourse as <span class="ital">broken off</span>, and have found the resumption either at <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-8.htm" title="To me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ;">Ephesians 3:8</a> (Oecumenius, Grotius), or at <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-13.htm" title="Why I desire that you faint not at my tribulations for you, which is your glory.">Ephesians 3:13</a> (Zanchius, Cramer, Holzhausen), or at <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-14.htm" title="For this cause I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,">Ephesians 3:14</a> (Theodoret, Luther, Piscator, Calixtus, Cornelius a Lapide, Estius, Homberg, Schöttgen, Bengel, Baumgarten, and others, including Flatt, Lachmann, Rückert, Winer, Matthies, Harless, Olshausen, Bisping, Bleek; de Wette, characterizing this construction as “hardly Pauline”), or only at <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-1.htm" title="I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that you walk worthy of the vocation with which you are called,">Ephesians 4:1</a> (Erasmus Schmid, Hammond, Michaelis in note to his translation). But all these hypotheses are—inasmuch as, according to the above explanation, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-1.htm" title="For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles,">Ephesians 3:1</a> in itself yields with ease and linguistic correctness a complete and suitable sense—unnecessary complications of the discourse.

These verses make a paragraph by themselves. Their main subject is the call of the Gentiles and Paul’s Apostolic vocation in relation thereto. He reminds his readers of the mystery of that call, its revelation to the Apostles and prophets, his own destination to the ministry of preaching among the Gentiles, and the grace given him to make known the Divine dispensation that opened the Church to those who were not of Israel. This with the view that they should not misunderstand his present position or be discouraged by it.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/ephesians/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div>Ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/3-1.htm" title="For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles,...">Ephesians 3:1-13</a>.

Here begins a sentence broken immediately by a great digression. Where is it resumed? At <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-8.htm" title="To me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ;">Ephesians 3:8</a>, or at <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-13.htm" title="Why I desire that you faint not at my tribulations for you, which is your glory.">Ephesians 3:13</a>, or at <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-14.htm" title="For this cause I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,">Ephesians 3:14</a>? On the whole we decide for the latter, not only because the identical phrase “for this cause” recurs there, but because the thought of the Indweller, and the Foundation (“<span class="ital">grounded</span>,” <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-17.htm" title="That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that you, being rooted and grounded in love,">Ephesians 3:17</a>), recurs there also. It is thus as if the Apostle had been just about to pray that the great Lord of the Temple might take a new (an ever new) possession of the Edifice preparing for Him; but had been diverted, by the designation he gives himself, to speak at large of his Gentile commission. For a parenthesis on the like scale see the latter half of Romans 5. Such deviations into side-fields of pregnant thought are characteristic of some minds of high calibre; and we are never to forget that while it is everywhere the Inspirer who speaks through the Apostle, He as truly uses the Apostle’s type of mind as He uses the Greek type of language to be His perfect vehicle of expression.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">I Paul</span>] For a similar emphatic <span class="ital">Ego</span>, cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-1.htm" title="Now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ, who in presence am base among you, but being absent am bold toward you:">2 Corinthians 10:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-2.htm" title="Behold, I Paul say to you, that if you be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing.">Galatians 5:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-23.htm" title=" If you continue in the faith grounded and settled, and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel, which you have heard, and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven; whereof I Paul am made a minister;">Colossians 1:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-19.htm" title="I Paul have written it with my own hand, I will repay it: albeit I do not say to you how you owe to me even your own self besides.">Philemon 1:19</a>. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-18.htm" title="Why we would have come to you, even I Paul, once and again; but Satan hindered us.">1 Thessalonians 2:18</a> is not quite in point, nor the passages, <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-18.htm" title=" The salutation by the hand of me Paul.

The motive here seems to be the profound personal interest of the Apostle in his great commission, brought to the surface by the statement he has just made of the grandeur of its issue in the completion of the Temple of the Universal Church. “It is I, positively I, who am, wonderful to say, chief minister in the process.” And there may also be the emphasis of intense personal interest in the Ephesian converts; a loving pressure, so to speak, of his personality upon theirs.—On the “<span class="ital">self-consciousness</span>” of St Paul, see Howson, <span class="ital">Character of St Paul</span>, Lect.

Our Epistle thus stands grouped with Philippians, Colossians, Philemon, 2 Timothy, as an Epistle written from prison.—“<span class="ital">Of Jesus Christ</span>”<span class="ital">:</span>—under all aspects of life Paul belongs to Christ. Whatever he is, does, or suffers, it is as <span class="ital">Christ’s property</span>.

See <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-21.htm" title="And he said to me, Depart: for I will send you far hence to the Gentiles.">Acts 22:21</a> for illustration. His imprisonment, due to Jewish hostility, was thus ultimately due to his assertion of the free welcome of the Gentiles to Messiah’s covenant. Acts 15 records the crisis within the Church which corresponded to this assault from without.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/ephesians/3.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-1.htm" title="For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles,">Ephesians 3:1</a>. <span class="greekheb">Τούτου χάριν</span>) <span class="ital">for this cause</span>.

To justify this introduction of himself, he delicately introduces the fact of his being a prisoner on their behalf. What had brought him to Rome, what had made him appeal to Caesar, was his preaching the gospel <span class="accented">to the Gentiles</span>; indeed, the immediate occasion of his arrest at Jerusalem was the suspicion that he had taken Trophimus, an Ephesian, one of themselves, into the temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-29.htm">Acts 21:29</a>).
