It may be noted that in each case his deep sense of unworthiness is brought out by the thought of God’s especial grace and favour to him. Thus in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/15-9.htm" title="For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.">1Corinthians 15:9-10</a>, the feeling that he is “the least of the Apostles, not meet to be called an Apostle,” rises out of the contemplation of the special manifestation of the risen Lord to him as “one born out of due time;” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-30.htm" title="If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things which concern my infirmities.">2Corinthians 11:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/12-9.htm" title="And he said to me, My grace is sufficient for you: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest on me.">2Corinthians 12:9-11</a>, “boasting” has been forced upon him, and so, having been compelled to dwell on the special work done by him, and the special revelations vouchsafed to him, he immediately adds, “though I am nothing;” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_timothy/1-12.htm" title="And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who has enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry;">1Timothy 1:12-16</a>, as also here, it is the greatness of his message of universal salvation which reminds him that he was “a persecutor and injurious,” “the chief of sinners,” and “less than the least of all saints.” Elation in the sense of privilege—“the glorying in that which we have received,” so emphatically rebuked in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-7.htm" title="For who makes you to differ from another? and what have you that you did not receive? now if you did receive it, why do you glory, as if you had not received it?">1Corinthians 4:7</a>—is the temptation of the first superficial enthusiasm; deep sense of weakness and unworthiness, the result of second and deeper thought, contrasting the heavenly treasure with the earthen vessels which contain it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-7.htm" title="But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.">2Corinthians 4:7</a>). Possibly there is a “third thought,” deeper still, belonging to the times of highest spiritual aspiration, which loses all idea of self, even of weakness and unworthiness, in the thought of “the strength made perfect in weakness,” and the consciousness (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/philippians/4-12.htm" title="I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: every where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need.">Philippians 4:12-13</a>) that “we can do all things through Christ that strengtheneth us.” See this last brought out in peculiar fulness and freedom in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-13.htm" title="For whether we be beside ourselves, it is to God: or whether we be sober, it is for your cause.">2Corinthians 5:13</a> to <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-10.htm" title="As sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things.">2Corinthians 6:10</a>; a passage almost unique in its disclosure of spiritual experience.<p><span class= "bld">The unsearchable riches of Christ.</span>—The word “unsearchable” properly carries with it the metaphor (latent in our word “investigate”) of tracking the footsteps, but not tracking them completely to their source or issue—thus gaining an evidence of a living power, but “not knowing whence it cometh or whither it goeth.” In this proper sense it is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-33.htm" title="O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out!">Romans 11:33</a>, “How unsearchable are His judgments, and His ways past finding out!” (as also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-9.htm" title="Which does great things and unsearchable; marvelous things without number:">Job 5:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-10.htm" title="Which does great things past finding out; yes, and wonders without number.">Job 9:10</a>). Here it is used in a slightly different sense—applied to that “wealth” or fulness of Christ on which this Epistle lays such especial stress, as a wealth of truth which we can see in part but cannot wholly measure, and a wealth of grace which we can enjoy but cannot exhaust.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/ephesians/3.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/3-8.htm" title="To me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ;...">Ephesians 3:8-9</a></span>. <span class="ital">Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, </span>&c. — Here are the noblest strains of eloquence, to paint the exceeding low opinion which the apostle had of himself, and the fulness of unfathomable blessings which are treasured up in Christ. The word <span class="greekheb">ελαχιστοτερω </span>is a comparative, formed from the superlative <span class="greekheb">ελαχιστος</span>, the force of which it is difficult to express in the English language. Doubtless he speaks of himself in this humble manner, on account of his having been formerly a blasphemer of Christ, a persecutor of his disciples, and exceedingly injurious in so acting. <span class="ital">Is this grace given </span>— This unmerited favour bestowed; <span class="ital">that I should preach among the Gentiles </span>— Ignorant of divine things as they had been from generation to generation, and apparently abandoned of God to vice and wretchedness; <span class="ital">the unsearchable riches of Christ </span>— Those unsearchable perfections, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-9.htm" title=" For in him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.">Colossians 2:9</a>,) whereby he is qualified to be the Saviour of the world, and to bestow on all who believe the greatest spiritual blessings, which are the only true riches, because they render the possessors perfectly happy. In other words, In the riches of Christ, here justly said to be unsearchable, are included, 1st, His <span class="ital">redeeming acts; </span>such as his incarnation, his enduring temptation, his obedience unto death, his resurrection, ascension, intercession. 2d, His <span class="ital">saving benefits; </span>as illumination, justification, adoption, the spirit of adoption and regeneration, the restoration of God’s image to the soul, communion with God, and eternal life. 3d, The <span class="ital">ways </span>and <span class="ital">means </span>of the application of these acts and benefits; as (1,) The <span class="ital">properties </span>and <span class="ital">powers </span>exerted by Christ, such as his wisdom, power, love, patience: (2,) The <span class="ital">means </span>and <span class="ital">ordinances, </span>as affliction, the word of God, prayer, the fellowship of saints: (3,) The <span class="ital">graces </span>and <span class="ital">virtues </span>to be exercised by us; as faith, hope, love, obedience; in all which particulars unsearchable riches are comprehended, and by which we may be unspeakably and eternally enriched. <span class="ital">And to make men see </span>— To enlighten and instruct, as well the Gentiles as the Jews, and show them <span class="ital">what is the fellowship of the mystery</span> — What those mysterious blessings are whereof all believers are called jointly to partake; <span class="ital">which from the beginning of the world </span>— Greek, <span class="greekheb">απο των αιωνων</span>, <span class="ital">from ages, </span>and <span class="ital">from generations, </span>(<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-26.htm" title=" Even the mystery which has been hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints:">Colossians 1:26</a>,) <span class="ital">hath been hid in God </span>— Concealed in his secret counsels; <span class="ital">who created all things by Jesus Christ </span>— His eternal Word and Son, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-3.htm" title="All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.">John 1:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-2.htm" title="Has in these last days spoken to us by his Son, whom he has appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;">Hebrews 1:2</a>; where see the notes.

How highly he speaks of Jesus Christ; the unsearchable riches of Christ! Though many are not enriched with these riches; yet how great a favour to have them preached among us, and to have an offer of them! And if we are not enriched with them it is our own fault. The first creation, when God made all things out of nothing, and the new creation, whereby sinners are made new creatures by converting grace, are of God by Jesus Christ. His riches are as unsearchable and as sure as ever, yet while angels adore the wisdom of God in the redemption of his church, the ignorance of self-wise and carnal men deems the whole to be foolishness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ephesians/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints - This is one of the class of expressions unique to Paul. The ordinary terms of language do not express the idea which he wishes to convey, and a word is therefore coined to convey an idea more emphatically; compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-17.htm">2 Corinthians 4:17</a>. The word used here - &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  elachistoteros - does not occur elsewhere in the New Testament. It is a comparative made from the superlative. Similar expressions are found, however, in later Greek writers; see Bloomfield and Rosenmuller for examples. The word means here, "who am incomparably the least of all the saints; or who am not worthy to be reckoned among the saints." It is expressive of the deep sense which he had of the sinfulness of his past life; of his guilt in persecuting the church and the Saviour; and perhaps of his sense of his low attainments in piety; see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-9.htm">1 Corinthians 15:9</a>. Paul never could forget the guilt of his former life; never forget the time when he was engaged in persecuting the church of God.<p>The unsearchable riches of Christ - On the word "riches," as used by Paul, see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-7.htm">Ephesians 1:7</a>. The word rendered "unsearchable," &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;  anexichniaston, occurs but once elsewhere in the New Testament <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-33.htm">Romans 11:33</a>, where it is rendered "past finding out;" see the notes at that verse. It means that which cannot be "traced out," or explored; which is inscrutable, or incomprehensible. The meaning here is, that there was a "sufficiency" in Christ which could not be traced out or explored. It was wholly incomprehensible. The fullness of the riches in him could not be appreciated. There is no more emphatic expression in the New Testament than this. It shows that the heart of the apostle was full of admiration of the sufficiency and glory that was in the Saviour; that he wanted words to express it; and that he considered it the highest honor to be permitted to tell the world that there were such riches in the Redeemer. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ephesians/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. am&#8212;Not merely was I in times past, but I still am the least worthy of so high an office (compare 1Ti 1:15, end).<p>least of all saints&#8212;not merely "of all apostles" (1Co 15:9, 10).<p>is&#8212;Greek, "has been given."<p>among&#8212;omitted in the oldest manuscripts Translate, "to announce to the Gentiles the glad tidings of the unsearchable (Job 5:9) riches," namely, of Christ's grace (Eph 1:7; 2:7).

This is an instance of the great humility of the apostle, and indeed the greatest saints are generally speaking, the most humble souls, as Abraham, Jacob, Moses, David, and others; these have the meanest thoughts of themselves, and the best of others; they rejoice in the grace of God manifested to others; they are willing to receive instruction, nay admonition, from the meanest believer; they have the least opinion of their own works, and are the greatest admirers of the grace of God; and do most contentedly submit to the sovereign will of God: the reasons of their great humility are, because they have the largest discoveries of the love and grace of God and Christ, which are of a soul humbling nature; they are the most sensible of their own sinfulness, vileness, and unworthiness, which keeps them low in their own sight; they are commonly the most afflicted with Satan's temptations, which are suffered to attend them, lest they should be exalted above measure; they are the most fruitful souls, and boughs laden with fruit hang lowest; and they are the most conformable to Christ, who is meek and lowly. The phrase seems to be Jewish: there was one R. Jose "the little", who was so called, it is said, because he was , "the least of saints" (l): but the apostle uses a still more diminutive word, and calls himself less than the least of them; and adds, <p>is this grace given; that is, the gift of grace, as before, the ministerial gift: <p>that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ; the riches of Christ, as God, lie in the perfections of his nature, in the works of his hands, in his empire and dominion over all, and in the revenues of glory, which result from thence; and these riches are underived and incommunicable, and are ineffable, yea inconceivable: his riches, as Mediator, lie in the persons of the elect, in the grace that is laid up in him for them, called the riches of grace, and in the inheritance he is possessed of for them, called the riches of glory; and these rich things are communicable, as well as solid, satisfying, and lasting; and they are unsearchable to the natural man, and cannot be fully investigated by believers themselves; they will be telling over to all eternity: and they will appear unsearchable, when it is considered what they have procured, and what blessings have been dispensed according to them; what a large family Christ has maintained by them, and how richly and fully he has provided for them, and to what honour and grandeur he raises them all. Now it was great grace to intrust the apostle with such a ministry, to put such treasure into an earthen vessel; it was great grace that qualified him for it; and it was great grace in particular to the Gentiles, that he should be appointed to publish these among them; and so the apostle esteemed it, and himself unworthy of such honour. <p>(l) T.

The only other example in the NT is the double comparative <span class="greekheb">μειζότερος</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/3_john/1-4.htm" title="I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth.">3 John 1:4</a>; <span class="ital">cf.</span> Buttm., <span class="ital">Gram. of NT Greek</span>, p. 28.—<span class="greekheb">ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσιν εὐαγγελίσασθαι τὸν ἀνεξιχνίαστον πλοῦτον τοῦ Χριστοῦ</span>: <span class="ital">to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ</span>.

The former reading would define the <span class="ital">sphere</span> assigned to Paul in his ministry; the latter, the <span class="ital">subjects</span> of that ministry. For <span class="greekheb">τὸν πλοῦτον</span> the better accredited form is <span class="greekheb">τὸ πλοῦτος</span>. The <span class="greekheb">τοῦ Χριστοῦ</span> is prob. the gen. of <span class="ital">possess.</span>, = the riches that Christ <span class="ital">has</span>, or that are in Him. The <span class="greekheb">πλοῦτος</span> thus contained in Christ is the whole wealth of the salvation He bestows; and this is “unsearchable,” <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, not in the sense of <span class="ital">inexhaustible</span>, but rather in that of <span class="ital">unfathomable</span>, “past finding out,” such as cannot be fully comprehended by man; <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-33.htm" title="O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out!">Romans 11:33</a>, the only other NT occurrence of <span class="greekheb">ἀνεξιχνίαστον</span>; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-9.htm" title="Which does great things and unsearchable; marvelous things without number:">Job 5:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-10.htm" title="Which does great things past finding out; yes, and wonders without number.">Job 9:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-24.htm" title="He shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and set others in their stead.">Job 34:24</a>, the only occurrences in the LXX.

It presents the truths, harmonized into one truth, of the simplicity and the infinity of the Gospel. All is centralized in Christ, the Christ of Pauline, of New Testament, theology, the Incarnate Son slain, risen, and glorified; and from that Centre diverge countless lines of application to every need of the human soul. A Gospel thus described is totally different from an ethical code, or system; and equally different from a mere growth, however sublime, of human sentiment and aspiration. It claims to be nothing less than a direct unfolding of Divine resources of love and power.—See Appendix E for a remarkable incident in Christian biography, connected with this clause.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>E. THE UNSEARCHABLE RICHES OF CHRIST. (Ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-8.htm" title="To me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ;">Ephesians 3:8</a>.)<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The following passage, referred to in the notes, is extracted from “A Sermon preached in the Parish Church of St Paul’s, Deptford, on Sunday, May 7, 1786, on the lamented occasion of the death of Richard Conyers, LL.D., late Rector of that Parish,” by the Rev. John Newton.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“When he entered upon his ministry at his beloved Helmsley, in Yorkshire, he found the place ignorant and dissolute to a proverb … With much zeal and diligence, he attempted the reformation of his parish, which was of great extent and divided into several hamlets. He preached frequently in them all. He encouraged his parishioners to come to his house. He distributed them into little companies, that he might instruct them with more convenience; he met them in rotation by appointment. In this manner … I have been assured that he often preached or exhorted, publicly or more privately, twenty times in a week. These labours were not in vain; a great, visible, and almost universal reformation took place. About the time I am speaking of, a clergyman in his neighbourhood made very honourable mention of Mr Conyers, in a letter to the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge (which I have seen in print), as perhaps the most exemplary, indefatigable and successful, parochial minister in the kingdom. Yet, in the midst of applause and apparent success, he was far from being satisfied with himself. He did what he could; he did more than most others; but he felt there was something still wanting, though for a time he knew not what; but he was desirous to know. He studied the Scriptures, and he prayed to the Father of lights. They who thus seek shall surely find. Important consequences often follow from a sudden, involuntary turn ot thought. One day an expression of St Paul’s, ‘the unsearchable riches of Christ’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-8.htm" title="To me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ;">Ephesians 3:8</a>), engaged his attention. He had often read the passage, but never noticed the word ‘<span class="ital">unsearchable</span>’ before. The Gospel, in his view of it, had appeared plain and within his comprehension; but the Apostle spoke of it as containing something that was ‘unsearchable.’ A conclusion, therefore forced itself upon him that the idea he had hitherto affixed to the word ‘<span class="ital">Gospel</span>,’ could not be the same with that of the Apostle.… Thus he was brought, with the Apostle, to account his former gain but loss. The ‘unsearchable riches of Christ’ opened to his mind; he received power to believe; his perplexities were removed, and he ‘rejoiced with joy unspeakable and full of glory.’ … He, from that time, preached Jesus Christ, and Him crucified, as the only ground of hope for sinners, and the only source from whence they could derive wisdom, righteousness, sanctification and redemption, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-2.htm" title="For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified.">1 Corinthians 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-30.htm" title="But of him are you in Christ Jesus, who of God is made to us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:">1 Corinthians 1:30</a>.… This change in his sentiments, and manner of preaching, though it added efficacy to his moral instructions, and endeared him to his people at home, lost him much of that high estimation in which he had been held abroad. But he knew the gospel of God too well to be ashamed of it: whatever disgrace he suffered in such a cause he could bear with patience[43].”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[43] Conyers’ name occurs in Cowper’s <span class="ital">Truth</span>:“[Heaven’s] open, and ye cannot enter—why?Because ye will not, Conyers would reply.”<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/ephesians/3.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-8.htm" title="To me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ;">Ephesians 3:8</a>. <span class="greekheb">Τῷ ἐλαχιστοτέρῳ</span>, <span class="ital">less than the least</span>) The idea of the name <span class="ital">Paul</span>,[43] increased by a comparative which rises higher than even the superlative; whereby it is implied that he scarcely reckons himself among the saints.

The thought of his having such riches to offer to all made him regard his office as most glorious, raised him far above the point of view from which the world would despise it, and filled him with adoring gratitude to God for having conferred it on him. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/ephesians/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Less than the least (&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#837;&#834; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#837;)<p>Only here in the New Testament, and very characteristic.
