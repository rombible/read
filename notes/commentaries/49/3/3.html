By revelation, not by the wisdom of man (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/2-7.htm" title="But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world to our glory:">1Corinthians 2:7-16</a>): for “God hath revealed them to us by His Spirit.” By direct revelation to St. Paul himself, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-12.htm" title="For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.">Galatians 1:12</a>, “not of man or by man, but by revelation of Jesus Christ,” and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-25.htm" title="Now to him that is of power to establish you according to my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery, which was kept secret since the world began,">Romans 16:25</a>, “according to my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery.” (See also <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-17.htm" title="Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent to you?">2Corinthians 12:17</a>.) This revelation we may refer especially to the time when, after his conversion, he was “in a trance while praying in the Temple,” and “saw Christ Himself,” saying unto him, “Depart, for I will send thee far hence unto the Gentiles” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/22-17.htm" title="And it came to pass, that, when I was come again to Jerusalem, even while I prayed in the temple, I was in a trance;">Acts 22:17-21</a>).<p><span class= "bld">As I wrote afore in few words.</span>—The reference is to the brief notice in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/1-10.htm" title="That in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him:">Ephesians 1:10-14</a>, and to the further explanation in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/2-11.htm" title="Why remember, that you being in time past Gentiles in the flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called the Circumcision in the flesh made by hands;">Ephesians 2:11-22</a>. Hence, in English, the idea would be more clearly expressed by “I have written above.” St. Paul refers them back to these passages as embodying his “understanding,” or conception, of the mystery thus revealed especially to him. The reference is one of those parenthetical remarks, which, to those remembering how St. Paul’s Epistles were dictated, almost irresistibly suggest insertion on the reading over of the Epistle.<p>-3<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/3-20.htm" title="Now to him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that works in us,">Ephesians 3:20-21</a> sum up the whole in a doxology to God the Father through Christ Jesus. It may be compared with the other more solemn doxologies in the New Testament: as <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-25.htm" title="Now to him that is of power to establish you according to my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery, which was kept secret since the world began,">Romans 16:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_timothy/5-15.htm" title="For some are already turned aside after Satan.">1Timothy 5:15-16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jude/1-24.htm" title="Now to him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy,">Jude 1:24-25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-6.htm" title="And has made us kings and priests to God and his Father; to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.">Revelation 1:6</a>. Each has its distinctive character. Here the prevailing idea of the preceding chapters is the wonder and the mystery of God’s fore-ordaining love, overflowing in the riches of His grace to those who are made one with Him and with each other in Christ Jesus. Hence, God is here described as He “who is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think,” and to do all “by His power dwelling” and working in us.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:1-7 For having preached the doctrine of truth, the apostle was a prisoner, but a prisoner of Jesus Christ; the object of special protection and care, while thus suffering for him. All the gracious offers of the gospel, and the joyful tidings it contains, come from the rich grace of God; it is the great means by which the Spirit works grace in the souls of men. The mystery, is that secret, hidden purpose of salvation through Christ. This was not so fully and clearly shown in the ages before Christ, as unto the prophets of the New Testament. This was the great truth made known to the apostle, that God would call the Gentiles to salvation by faith in Christ. An effectual working of Divine power attends the gifts of Divine grace. As God appointed Paul to the office, so he qualified him for it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ephesians/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>How that by revelation - see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-12.htm">Galatians 1:12</a>. He refers to the revelation which was made to him when he was called to the apostolic office, that the gospel was to be preached to the Gentiles, and that he was converted for the special purpose of carrying it to them; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-15.htm">Acts 9:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-21.htm">Acts 22:21</a>.<p>Unto me the mystery - The hitherto concealed truth that the gospel was to be preached to the Gentiles; see the notes, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-9.htm">Ephesians 1:9</a>, on the meaning of the word "mystery."<p>As I wrote afore in few words - Margin, "a little before." To what this refers commentators are not agreed. Bloomfield, Doddridge, Rosenmuller, Erasmus, Grotius, Locke, and others, suppose that he refers to what he had written in the two previous chapters respecting the plan of God to call the Gentiles to his kingdom. Calvin supposes that he refers to some former epistle which he had written to them, but which is now lost. Hc remarks in regard to this, "If the solicitude of Paul be rightly considered; if his vigilance and assiduity; if his zeal and studious habits; if his kindness and promptitude in assisting his brethren, it is easy to suppose that he wrote many epistles publicly and privately to this place and to that place. But those only which the Lord saw necessary to the welfare of his church has he taken care to have preserved." In this opinion there is nothing in itself improbable (compare introduction to Isaiah, section 5 (1)), but it may be doubted whether Paul here refers to any such epistle. The addition which he makes, "whereby, when ye read," etc., seems rather to imply that he refers to what he had just written. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ephesians/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. he made known&#8212;The oldest manuscripts read, "That by revelation was the mystery (namely, of the admission of the Gentiles, Eph 3:6; 1:9) made known unto me (Ga 1:12)."<p>as I wrote afore&#8212;namely, in this Epistle (Eph 1:9, 10), the words of which he partly repeats.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ephesians/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">By revelation; </span> not by man, but immediately, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-15.htm" title="But the Lord said to him, Go your way: for he is a chosen vessel to me, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Israel:">Acts 9:15</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-12.htm" title="For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.">Galatians 1:12</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">He made known unto me the mystery; </span> viz. of calling the Gentiles to salvation by faith in Christ, without the works of the law, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-6.htm" title="That the Gentiles should be fellow heirs, and of the same body, and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel:">Ephesians 3:6</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">As I wrote afore; </span> in the two former chapters of this Epistle. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/ephesians/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>How that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery,.... Or "is made known unto me": so the Alexandrian copy, and some others, and the Vulgate Latin version. The Gospel, which is sometimes called a mystery, the mystery of the Gospel, the mystery of godliness, and the mystery of faith: the several doctrines of the Gospel are the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven; such as a trinity of persons in the Godhead, the union of the two natures in Christ, the saints' union to Christ, and communion with him, the resurrection of the dead, and the change of living saints, and the whole doctrine of salvation by Christ, of justification by his righteousness, pardon by his blood, and atonement by his sacrifice; and this was made known to the apostle, not in a mere notional and speculative way, but in a spiritual and saving manner; not by men, for he was not taught by men, nor did he receive it from them, but had it by the revelation of Jesus Christ, and by the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him: <p>as I wrote afore in few words: in the two first chapters of this epistle, which are a compendium of the mystery of the Gospel, in its several parts; as predestination, election, redemption, regeneration, and salvation by free grace. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/ephesians/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">How that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery; (as I wrote afore in few words,</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/ephesians/3.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-3.htm" title="How that by revelation he made known to me the mystery; (as I wrote before in few words,">Ephesians 3:3</a>.

It is a wonderful paradox, yet deeply truth-like, that the great champion of Pharisaism should have been chosen to be <span class="ital">the</span> Apostle of the heathen.—For the phrase, “by revelation,” cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-25.htm" title="Now to him that is of power to establish you according to my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery, which was kept secret since the world began,">Romans 16:25</a> (Greek); <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-2.htm" title="And I went up by revelation, and communicated to them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them which were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain.">Galatians 2:2</a>; and for St Paul’s claim to be a recipient of revelations, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-1.htm" title="It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory.

Mystery, that which is known only to the initiated, does not denote here a thing obscure in its own nature, but only something that had been concealed from view. It was only the initiated that now knew that God designed the gospel for Gentile and Jew alike. Paul had been initiated "by revelation" - not by his own reflecting power, not by his study of Scripture, not by communication from ether men, but by a special communication from God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-12.htm">Galatians 1:12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">As I wrote before in few words.</span> Where?

If it be said the allusions in these places to the topic in question are rather vague and general, the apostle virtually admits it - he wrote of it "in few words;" but, as it is a great and glorious truth, he returns to it to amplify it and place it in a brighter light. </body></html>
