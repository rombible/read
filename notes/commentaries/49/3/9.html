The phrase used in the original is at once stronger and weaker than our version of it. It is stronger, for the word is, properly, <span class= "ital">to enlighten</span> or illuminate—the same word used above (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-18.htm" title="The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that you may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,">Ephesians 1:18</a>), “the eyes of your heart being enlightened.” Strictly, Christ alone is the Light of the world, “which enlightens every man” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/1-4.htm" title="In him was life; and the life was the light of men.">John 1:4-5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-9.htm" title="That was the true Light, which lights every man that comes into the world.">John 1:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-2.htm" title="And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came to him; and he sat down, and taught them.">John 8:2</a>); but, as reflecting Him, He declared His servants to be the “light of the world.” Yet it is weaker, for while we can enlighten, it is our daily sorrow that we cannot “make men see.” Even He wept over Jerusalem because His light was, by wilful blindness, “hidden from their eyes” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-41.htm" title="And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it,">Luke 19:41</a>). To “open the eyes, and turn men from darkness to light,” although (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-18.htm" title="To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me.">Acts 26:18</a>) attributed in general terms to the servants of God, because naturally following on their ministry, is properly the work of the Holy Spirit, even in relation to the words of our Lord Himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-26.htm" title="But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatever I have said to you.">John 14:26</a>).<p><span class= "bld">The fellowship of the mystery.</span>—Both MS. authority and internal evidence point here to “the <span class= "ital">dispensation</span> of the mystery” as the true reading. Probably here the reference is not to the commission of the mystery to the Apostle (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-2.htm" title="If you have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me to you-ward:">Ephesians 3:2</a>), but (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-10.htm" title="That in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him:">Ephesians 1:10</a>) to the law or order which God Himself has ordained for the manifestation of the truth, both to men and angels.<p><span class= "bld">Who created all things by Jesus Christ.</span>—The words “by Jesus Christ” should be omitted, probably having crept in from a gloss, and not belonging to the original. The description of God as “He who created all things,” material and spiritual, is here emphatic—designed to call attention to the dispensation of the gospel as existing in the primeval purpose of the Divine Mind (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-4.htm" title="According as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love:">Ephesians 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-7.htm" title="So that you come behind in no gift; waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ:">1Corinthians 1:7</a>), hidden from the beginning of the world (properly, <span class= "ital">from the ages</span>) till the time of its revelation was come. The New Testament constantly dwells on this view of the Mediation of Christ, as belonging in some form to the relation of humanity to God in itself, and not merely to that relation as affected by the Fall; but nowhere with greater emphasis than in the profound and universal teaching of these Epistles.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:8-12 Those whom God advances to honourable employments, he makes low in their own eyes; and where God gives grace to be humble, there he gives all other needful grace. How highly he speaks of Jesus Christ; the unsearchable riches of Christ! Though many are not enriched with these riches; yet how great a favour to have them preached among us, and to have an offer of them! And if we are not enriched with them it is our own fault. The first creation, when God made all things out of nothing, and the new creation, whereby sinners are made new creatures by converting grace, are of God by Jesus Christ. His riches are as unsearchable and as sure as ever, yet while angels adore the wisdom of God in the redemption of his church, the ignorance of self-wise and carnal men deems the whole to be foolishness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ephesians/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And to make all men see - In order that the whole human family might see the glory of God in the plan of salvation. Hitherto the revelation of his character and plans had been confined to the Jews. Now it was his design that all the race should be made acquainted with it.<p>What is the fellowship of the mystery - Instead of "fellowship" here - &#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;  koino&#772;nia - most mss. and versions read &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;  oikonomia - "dispensation;" see Mill. This reading is adopted by Griesbach, Tittman, Rosenmuller, Koppe, and is regarded by most critics as being the genuine reading. The mistake might easily have been made by a transcriber. The meaning then would be, "to enlighten all in respect to rite dispensation of this mystery;" that is, to cause all to understand the manner in which this great truth of the plan of salvation is communicated to people. If the word "fellowship" is to be retained, it means that this doctrine, or secret counsel of God, was now "common" to all believers. It was not to be confined to any class or rank of people. Locke renders it," and to make all people perceive how this mystery comes now to be communicated to the world." Dr. Whately (Errors of Romanism, chapter ii. section 1) renders it, the common participation of the mystery;" that is, of truths formerly unknown, and which could not be known by man's unaided powers, but which were now laid open by the gracious dispensation of Divine Providence; no longer concealed, or confined to a few, but to be partaken of by all.<p>The allusion, according to him, is to the mysteries of the ancient pagan religions; and he supposes that the apostle designs to contrast those "mysteries" with Christianity. In those "mysteries" there was a distinction between the initiated and uninitiated. There was a revelation to some of the worshippers, of certain holy secrets from which others were excluded. There were in some of the mysteries, as the Elensinian, "great and lesser" doctrines in which different persons were initiated. In strong contrast with these, the "great mystery" in Christianity was made known to all. It was concealed from none and there was no distinction made among those who were initiated. No truths which God had revealed were held back from any part, but there was a common participation by all. Christianity has no hidden truths for a part only of its friends; it has no "reserved" doctrines; it has no truths to be entrusted only to a sacred priesthood. Its doctrines are to be published to the wide world, and every follower of Christ is to be a partaker of all the benefits of the truths which Christ has revealed. It is difficult to determine which is the true reading, and it is not very important. The general sense is, that Paul felt himself called into the ministry in order that all people might understand now that salvation was free for all - a truth that had been concealed for ages. Bearing this great truth, he felt that he had a message of incalculable value to mankind, and he was desirous to go and proclaim it to the wide world. On the word "mystery," see the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-9.htm">Ephesians 1:9</a>.<p>Hath been hid in God - With God. It has been concealed in his bosom. The plan was formed, but it had not before been made known.<p>Who created all things - This is plain enough; but it is not quite so plain why the declaration is introduced in this place. Locke and Rosenmuller suppose that it refers to the new creation, and that the sense is, that God frames and manages this new creation wholly by Jesus Christ. But the expression contains a truth of larger import, and naturally conveys the idea that all things were made by God, and that this was only a part of his great and universal agency. The meaning is, that God formed all things, and that this purpose of extending salvation to the world was a part of his great plan, and was under his control.<p>By Jesus Christ - As this stands in our common Greek text, as well as in our English version, there is a striking resemblance between the passage and that in <a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15-16</a>. But the phrase is missing in the Vulgate, the Syriac, the Coptic, and in several of the ancient mss. Mill remarks that it was probably inserted here by some transcriber from the parallel passage in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16</a>; and it is rejected as an interpolation by Griesbach. It is not "very" material whether it be retained in this place or not, as the same sentiment is elsewhere abundantly taught; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-3.htm">John 1:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-2.htm">Hebrews 1:2</a>. If it is to be retained, the sentiment is that the Son of God - the second person of the Trinity - was the great and immediate agent in the creation of the universe. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ephesians/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. to make all men see&#8212;Greek, "to enlighten all" (Eph 1:18; Ps 18:28; Heb 6:4). "All" (compare Col 1:28).<p>fellowship&#8212;The oldest manuscripts read, "economy," or "dispensation" (compare Col 1:25, 26; and see on [2365]Eph 1:10, above). "To make all see how it hath seemed good to God at this time to dispense (through me and others, His stewards) what heretofore was a mystery." Ellicott explains it, "the arrangement," or "regulation" of the mystery (the union of Jews and Gentiles in Christ) which was now to be humbly traced and acknowledged in the fact of its having secretly existed in the counsel of God, and now having been revealed to the heavenly powers by means of the Church.<p>from the beginning of the world&#8212;Greek, "from (the beginning of) the ages." Compare Eph 1:4; Ro 16:25; 1Co 2:7. The "ages" are the vast successive periods of time, marked by successive stages of creation and orders of beings.<p>in God&#8212;"hidden in" His counsels (Eph 1:9).<p>created all things by Jesus Christ&#8212;God's creation of the world and all things therein is the foundation of the rest of the "economy," which is freely dispensed according to the universal power of God [Bengel]. AS God created "the whole range of things" (so the Greek), physical and spiritual alike, He must have an absolute right to adjust all things as He will. Hence, we may see His right to keep the mystery of world-wide salvation in Christ "hidden in Himself," till his own good time for revealing it.

Or "the dispensation of the mystery" as the Complutensian, and several copies, and the Vulgate Latin and Syriac versions, read. The mystery is the Gospel; the fellowship of it is the communication of grace by it, a participation of the truths and doctrines of it, communion with Father, Son, and Spirit, which the Gospel calls and leads unto, and that equal concern and interest which both Jews and Gentiles have in the privileges of it. Now men are naturally in the dark about these things, and the ministry of the word is the means of enlightening them, and is indeed the grand design of it; and the ministers of the Gospel do instrumentally enlighten persons, though it is God only that does it efficiently; and for this, gifts of grace were bestowed upon the apostle, even for the enlightening of all men, not every individual person in the world, but some of all sorts, particularly Gentiles, as well as Jews. The word  rendered "all men", is left out in the Alexandrian copy. <p>Which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God; in the heart of God, in his counsel and covenant; which shows the original and source of the Gospel, and expresses the richness and valuableness of it, as well as its safety and secrecy: here it was hid in some measure from the elect angels, and from Old Testament saints, and altogether from natural men, and especially from the Gentiles, whose times of ignorance God winked at, or overlooked: and this was kept so from ages past, from the beginning of time, till now, and was laid up in the breast of God from all eternity; for it was ordained before the world for the glory, of his people. What the apostle says of the Gospel, the Jews say of the law, that it was hid and treasured up two thousand years before the world was created (m); yea, they say (n), that many ages before the creation of the world it was written and left,  , "in the bosom of God": and he is here described, as he <p>who created all things by Jesus Christ; not as an instrument, but as a co-efficient cause: and this is to be understood, not of the new creation, but of the old, and of all things in it; for without Christ, was not anything made that is made. The phrase, "by Jesus Christ", is left out in the Alexandrian and Claromontane copies, and in the Vulgate Latin, Syriac, and Ethiopic versions. <p>(m) Zohar in Exod. fol. 20. 4. &amp; in Numb. fol. 66. 3.

At variance with the context, Olshausen holds that Paul wished to call attention to the fact that the establishment of redemption itself [of which the apostle in fact is not speaking] is a creative act of God, which could have proceeded only from Him who created all things.

The <span class="greekheb">πάντας</span> which the TR inserts after <span class="greekheb">φωτίσαι</span> is omitted by some MSS. (including [272]1[273]) and certain Fathers (Hil., Jer., Aug., etc.). It is rejected by Tisch., accepted by RV in the text, and dealt with by WH as a <span class="ital">secondary</span> reading. The <span class="greekheb">κοινωνία</span> of the TR, which has the slenderest possible authority, must give place to the <span class="greekheb">οἰκονομία</span> of the RV with LTTrWH, which is the reading of [274] [275] [276] [277] [278] [279] [280] [281], etc. If the <span class="greekheb">πάντας</span> is omitted the sense becomes, as it is given in the margin of the RV, “to bring to light what is” the dispensation. If it is retained, the idea will be that of the <span class="ital">enlightenment of all</span> as to what the dispensation is. The <span class="greekheb">πάντας</span>, however, which occupies an unemphatic position here, <span class="ital">after</span> the verb (in contrast with the emphatic position of <span class="greekheb">τοῖς ἔθνεσιν</span> <span class="ital">before</span> its verb) can scarcely bear the absolute sense of all <span class="ital">men</span>, Jew and Gentile alike, but refers to all the <span class="greekheb">ἔθνη</span> previously mentioned. The verb <span class="greekheb">φωτίσαι</span> is more than <span class="greekheb">διδάξαι</span> or <span class="greekheb">κηρύξαι</span>. It means to <span class="ital">illuminate</span>. Paul was not only to deliver his Apostolic message, but also to spiritually enlighten those who heard it, so that they should understand it. The particular thing in that message which is here in view is the <span class="greekheb">οἰκονομία</span> (on which see under <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-10.htm" title="That in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him:">Ephesians 1:10</a>), that is, the <span class="ital">dispensation</span> or <span class="ital">arrangement</span> of the mystery, to wit the admission of the Gentiles on equal terms with the Jews; the <span class="greekheb">μυστήριον</span> here having the same application as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-6.htm" title="That the Gentiles should be fellow heirs, and of the same body, and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel:">Ephesians 3:6</a>. The formula <span class="greekheb">ἀπὸ τῶν αἰώνων</span> occurs in the NT only here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-26.htm" title=" Even the mystery which has been hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints:">Colossians 1:26</a>; the forms <span class="greekheb">ἀπὸ αἰῶνος</span> and <span class="greekheb">ἐκ τοῦ αἰῶνος</span> also occur, the former in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-70.htm" title="As he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets, which have been since the world began:">Luke 1:70</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-21.htm" title="Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God has spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began.">Acts 3:21</a>, the latter in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-32.htm" title="Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind.">John 9:32</a>. It means literally “from the ages,” “from the world-periods,” that is, <span class="ital">from the beginning</span>, or <span class="ital">since the world began</span>. It is to be distinguished from <span class="greekheb">πρὸ τῶν αἰώνων</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-7.htm" title="But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world to our glory:">1 Corinthians 2:7</a>). The Divine decree was formed <span class="ital">before</span> the ages of the world began; the keeping of that decree hidden was <span class="ital">since</span> the ages of the world began, <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, “from the commencement of the ages when intelligent beings from whom it could be concealed were called into existence” (Ell.). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-25.htm" title="Now to him that is of power to establish you according to my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery, which was kept secret since the world began,">Romans 16:25</a> we have the similar description of the <span class="greekheb">μυστήριον</span> as <span class="greekheb">χρόνοις αἰωνίοις σεσιγημένου</span>.—<span class="greekheb">ἐν τῷ Θεῷ τῷ τὰ πάντα κτίσαντι διὰ Ἰησοῦ χριστοῦ</span>: <span class="ital">in God who created all things</span> [<span class="ital">through Jesus Christ</span>]. The “mystery” had its place of concealment in <span class="ital">God</span> Himself, in the Divine mind. And God is designated specially in respect of His <span class="ital">creative power</span>—“God who created all things” (not “<span class="ital">inasmuch as</span> He created all things,” which would require the omission of the <span class="greekheb">τῷ</span>). The <span class="greekheb">τὰ πάντα</span>, which also occupies a somewhat emphatic position here, is not to be restricted either to the <span class="ital">physical</span> creation (Chrys.), or to the <span class="ital">spiritual</span> (Calv.), but has the absolute sense of <span class="ital">all that exists</span>. The TR adds <span class="greekheb">διὰ Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ</span> to the <span class="greekheb">κτίσαντι</span> (with [282] [283] [284], etc.); but these words must be omitted, as the best authorities ([285] [286] [287] [288] [289] [290], 17, etc.) do not give them. But why is this reference to God as the <span class="ital">Creator of all things</span> introduced at this point? By way of confirmation, say some, of what has just been said of the “mystery” as having been hidden from the beginning in God; the point being that He who created all things must have had the contents of this “mystery” in His eternal plan (Mey.). To “enhance the idea of His omnipotence,” say others; He who created all things having “<span class="ital">ordained</span> the mystery itself in the exercise of His undoubted prerogative of sovereign and creative power” (Ell.). Or, as others put it more precisely, its object is to take the wonder from the idea of the “mystery” having been so long unrevealed; the creation of all things by God being a fact which involves His perfect right to adjust all things as He will” (Alf.)—the <span class="ital">Creator of all</span> being “free to make what arrangements He pleased as to the concealment and revelation of His purpose” (Abb.). None of these interpretations can be said to be either very clear or very adequate. This designation of God as the Creator of all that exists is intended rather to express the <span class="ital">greatness</span> of the “mystery” that is now disclosed and of which Paul is to be a preacher. The main thought in the verse in question is the thought with which it starts, <span class="ital">viz.</span>, the marvel of that Apostolic commission of which Paul had been put in trust by the grace of God; and the majesty and the wonder of that commission are made the greater by the grandeur of the “mystery” the Divine disposition of which he was appointed to declare to all men. This “mystery,” though long hidden, had been in the Divine mind from the first, and it had been there in such a sense that the whole scheme of created things had it in view, and in such wise that the knowledge of it was to be imparted even to the angelic world (<span class="ital">cf.</span> Haupt). Or, as it may be better put, the “mystery” now at last revealed by God and proclaimed by Paul to all men in all the sovereign and surpassing wisdom of the Divine dispensation by which it was hidden long and in the fulness of time at last disclosed, was one of God’s own eternal secrets, one of His unsearchable thoughts, a thing that had its place from the beginning in His creative plan, a reserve in the Eternal mind that purposed and formed all that exists. And to Paul’s hands did the surpassing grace of God commit the proclamation of a truth of such magnitude, the <span class="ital">illumination</span> (<span class="greekheb">φωτίσαι</span>) of so unsearchable a disposition of the Divine wisdom!<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[272] Codex Sinaiticus (sæc. iv.), now at St. Petersburg, published in facsimile type by its discoverer, Tischendorf, in 1862.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[273] Codex Alexandrinus (sæc. v.), at the British Museum, published in photographic facsimile by Sir E.

To define somewhat the meaning of the phrase; the great Truth in question was hidden in comparative secrecy, from the starting point of the progress of the developments (“ages”) of the Divine dealings for man, up to the actual Advent of the Messiah.
