The sense is “if (that is),” or “if, as I suppose,” “ye heard the dispensation,” &c. The passage bears on the question whether the Epistle was an encyclical letter, or one addressed to the Ephesian Church. The argument which has been drawn from it in the former direction is not so strong as appears in the English; for the original implies no doubt that the readers of the Epistle had heard, and the hearing might have been not about St. Paul, but from St. Paul himself. Still, there is a vague generality about the expression, which suits well an address to the Asiatic churches generally, but could hardly have been used to a church so well known and beloved as Ephesus, where “the signs of an Apostle” had been wrought abundantly.<p><span class= "bld">The dispensation of the grace of God which is given me to you-ward.</span>—The descriptive clause, “which is given me to you-ward,” is seen in the original to belong to the word <span class= "ital">“</span>grace,” not (as our version might suggest) to “dispensation.” The grace of God is spoken of as given to St. Paul, not so much for his own sake, as for ministration to them of the dispensation described in the next verse. We find there that the revelation of salvation to the Gentiles was the “dispensation,” that is (much as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-10.htm" title="That in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him:">Ephesians 1:10</a>), the peculiar office in the ministration of the grace of God to the world, assigned to St. Paul by His wisdom.

All the gracious offers of the gospel, and the joyful tidings it contains, come from the rich grace of God; it is the great means by which the Spirit works grace in the souls of men. The mystery, is that secret, hidden purpose of salvation through Christ. This was not so fully and clearly shown in the ages before Christ, as unto the prophets of the New Testament. This was the great truth made known to the apostle, that God would call the Gentiles to salvation by faith in Christ. An effectual working of Divine power attends the gifts of Divine grace. As God appointed Paul to the office, so he qualified him for it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ephesians/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>If ye have heard - &#x395;&#x3b9;&#787;&#769;-&#x3b3;&#x3b5;  Ei-ge "If at least, if indeed, if so be, spoken of what is taken for granted."

The particle here is not designed to express a doubt whether they had heard of it or not, for he takes it for granted that they had. Doddridge renders it, "since I well know you have heard," etc. He had informed them of his being called to be the minister to the Gentiles <a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-3.htm">Ephesians 3:3</a>, but still there was a possibility that they had not received the letter containing the information, and he goes, therefore, into another statement on the subject, that they might fully comprehend it. Hence, this long parenthetical sentence - one of the longest that occurs in the writings of Paul, and expressed under the impulse of a mind full of the subject; so full, as we would say, that he did not know what to say first.<p>Hence, it is exceedingly difficult to understand the exact state of mind in which he was. It seems to me that the whole of this long statement grew out of the incidental mention <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-1.htm">Ephesians 3:1</a> of the fact that he was a prisoner for the Gentiles. Instantly he seems to have reflected that they would be grieved at the intelligence that he was suffering on their account. He goes, therefore, into this long account, to show them how it happened; that it was by the appointment of God; that it was in the evolving of a great and glorious mystery; that it was in a cause adapted to promote, in an eminent degree, the glory of God; that it was according to an eternal purpose; and he, therefore <a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-13.htm">Ephesians 3:13</a>, says, that he desires that they would not "faint" or be unduly distressed on account of his sufferings for them, since his sufferings were designed to promote their "glory." He was comforted in the belief that he was making known the glorious and eternal plan of God, and in the belief that it was for the welfare of mankind; and he, therefore, entreated them also not to be troubled inordinately at his sufferings.<p>The dispensation - Greek "economy;" rendered "stewardship," <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/16-2.htm">Luke 16:2-4</a>; and "dispensation," <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-10.htm">Ephesians 1:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-2.htm">Ephesians 3:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-25.htm">Colossians 1:25</a>; see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-10.htm">Ephesians 1:10</a>.

Now the apostle had a dispensation to preach this Gospel committed to him; he acted by authority, and as a steward of the mysteries of God; and which he faithfully dispensed to the family of Christ, who appointed him to this service: this the Ephesians had heard of, from the relations of the apostle, and others, and knew it themselves, having often heard him preach, for he was with them for the space of three years; wherefore this is not said as if he questioned, whether they had heard or not, but as taking it for granted that they had: "if", or "seeing ye have heard", &amp;c. <p>which is given me to you-ward; it was not for his own private use, that the Gospel was committed to him, or gifts were given him to qualify him for the dispensation of it, but for the sake of others, especially the Gentiles, and particularly the Ephesians. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/ephesians/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">If ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me to you-ward:</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/ephesians/3.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-2.htm" title="If you have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me to you-ward:">Ephesians 3:2</a>.

Whether the certainty of the assumption is in the particle itself or is derived from the context is still debated among grammarians. Some hold that in this case as in others the <span class="greekheb">γέ</span> simply strengthens the force of the simple particle, while others think that this is its significance, if not in every instance, at least in a considerable number of occurrences; <span class="ital">cf.</span> Mey. and Ell., <span class="ital">in loc.</span>; Win.-Moult., p. 561; Bâumlein, <span class="ital">Partikeln</span>, p. 64.

Not here to notice the <span class="ital">anti-Pauline</span> inference it is enough to say of the <span class="ital">anti-Ephesian</span> that it proves too much.

The true account of it, surely, is that it is a phrase of almost irony, an allusion to well-known fact under the disguise of hypothesis. His Gentile commission was no new thing, and was widely known, when this clause was written; but a natural and beautiful rhetoric prefers to treat it as if possibly obscure or forgotten.—That St Paul had never been silent at Ephesus on the subject appears from <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/19-8.htm" title="And he went into the synagogue, and spoke boldly for the space of three months, disputing and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of God....">Acts 19:8-9</a>, where we see him withdrawing the converts from the synagogue.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the dispensation</span>] <span class="bld">The stewardship</span>.

The words, "if ye have heard," etc., do not denote an uncertainty, but are a delicate reminder. Doubtless they had heard of the matter when he was at Ephesus, and, as he remarks in ver. 3, he had already written briefly on it. Grace is here used in a more restricted sense than in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-2.htm">Ephesians 1:2</a> - in the sense of Divine favor, honor, privilege  - the same as in ver. 8, "To me... is this favor given." Which is given me to you-ward. The grace or favor meant is that whereby Paul was constituted the apostle of the Gentiles. Deeply though he felt his being sent away from preaching to his countrymen (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-18.htm">Acts 22:18</a>), he took kindly to the new sphere allotted to him, and magnified his office (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-13.htm">Romans 11:13</a>). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/ephesians/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>If ye have heard (&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b5; &#x3b7;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;)<p>Here begins a long digression extending to <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-14.htm">Ephesians 3:14</a>.
