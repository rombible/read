The servants of old were generally slaves. The apostles were to teach servants and masters their duties, in doing which evils would be lessened, till slavery should be rooted out by the influence of Christianity. Servants are to reverence those over them. They are to be sincere; not pretending obedience when they mean to disobey, but serving faithfully. And they must serve their masters not only when their master's eye is upon them; but must be strict in the discharge of their duty, when he is absent and out of the way. Steady regard to the Lord Jesus Christ will make men faithful and sincere in every station, not grudgingly or by constraint, but from a principle of love to the masters and their concerns. This makes service easy to them, pleasing to their masters, and acceptable to the Lord Christ. God will reward even the meanest drudgery done from a sense of duty, and with a view to glorify him. Here is the duty of masters. Act after the same manner. Be just to servants, as you expect they should be to you; show the like good-will and concern for them, and be careful herein to approve yourselves to God. Be not tyrannical and overbearing. You have a Master to obey, and you and they are but fellow-servants in respect to Christ Jesus. If masters and servants would consider their duties to God, and the account they must shortly give to him, they would be more mindful of their duty to each other, and thus families would be more orderly and happy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ephesians/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And, ye masters - The object of this is, to secure for servants a proper treatment. It is evident, from this, that there were in the Christian church those who were "masters;" and the most obvious interpretation is, that they were the owners of slaves. Some such persons would be converted, as such are now. Paul did not say that they could not be Christians. He did not say that they should he excluded at once from the communion. He did not hold them up to reproach, or use harsh and severe language in regard to them. He taught them their duty toward those who were under them, and laid down principles which, if followed, would lead ultimately to universal freedom.<p>Do the same things unto them - &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768;  ta auta. The "same things," here seem to refer to what he had said in the previous verses. They were, to evince toward their servants the same spirit which he had required servants to evince toward them - the same kindness, fidelity, and respect for the will of God. He had required servants to act conscientiously; to remember that the eye of God was upon them, and that in that condition in life they were to regard themselves as serving God, and as mainly answerable to him. The same things the apostle would have masters feel. They were to be faithful, conscientious, just, true to the interests of their servants, and to remember that they were responsible to God. They were not to take advantage of their power to oppress them, to punish them unreasonably, or to suppose that they were freed from responsibility in regard to the manner in which they treated them. In the corresponding passage in Colossians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-1.htm">Colossians 4:1</a>), this is, "Masters, give unto your servants that which is just and equal;" see the note on that place.<p>Forbearing threatening - Margin, "moderating." The Greek word means to "relax, loosen;" and then, to "omit, cease from." This is evidently the meaning here The sense is, that they were to be kind, affectionate, just. It does not mean that they were to remit punishment where it was deserved; but the object is to guard against that to which they were so much exposed in their condition - a fretful, dissatisfied temper; a disposition to govern by terror rather than by love. Where this unhappy state of society exists, it would be worth the trial of those who sustain the relation of masters, to see whether it would not be "possible" to govern their servants, as the apostle here advises, by the exercise of love. Might not kindness, and confidence, and the fear of the Lord, be substituted for threats and stripes?<p>Knowing that your Master also is in heaven - Margin, "Some read, both your and their." Many mss. have this reading; see Mill. The sense is not materially affected, further than, according to the margin, the effect would be to make the master and the servant feel that, in a most important sense, they were on an equality. According to the common reading, the sense is, that masters should remember that they were responsible to God, and this fact should be allowed to influence them in a proper manner. This it would do in two ways:<p>(1) By the fact that injustice toward their servants would then be punished as it deserved - since there was no respect of persons with God.<p>(2) it would lead them to act toward their servants as they would desire God to treat them. Nothing would be better adapted to do this than the feeling that they had a common Master, and that they were soon to stand at his bar.<p>Neither is there respect of persons with him - see this expression explained in the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-11.htm">Romans 2:11</a>. The meaning here is, that God would not be influenced in the distribution of rewards and punishments, by a regard to the rank or condition of the master or the slave. He would show no favor to the one because he was a master; he would withhold none from the other because he was a slave. He would treat both according to their character. In this world they occupied different ranks and conditions; at his bar they would be called to answer before the same Judge. It follows from this:<p>(1) that a slave is not to be regarded as a "chattel," or a "thing," or as "property." He is a man; a redeemed man; an immortal man. He is one for whom Christ died. But Christ did not die for "chattels" and "things."<p>(2) the master and the servant in their great interests are on a level. Both are sinners; both will soon die; both will moulder back in the same manner to dust; both will stand at the tribunal of God; both will give up their account. The one will not be admitted to heaven because he is a master; nor will the other be thrust down to hell because he is a slave. If both are Christians, they will be admitted to a heaven where the distinctions of rank and color are unknown. If the master is not a Christian and the servant is, he who has regarded himself as superior to the servant in this life, will see "him" ascend to heaven while he himself will be thrust down to hell.<p>(3) Considerations like these will if they have their proper influence, produce two effects:<p>(a) They will lighten the yoke of slavery while it continues, and while it may be difficult to remove it at once. If the master and the slave were both Christians, even if the relation continued, it would be rather a relation of mutual confidence. The master would become the protector, the teacher, the guide, the friend; the servant would become the faithful helper - rendering service to one whom he loved, and to whom he felt himself bound by the obligations of gratitude and affection.<p>(b) But this state of feeling would soon lead to emancipation. There is something shocking to the feelings of all, and monstrous to a Christian, in the idea of holding "a Christian brother" in bondage. So long as the slave is regarded as a "chattel" or a mere piece of "property," like a horse, so long people endeavor to content themselves with the feeling that he may be held in bondage. But the moment it is felt that he is a "Christian brother" - a redeemed fellow-traveler to eternity, a joint heir of life - that moment a Christian should feel that there is something that violates all the principles of his religion in holding him as A slave; in making a "chattel" of that for which Christ died, and in buying and selling like a horse, an ox, or an ass, a child of God, and an heir of life. Accordingly, the prevalence of Christianity soon did away the evil of slavery in the Roman empire; and if it prevailed in its purity, it would soon banish it from the face of the earth. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ephesians/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. the same things&#8212;Mutatis mutandis. Show the same regard to God's will, and to your servants' well-being, in your relation to them, as they ought to have in their relation to you. Love regulates the duties both of servants and masters, as one and the same light attempers various colors. Equality of nature and faith is superior to distinctions of rank [Bengel]. Christianity makes all men brothers: compare Le 25:42, 43; De 15:12; Jer 34:14 as to how the Hebrews were bound to treat their brethren in service; much more ought Christians to act with love.<p>threatening&#8212;Greek, "the threatening" which masters commonly use. "Masters" in the Greek, is not so strong a term as "despots": it implies authority, but not absolute domination.<p>your Master also&#8212;The oldest manuscripts read, "the Master both of them and you": "their Master and yours." This more forcibly brings out the equality of slaves and masters in the sight of God. Seneca [Thyestes, 607], says, "Whatever an inferior dreads from you, this a superior Master threatens yourselves with: every authority here is under a higher above." As you treat your servants, so will He treat you.<p>neither &#8230; respect of persons&#8212;He will not, in judging, acquit thee because thou art a master, or condemn him because he is a servant (Ac 10:34; Ro 2:11; Ga 2:6; Col 3:25; 1Pe 1:17).

The duty of the masters is a corresponding duty, essentially the same as that of the servants (<span class="greekheb">τὰ αὐτά</span>), and it is stated first in respect of what is to be done and then in respect of what is to be left undone. It is to put a forced sense, however, on the phrase <span class="greekheb">ποιεῖτε τὰ αὐτά</span> if it is made to refer only to the preceding <span class="greekheb">δουλεύοντες</span> (Chrys.), as if the point were that the masters had a <span class="ital">service</span> to render to the <span class="greekheb">δοῦλοι</span> as these had a service to render to them. Nor does it seem to look back simply to the more general idea in <span class="greekheb">ποιοῦντες τὸ θέλημα τοῦ Θεοῦ</span>. Probably the <span class="greekheb">μετʼ εὐνοίας</span> is more immediately in view, and the meaning is that the masters were to act to their servants in the same Christian way as the servants were called to act to them—in the same spirit of consideration and goodwill.—<span class="greekheb">ἀνιέντες τὴν ἀπεολήν</span>: <span class="ital">giving up your threatening</span>. The <span class="greekheb">τήν</span>, pointing to the too well-known habit of the masters, may be best rendered by “your”. <span class="greekheb">ἀνίημι</span> is used in the NT in the sense of <span class="ital">loosening</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-26.htm" title="And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened, and every one's bands were loosed.">Acts 16:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-40.htm" title="And when they had taken up the anchors, they committed themselves to the sea, and loosed the rudder bands, and hoisted up the mainsail to the wind, and made toward shore.">Acts 27:40</a>), and of <span class="ital">leaving</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-5.htm" title="Let your conversation be without covetousness; and be content with such things as you have: for he has said, I will never leave you, nor forsake you.">Hebrews 13:5</a>, from LXX). In classical Greek it is used metaphorically both of <span class="ital">slackening, releasing</span> (Aristoph., <span class="ital">Vesp.</span>, 574), and <span class="ital">giving up</span> (Thuc., iii., 10, of <span class="greekheb">ἔχθρα</span>). The latter sense is most in point here. As Ell. rightly observes: “St. Paul singles out the prevailing vice and most customary exhibition of bad feeling on the part of the master, and in forbidding this, naturally includes every similar form of harshness”. This negative side of the master’s duty is not noticed in the parallel passage in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-1.htm" title=" Masters, give to your servants that which is just and equal; knowing that you also have a Master in heaven.">Colossians 4:1</a>.—<span class="greekheb">εἰδότες ὅτι καὶ ὑμῶν αὐτῶν</span> [<span class="greekheb">αὐτῶν καὶ ὑμῶν</span>] <span class="greekheb">ὁ Κύροίς ἐστιν ἐν οὐρανοῖς</span>: <span class="ital">knowing as ye do that also your Master</span> [<span class="ital">that both their Master and yours</span>] <span class="ital">is in heaven</span>. <span class="greekheb">εἰδότες</span>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-8.htm" title="Knowing that whatever good thing any man does, the same shall he receive of the Lord, whether he be bond or free.">Ephesians 6:8</a>, expresses the reason or encouragement for such conduct on the part of masters, <span class="ital">viz.</span>, the fact that masters themselves have a Master or Lord, whose seat is in <span class="ital">heaven</span>, not merely on earth, and who is Lord equally of master and of slave. The reading of the TR, <span class="greekheb">καὶ ὑμῶν αὐτῶν</span>, has the support of most cursives and such uncials as K.

But the best accredited reading is <span class="greekheb">καὶ αὐτῶν καὶ ὑμῶν</span>, “both theirs and yours,” given by B1[777] [778]*, also by [779] [780] (except that <span class="greekheb">αὐτῶν</span> becomes <span class="greekheb">ἑαυτῶν</span>), Syr., Boh., Vulg., Arm., etc., and accepted by LTTrWHRV.—<span class="greekheb">καὶ προσωποληψία οὐκ εστι παρʼ αὐτῷ</span>: <span class="ital">and respect of persons is not with Him</span>. The form <span class="greekheb">προσωποληψία</span> is preferred by the best critics (LTTrWH). The noun and its cognates <span class="greekheb">προσωπολημπτής</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-34.htm" title="Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons:">Acts 10:34</a>), <span class="greekheb">προσωπολημπτέω</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-9.htm" title="But if you have respect to persons, you commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors.">Jam 2:9</a>), <span class="greekheb">ἀπροσωπολήμπτως</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-17.htm" title="And if you call on the Father, who without respect of persons judges according to every man's work, pass the time of your sojourning here in fear:">1 Peter 1:17</a>), are Hellenistic forms, occurring only in biblical and ecclesiastical Greek. <span class="greekheb">προσωπολημψία</span> itself is found only four times in the NT (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-11.htm" title="For there is no respect of persons with God.">Romans 2:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-9.htm" title="And, you masters, do the same things to them, forbearing threatening: knowing that your Master also is in heaven; neither is there respect of persons with him.">Ephesians 6:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-25.htm" title=" But he that does wrong shall receive for the wrong which he has done: and there is no respect of persons.">Colossians 3:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-1.htm" title="My brothers, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect of persons.">Jam 2:1</a>). <span class="ital">Cf.</span> also the phrases <span class="greekheb">βλέπειν εἰς πρόσωπον</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-16.htm" title="And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him.">Matthew 26:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/12-14.htm" title="And when they were come, they say to him, Master, we know that you are true, and care for no man: for you regard not the person of men, but teach the way of God in truth: Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?">Mark 12:14</a>), <span class="greekheb">λαμβάνειν πρόσωπον</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/20-21.htm" title="And they asked him, saying, Master, we know that you say and teach rightly, neither accept you the person of any, but teach the way of God truly:">Luke 20:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-6.htm" title="But of these who seemed to be somewhat, (whatever they were, it makes no matter to me: God accepts no man's person:) for they who seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to me:">Galatians 2:6</a>), which in the NT have always a bad meaning,—to judge partially, to have regard to the person in judging or treating one. In the LXX the phrase <span class="greekheb">λαμβάνειν</span> or <span class="greekheb">θαυμάζειν πρόσωπον</span> is also used in the sense of having respect to one’s person, <span class="ital">being partial</span> (<span class="ital">e.g.</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/32-21.htm" title="Let me not, I pray you, accept any man's person, neither let me give flattering titles to man.">Job 32:21</a>, where it is conjoined with <span class="ital">giving flattering titles</span>), but admits at the same time of the better sense of <span class="ital">showing favour</span> to one (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-21.htm" title="And he said to him, See, I have accepted you concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which you have spoken.">Genesis 19:21</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[775] Codex Claromontanus (sæc. vi.), a Græco-Latin MS. at Paris, edited by Tischendorf in 1852.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[776] Codex Boernerianus (sæc. ix.), a Græco-Latin MS., at Dresden, edited by Matthæi in 1791.
