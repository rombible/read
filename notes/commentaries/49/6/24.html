It may be noted that it is not found in the Epistles of St. James, St. Peter, St. Jude and St. John, and that it is found in the Epistle to the Hebrews. Here, however, it is at once general and conditional, “to all them who love the Lord Jesus Christ.” So in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-22.htm" title="If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha.">1Corinthians 16:22</a>, “If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be anathema.”<p><span class= "bld">In sincerity.</span>—The original is far stronger, “in <span class= "ital">incorruptibility,” </span>a word usually applied to the immortality of heaven (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-7.htm" title="To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honor and immortality, eternal life:">Romans 2:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-42.htm" title="So also is the resurrection of the dead.

Amen.">Ephesians 6:24</a>In turning to the great words which I have read as a text, I ask you to mark their width and their simplicity. They are wide; they follow a very comprehensive benediction, with which, so to speak, they are concentric. But they sweep a wider circle. The former verse says, ‘Peace be to the brethren.’ But beyond the brethren in these Asiatic churches {as a kind of circular letter to whom this epistle was probably sent} there rises before the mind of the Apostle a great multitude, in every nation, and they share in his love, and in the promise and the prayer of my text. Mark its simplicity: everything is brought down to its most general expression. All the qualifications for receiving the divine gift are gathered up in one-love. All the variety of the divine gifts is summed up in that one comprehensive expression-’grace.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. So then, note, first, the comprehensive designation of the recipients of grace.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>They are ‘all who love our Lord Jesus Christ in incorruption.’ Little need be said explanatory of the force of this general expression. We usually find that where Scripture reduces the whole qualification for the reception of the divine gift, and the conditions which unite to Jesus Christ, to one, it is faith, not love, that is chosen. But here the Apostle takes the process at the second stage, and instead of emphasising the faith which is the first step, he dwells upon the love which is its uniform consequence. This love rests upon the faith in Jesus Christ our Lord.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Then note the solemn fulness of the designations of the object of this faith-born love. ‘Jesus Christ our Lord’-the name of His humanity; the name of His office; the designation of His dominion. He is Jesus the Man. Jesus is the Christ, the Fulfiller of all prophecy; the flower of all previous revelation; the Anointed of God with the fulness of His Divine Spirit as Prophet, Priest, and King. Jesus Christ is the Lord-which, at the lowest, expresses sovereignty, and if regard be had to the Apostolic usage, expresses something more, even participation in Deity. And it is this whole Christ, the Jesus, the Christ, the Lord; the love to whom, built upon the faith in Him in all these aspects and characteristics, constitutes the true unity of the true Church.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>That Church is not built upon a creed, but it is built upon a whole Christ, and not a maimed one. And so we must have a love which answers to all those sides of that great revealed character, and is warm with human love to Jesus; and is trustful with confiding love to the Christ; and is lowly with obedient love to the Lord. And I venture to go a step further, and say,-and is devout with adoring love to the eternal Son of the Father. This is the Apostle’s definition of what makes a Christian: Faith that grasps the whole Christ and love that therefore flows to Him. It binds all who possess it into one great unity. As against a spurious liberalism which calls them Christians who lay hold of a fragment of the one entire and perfect chrysolite, we must insist that a Christian is one who knows Jesus, who knows Christ, who knows the Lord, and who loves Him in all these aspects. Only we must remember, too, that many a time a man’s heart outruns his creed, and that many a soul glows with truer, deeper, more saving devotion and trust to a Christ whom the intellect imperfectly apprehends, than are realised by unloving hearts that are associated with clearer heads. Orchids grow in rich men’s greenhouses, fastened to a bit of stick, and they spread a fairer blossom that lasts longer than many a plant that is rooted in a more fertile soil. Let us be thankful for the blessed inconsistencies which knit some to the Christ who is more to them than they know.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>There is also here laid down for us the great principle, as against all narrowness and all externalism, and all so-called ecclesiasticism, that to be joined to Jesus Christ is the one condition which brings a man into the blessed unity of the Church. Now it seems to me that, however they may be to be lamented on other grounds, and they are to be lamented on many, the existence of diverse Churches does not necessarily interfere with this deep-seated and central unity. There is a great deal said to-day about the reunion of Christendom, by which is meant the destruction of existing communions and the formation of a wider one. I do not believe, and I suppose you do not, that our existing ecclesiastical organisations are the final form of the Church of the living God. But let us remember that the two things are by no means contradictory, the belief in, and the realising of, the essential unity of the Church, and the existence of diverse communions. You will see on the side of many a Cumberland hill a great stretch of limestone with clefts a foot or two deep in it-there are flowers in the clefts, by the bye-but go down a couple of yards and the divisions have all disappeared, and the base-rock stretches continuously. The separations are superficial; the unity is fundamental. Do not let us play into the hands of people whose only notion of unity is that of a mechanical juxtaposition held together by some formula or orders; but let us recognise that the true unity is in the presence of Jesus Christ in the midst, and in the common grasp of Him by us all.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>There is a well-known hymn which was originally intended as a High Church manifesto, which thrusts at us Nonconformists when it sings:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital"><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>‘We are not divided,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>All one body we.’</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And oddly enough, but significantly too, it has found its way into all our Nonconformist hymn-books, and we, ‘the sects,’ are singing it, with perhaps a nobler conception of what the oneness of the body, and the unity of the Church is, than the writer of the words had. ‘We are not divided,’ though we be organised apart. ‘All one body we,’ for we all partake of that one bread, and the unifying principle is a common love to the one Jesus Christ our Lord.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. Mark the impartial sweep of the divine gifts.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>My text is a benediction, or a prayer; but it is also a prophecy, or a statement, of the inevitable and uniform results of love to Jesus Christ. The grace will follow that love, necessarily and certainly, and the lovers will get the gift of God because their love has brought them into living contact with Jesus Christ; and His life will flow over into theirs. I need not remind you that the word ‘grace’ in Scripture means, first of all, the condescending love of God to inferiors, to sinners, to those who deserved something else; and, secondly, the whole fulness of blessing and gift that follow upon that love. And, says Paul, these great gifts from heaven, the one gift in which all are comprised, will surely follow the opening of the heart in love to Jesus Christ.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Ah, brethren! God’s grace makes uncommonly short work of ecclesiastical distinctions. The great river flows through territories that upon men’s maps are painted in different colours, and of which the inhabitants speak in different tongues. The Rhine laves the pine-trees of Switzerland, and the vines of Germany, and the willows of Holland; and God’s grace flows through all places where the men that love Him do dwell. It rises, as it were, right over the barriers that they have built between each other. The little pools on the sea-shore are separate when the tide is out, but when it comes up it fills all the pot-holes that the pebbles have made, and unifies them in one great flashing, dancing mass; and so God’s grace comes to all that love Him, and confirms their unity.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Surely that is the true test of a living Church. ‘When Barnabas came, and saw the grace of God, he was glad.’ It was not what he had expected, but he was open to conviction. The Church where he saw it had been very irregularly constituted; it had no orders and no sacraments, and had been set a-going by the spontaneous efforts of private Christians, and he came to look into the facts. He asked for nothing more when he saw that the converts had the life within them. And so we, with all our faults-and God forbid that I should seem to minimise these-with all our faults, we poor Nonconformists, left to the uncovenanted mercies, have our share of that gift of grace as truly, and, if our love be deeper, more abundantly, than the Churches that are blessed with orders and sacraments, and an ‘unbroken historical continuity.’ And when we are unchurched for our lack of these, let us fall back upon St. Augustine’s ‘Where Christ is, there the Church is’; and believe that to us, even to us also, the promise is fulfilled, ‘Lo! I am with you always, even to the end of the world.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">III. Lastly, note the width to which our sympathies should go.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Apostle sends out his desires and prayers so as to encircle the same area as the grace of God covers and as His love enfolds. And we are bound to do the same.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>I am not going to talk about organic unity. The age for making new denominations is, I suppose, about over. I do not think that any sane man would contemplate starting a new Church nowadays. The rebound from the iron rigidity of a mechanical unity that took place at the Reformation naturally led to the multiplication of communities, each of which laid hold of something that to it seemed important. The folly of ecclesiastical rulers who insisted upon non-essentials lays the guilt of the schism at their doors, and not at the doors of the minority who could not, in conscience, accept that which never should have been insisted upon as a condition. But whilst we must all feel that power is lost, and much evil ensues from the isolation, such as it is, of the various Churches, yet we must remember that re-union is a slow process; that an atmosphere springs up round each body which is a very subtle, but none the less a very powerful, force, and that it will take a very, very long time to overcome the difficulties and to bring about any reconstruction on a large scale. But why should there be three Presbyterian Churches in Scotland, with the same creed, confessions of faith, and ecclesiastical constitution? Why should there be half a dozen Methodist bodies in England, of whom substantially the same thing may be said? Will it always pass the wit of man for Congregationalists and Baptists to be one body, without the sacrifice of conviction upon either side? Surely no! You young men may see these fair days; men like me can only hope that they will come and do a little, such as may be possible in a brief space, to help them on.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Putting aside, then, all these larger questions, I want, in a sentence or two, to insist with you upon the duty that lies on us all, and which every one of us may bear a share in discharging. There ought to be a far deeper consciousness of our fundamental unity. They talk a great deal about ‘the rivalries of jarring sects.’ I believe that is such an enormous exaggeration that it is an untruth. There is rivalry, but you know as well as I do that, shabby and shameful as it is, it is a kind of commercial rivalry between contiguous places of worship, be they chapels or churches, be they buildings belonging to the same or to different denominations. I, for my part, after a pretty long experience now, have seen so little of that said bitter rivalry between the Nonconformist sects, as sects, that to me it is all but non-existent. And I believe the most of us ministers, going about amongst the various communities, could say the same thing. But in the face of a cultivated England laughing at your creed of Jesus, the Christ, the Lord; and in the face of a strange and puerile recrudescence of sacerdotalism and sacramentarianism, which shoves a priest and a rite into the place where Christ should stand, it becomes us Nonconformists who believe that we know a more excellent way to stand shoulder to shoulder, and show that the unities that bind us are far more than the diversities that separate.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It becomes us, too, to further conjoint action in social matters. Thank God we are beginning to stir in that direction in Manchester-not before it was time. And I beseech you professing Christians, of all Evangelical communions, to help in bringing Christian motives and principles to bear on the discussion of social and municipal and economical conditions in this great city of ours.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And there surely ought to be more concert than we have had in aggressive work; that we should a little more take account of each other’s action in regulating our own; and that we should not have the scandal, which we too often have allowed to exist, of overlapping one another in such a fashion as that rivalry and mere trade competition is almost inevitable.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>These are very humble, prosaic suggestions, but they would go a long way, if they were observed, to sweeten our own tempers, and to make visible to the world our true unity. Let us all seek to widen our sympathies as widely as Christ’s grace flows; to count none strangers whom He counts friends; to discipline ourselves to feel that we are girded with that electric chain which makes all who grasp it one, and sends the same keen thrill through them all. If a circle were a mile in diameter, and its circumference were dotted with many separate points, how much nearer each of these would be if it were moved inwards, on a straight line, closer to the centre, so as to make a circle a foot across. The nearer we come to the One Lord, in love, communion, and likeness, the nearer shall we be to one another.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:19-24 The gospel was a mystery till made known by Divine revelation; and it is the work of Christ's ministers to declare it.

Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith. By peace, understand all manner of peace; peace with God, peace of conscience, peace among themselves. And the grace of the Spirit, producing faith and love, and every grace. These he desires for those in whom they were already begun. And all grace and blessings come to the saints from God, through Jesus Christ our Lord.

Compare 1Co 9:25, "corruptible &#8230; incorruptible crown." "Purely," "holily" [Estius], without the corruption of sin (See on [2377]1Co 3:17; 2Pe 1:4; Jude 10).

The differences of opinion among real Christians are comparatively small, and show that they are not following one another like silly sheep, each trusting the one before him. Their agreement in the main, while showing their independence as witnesses by differing in non-essentials, can only be accounted for by their being all in the right direction (Ac 15:8, 9; 1Co 1:2; 12:3).   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ephesians/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This is more extensive than the former, he prays here for all true believers every where. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">In sincerity; </span> or, with incorruption, i.e. so as that nothing can draw them off from the love of Christ, and so it implies constancy as well as sincerity. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Written from Rome unto the Ephesians by Tychicus.</span> <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/ephesians/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Grace be with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ,.... Christ is the object of love, and a lovely object he is: he is to be loved because of the loveliness of his person, and the transcendent excellencies that are in him; because of his suitableness and fulness as a Saviour; and because of his great love shown to his church and people; and because of the relations he stands in to them, and the communion they have with him: love to Christ is a grace of the Spirit, and is in all believers; and though it is imperfect, and sometimes cold, it will abide for ever; it ought to be universal and superlative; all of Christ is to be loved, and he is to be loved above all: and it shows itself in a value for his Gospel, and the truths of it; in an esteem of his ordinances, and a regard to his commands; in parting with all for Christ, when called for; and in bearing all for his sake; in a well pleasedness in his company and presence, and in a concern for his absence, and in an uneasiness until he is enjoyed again: it should be fervent, and constant, and cordial, and, as here said, <p>in sincerity; from the heart, and with all the heart, and without hypocrisy; not in word only, but in deed and in truth; which appears when he is loved, as before observed: and the apostle wishes "grace" to all such sincere and hearty lovers of him; by which may be meant a fresh discovery of the free grace, love, and favour of God in Christ to them; and a fresh supply of grace from the fulness of it in Christ; and a larger measure of the grace of the Spirit to carry on the good work begun in them; as well as a continuation of the Gospel of the grace of God with them, and an increase of spiritual gifts. Grace may be connected with the word translated "sincerity", and be rendered "grace with incorruption": or incorruptible grace, as true grace is an incorruptible seed; or "grace with immortality": and so the apostle wishes not only for grace here, but for eternal happiness and glory hereafter; and then closes the epistle with an Amen, as a confirmation and asseveration of the truth of the doctrines contained in it, and as expressive of his earnest desire that the several petitions in it might be granted, and of his faith and confidence that they would be fulfilled. <p>The subscription, <p>written from Rome to the Ephesians by Tychicus, seems to be right; for that this epistle is written to the Ephesians, the inscription shows; and that it was written when the apostle was at Rome, appears from <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-1.htm">Ephesians 3:1</a>; and that it was sent by Tychicus, seems very likely from <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-21.htm">Ephesians 6:21</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/ephesians/6.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Grace <i>be</i> with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ <span class="cverse3">{m}</span> in sincerity.

As in Colossians, the three Pastoral Epistles, and also in Hebrews, we have here <span class="greekheb">ἡ χάρις</span>, “<span class="ital">the</span> grace,” the grace beside which there is none other, the grace of God in Christ of which Christians have experience. In the closing benedictions of Cor., Gal., Philip., Thess., Philem. (as also in Rev.), we have the fuller form <span class="greekheb">ἡ χάρις τοῦ Κυρίου Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ</span>, or <span class="greekheb">ἡ χάρις τοῦ Κυρίου ἡμῶν Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ</span>; also in Romans according to the TR, the verse, however, being deleted by the best critics. The former benediction was for the <span class="ital">brethren</span>, probably those in the Asiatic Churches. This second benediction is of widest scope—for <span class="ital">all</span> those who love Christ. The difficulty is with the unusual expression <span class="greekheb">ἐν ἀφθαρσίᾳ</span>, both as to its sense and its connection. The noun <span class="greekheb">ἀφθαρσία</span> is used in Plutarch of <span class="greekheb">τὸ θεῖομ</span> (<span class="ital">Arist.</span>, c. 6), in Philo of the <span class="greekheb">κόσμος</span> (<span class="ital">De incorr.

The occurrence in <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-10.htm" title="Not purloining, but showing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savior in all things.">Titus 2:10</a> must be discounted in view of the adverse diplomatic evidence. The Pauline use, therefore, is in favour of the idea of “incorruption,” “imperishableness,” the quality of the <span class="ital">changeless</span> and <span class="ital">undecaying</span>; and that as belonging to the future in contrast with the present condition of things. There is nothing, therefore, to bear out the sense of <span class="ital">sincerity</span> adopted by Chrys., the AV, the Bish.; <span class="ital">cf.</span> Tynd., “in pureness”; Cov. Test., “sincerely”; Cov. Cran., “unfeignedly”. This would be expressed by <span class="greekheb">ἀφθορία</span> or some similar term (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-7.htm" title="In all things showing yourself a pattern of good works: in doctrine showing soundness, gravity, sincerity,">Titus 2:7</a>). Nor can it be simply identified with all <span class="ital">imperishable being</span> in this life or in the other (Bleek, Olsh., Matthies, etc.); nor yet again with <span class="greekheb">ἐν ἀφθάρτοις</span> on the analogy of <span class="greekheb">ἐν ʼπουρανίοις</span>, as if it described the <span class="ital">sphere</span> of the <span class="greekheb">ἀγάπη</span>. There remains the <span class="ital">qualitative</span> sense of “imperishableness” (Mey., Ell., Alf., Abb., and most), which best suits linguistic use, the sense of the adj. <span class="greekheb">ἄφθαρτος</span> (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-23.htm" title="And changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and four footed beasts, and creeping things.">Romans 1:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-25.htm" title="And every man that strives for the mastery is temperate in all things.

The <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span>, therefore, is not to be loosely dealt with, as if = <span class="greekheb">εἰς</span> (Beza, as if it meant the same as <span class="greekheb">εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα</span>), or <span class="greekheb">διά</span> (Theophy.), or <span class="greekheb">ὑπέρ</span> (Chrys.), or even <span class="greekheb">μετά</span> (Theodor.); but has its proper force of the <span class="ital">element</span> of <span class="ital">manner</span> in which the love is cherished. Further, the simplest and most obvious connection is with the <span class="greekheb">ἀγαπώντων</span>, as it is taken by most, including Chrys., Theod., and the other Greek commentators. Some, however, connect the phrase with <span class="greekheb">ἡ χάρις</span>, as = “grace be with all <span class="ital">in eternity</span>” (Bez., Beng., Matthies), or, “<span class="ital">in all imperishable being</span>” (Harl.), or as a short way of saying “grace be with all that they may have eternal life” (Olsh.). This construction, though strongly advocated recently by Von Soden, fails to give a clear and satisfactory sense, or one wholly accordant with the use of <span class="greekheb">ἀφθαρσία</span>; while there is against it also the fact that the defined noun and the defining phrase would be further apart than is usual in benedictions. Still less reason is there to connect the phrase immediately with <span class="greekheb">τὸν Κύριον ἡμῶν Ἰησοῦν Χριστόν</span> as if it described Christ as <span class="ital">immortal</span> (Wetst., etc.)—a construction both linguistically and grammatically (in the absence of <span class="greekheb">τὸν</span> before <span class="greekheb">ἐν ἀφθαρσίᾳ</span>) questionable. The phrase, therefore, defines the <span class="ital">way</span> in which they love, or the element in which their love has its being. It is a love that “knows neither change, diminution, nor decay” (Ell.). The closing <span class="greekheb">ἀμήν</span> added by the TR is found in [895]3[896] [897] [898] [899], most cursives, Syr., Boh., etc.; but not in [900] [901] [902] [903] [904], 17, Arm., etc. It is omitted by LTTrWHRV.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[895] Codex Sinaiticus (sæc. iv.), now at St. Petersburg, published in facsimile type by its discoverer, Tischendorf, in 1862.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[896] Codex Claromontanus (sæc. vi.), a Græco-Latin MS. at Paris, edited by Tischendorf in 1852.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[897] Codex Mosquensis (sæc. ix.), edited by Matthæi in 1782.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[898] Codex Porphyrianus (sæc. ix.), at St. Petersburg, collated by Tischendorf.

Like the subscriptions appended to Rom., Phil., and 2 Tim., it chronicles a view of the Epistle that is easier to reconcile with fact than is the case with others (1 and 2 Thess., Tit., and espec. 1 Cor., Gal., 1 Tim.). In the oldest MSS. it is simply <span class="greekheb">πρὸς Ἐφεσίους</span>. In the Versions, later MSS., and some of the Fathers it takes various longer forms. The form represented in the TR and the AV is not older than Euthalius, Deacon of Alexandria and Bishop of Sulca, who flourished perhaps in the middle of the fifth century.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/ephesians/6.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">24</span>. <span class="ital">Grace</span>] Lit., “<span class="ital">the</span> grace.” So in the closing benedictions of Col., 1 Tim., 2 Tim., Tit., Heb. In Rom., Cor., Gal., Phil., Thess., Philem., Rev., the benedictions are in the full form (or nearly so), “the grace <span class="ital">of our Lord Jesus Christ</span>.” The shorter form is very probably the epitome of the larger; “<span class="ital">the</span> grace” is <span class="ital">His</span> grace.

It is nothing less than God Himself in action, in His Son, by His Spirit, in the salvation of man.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">with all them that love</span>, &c.] In this short clause, at once so broad and so deep in its reference, so exclusive from one point of view, so inclusive from another, we find the last expression of those great ideas of the Epistle, the local Universality and spiritual Unity of the true, the truly believing and loving, Church. All who answer this description are, as a fact, in contact with the Fountain of Grace, and on all of them the Apostle invokes “grace for grace” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-16.htm" title="And of his fullness have all we received, and grace for grace.">John 1:16</a>), the successive and growing supplies of the gift of God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“<span class="ital">Our Lord Jesus Christ</span>”<span class="ital">:</span>—the full name and style of the Object of love is given. In this lies the needful warning that the Object must be no creature of the individual’s, or of the community’s, thought, but the Redeemer and King of history and revelation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in sincerity</span>] Lit., (as R.V.,) <span class="bld">in uncorruptness</span>.

Thus the word tends always towards the spiritual and eternal, as towards that which is in its own nature free from elements of decay. “In <span class="ital">spiritual reality</span>” would thus represent a part, but only a part, of the idea of the present phrase. The whole idea is far greater in its scope. The “love of our Lord Jesus Christ” in question here is a love living and moving “<span class="ital">in</span>” the sphere and air, so to speak, of that which cannot die, and cannot let die. God Himself is its “environment,” as He lives and works in the regenerate soul. It is a love which comes from, exists by, and leads to, the unseen and eternal. “Thus only,” in Alford’s words, “is the word worthy to stand as the crown and climax of this glorious Epistle.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[41] The Genevan English Version (1557) renders the words in the text here, “<span class="ital">to their immortalitie</span>.” The preposition (“to”) cannot stand, but the noun conveys part of the true meaning.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Amen</span>] See note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-21.htm" title="To him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end.
