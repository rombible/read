The words “that he might comfort (or, <span class= "ital">encourage</span>) your hearts,” although they might apply generally to all messengers from an Apostle, may probably be best explained by reference to the tone of the Epistle to the Philippians—in which St. Paul shows so much affectionate anxiety lest his converts should be disheartened by his continued imprisonment—and to the exhortation in this Epistle not “to faint at his tribulations for them” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-13.htm" title="Why I desire that you faint not at my tribulations for you, which is your glory.">Ephesians 3:13</a>).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:19-24 The gospel was a mystery till made known by Divine revelation; and it is the work of Christ's ministers to declare it. The best and most eminent ministers need the prayers of believers. Those particularly should be prayed for, who are exposed to great hardships and perils in their work. Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith. By peace, understand all manner of peace; peace with God, peace of conscience, peace among themselves. And the grace of the Spirit, producing faith and love, and every grace. These he desires for those in whom they were already begun.

He was a prisoner at Rome, and it was doubtful what the result would be. In this situation, he felt it proper to despatch a special messenger to give information about his condition; to state what was doing in Rome; to ask the prayers of the churches; and to administer consolation to them in their various trials. The same sentiment in regard to the embassy of Tychicus, is expressed in the Epistle to the Colossians, <a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/4-7.htm">Colossians 4:7-8</a>. No small part of the consolation which he would impart to them would be found in these invaluable letters which he bore to them from the apostle. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ephesians/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22. for the same purpose&#8212;Greek, "for this very purpose."

If it were certain that the Epistle to the Colossians preceded that to the Ephesians, that the special mission on which Tychicus was sent with Onesimus to Colossæ took place before Paul wrote the Epistle to the Ephesians, and that he found some opportunity of forwarding the latter Epistle also in the course of Tychicus’s journey, the <span class="greekheb">ἔπεμψα</span> would have its usual aorist sense, referring to a past act. Failing this, it must be taken as an instance of the <span class="ital">epistolary</span> aor., the mission being <span class="ital">coincident</span> with the writing of the letter, but contemplated from the view-point of the <span class="ital">recipients</span> of the letter, to whom it was a thing of the past.

It is well rendered “our state” by the RV; “our affairs” by the AV. The information regarding Paul and his friends would not be confined to the letter, but would be given no doubt also by Tychicus by word of mouth.—<span class="greekheb">καὶ παρακαλέσῃ τὰς καρδίας ὑμῶν</span>: <span class="ital">and that he may comfort your hearts</span>. <span class="greekheb">παρακαλεῖν</span> means most frequently either to <span class="ital">exhort</span> or (in later Greek as well as in the NT) to <span class="ital">beseech</span>. Rarely in non-biblical Greek has it the sense of <span class="ital">comforting</span> or <span class="ital">encouraging</span>; but in the LXX it represents <span class="greekheb">בִחַם</span>, and in the NT it has these senses, and also once that of <span class="ital">instructing</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-9.htm" title="Holding fast the faithful word as he has been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the disputers.">Titus 1:9</a>). Here it means to <span class="ital">comfort</span>, or to <span class="ital">encourage</span>; probably the former, with respect both to Paul’s troubles already mentioned (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-13.htm" title="Why I desire that you faint not at my tribulations for you, which is your glory.">Ephesians 3:13</a> above) and their own.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/ephesians/6.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">22</span>. <span class="ital">I have sent</span>] Lit., “<span class="ital">I did send</span>.” The aorist is “epistolary”; it speaks from the time of the arrival, not the sending, of the messenger.

By derivation and usage it has more in it of <span class="ital">exhortation</span> than <span class="ital">consolation;</span> though the two ideas run often into one another. “Comfort” by derivation (<span class="ital">confortatio</span>) means rightly, “strengthening.” If this is borne in mind, the A.V. gives a true interpretation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">your hearts</span>] See, for collocation of the words “heart” and “comfort,” <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-2.htm" title=" That their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and to all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the acknowledgment of the mystery of God, and of the Father, and of Christ;">Colossians 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-8.htm" title=" Whom I have sent to you for the same purpose, that he might know your estate, and comfort your hearts;">Colossians 4:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-17.htm" title="Comfort your hearts, and establish you in every good word and work.">2 Thessalonians 2:17</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/ephesians/6.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-22.htm" title="Whom I have sent to you for the same purpose, that you might know our affairs, and that he might comfort your hearts.">Ephesians 6:22</a>. <span class="greekheb">Πρὸς ὑμᾶς</span>, <span class="ital">to you</span>) afar off.—<span class="greekheb">παρακαλέσῃ</span>, <span class="ital">might comfort</span>) lest ye should take offence at my bonds.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Whom I have sent unto you for this very purpose, that ye may know our state, and that he may comfort your hearts.</span> This serves to explain the absence of personal remembrances, allusions, and messages in the Epistle. Tychicus, who had his full confidence, would tell them all by word of mouth. The concluding words show that it was not to gratify any mere personal feeling that Paul directed Tychicus to make this communication; but knowing how much they felt for him, he believed it would be a comfort to hear how he fared. To pagans the idea of captivity was always dolorous and dreadful; it was well for them to learn how Christians could glory in tribulations (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-3.htm">Romans 5:3</a>). Tychicus, the beloved brother, was evidently well fitted to apply to the Ephesians this comforting view of his state. </body></html>
