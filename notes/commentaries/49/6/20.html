For oftentimes it had caught him: and he was kept bound with chains and in fetters; and he broke the bands, and was driven of the devil into the wilderness.)">Luke 8:29</a>, where it is distinguished from a “fetter” properly so called, as binding the feet, and therefore obviously signifies a “manacle” binding the hand. Both are included (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-29.htm" title="(For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For oftentimes it had caught him: and he was kept bound with chains and in fetters; and he broke the bands, and was driven of the devil into the wilderness.)">Luke 8:29</a>) in the general word “bonds.” The allusion is undoubtedly to the custom of chaining the prisoner by the hand to the soldier who kept him. Thus in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/12-6.htm" title="And when Herod would have brought him forth, the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains: and the keepers before the door kept the prison.">Acts 12:6</a> we read that Peter “was sleeping between two soldiers,” and therefore “bound with two manacles;” and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-33.htm" title="Then the chief captain came near, and took him, and commanded him to be bound with two chains; and demanded who he was, and what he had done.">Acts 21:33</a> that a similar precaution was used on the first apprehension of St. Paul. Here the singular number is probably to be understood literally. St. Paul was free except for the one chain, which the soldier was responsible for holding, and perhaps did not always think it needful to hold. That chain he seems to speak of as the badge of his ambassadorial dignity. To ambassadors, indeed, it belongs to be safe from imprisonment; but it was his greater glory to wear the chain for Christ.<p><span class= "bld">That therein . . .</span>—This is simply an enforcement of the previous phrase, in “plainness of speech.” The same word is used, and with the same signification of simplicity, as well as boldness, which (St. Paul here adds) alone befits his office.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:19-24 The gospel was a mystery till made known by Divine revelation; and it is the work of Christ's ministers to declare it. The best and most eminent ministers need the prayers of believers. Those particularly should be prayed for, who are exposed to great hardships and perils in their work. Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith. By peace, understand all manner of peace; peace with God, peace of conscience, peace among themselves. And the grace of the Spirit, producing faith and love, and every grace. These he desires for those in whom they were already begun. And all grace and blessings come to the saints from God, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Grace, that is, the favour of God; and all good, spiritual and temporal, which is from it, is and shall be with all those who thus love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity, and with them only.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ephesians/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For which I am an ambassador in bonds - In chains (see the margin); or in confinement. There is something especially touching in this. He was "an ambassador" - sent to proclaim peace to a lost world. But he was now in chains. An ambassador is a sacred character. No greater affront can be given to a nation than to put its ambassadors to death, or even to throw them into prison. But Paul says here that the unusual spectacle was witnessed of an ambassador seized, bound, confined, imprisoned; an ambassador who ought to have the privileges conceded to all such people, and to be permitted to go everywhere publishing the terms of mercy and salvation. See the word "ambassador" explained in the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-20.htm">2 Corinthians 5:20</a>.<p>That therein - Margin, or "thereof." Greek, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837;  en auto&#772; - "in it;" that is, says Rosenmuller, in the gospel. It means that in speaking the gospel he might be bold.<p>I may speak boldly - Openly, plainly, without fear; see the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-13.htm">Acts 4:13</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/9-27.htm">Acts 9:27</a>, note; <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-46.htm">Acts 13:46</a>, note; <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/14-3.htm">Acts 14:3</a>, note; <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/18-26.htm">Acts 18:26</a>, note; <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/19-8.htm">Acts 19:8</a>, note; <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/26-26.htm">Acts 26:26</a>, note.<p>As I ought to speak - Whether in bonds or at large. Paul felt that the gospel ought always to be Spoken with plainness, and without the fear of man. It is remarkable that he did not ask them to pray that he might be released. "Why" he did not we do not know; but perhaps the desire of release did not lie so near his heart as the duty of speaking the gospel with boldness It may be of much more importance that we perform our duty aright when we are afflicted, or are in trouble, than that we should be released. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ephesians/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20. For&#8212;Greek, as in Eph 6:19, "On behalf of which."<p>an ambassador in bonds&#8212;a paradox. Ambassadors were held inviolable by the law of nations, and could not, without outrage to every sacred right, be put in chains. Yet Christ's "ambassador is in a chain!" The Greek is singular. The Romans used to bind a prisoner to a soldier by a single chain, in a kind of free custody. So Ac 28:16, 20, "I am bound with this chain." The term, "bonds" (plural), on the other hand, is used when the prisoner's hands or feet were bound together (Ac 26:29); compare Ac 12:6, where the plural marks the distinction. The singular is only used of the particular kind of custody described above; an undesigned coincidence [Paley].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ephesians/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">For which I am an ambassador in bonds; </span> for which gospel I still continue, though a prisoner, in the embassy committed to me by Christ. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">That therein I may speak boldly; </span> this may imply not only free speaking, but free acting in all things whereby the gospel may be propagated. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/ephesians/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For which I am an ambassador in bonds,.... The character the apostle bore was that of an ambassador; and he was an ambassador from and for Christ, in his room and stead; he represented him, he was sent by him, and entrusted by him with the Gospel; he gave him it, and a commission to preach it, and furnished him with qualifications for it; such as knowledge and faithfulness wisdom and prudence, courage and greatness of mind; and made his embassy successful: and he was chiefly an ambassador to the Gentiles, which showed great condescension in Christ to send him to them, and base ingratitude in the despisers and rejecters of the Gospel, for which he was an ambassador; for the embassy Christ's ministers are sent on, is the embassy of the Gospel of peace: their business is to declare that men by nature are enemies to God; that peace is made by the blood of Christ for such; by which means they are made useful to conciliate the minds of men to God's way of salvation and to bring them to submit to his government and laws: and when he adds, "in bonds", or "in a chain", he means, that he was in such circumstances, not for any crime, but for the Gospel, for which he was an ambassador; and therefore was not ashamed of his bonds, or chain, but rather gloried in them; and he makes mention of them to engage persons to a regard to him as an ambassador, and to his embassy; for an ambassador, especially an ambassador of Christ, that comes with his Gospel, and more especially that is suffering for it, ought to be received, heard, and honoured. <p>That therein I may speak boldly as I ought to speak; that is, the apostle beseeches the saints to pray for him, that since he was an ambassador for the Gospel, and in bonds, that he might speak in it, or rather of it boldly and freely; that he might have both liberty from his bonds, and liberty in his soul, and freedom of speech; and that he might use boldness in delivering his message, as became an ambassador of Jesus Christ. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/ephesians/6.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For which I am an ambassador in bonds: that therein I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/ephesians/6.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-20.htm" title="For which I am an ambassador in bonds: that therein I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.">Ephesians 6:20</a>. <span class="ital">For which</span> (to conduct its cause) <span class="ital">I discharge the office of ambassador in a chain</span>.

But, while in such passages as <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-1.htm" title="And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand.">Revelation 20:1</a> the specific sense may not be required, it seems clear that the distinction between <span class="ital">manacle</span> and <span class="ital">fetter</span> does obtain (<span class="ital">cf.</span> Polyb., iii., 82, 8); that this distinction is made in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/5-4.htm" title="Because that he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been plucked asunder by him, and the fetters broken in pieces: neither could any man tame him.">Mark 5:4</a>; and that <span class="greekheb">ἅλυσις</span> is used of the “handcuff” by which a prisoner was attached to his guard (Joseph., <span class="ital">Antiq.</span>, xviii., 6, 7, 10; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/12-6.htm" title="And when Herod would have brought him forth, the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains: and the keepers before the door kept the prison.">Acts 12:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-33.htm" title="Then the chief captain came near, and took him, and commanded him to be bound with two chains; and demanded who he was, and what he had done.">Acts 21:33</a>, etc.; <span class="ital">cf.</span> Light., <span class="ital">Phil.</span>, p. 8). This may be its meaning here, and there will be no necessity for taking it to be a <span class="ital">collective</span> sing. = bonds; of which use indeed, though possible (<span class="ital">cf.</span> Bernh., <span class="ital">Synt.</span>, ii., 1, p. 58), there does not appear to be any clear example in the NT itself. And such phrases as <span class="greekheb">εἰς τὴν ἅλυσιν ἐμπίπτειν</span> (Polyb., iv., 76, 5, xxi., 3, 3) are inconclusive, the article giving the word the generic sense. It has been thought that the expression points to the <span class="ital">custodia militaris</span> endured by Paul in Rome (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/28-16.htm" title="And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him.">Acts 28:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/28-20.htm" title="For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see you, and to speak with you: because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.">Acts 28:20</a>; <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-16.htm" title="The Lord give mercy to the house of Onesiphorus; for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain:">2 Timothy 1:16</a>; Beza, Grot., Paley, Steyer, etc.). That is possible, and indeed even probable, so far as the <span class="ital">custodia</span> is concerned. But the description might apply to the imprisonment in Cæsarea as well as to that in Rome. The real point of the clause is in the view it gives of the need of the <span class="greekheb">παρρησία</span> and of the <span class="ital">intercessions</span> that should bring that gift.—<span class="greekheb">ἵνα ἐν αὐτῷ παρρησιάσωμαι ὡς δεῖ με λαλῆσαι</span>: <span class="ital">in order that therein I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak</span>. How is this purpose-clause to be connected? Some attach it to the <span class="greekheb">πρεσβεύω</span> (Beng., Meyer, Von Soden), as if = “I act as ambassador in a chain with the object of speaking boldly,” etc. Others connect it with the whole foregoing clause, making it <span class="ital">subordinate</span> to that, and an explanation of the object of the <span class="ital">gift of utterance</span>, = “that utterance may be given to me to make known the mystery, with the view that I should speak boldly” (Harl.). But <span class="greekheb">ἵνα</span> is repeatedly used to introduce something that is not <span class="ital">subordinate</span> to, but <span class="ital">coordinate</span> with, what is stated in a former <span class="greekheb">ἵνα</span> clause (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-13.htm" title="For if you live after the flesh, you shall die: but if you through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, you shall live.">Romans 8:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-14.htm" title="That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.">Galatians 3:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-20.htm" title="But now are they many members, yet but one body.">1 Corinthians 12:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-3.htm" title="Yet have I sent the brothers, lest our boasting of you should be in vain in this behalf; that, as I said, you may be ready:">2 Corinthians 9:3</a>). It is best, therefore, to take it so here, and to understand the clause as giving a <span class="ital">second</span> object contemplated in the <span class="greekheb">προσευχόμενοι</span> and <span class="greekheb">ἀγρυπνοῖντες</span>, etc. First the gift of <span class="ital">utterance</span>, and now secondly the gift more particularly of a <span class="ital">boldness</span> or <span class="ital">freedom</span> (<span class="greekheb">παρρησιάσωμαι</span>) in preaching such as <span class="ital">became</span> the Apostle’s office and responsibility (<span class="greekheb">ὡς δεῖ με λαλῆσαι</span>). The <span class="greekheb">αὐτῷ</span> refers to the <span class="greekheb">μυστήριον</span> which was to be preached. The <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span> is taken by some (<span class="ital">e.g.</span>, Harl.) to denote the <span class="ital">source</span> or <span class="ital">ground</span> of the <span class="ital">boldness</span> in speaking (<span class="greekheb">παρρησιάσωμαι</span>). But it is <span class="ital">God</span> who is named as the source of such boldness (<span class="greekheb">ἐπαρρησιασάμεθα ἐν τῷ Θεῷ</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-2.htm" title="But even after that we had suffered before, and were shamefully entreated, as you know, at Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak to you the gospel of God with much contention.">1 Thessalonians 2:2</a>). It might be an instance of <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span> expressing that <span class="ital">on</span> which a certain power operates or <span class="ital">in</span> which it shows itself (as in <span class="greekheb">ἵνα οὕτω γένηται ἐν ἐμοί</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-15.htm" title="But I have used none of these things: neither have I written these things, that it should be so done to me: for it were better for me to die, than that any man should make my glorying void.">1 Corinthians 9:15</a>; <span class="greekheb">ἐν ἡμῖν μάθητε</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-6.htm" title="And these things, brothers, I have in a figure transferred to myself and to Apollos for your sakes; that you might learn in us not to think of men above that which is written, that no one of you be puffed up for one against another.">1 Corinthians 4:6</a>; <span class="ital">cf.</span> Thayer-Grimm, <span class="ital">Lex.</span>, p. 210). But it is best understood as the note of that <span class="ital">in</span> which one is <span class="ital">busied</span> (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-12.htm" title="And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, having a good report of all the Jews which dwelled there,">Acts 22:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-15.htm" title="Meditate on these things; give yourself wholly to them; that your profiting may appear to all.">1 Timothy 4:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-2.htm" title=" Continue in prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving;">Colossians 4:2</a>, etc.), and so = “that, occupied with that mystery, <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, in <span class="ital">proclaiming</span> it, I may speak boldly” (Mey.).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/ephesians/6.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">20</span>. <span class="ital">for which</span>] <span class="bld">On behalf of which</span>, in the interests of which.

See his note there. This is not the place to discuss the question.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in bonds</span>] Lit., <span class="bld">in a chain</span>. The Gr. word occurs elsewhere in St Paul’s speech or writings, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/28-20.htm" title="For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see you, and to speak with you: because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.">Acts 28:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-16.htm" title="The Lord give mercy to the house of Onesiphorus; for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain:">2 Timothy 1:16</a>.—Prisoners detained upon appeal to the Emperor, as was St Paul, were sometimes “coupled by a slight chain round the right wrist to the left of a soldier, and, thus shackled … if they could afford it, were at liberty to hire a lodging for themselves without the walls, but within the prescribed limits” (Lewin, <span class="ital">Life, &c., of St Paul</span>, ii. 236. See too Bp Lightfoot, <span class="ital">Philippians</span>, p. 8). Cp.
