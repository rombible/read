It is indeed the great object of this chapter to bring out the equality and unity of both Jews and Gentiles in the Church of Christ; and this truth is naturally introduced by a statement of their former equality in alienation and sin.<p><span class= "bld">In the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind.</span>—The parallelism of these two clauses illustrates very clearly the extended sense in which the word “flesh” is used by St. Paul, as may indeed be seen by the catalogue of the works of the flesh in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/galatians/5-19.htm" title="Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,">Galatians 5:19-20</a>. For here “the flesh,” in the first clause, includes both “the flesh and the mind” (or, more properly, the <span class= "ital">thoughts</span>) of the second; that is, it includes both the appetites and the passions of our fleshly nature, and also the “thoughts” of the mind itself, so far as it is devoted to this visible world of sense, alienated from God, and therefore under the influence of the powers of evil. In fact, in scriptural use the sins of “the flesh,” “the world,” and “the devil” are not different classes of sins, but different aspects of sin, and any one of the three great enemies is made at times to represent all.<p><span class= "bld">And were by nature the children of wrath, even as others</span> (or rather, <span class= "ital">the others—</span>that is, the heathen).—From this passage the phrase “children of wrath” has passed into Christian theology as an almost technical description of the unregenerate state. Hence it needs careful examination. (1) Now the phrase “children of wrath” (corresponding almost exactly to “children of a curse,” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-14.htm" title="Having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin; beguiling unstable souls: an heart they have exercised with covetous practices; cursed children:">2Peter 2:14</a>) seems borrowed from the Hebrew use in the Old Testament, by which (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-30.htm" title="Then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said to him, You son of the perverse rebellious woman, do not I know that you have chosen the son of Jesse to your own confusion, and to the confusion of your mother's nakedness?">1Samuel 20:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-5.htm" title="And David's anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he said to Nathan, As the LORD lives, the man that has done this thing shall surely die:">2Samuel 12:5</a>) a “son of death” is one under sentence of death, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-4.htm" title="Against whom do you sport yourselves? against whom make you a wide mouth, and draw out the tongue? are you not children of transgression, a seed of falsehood.">Isaiah 57:4</a> (the Greek translation) “children of destruction” are those doomed to perish. In this sense we have, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-12.htm" title="While I was with them in the world, I kept them in your name: those that you gave me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled.">John 17:12</a>, “the son of perdition;” and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-15.htm" title="Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you compass sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he is made, you make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves.">Matthew 23:15</a>, “the son of hell.” It differs, therefore, considerably from the phrase “children of disobedience” (begotten, as it were, of disobedience) above. But it is notable that the word for “children” here used is a term expressing endearment and love, and is accordingly properly, and almost invariably, applied to our relation to God. When, therefore, it is used as in this passage, or, still more strikingly, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-10.htm" title="In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whoever does not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loves not his brother.">1John 3:10</a>, “children of the devil” (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-44.htm" title="You are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father you will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and stayed not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.">John 8:44</a>), there is clearly an intention to arrest the attention by a startling and paradoxical expression. “We were children,” not of God, not of His love, but “of wrath”—that is, His wrath against sin; “born (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/galatians/3-10.htm" title="For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one that continues not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them.">Galatians 3:10-22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-4.htm" title="But when the fullness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law,">Galatians 4:4</a>) under the law,” and therefore “shut up under sin,” and “under the curse.” (2) Next, we have the phrase “by nature,” which, in the true reading of the original, is interposed, as a kind of limitation or definition, between “children” and “of wrath.” In the first instance it was probably suggested by the reference to Israel, who were by covenant, not by nature, the chosen people of God. Now the word “nature,” applied to humanity, indicates what is common to all, as opposed to what is individual, or what is inborn, as opposed to what is acquired. But whether it refers to humanity as it was created by God, or to humanity as it has become by “fault and corruption of nature,” must always be determined by the context. Here the reference is clearly to the latter. “Nature” is opposed to “grace”—that is, the nature of man as alienated from God, to the nature of man as restored to his original birthright, the “image of God,” in Jesus Christ. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/5-12.htm" title="Why, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed on all men, for that all have sinned:">Romans 5:12-21</a>.) The existence of an inborn sinfulness needs no revelation to make it evident to those who have eyes to see. It needs a revelation—and such a revelation the gospel gives—to declare to us that it is not man’s true nature, and that what is really original is not sin, but righteousness. (3) The whole passage, therefore, describes the state of men before their call to union with Christ, as naturally “under wrath,” and is well illustrated by the full description, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-18.htm" title="For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;">Romans 1:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-16.htm" title="In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel.">Romans 2:16</a>, of those on whom “the wrath of God is revealed.” There man’s state is depicted as having still some knowledge of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/1-19.htm" title="Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God has showed it to them.">Romans 1:19-21</a>), as having “the work of the law written on the heart” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/2-14.htm" title="For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law to themselves:">Romans 2:14-15</a>), and accordingly as being still under a probation before God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/2-6.htm" title="Who will render to every man according to his deeds:">Romans 2:6-11</a>). Elsewhere we learn that Christ, “the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world,” died for all, even “the ungodly” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/5-6.htm" title="For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly.">Romans 5:6-8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-1.htm" title="And I stood on the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and on his horns ten crowns, and on his heads the name of blasphemy.">Revelation 13:1</a>); and that none are wholly excluded from His atonement but those who “tread under foot the Son of God, and count the blood of the covenant an unholy thing” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-29.htm" title="Of how much sorer punishment, suppose you, shall he be thought worthy, who has trodden under foot the Son of God, and has counted the blood of the covenant, with which he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and has done despite to the Spirit of grace?">Hebrews 10:29</a>). Hence that state is not absolutely lost or hopeless. But yet, when the comparison, as here, is with the salvation of the gospel, they are declared “children of wrath” who are “strangers to the new covenant of promise,” with its two supernatural gifts of justification by faith and sanctification in the Spirit, and their condition is described, comparatively but not absolutely, as “having no hope, and without God in the world.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/ephesians/2.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-3.htm" title="Among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others.">Ephesians 2:3</a></span>. <span class="ital">Among whom also we </span>— Jews, as well as you Gentiles; <span class="ital">had our conversation </span>— That is, our course of life; <span class="ital">in times past </span>— At least in some degree, whatever our education or religious profession might have been.

A man dead in trespasses and sins has no desire for spiritual pleasures. When we look upon a corpse, it gives an awful feeling. A never-dying spirit is now fled, and has left nothing but the ruins of a man. But if we viewed things aright, we should be far more affected by the thought of a dead soul, a lost, fallen spirit. A state of sin is a state of conformity to this world. Wicked men are slaves to Satan. Satan is the author of that proud, carnal disposition which there is in ungodly men; he rules in the hearts of men. From Scripture it is clear, that whether men have been most prone to sensual or to spiritual wickedness, all men, being naturally children of disobedience, are also by nature children of wrath. What reason have sinners, then, to seek earnestly for that grace which will make them, of children of wrath, children of God and heirs of glory! God's eternal love or good-will toward his creatures, is the fountain whence all his mercies flow to us; and that love of God is great love, and that mercy is rich mercy. And every converted sinner is a saved sinner; delivered from sin and wrath. The grace that saves is the free, undeserved goodness and favour of God; and he saves, not by the works of the law, but through faith in Christ Jesus. Grace in the soul is a new life in the soul. A regenerated sinner becomes a living soul; he lives a life of holiness, being born of God: he lives, being delivered from the guilt of sin, by pardoning and justifying grace. Sinners roll themselves in the dust; sanctified souls sit in heavenly places, are raised above this world, by Christ's grace. The goodness of God in converting and saving sinners heretofore, encourages others in after-time, to hope in his grace and mercy. Our faith, our conversion, and our eternal salvation, are not of works, lest any man should boast. These things are not brought to pass by any thing done by us, therefore all boasting is shut out. All is the free gift of God, and the effect of being quickened by his power. It was his purpose, to which he prepared us, by blessing us with the knowledge of his will, and his Holy Spirit producing such a change in us, that we should glorify God by our good conversation, and perseverance in holiness. None can from Scripture abuse this doctrine, or accuse it of any tendency to evil. All who do so, are without excuse.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ephesians/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>We all had our conversation - see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-12.htm">2 Corinthians 1:12</a>; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-3.htm">1 Peter 4:3</a>.<p>In the lusts of our flesh - Living to gratify the flesh, or the propensities of a corrupt nature. It is observable here that the apostle changes the form of the address from "ye" to "we," thus including himself with others, and saying that this was true of "all" before their conversion. He means undoubtedly to say, that whatever might have been the place of their birth, or the differences of religion under which they had been trained, they were substantially alike by nature. It was a characteristic of all that they lived to fulfil the desires of the flesh and of the mind. The "design" of the apostle in thus grouping himself with them was, to show that he did not claim to be any better by nature than they were, and that all which any of them had of value was to be traced to the grace of God. There is much delicacy here on the part of the apostle. His object was to remind them of the former grossness of their life, and their exposure to the wrath of God. Yet he does not do it harshly. He includes himself in their number. He says that what he affirms of them was substantially true of himself - of all - that they were under condemnation, and exposed to the divine wrath.<p>Fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind - Margin, as in Greek, "wills." Complying with the wishes of a depraved nature. The "will of the flesh" is that to which the flesh, or the unrenewed nature of man, prompts; and Paul says that all had been engaged in fulfilling those fleshly propensities. This was clearly true of the pagan, and it was no less true of the unconverted Jew that he lived for himself, and sought to gratify the purposes of a depraved nature, though it might manifest itself in a way different from the pagan. The "will of the mind" referred to here relates to the wicked "thoughts and purposes" of the unrenewed nature - the sins which relate rather to the "intellect" than to the gross passions. Such, for instance, are the sins of pride, envy, ambition, covetousness, etc.; and Paul means to say, that before conversion they lived to gratify these propensities, and to accomplish these desires of the soul.<p>And were by nature - &#x3a6;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;  Fusei. By birth, or before we were converted By conversion and adoption they became the children of God; before that, they were all the children of wrath. This is, I think, the fair meaning of this important declaration. It does not affirm "when" they began to be such, or that they were such as soon as they were born, or that they were such before they became moral agents, or that they became such in virtue of their connection with Adam - whatever may be the truth on these points; but it affirms that before they were renewed, they were the children of wrath. So far as This text is concerned, this might have been true at their very birth; but it does not directly and certainly prove that. It proves that at no time before their conversion were they the children of God, but that their whole condition before that was one of exposure to wrath; compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/2-14.htm">Romans 2:14</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-27.htm">Romans 2:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-14.htm">1 Corinthians 11:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-15.htm">Galatians 2:15</a>. Some people are born Jews, and some pagan; some free, and some slaves; some white, and some black; some are born to poverty, and some to wealth; some are the children of kings, and some of beggars; but, whatever their rank or condition, they are born exposed to wrath, or in a situation which would render them liable to wrath. But why this is, the apostle does not say. Whether for their own sins or for the sins of another; whether by a corrupted soul, or by imputed guilt; whether they act as moral agents as soon as born, or at a certain period of childhood, Paul does not say. <p>The children of wrath - Exposed to wrath, or liable to wrath. They did not by nature inherit holiness; they inherited that which would subject; them to wrath. The meaning has been well expressed by Doddridge, who refers it "to the original apostasy and corruption, in consequence of which people do, according to the course of nature, fall early into personal guilt, and so become obnoxious to the divine displeasure." Many modern expositors have supposed that this has no reference to any original tendency of our fallen nature to sin, or to native corruption, but that it refers to the "habit" of sin, or to the fact of their having been the slaves of appetite and passion. I admit that the direct and immediate sense of the passage is that they were, when without the gospel, and before they were renewed, the children of wrath; but still the fair interpretation is, that they were born to that state, and that that condition was the regular result of their native depravity; and I do not know a more strong or positive declaration that can be made to show that people are by nature destitute of holiness, and exposed to perdition.<p>Even as others - That is, "do not suppose that you stand alone, or that you are the worst of the species. You are indeed, by nature, the children of wrath; but not you alone. All others were the same. You have a common inheritance with them. I do not mean to charge you with being the worst of sinners, or as being alone transgressors. It is the common lot of man - the sad, gloomy inheritance to which we all are born." The Greek is, &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#788; &#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;  hoi loipoi "the remainder, or the others," - including all; compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-19.htm">Romans 5:19</a>. This doctrine that people without the gospel are the children of wrath, Paul had fully defended in <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/1.htm">Romans 1-3</a>. Perhaps no truth is more frequently stated in the Bible; none is more fearful and awful in its character. What a declaration, that we "are by nature the children of wrath!" Who should not inquire what it means? Who should not make an effort to escape from the wrath to come, and become a child of glory and an heir of life? <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ephesians/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. also we&#8212;that is, we also. Paul here joins himself in the same category with them, passing from the second person (Eph 2:1, 2) to the first person here.<p>all&#8212;Jews and Gentiles.<p>our conversation&#8212;"our way of life" (2Co 1:12; 1Pe 1:18). This expression implies an outwardly more decorous course, than the open "walk" in gross sins on the part of the majority of Ephesians in times past, the Gentile portion of whom may be specially referred to in Eph 2:2. Paul and his Jewish countrymen, though outwardly more seemly than the Gentiles (Ac 26:4, 5, 18), had been essentially like them in living to the unrenewed flesh, without the Spirit of God.<p>fulfilling&#8212;Greek, doing.<p>mind&#8212;Greek, "our thoughts." Mental suggestions and purposes (independent of God), as distinguished from the blind impulses of "the flesh."<p>and were by nature&#8212;He intentionally breaks off the construction, substituting "and we were" for "and being," to mark emphatically his and their past state by nature, as contrasted with their present state by grace. Not merely is it, we had our way of life fulfilling our fleshly desires, and so being children of wrath; but we were by nature originally "children of wrath," and so consequently had our way of life fulfilling our fleshly desires. "Nature," in Greek, implies that which has grown in us as the peculiarity of our being, growing with our growth, and strengthening with our strength, as distinguished from that which has been wrought on us by mere external influences: what is inherent, not acquired (Job 14:4; Ps 51:5). An incidental proof of the doctrine of original sin.<p>children of wrath&#8212;not merely "sons," as in the Greek, "sons of disobedience" (Eph 2:2), but "children" by generation; not merely by adoption, as "sons" might be. The Greek order more emphatically marks this innate corruption: "Those who in their (very) nature are children of wrath"; Eph 2:5, "grace" is opposed to "nature" here; and salvation (implied in Eph 2:5, 8, "saved") to "wrath." Compare Article IX, Church of England Common Prayer Book. "Original sin (birth-sin), standeth not in the following of Adam, but is the fault and corruption of the nature of every man, naturally engendered of Adam [Christ was supernaturally conceived by the Holy Ghost of the Virgin], whereby man is very far gone from original righteousness, and is of his own nature inclined to evil; and therefore, in every person born into this world, it deserveth God's wrath and damnation." Paul shows that even the Jews, who boasted of their birth from Abraham, were by natural birth equally children of wrath as the Gentiles, whom the Jews despised on account of their birth from idolaters (Ro 3:9; 5:12-14). "Wrath abideth" on all who disobey the Gospel in faith and practice (Joh 3:36). The phrase, "children of wrath," is a Hebraism, that is, objects of God's wrath from childhood, in our natural state, as being born in the sin which God hates. So "son of death" (2Sa 12:5, Margin); "son of perdition" (Joh 17:12; 2Th 2:3).<p>as others&#8212;Greek, "as the rest" of mankind are (1Th 4:13).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ephesians/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Among whom also we all; </span> we apostles and believers of the Jews.

What the apostle says of the Gentile Ephesians before conversion, he says of himself and other Jews; and this he does, partly to show that it was not from ill will, or with a design to upbraid the Gentiles, that he said what he did; and partly to beat down the pride of the Jews, who thought themselves better than the sinners of the Gentiles; as well as to magnify the grace of God in the conversion of them both: the sense is, that the apostle and other Jews in the time of their unregeneracy, had their conversation according to the customs of the world, and to the prince of the air, and among unbelievers, as well as the Gentiles; and that they were equally sinners, and lived a like sinful course of life: <p>in the lusts of our flesh; by "flesh" is meant, the corruption of nature; so called, because it is propagated by natural generation; and is opposed to the Spirit, or principle of grace; and has for its object fleshly things; and discovers itself mostly in the body, the flesh; and it makes persons carnal or fleshly: and this is called "our", because it belongs to human nature, and is inherent in it, and inseparable from it in this life: and the "lusts" of it, are the inward motions of it, in a contrariety to the law and will of God; and are various, and are sometimes called fleshly and worldly lusts, and the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life: and persons may be said to have their conversations in these, when these are the ground of their conversation, when they are solicitous about them, and make provision for the fulfilling of them, and constantly employ themselves in obedience to them, as follows: <p>fulfilling the desires of the flesh, and of the mind: or the wills of them; what they incline to, will, and crave after: various are the degrees of sin, and its several motions; and universal is the corruption of human nature; not only the body, and the several members of it, are defiled with sin, and disposed to it, but all the powers and faculties of the soul; even the more noble and governing ones, the mind, understanding, and will, as well as the affections; and great is the power and influence which lust has over them: <p>and were by nature children of wrath, even as others: by which is meant, not only that they were wrathful persons, living in malice, hateful, and hating one another; but that they were deserving of the wrath of God, which comes upon the children of disobedience, among whom they had their conversation; and which is revealed from heaven against such sins as they were guilty of, though they were not appointed to it: and they were such "by nature"; really, and not in opinion, and by and from their first birth: so a Jewish commentator (s) on these words, "thy first father hath sinned", <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-27.htm">Isaiah 43:27</a> has this note; <p>"how canst thou say thou hast not sinned? and behold thy first father hath sinned, and he is the first man, for man , "is naturally in sin";'' <p>or by nature a sinner, or sin is naturally impressed in him; and hence being by nature a sinner, he is by nature deserving of the wrath of God, as were the persons spoken of: <p>even as others; as the rest of the world, Jews as well as Gentiles; and Gentiles are especially designed, in distinction from the Jews, the apostle is speaking of; and who are particularly called in the Jewish dialect  "others"; See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-11.htm">Luke 18:11</a>. <p>(s) Kimchi in loc. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/ephesians/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{6}</span> Among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and <span class="cverse3">{7}</span> were by nature the <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> children of wrath, even as <span class="cverse3">{f}</span> others.</span><p>(6) After he has separately condemned the Gentiles, he confesses that the Jews (among whom he numbers himself) are not the least bit better.<p>(d) By the name of flesh in the first place, he means the whole man, which he divides into two parts: into the flesh, which is the part that the philosophers consider to be without reason, and into the thought, which they call reasonable.

The fact that on <span class="ital">this</span> account <span class="greekheb">ἦμεν</span> is <span class="ital">prefixed</span> has been left unnoticed, and hence <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἦμεν</span> has been either tacitly (so usually) or expressly (as by Fritzsche, <span class="ital">Conject</span>. p. 45, who takes <span class="greekheb">ἐν ταῖς ἐπιθυμ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τῆς σαρκὸς ἡμῶν ποιοῦντες κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. together as one clause) connected with <span class="greekheb">ἐν οἷς</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἀνεστρ</span>.

The AV gives “also we all”; Tynd., Cov., Gen., “we also had”; Bish., “we all had”; RV, “we also all”. The <span class="greekheb">ἐν οἷς</span> cannot mean “in which <span class="ital">trespasses</span>” (so Syr., Jer., Beng., etc.); for the <span class="greekheb">ὑμῶν</span> of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-1.htm" title="And you has he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins;">Ephesians 2:1</a> is against that, and the form would have been <span class="greekheb">ἐν αἷς</span> as ruled by the nearest noun <span class="greekheb">ἁμαρτίαις</span>. It can only refer to the <span class="greekheb">υἱοὶ τῆς ἀπειθείας</span>. The <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἡμεῖς πάντες</span> is in contrast with the <span class="greekheb">καὶ ὑμᾶς</span> of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-1.htm" title="And you has he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins;">Ephesians 2:1</a> and the <span class="greekheb">περιεπατήσατε</span> of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-2.htm" title="Wherein in time past you walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now works in the children of disobedience:">Ephesians 2:2</a>. Paul had begun by speaking of the moral condition of these Gentiles before their conversion. He now adds that these Gentiles were in no exceptional position in that respect, but that all, Jews as well as Greeks, Jewish-Christians like himself no less than Gentile Christians like his readers, had been among those who once lived in obstinate disobedience to God. Paul seldom misses the opportunity of declaring the universal sinfulness of men, the dire level of corruptness on which all, however they differed in race or privilege, stood. So here the <span class="greekheb">ἡμεῖς πάντες</span> is best taken in its utmost breadth—not merely “all the Jewish-Christians” (Mey.), but = the whole body of us Christians, Jewish and Gentile alike included. For the <span class="greekheb">περιεπατήσατε</span> of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-2.htm" title="Wherein in time past you walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now works in the children of disobedience:">Ephesians 2:2</a> we have now <span class="greekheb">ἀνεστράφημεν</span>, “had our conversation” (AV), “conversed” (Rhem.), “lived” (RV). Like the Heb. <span class="greekheb">חָלַךְ</span> it denotes one’s walk, his active, open life, his way of conducting himself.—<span class="greekheb">ἐν ταῖς ἐπιθυμίαις τῆς σαρκὸς ἡμῶν</span>: <span class="ital">in the lusts of our flesh</span>. Definition of the domain or element in which their life once was spent. It kept within the confines of the appetites and impulses proper to fallen human nature or springing from it. The noun <span class="greekheb">ἐπιθυμία</span> has its usual sense of <span class="ital">craving</span>, the craving in particular of what is forbidden; <span class="greekheb">σάρξ</span> in like manner has its large, theological sense, human nature as such, in its physical, mental and moral entirety, considered as apart from God and under the dominion of sin.—<span class="greekheb">ποιοῦντες τὰ θελήματα τῆς σαρκὸς καὶ τῶν διανοιῶν</span>: <span class="ital">doing the desires of the flesh and of the thoughts</span>. The <span class="greekheb">ποιοῦντες</span> is sufficiently represented by the “doing” of Wycl., Cov., Rhem., RV. The AV and other Versions give “fulfilling”. The word <span class="greekheb">θέλημα</span> is of very rare occurrence, except in biblical and ecclesiastical Greek. It denotes properly the <span class="ital">thing willed</span>, but is used also of the Divine <span class="ital">purpose</span> (<span class="ital">e.g.</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-9.htm" title="Having made known to us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he has purposed in himself:">Ephesians 1:9</a>), or <span class="ital">command</span> (<span class="ital">e.g.</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-17.htm" title="Why be you not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord is.">Ephesians 5:17</a>), etc. Here, as also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-13.htm" title="Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.">John 1:13</a>, it denotes <span class="ital">inclination</span> or <span class="ital">desire</span>. The pl. <span class="greekheb">διανοιῶν</span> is best rendered “thoughts,” with Wycl., Cov., Rhem. and RV margin; RV text, following the AV and other Versions, gives “mind”. In the LXX the singular represents the OT <span class="greekheb">לֵב</span>, and denotes the <span class="ital">mind</span> in the large sense, inclusive of understanding, feeling and desiring. It is only the context that gives it the sense of <span class="ital">wicked</span> thoughts. Two sources of evil desire and impulse, therefore, are indicated here, <span class="ital">viz.</span>, our fallen nature in general and the laboratory of perverted thoughts, impressions, imaginations, volitions, in particular.—<span class="greekheb">καὶ ἦμεν τέκνα φύσει ὀργῆς</span>: <span class="ital">and were children by nature of wrath</span>. “Children,” rather than “<span class="ital">the</span> children,” as it is given by AV and all the other old English Versions (except Wycl., who has “the sons”). From what he and his fellow-Christians <span class="ital">did</span> in their pre-Christian life, Paul turns now to what they <span class="ital">were</span> then. The statement is so constructed as to throw the chief emphasis on the <span class="greekheb">ἧμεν</span> and the <span class="greekheb">ὀργῆς</span>. For <span class="greekheb">ἦμεν</span> the better attested form is <span class="greekheb">ἤμεθα</span>. Some good MSS. and Versions ([133] [134] [135] [136] [137], Syr.-Harcl., Vulg.) read <span class="greekheb">φύσει τέκνα</span>, and that order is accepted by Lachmann, while a place is given it in the margin by Tregelles. The order <span class="greekheb">τέκνα φύσει</span>, however, which is that of [138] [139] [140], Chrys., etc., and both the TR and the RV, is to be preferred. The <span class="greekheb">ἧμεν</span> makes it clear that it is no longer <span class="ital">doing</span> (<span class="greekheb">ποιοῦντες</span>) simply that is in view, but <span class="ital">being, condition</span>. The <span class="greekheb">τέκνα</span> is the same kind of idiomatic phrase as the former <span class="greekheb">υἱοί</span>, only, if possible, stronger and more significant. It describes those in view as not only worthy of the <span class="greekheb">ὀργή</span>, but actually <span class="ital">subject</span> to it, definitely <span class="ital">under</span> it. But what is this <span class="greekheb">ὀργή</span> itself? It is not to be identified with <span class="ital">punitive righteousness</span> (<span class="greekheb">τιμωρία</span>), <span class="ital">punishment</span> (<span class="greekheb">κόλασις</span>), future <span class="ital">judgment</span>, or the <span class="ital">effect</span> of God’s present judgment of men, but denotes the <span class="ital">quality</span> or <span class="ital">affectus</span> of wrath. But is it <span class="ital">man’s</span> wrath or <span class="ital">God’s?</span> The word is certainly used of the passion of wrath in us (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-31.htm" title="Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamor, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice:">Ephesians 4:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-8.htm" title=" But now you also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth.">Colossians 3:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-19.htm" title="Why, my beloved brothers, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:">Jam 1:19</a>, etc.), and so the whole phrase is understood by some to mean nothing more than that those referred to were given to violent anger or ungovernable impulse (<span class="ital">e.g.</span>, Maurice, <span class="ital">Unity</span>, p. 538). But this would add little or nothing to what was said of the lusts of the flesh and thoughts, and would strip the whole statement of its point, its solemnity, and its universality. It is the Divine wrath that is in view here; as it is, indeed, in thirteen out of twenty occurrences in the Pauline writings, and that, too, whether with or without the definite article or the defining <span class="greekheb">Θεοῦ</span> (<span class="ital">cf.</span> Moule, <span class="ital">in loc</span>). This holy displeasure of God with sin is not inconsistent with His love, but is the reaction of that love against the denial of its sovereign rights of responsive love. The term <span class="greekheb">φύσις</span>, though it may occasionally be applied to what is <span class="ital">habitual</span> or to character as <span class="ital">developed</span>, means properly what is <span class="ital">innate, implanted</span>, in one by <span class="ital">nature</span>, and this with different shades of meaning (<span class="ital">cf., e.g.</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-14.htm" title="For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law to themselves:">Romans 2:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-15.htm" title="We who are Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles,">Galatians 2:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-8.htm" title="However, then, when you knew not God, you did service to them which by nature are no gods.">Galatians 4:8</a>, etc.). The clause means, therefore, that in their pre-Christian life those meant by the <span class="greekheb">ἡμεῖς πάντες</span> were in the condition of subjection to the Divine wrath; and that they were so not by deed merely, nor by circumstance, nor by passing into it, but by nature. Their universal sin has been already affirmed. This universal sin is now described as sin by nature. Beyond this Paul does not go in the present passage. But the one is the explanation of the other. Universal sin implies a law of sinning, a sin that is of the nature; and this, again, is the explanation of the fact that all are under the Divine wrath. For the Divine wrath operates only where sin is. Here is the essential meaning of the doctrine of <span class="ital">original sin.</span> That it finds any justification here is denied, indeed, by some; even by Meyer, who admits, however, that elsewhere (<span class="ital">e.g.</span>, in Romans 6) Paul teaches that there is a principle of sin in man by nature, and that man sins actually because of that innate principle. But he argues that it is in virtue not of the principle itself, but of the acts of sin by which that principle expresses itself, that we are in a state of subjection to the Divine wrath. This, however, is to make a nature which originates sinful acts and which does that in the case of all men without exception, itself a neutral thing.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[133] Codex Alexandrinus (sæc. v.), at the British Museum, published in photographic facsimile by Sir E.

The Apostle willingly, and truly, identifies his own experience with that of his converts.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">had our conversation</span>] Lit., <span class="bld">moved up and down</span>; engaged in the activities of life. <span class="ital">Conversatio</span> in Latin, like the Gr. word here, means precisely this; the goings in and out of human <span class="ital">intercourse;</span> not specially the exchange of <span class="ital">speech</span>, to which the word “conversation” is now restricted.—In <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-20.htm" title="For our conversation is in heaven; from where also we look for the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ:">Php 3:20</a> the Gr. original is different.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the lusts of our flesh</span>] Better, <span class="bld">the desires</span>. “Lusts” is narrowed in modern usage to a special class of sensual appetites, but the older English knew no such fixed restriction; see <span class="ital">e.g.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-12.htm" title="What man is he that desires life, and loves many days, that he may see good?">Psalm 34:12</a>, in the Prayer Book (Cranmer’s) Version; “what man is he that <span class="ital">lusteth to live?</span>” and <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-17.htm" title="For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that you cannot do the things that you would.">Galatians 5:17</a>, where the Spirit, as well as the flesh, “lusteth.”—Sinful “lusts” are thus <span class="ital">all desires</span>, whether gross or fine in themselves, which are against the will of God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“<span class="ital">Our flesh:</span>”—this important word, wherever it occurs in N.T. in connexion with the doctrine of sin, means human nature as conditioned by the Fall, or, to word it otherwise, either the state of the unregenerate being, in which state the sinful principle dominates, or the state of that element of the regenerate being in which the principle, dislodged, as it were, from the centre, still lingers and is felt; not dominant in the being, but present. (For its permanence, till death, in the regenerate, see the implied statements of <span class="ital">e.g.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-16.htm" title="This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh.">Galatians 5:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-3.htm" title="For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh.">Php 3:3</a>.) We may account for the use of the word <span class="ital">flesh</span> as a symbol for this phenomenon by the fact that sin works so largely under conditions of bodily, fleshly, life in the literal sense of those words. See further, note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-4.htm" title="That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.">Romans 8:4</a> in this Series.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">fulfilling the desires</span>] Lit., <span class="bld">doing the wishes</span>. This (see last note) does not mean that “we” were loose livers, in the common sense; we might or might not have been such. But we followed the bent of the unregenerate Ego, whatever on the whole it was.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">of the mind</span>] Lit., <span class="bld">of the thoughts</span>; in the sense generally of reflection and impression. The word is used (in the singular) <span class="ital">e.g.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-37.htm" title="Jesus said to him, You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.">Matthew 22:37</a>; “with all thy mind,” representing the Heb. “heart” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-5.htm" title="And you shall love the LORD your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your might.">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-20.htm" title="And we know that the Son of God is come, and has given us an understanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life.">1 John 5:20</a>; “He hath given us an understanding.” Here probably the distinction is between sin in imagination and sin in positive action (“of the <span class="ital">flesh</span>”); one of the many warnings of Scripture that moral evil lies as deep as possible in the texture and motion of the fallen nature. Cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-19.htm" title="For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies:">Matthew 15:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-1.htm" title="Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.">2 Corinthians 7:1</a>, and see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-9.htm" title="The thought of foolishness is sin: and the scorner is an abomination to men.">Proverbs 24:9</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">by nature the children of wrath</span>] On the phrase “children of wrath” see last note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-2.htm" title="Wherein in time past you walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now works in the children of disobedience:">Ephesians 2:2</a>. “By nature we were connected with, we essentially were exposed to, wrath, the wrath of God.” It has been suggested that “children of wrath” may mean no more than “beings <span class="ital">prone to</span> violent anger,” or even to “ungoverned <span class="ital">impulse</span>” generally. But the word “wrath” is frequent with St Paul, and in 13 out of the 20 places it unmistakably means the Divine wrath, even where “of God” is not added, and where the definite article is absent. See for passages specially in point <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-15.htm" title="Because the law works wrath: for where no law is, there is no transgression.">Romans 4:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-9.htm" title="Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him.">Romans 5:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-22.htm" title="What if God, willing to show his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much long-suffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction:">Romans 9:22</a>; below, ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-6.htm" title="Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things comes the wrath of God on the children of disobedience.">Ephesians 5:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-9.htm" title="For God has not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,">1 Thessalonians 5:9</a>. Add to this that this passage deals with the deepest and most general facts, and it is thus unlikely that any one special phase of sin would be instanced.—N. T. usage gives <span class="ital">no</span> support to the suggested explanation “ungoverned <span class="ital">impulse</span>” mentioned above. The word must mean “wrath,” whether of man or of God.—Translate, certainly, with A. V. and R. V.—On the truth that the fallen being, as such, lies under Divine “wrath,” see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-36.htm" title="He that believes on the Son has everlasting life: and he that believes not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God stays on him.">John 3:36</a>, where “the wrath of God <span class="ital">remaineth</span> against” the soul which does not submit to the Son. Not to “possess eternal life” is to have that “wrath” for certain still impending.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And what is the Divine wrath? No arbitrary or untempered passion in the Eternal, but the antagonism of the eternal Holiness to sin; only—the antagonism of an Eternal Person. Von Gerlach, quoted by Monod on this verse, writes: “The forgetfulness at the present day of the doctrine of the wrath of God has exercised a baneful influence on the various relations in which man holds the place of God, and in particular on the government of the family and the state.” The antithesis to the truth about it is the <span class="ital">dictum</span> of the “Absolute Religion,” that “there is nothing in God to fear;” words in complete discord with great lines of revelation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“<span class="ital">By nature:</span>”—i.e., by our unregenerate state in itself, not only by circumstances. For illustration see <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-15.htm" title="We who are Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles,">Galatians 2:15</a>, (“Jews by nature”) and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-8.htm" title="Why he said, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts to men.">Ephesians 4:8</a>, (“by nature no Gods”). Such was our state antecedent to the new process, <span class="ital">ab extra</span>, of regeneration. We have here the doctrine of “Original or Birth Sin,” as given in Art ix. of the Church of England. “That which provokes the wrath of God is not only in the individual, but in the race and in the nature” (Monod). A greater mystery we could not state; but neither could we name a surer fact “Original sin is, fundamentally, simply <span class="ital">universal</span> sin. That is the fact which is at once the evidence and the substance of it … Universal sin must receive the same interpretation that any other universal does, namely that it implies a <span class="ital">law</span>, in consequence of which it is universal. Nobody supposes that anything takes place universally by chance … we know there must be some law working in the case … What we <span class="ital">call</span> the law is a secondary question. The great thing is to see that there is a law. If all the individuals who come under the head of a certain nature have sin in them, then one mode of expressing this law is to say that it <span class="ital">belongs to the nature</span>, the nature being the common property and ground in which all meet” (J. B. Mozley, <span class="ital">Lectures</span>, ix. pp. 136, &c.).

"We also," as well as you - we were all in the same condemnation, all in a miserable plight, not merely occasionally dipping into sin, but spending our very lives in the lusts or desires of our flesh, living fro' no noble ends, but in an element of carnal desire, as if there were nothing higher than to please the carnal nature. <span class="cmt_word">Fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind.</span> Desires of the flesh, the grosser and more animal propensities (the flesh, in Scripture, has often a wider sense; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-19.htm">Galatians 5:19-21</a>); and of the mind or thoughts, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, the objects that we thought about, whatever they might be, - the <span class="accented">waywardness</span> of our thoughts seems to be denoted, the random roaming of the mind hither and thither, towards this pleasure and that, sometimes serious, sometimes frivolous, but all marked by the absence of any controlling regard to the will of God. The life indicated is a life of indulgence in whatever natural feelings may arise in us-be they right or be they wrong. <span class="cmt_word">And we were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest.</span> This is a substantive clause, standing on its own basis, a separate fact, not merely an inference from the previous statements. The <span class="accented">life</span> described would have exposed us to wrath; but beyond and before this we were <span class="accented">by nature</span> children of wrath. "By nature" denotes something in our constitution, in our very being; and "even as the rest" denotes that this was universal, not a peculiarity affecting some, but a general feature applicable to all. "Children of wrath" denotes that we belonged to a race which had incurred the wrath of God; our individuality was so far absorbed by the social body that we shared the lot under which it had come. If there be something in this that seems contrary to justice, that seems to condemn men for the sins of others, we remark <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that in actual life we constantly find individuals suffering for the sin of the corporation, domestic, social, or national, with which they are identified; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that apart from this altogether, our individual offenses would expose us to God's wrath; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> that the moral and legal relations of the individual to the corporation is a subject of difficulty, and in this case makes a strong demand on our faith. We should accept the teaching of the Word of God upon it, and leave our righteous Judge to vindicate himself. "Wrath," as applied to God, must be regarded as essentially different from the same word when used of man. In the latter case it usually indicates a disorderly, excited, passionate feeling, as of one who has lost self-control; when used of God, it denotes the holy, calm, deep opposition of his nature to sin, compelling him to inflict the appropriate punishment. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/ephesians/2.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Had our conversation (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;)<p>See on the kindred noun conversation, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter 1:15</a>.

Wrath (&#x3bf;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2;) is God's holy hatred of sin; His essential, necessary antagonism to everything evil, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-18.htm">Romans 1:18</a>. By nature (&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;) accords with children, implying what; is innate. That man is born with a sinful nature, and that God and sin are essentially antagonistic, are conceded on all hands: but that unconscious human beings come into the world under the blaze of God's indignation, hardly consists with Christ's assertion that to little children belongs the kingdom of heaven. It is true that there is a birth-principle of evil, which, if suffered to develop, will bring upon itself the wrath of God. Whether Paul means more than this I do not know.<p>Others (&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#788; &#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;)<p>Rev., correctly, the rest. </body></html>
