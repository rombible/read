On the reconciliation of man to God, see the great passage <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/5-18.htm" title="And all things are of God, who has reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and has given to us the ministry of reconciliation;">2Corinthians 5:18-21</a>. But it should be noted that in the original the word used here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/colossians/1-20.htm" title=" And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things to himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven.">Colossians 1:20-21</a> (and nowhere else) is a compound signifying not simply to “conciliate,” but properly to “reconcile,”—that is to reunite those who were originally united, but afterwards separated by the sin of man. This brings out the profound idea, which so especially characterises these Epistles, of a primeval unity of all created being in Christ, marred and broken by sin, and restored by His manifestation in human flesh. Note that the passage in the Colossians (on which see Notes) has a far wider scope than this passage—“having made peace through the blood of His cross, by Him to reconcile all things to Himself; by Him (I say), whether they be things on earth or things in heaven.” On the other hand, this passage characteristically still lays stress on the idea “in one body”—that is, as throughout, His mystical body, the Church—although probably the phrase is suggested here by the thought of the natural body of the Lord offered on the cross, which is clearly referred to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-21.htm" title=" And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now has he reconciled">Colossians 1:21</a>. There is a similar connection of thought in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/10-16.htm" title="The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?">1Corinthians 10:16-17</a>, “The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ? For we are all one bread, and one body.”<p><span class= "bld">By the cross, having slain the enmity thereby.</span>—In this verse (in accordance with the context) “the enmity,” which by His death He “slew,” is the barrier between God and man, created by sin, but brought out by the Law, as hard and rigid law, “in ordinances” of which St. Paul does not hesitate to say that “sin took occasion by it,” and “by it slew” man (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-11.htm" title="For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me.">Romans 7:11</a>). This is illustrated by the cognate, though different, metaphor of <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-14.htm" title=" Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross;">Colossians 2:14</a>, where it is said of Christ that He “blotted out the handwriting of ordinances which was against us, which was contrary unto us, and took it out of the way, <span class= "ital">nailing it to His cross.”</span> Compare also, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/galatians/2-19.htm" title="For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live to God.">Galatians 2:19-20</a>, the connection of spiritual “death to the Law” with our partaking of our Lord’s crucifixion: “I, through the Law, am dead to the Law, that I might live unto God. <span class= "ital">I am crucified with Christ, </span>nevertheless I live. . . . by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me and <span class= "ital">gave Himself for me.”</span> By His death Christ has both redeemed us from sin, and also “redeemed (properly, <span class= "ital">bought</span>) us from the curse of the Law” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-13.htm" title="Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangs on a tree:">Galatians 3:13</a>).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:14-18 Jesus Christ made peace by the sacrifice of himself; in every sense Christ was their Peace, the author, centre, and substance of their being at peace with God, and of their union with the Jewish believers in one church. Through the person, sacrifice, and mediation of Christ, sinners are allowed to draw near to God as a Father, and are brought with acceptance into his presence, with their worship and services, under the teaching of the Holy Spirit, as one with the Father and the Son. Christ purchased leave for us to come to God; and the Spirit gives a heart to come, and strength to come, and then grace to serve God acceptably.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ephesians/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And that he might reconcile both unto God - This was another of the effects of the work of redemption, and indeed the main effect. It was not merely to make them harmonious, but it was that both, who had been alienated from God, should be reconciled to "him." This was a different effect from that of producing peace between themselves, though in some sense the one grew out of the other. They who are reconciled to God will be at peace with each other. They will feel that they are of the same family, and are all brethren. On the subject of reconciliation, see the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-18.htm">2 Corinthians 5:18</a>.<p>In one body - One spiritual personage - the church; see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-23.htm">Ephesians 1:23</a>.<p>By the cross - By the atonement which he made on the cross; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-20.htm">Colossians 1:20</a>; compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-25.htm">Romans 3:25</a>. It is by the atonement only that men ever become reconciled to God.<p>Having slain the enmity - Not only the enmity between Jews and Gentiles, but the enmity between the sinner and God. He has by that death removed all the obstacles to reconciliation on the part of God and on the part of man. It is made efficacious in removing the enmity of the sinner against God, and producing peace.<p>Thereby - Margin, "in himself."

This is another end of the abrogation of the ceremonial law: the Jews had run up a long score against the ceremonial law, as well as against the moral law; and Christ by fulfilling it for them, and thereby abrogating it, reconciled them; and the Gentiles could not be reconciled together with them, without the abrogation of it: and this reconciliation of them is made to God, who was the person offended; and who yet first set on foot a reconciliation, in which his glory is greatly concerned; and reconciliation with others depends upon reconciliation with him: and this is made <p>in one body by the cross; by which "body" is meant, the human body of Christ, which the Father prepared for him, and he assumed, and that in order to make reconciliation for his people; and is said to be "one" body, because it was in one and the same body, which he reconciled both Jews and Gentiles unto God, and in or by one sacrifice of that body; reconciliation being so effectually made by it that there is no need of a reiteration: or the sense is, he reconciled them into "one body"; into one mystical body, the church, of which he is head; and this he did "by the cross", that is, by his blood shed on the cross, or by his suffering the death of the cross; which shows that reconciliation is made in a way of satisfaction to the law and justice of God, by Christ's bearing the penalty of the law, and suffering the strokes of justice on the cross; and expresses the efficacy of his blood and sacrifice, and the greatness of his condescension and love: <p>having slain the enmity thereby; the ceremonial law, as before; and the slaying it is the same with abolishing it; unless the enmity between God and man is meant, which was slain by removing the cause of it, sin; and which laid a foundation for the slaying of it in the hearts of his people in regeneration, when sin is made odious to them, and they are reconciled to God's way of salvation; hence being slain in both senses, peace with God can never be broken. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/ephesians/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And that he might reconcile both unto God in <span class="cverse3">{o}</span> one body by the cross, having <span class="cverse3">{p}</span> slain the enmity thereby:</span><p>(o) He alludes to the sacrifices of the Law, which represented that true and only sacrifice.<p>(p) For he destroyed death by death, and fastened it as it were to the cross.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/ephesians/2.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-16.htm" title="And that he might reconcile both to God in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby:">Ephesians 2:16</a>.

Grotius correctly observes: “idem hie valet, quod modo <span class="greekheb">λύσας</span>, sed crucis facta mentione, aptior fuit translatio verbi <span class="greekheb">ἀποκτείνας</span>, quia crux mortem adfert.” And the <span class="greekheb">ἔχθρα</span> (here personified) is not to be explained otherwise than in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-14.htm" title="For he is our peace, who has made both one, and has broken down the middle wall of partition between us;">Ephesians 2:14</a>; hence not the <span class="ital">law</span> (Michaelis, Koppe, Holzhausen), nor the hostile relation of the Jews and Gentiles towards <span class="ital">God</span> (most expositors, including Rückert, Meier, Harless, Hofmann), but the enmity of the two <span class="ital">towards each other</span>. The aim of the apostle was not to explain the nature of the atonement in general as such, but to show how Christ has reconciled with God the Jews and Gentiles <span class="ital">combined into unity</span>, and to this end it was pertinent to say that He had cancelled the enmity which had hitherto subsisted between them. The <span class="ital">aorist participle</span>, we may add, affirms not something simultaneous with <span class="greekheb">ἀποκαταλλ</span>. (<span class="ital">ita ut interficeret</span>), but something <span class="ital">preceding</span> (<span class="ital">after that</span> He has slain), so that the <span class="ital">relation of time</span> is conceived of otherwise than in the case of the correlative <span class="greekheb">ποιῶν εἰρήνην</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-15.htm" title="Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself of two one new man, so making peace;">Ephesians 2:15</a>. Paul, namely, has conceived the matter thus: Christ has desired by His death on the cross to cancel the mutual enmity between Jews and Gentiles (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-15.htm" title="Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself of two one new man, so making peace;">Ephesians 2:15</a>), and then by means of this death to reconcile both, who should now in this manner be united into one aggregate, <span class="greekheb">ἐν ἑνὶ σώματι</span> with God. In reality these are indeed only different <span class="ital">sides</span> of the effect of the death of Christ on the cross, not separate and successive effects; but in the representation unfolding the subject, in which Paul will here, as in a picture, set the matter before us in its various elements, they appear so, and this is in keeping with the whole solemn pathos which is shed over the passage.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐν αὐτῷ</span> <span class="ital">i.e.</span> <span class="ital">on the cross</span>. The reference to <span class="greekheb">σώματι</span> (Bengel, Semler, Hofmann, following Tertullian) falls with the correct explanation of <span class="greekheb">ἐν ἐνὶ σώματι</span>. The reading <span class="greekheb">ἐν ἑαυτῷ</span> (F G, 115, codd. in Jer. Arab. pol Vulg. It. Goth. Syr. p. Ambr. Aug.) would yield the same sense as that reference to <span class="greekheb">σώματι</span>, but is a conformation to <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-15.htm" title="Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself of two one new man, so making peace;">Ephesians 2:15</a>, in accordance with which Luther also translated “<span class="ital">through Himself</span>.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[154] Hofmann, after Tertull. <span class="ital">c. Marc.</span> v. 17, attaches it to the following <span class="greekheb">ἀποκτ</span>., by which, however, the emphasis that manifestly lies on <span class="greekheb">ἀποκτ</span>. is pushed forward to <span class="greekheb">διὰ τοῦ σταυροῦ</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[155] “In His person subsists the newness of human nature for them, and in His body, wherein [as a bodily living man] He has gone unto God, they have the place where mankind is restored to communion with God,” Hofmann, p. 380. With this explaining away of the atonement it was no doubt consistent to connect <span class="greekheb">διὰ τοῦ σταυροῦ</span> with <span class="greekheb">ἀποκτ</span>., and to refer back <span class="greekheb">ἐν αὐτῷ</span> to the <span class="greekheb">ἓν εῶμα</span>. The simply correct rendering is given, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, in the version of Castalio: “<span class="ital">ut in sese ex duobus conderet unum novum hominem faciendo pacem, et ambos uno in corpore reconciliaret Deo per crucem peremtis in ea inimicitiis</span>.”<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/ephesians/2.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-16.htm" title="And that he might reconcile both to God in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby:">Ephesians 2:16</a>. <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἀποκαταλλάξῃ τοὺς ἀμφοτέρους</span>: <span class="ital">and that He might reconcile them both</span>. Further statement of object, the <span class="greekheb">καί</span> continuing and extending it. Only at this point is the prior and larger idea of the reconciliation <span class="ital">to God</span> introduced, and even now it is in connection with the idea of the reconciliation of Jew and Gentile. For <span class="greekheb">τοὺς δύο</span> we now have <span class="greekheb">τοὺς ἀμφοτέρους</span>, not “the two” but “both of them together,” <span class="ital">unity</span> being the aspect in which they are now presented. The <span class="greekheb">ἀπο</span>- in such compounds has sometimes simply an intensive meaning (<span class="greekheb">ἀποθαρρεῖν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀποθαυμάζειν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀποκαραδοκεῖν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀπεκδέχεσθαι</span>, etc.); sometimes, though less frequently, the sense of <span class="ital">again</span> (<span class="greekheb">ἀποδίδωμι</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀποκαθίστημι</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀποκατορθόω</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀποκαταλαμβάνω</span>). It is doubtful which is the force of the <span class="greekheb">ἀπο</span>- here. In the context, it is true, so far as the relations of Jew and Gentile to each other are dealt with, we have simply the idea of a state of separation into two hostile camps giving place to a state of unity. But in the present clause the larger truth of a reconciliation <span class="ital">to God</span> is in view, and this favours the idea of a <span class="ital">restoration</span> to a condition which had been lost. The form <span class="greekheb">ἀποκαταλλάσσειν</span> occurs in the NT only here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/colossians/1-20.htm" title=" And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things to himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven....">Colossians 1:20-21</a>. In the LXX and once in the NT (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-24.htm" title="Leave there your gift before the altar, and go your way; first be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift.">Matthew 5:24</a>) we have also <span class="greekheb">διαλλάττεσθαι</span>. But the two appear to be practically indistinguishable. As derivatives of <span class="greekheb">ἀλλάσσειν</span> they both convey the idea of a change, not primarily in <span class="ital">feeling</span> (which is expressed by <span class="greekheb">ἱλάσκεσθαι</span> and its compounds), but in <span class="ital">relation</span>, and in <span class="ital">mutual</span> relation, on the side of God to man and on the side of man to God (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/5-9.htm" title="Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him....">Romans 5:9-11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/5-18.htm" title="And all things are of God, who has reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and has given to us the ministry of reconciliation;...">2 Corinthians 5:18-20</a>).—<span class="greekheb">ἐν ἑνὶ σώματι διὰ τοῦ σταυροῦ</span>; <span class="ital">in one body through the cross</span>. This cannot refer to <span class="ital">Christ’s</span> body (Chrys., Beng., Harl., Hofm.), as if the point were either the reconciliation of <span class="ital">two</span> parties by <span class="ital">one body</span>, or the <span class="ital">one</span> offering of Christ that needed no repetition (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-27.htm" title="Who needs not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people's: for this he did once, when he offered up himself.">Hebrews 7:27</a>, etc.), or, again, the <span class="ital">one</span> sacrifice as contrasted with the multitude of the Levitical oblations. These are ideas alien to the context, and they are the less appropriate because Christ Himself is the <span class="ital">subject</span> of the <span class="greekheb">ἀποκαταλλάξῃ</span>. The reference is to the Jews and Gentiles now making one body; <span class="ital">cf.</span> the <span class="greekheb">ἒν σῶμα</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-17.htm" title="For we being many are one bread, and one body: for we are all partakers of that one bread.">1 Corinthians 10:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-4.htm" title="There is one body, and one Spirit, even as you are called in one hope of your calling;">Ephesians 4:4</a>; and especially in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-15.htm" title=" And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also you are called in one body; and be you thankful.">Colossians 3:15</a>. His object was to bring the two long-sundered and antagonistic parties as one whole, one great body, into right relation to God by His cross. The <span class="greekheb">διὰ τοῦ σταυροῦ</span> belongs rather to the <span class="greekheb">ἀποκαταλλάξῃ</span> than to the following <span class="greekheb">ἀποκτείνας</span> (von Soden).—<span class="greekheb">ἀποκτείνας τὴν ἔχθραν ἐν αὐτῷ</span>: <span class="ital">having slain the enmity thereby</span>. For <span class="greekheb">ἐν αὐτῷ</span> there is a variant reading <span class="greekheb">ἐν ἑαυτῷ</span>, slenderly supported (F 115, etc.); and some propose <span class="greekheb">ἐν αὑτῷ</span> (von Soden). But this <span class="greekheb">ἐν αὐτῷ</span> refers to the <span class="greekheb">σταυροῦ</span>, and the idea is not that Christ slew the enmity in Himself, but that He did it “by the cross,” or, as some take it (Alf., etc.), “on the cross”. The <span class="greekheb">ἔχθρα</span> here, again, is not the <span class="ital">Law</span> itself, nor the enmity of Jew and Gentile <span class="ital">to God</span> (though most take it so), but rather the <span class="greekheb">ἔχθρα</span> previously mentioned—the enmity between Jew and Gentile. Further, the <span class="greekheb">ἀποκτείνας</span> which <span class="ital">might</span> denote an action coincident with that denoted by the main verb, or might define the way in which the latter was made good, seems to have its proper sense of <span class="ital">priority</span>—“after He had killed”. He had first to kill this enmity between the two before He could bring them both into right relations to God in the way indicated, <span class="ital">viz.</span>, in one body, as one great, united whole.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/ephesians/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">16</span>. <span class="ital">reconcile both unto God</span>] The Gr. verb here rendered “reconcile” occurs elsewhere (in exactly the same form) only <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/colossians/1-20.htm" title=" And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things to himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven....">Colossians 1:20-21</a>; but a form nearly identical occurs <span class="ital">e. g.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-10.htm" title="For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life.">Romans 5:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-11.htm" title="But and if she depart, let her remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband: and let not the husband put away his wife.">1 Corinthians 7:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/5-18.htm" title="And all things are of God, who has reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and has given to us the ministry of reconciliation;...">2 Corinthians 5:18-20</a>. The idea of the verb is on the whole that of the propitiation of an alienated superior, to whom offending inferiors are, with his consent, led back as accepted suppliants. God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-19.htm" title="To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself, not imputing their trespasses to them; and has committed to us the word of reconciliation.">2 Corinthians 5:19</a>) “reconciled the world unto Himself” by providing, in His Son, the Divine pacification of the Divine displeasure against the world. Christ “reconciles us to God” by being and effecting that pacification. Hence Reconciliation, in practice, nearly approaches to both the ideas, Atonement and Justification. The Lord, here, “<span class="ital">by the cross</span>,” reconciles the Church to God; effects its acceptance; secures the “non-imputation of trespasses” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-19.htm" title="To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself, not imputing their trespasses to them; and has committed to us the word of reconciliation.">2 Corinthians 5:19</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“<span class="ital">Both</span>”<span class="ital">:</span>—here in the masculine plural; both great <span class="ital">groups</span>, Jewish and Gentile believers.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in one body</span>] A phrase in contrast (see last note) to “both;” the two groups become the One Body, the One Man, of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-15.htm" title="Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself of two one new man, so making peace;">Ephesians 2:15</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">by the cross</span>] The only mention of it in this Epistle. Observe here, as consistently in the N. T., the isolation of the Lord’s Death from His Life-work, where ideas of atonement are in view; a fact most suggestive of the doctrine that that Death was a true and proper propitiatory Sacrifice, an altar-work, and not only a supreme act of self-sacrificing sympathy with man’s need and God’s holiness. For on the latter view there is no clear line of demarcation between the Death and the self-sacrificing Life.—Cp. the parallel, <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-20.htm" title=" And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things to himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven.">Colossians 1:20</a> (“the blood of the Cross”), and see above on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-7.htm" title="In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace;">Ephesians 1:7</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">having slain the enmity thereby</span>] I.e. by the Cross, the Atoning Death.—“<span class="ital">The enmity:</span>”—that spoken of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-15.htm" title="Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself of two one new man, so making peace;">Ephesians 2:15</a>; immediately, that between Jew and Gentile; ultimately (for this underlies the conditions of the existence of that other) that between man and God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-7.htm" title="Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.">Romans 8:7</a>).—“<span class="ital">Slain:</span>”—a word chosen, instead of <span class="ital">e. g.</span> “cancelled,” “abolished,” because the work was done <span class="ital">through death</span>. What was really, in final effect, <span class="ital">executed</span> at Calvary was the obstacle to peace; whether peace in the sense of the harmony of redeemed souls, or peace in the sense of reconciliation to God, the basis of the other.

No preference was to be given to the Jew facilitating his union to Christ: the Gentile was to be taken into Christ's body as readily as the Jew. In reference to the sense in which reconciliation was effected by the cross of Jesus, some say it was only as the cross demonstrated to men the love of God and his willingness to bless them; while others maintain very strongly that it was as providing a satisfaction to God's justice for their guilt, and thus enabling him to receive and bless the sinner. Not only the analogy of other passages of Scripture as well as of this Epistle justifies the latter view, but preeminently the words, "by the cross." If Christ had only to <span class="accented">proclaim</span> God's friendship toward sinners, why should he have suffered on the cross? The cross as a mere pulpit is hideous; as an altar it is glorious. The love of God is ill revealed, if it subjected Jesus to unnecessary agony. The love of both Father and Son is indeed commended, if the agony was voluntarily borne by the Son, and permitted by the Father, as being indispensable for the pardon of the sinner. '<span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3be;&#x1fc3;</span> denotes the whole process of reconciliation (see Eadie). <span class="cmt_word">Having slain the enmity thereby</span> (or, <span class="accented">thereon</span>). "The enmity" is the same as at the beginning of ver. 15 - the enmity of man to God. The destruction of this enmity is one of the effects of the cross, though not the only effect; it is necessary to root out the enmity of the carnal mind. That this is the meaning here seems plain from <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-10.htm">Romans 5:10</a>, "If, <span class="accented">when we were enemies</span>, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son." The apostle there makes no allusion to the enmity of Jew and Gentile to each other, but to this wider fact - <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>. If any words can denote the result of a propitiatory sacrifice, it is surely "reconciled to God by the death of his Son." <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/ephesians/2.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Might reconcile (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b7;&#837;)<p>Only here and <a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/1-20.htm">Colossians 1:20</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-21.htm">Colossians 1:21</a>.
