When we are warned against the one (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-2.htm" title="And be not conformed to this world: but be you transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.">Romans 12:2</a>, “Be not conformed to this world;” see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-20.htm" title="Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this world? has not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?">1Corinthians 1:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-6.htm" title="However, we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nothing:">1Corinthians 2:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-10.htm" title="For Demas has forsaken me, having loved this present world, and is departed to Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia.">2Timothy 4:10</a>), it is against the” vanity”—that is, the transitoriness and unreality—of the present life; when against the other (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-3.htm" title="Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world:">Galatians 4:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-14.htm" title="But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified to me, and I to the world.">Galatians 6:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/colossians/2-8.htm" title=" Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.">Colossians 2:8-10</a>), it is against its “pomp,” its carnal, material, unspiritual splendour. Here the former life of the Ephesians is described as at once transitory and carnal.<p><span class= "bld">The prince of the power of the air.</span>—The connection of the “world” with the Evil One as its “prince” is not uncommon in Holy Scripture (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-31.htm" title="Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.">John 12:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-30.htm" title="Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the prince of this world comes, and has nothing in me.">John 14:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-11.htm" title="Of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged.">John 16:11</a>); and the “power” of this passage is exactly that which Satan claims as “committed” to him in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-32.htm" title="And they were astonished at his doctrine: for his word was with power.">Luke 4:32</a>. But the phrase “the power of the air” is unique and difficult. We note (1) that this phrase signifies not “a power over the air,” but “a power dwelling in the region of the air.” Now, the word “power” (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-21.htm" title="Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come:">Ephesians 1:21</a>), both in the singular and the plural, is used in this Epistle, almost technically, of superhuman power. Here, therefore, the Evil One is described as “the prince,” or <span class= "ital">ruler, </span>of such superhuman power—considered here collectively as a single power, prevailing over the world, and working in the children of disobedience—in the same sense in which he is called the “prince of the devils,” the individual spirits of wickedness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-34.htm" title="But the Pharisees said, He casts out devils through the prince of the devils.">Matthew 9:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-24.htm" title="But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, This fellow does not cast out devils, but by Beelzebub the prince of the devils.">Matthew 12:24</a>). Next (2), Why is this spoken of as ruling “in the air”? There may possibly be allusion (as has been supposed) to the speculations of Jewish or Gentile philosophy; but it seems far more probable that the “air” is here meant simply to describe a sphere, and therefore a power, below the heaven and yet above the earth. The “air” is always opposed to the bright “ether,” or to the spiritual “heaven”; the word and its derivatives carry with them the ideas of cloudiness, mist, and even darkness. Hence it is naturally used to suggest the conception of the evil power, as allowed invisibly to encompass and move above this world, yet overruled by the power of the true heaven, which it vainly strives to overcloud and hide from earth. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-12.htm" title="For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.">Ephesians 6:12</a> the powers of evil are described with less precision of imagery, as dwelling “in heavenly places,” the opposition being there only between what is human and superhuman; yet even there the “darkness” of this world is referred to, corresponding to the conception of cloudiness and dimness always attaching to “the air.”<p><span class= "bld">The spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience.</span>—The Greek here shows that the word “spirit” must be taken in apposition, not to “prince,” as an English reader would naturally suppose, but to “power.” As the individual demons when considered as working on the human spirit are called spirits—“unclean spirits “in the Gospels, “evil spirits” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-12.htm" title="So that from his body were brought to the sick handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them.">Acts 19:12</a> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-16.htm" title="And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain damsel possessed with a spirit of divination met us, which brought her masters much gain by soothsaying:">Acts 16:16</a>), “deceiving spirits” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-1.htm" title="Now the Spirit speaks expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;">1Timothy 4:1</a>—so here the collective power of evil, considered as working in “the children of disobedience,” is called “a spirit,” like the “spirit of the world,” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-12.htm" title="Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.">1Corinthians 2:12</a>, but here even more distinctly opposed to the “Spirit of God.” In reference to this spiritual power over the soul our Lord’s casting out demons is described (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-28.htm" title="And he said to them, You know how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company, or come to one of another nation; but God has showed me that I should not call any man common or unclean.">Acts 10:28</a>) as a deliverance of those who were “oppressed of the devil;” the apostolic work of conversion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-18.htm" title="To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me.">Acts 26:18</a>) as a turning “from the power of Satan to God,” and excommunication as “a deliverance to Satan” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-5.htm" title="To deliver such an one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.">1Corinthians 5:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-20.htm" title="Of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I have delivered to Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme.">1Timothy 1:20</a>); and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-9.htm" title="Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders,">2Thessalonians 2:9</a> exactly the same word for “inward working” is applied to the action of Satan on the soul. From this half-personal use of the word “spirit” it is easy to pass to the more abstract sense of an inner spiritual principle (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-15.htm" title="For you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but you have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.">Romans 8:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-8.htm" title="(According as it is written, God has given them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear;) to this day.">Romans 11:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-7.htm" title="For God has not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.">2Timothy 1:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-6.htm" title="We are of God: he that knows God hears us; he that is not of God hears not us. Hereby know we the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.">1John 4:6</a>).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:1-10 Sin is the death of the soul. A man dead in trespasses and sins has no desire for spiritual pleasures. When we look upon a corpse, it gives an awful feeling. A never-dying spirit is now fled, and has left nothing but the ruins of a man. But if we viewed things aright, we should be far more affected by the thought of a dead soul, a lost, fallen spirit. A state of sin is a state of conformity to this world. Wicked men are slaves to Satan. Satan is the author of that proud, carnal disposition which there is in ungodly men; he rules in the hearts of men. From Scripture it is clear, that whether men have been most prone to sensual or to spiritual wickedness, all men, being naturally children of disobedience, are also by nature children of wrath. What reason have sinners, then, to seek earnestly for that grace which will make them, of children of wrath, children of God and heirs of glory! God's eternal love or good-will toward his creatures, is the fountain whence all his mercies flow to us; and that love of God is great love, and that mercy is rich mercy. And every converted sinner is a saved sinner; delivered from sin and wrath. The grace that saves is the free, undeserved goodness and favour of God; and he saves, not by the works of the law, but through faith in Christ Jesus. Grace in the soul is a new life in the soul. A regenerated sinner becomes a living soul; he lives a life of holiness, being born of God: he lives, being delivered from the guilt of sin, by pardoning and justifying grace. Sinners roll themselves in the dust; sanctified souls sit in heavenly places, are raised above this world, by Christ's grace. The goodness of God in converting and saving sinners heretofore, encourages others in after-time, to hope in his grace and mercy. Our faith, our conversion, and our eternal salvation, are not of works, lest any man should boast. These things are not brought to pass by any thing done by us, therefore all boasting is shut out. All is the free gift of God, and the effect of being quickened by his power. It was his purpose, to which he prepared us, by blessing us with the knowledge of his will, and his Holy Spirit producing such a change in us, that we should glorify God by our good conversation, and perseverance in holiness. None can from Scripture abuse this doctrine, or accuse it of any tendency to evil. All who do so, are without excuse.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ephesians/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Wherein - In which sins, or in the practice of which transgressions.<p>Ye walked - You lived, life being often compared to a journey or a race. note, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-4.htm">Romans 6:4</a>.<p>According to the course of this world - In conformity with the customs and manners of the world at large. The word rendered here as "world" - &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;  aio&#772;n - means properly "age," but is often used to denote the present world, with its cares, temptations, and desires; and here denotes particularly the people of this world. The meaning is, that they had lived formerly as other people lived, and the idea is strongly conveyed that the course of the people of this world is to walk in trespasses and sins. The sense is, that there was by nature no difference between them and others, and that all the difference which now existed had been made by grace.<p>According to the prince of the power of the air - see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>; compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-4.htm">2 Corinthians 4:4</a>. There can be no doubt that Satan is here intended, and that Paul means to say that they were under his control as their leader and prince. The phrase, "the prince of the power," may mean either "the powerful prince," or it may mean that this prince had power over the air, and lived and reigned there particularly. The word "prince" - &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;  archonta - "Archon," means one first in authority and power, and is then applied to anyone who has the pre-eminence or rule. It is applied to Satan, or the chief of the fallen angels, as where he is called "the prince - &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;  archo&#772;n - of the devils," <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-34.htm">Matthew 9:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-24.htm">Matthew 12:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-22.htm">Mark 3:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-15.htm">Luke 11:15</a>; "the prince of this world," <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-31.htm">John 12:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-30.htm">John 14:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-11.htm">John 16:11</a>. But "why" he is here called the prince having power "over the air," it is not easy to determine.<p>Robinson (Lexicon) supposes it to be because he is lord of the powers of the air; that is, of the demons who dwell and rule in the atmosphere. So Doddridge supposes that it means that he controls the fallen spirits who are permitted to range the regions of the atmosphere. It is generally admitted that the apostle here refers to the prevailing opinions both among the Jews and pagan, that the air was thickly populated with spirits or demons. That this was a current opinion, may be seen fully proved in Wetstein; compare Bloomfield, Grotius, and particularly Koppe. Why the region of the air was supposed to be the dwelling-place of such spirits, is now unknown. The opinion may have been either that such spirits "dwelt" in the air, or that they had control over it, according to the later Jewish belief. Cocceius and some others explain the word "air" here as meaning the same as "darkness," as in profane writers. It is evident to my mind that Paul does not speak of this as a mere tradition, opinion, or vagary of the fancy, or as a superstitious belief: but that he refers to it as a thing which he regarded as true. In this opinion I see no absurdity that should make it impossible to believe it. For:<p>(1) the Scriptures abundantly teach that there are fallen, wicked spirits; and the existence of fallen angels is no more improbable than the existence of fallen people.<p>(2) the Bible teaches that they have much to do with this world. They tempted man; they inflicted disease in the time of the Saviour; they are represented as alluring and deceiving the race.<p>(3) they must have "some" locality - some part of the universe where they dwell. That they were not confined down to hell in the time of the Redeemer, is clear from the New Testament; for they are often represented as having afflicted and tortured people.<p>(4) why is there any improbability in the belief that their residence should have been in the regions of the air? That while they were suffered to be on earth to tempt and afflict people, they should have been permitted especially to occupy these! regions? Who can tell what may be in the invisible world, and what spirits may be permitted to fill up the vast space that now composes the universe? And who can tell what control may have been given to such fallen spirits over the regions of the atmosphere - over clouds, and storms, and pestilential air? People have control over the earth, and pervert and abuse the powers of nature to their own ruin and the ruin of each other. The elements they employ for the purposes of ruin and of temptation. Fruit and grain they convert to poison; minerals, to the destruction caused by war. In itself considered, there is nothing more improbable that spirits of darkness may have had control over the regions of the air, than that fallen man has over the earth; and no more improbability that that power has been abused to ruin people, than that the power of people is abused to destroy each other. No one can "prove" that the sentiment here referred to by Paul is "not" true; and no one can show how the doctrine that fallen spirits may do mischief in any part of the works of God, is anymore improbable than that wicked "men" should do the same thing. The word "power" here - "power of the air" - I regard as synonymous with "dominion or rule;" "a prince having dominion or rule over the air."<p>The spirit that now worketh - That still lives, and whose energy for evil is still seen and felt among the wicked. Paul here means undoubtedly to teach that there was such a spirit, and that he was still active in controlling people.<p>The children of disobedience - The wicked; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-6.htm">Colossians 3:6</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ephesians/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. the course of this world&#8212;the career (literally, "the age," compare Ga 1:4), or present system of this world (1Co 2:6, 12; 3:18, 19, as opposed to "the world to come"): alien from God, and lying in the wicked one (1Jo 5:19). "The age" (which is something more external and ethical) regulates "the world" (which is something more external).<p>the prince of the power of the air&#8212;the unseen God who lies underneath guiding "the course of this world" (2Co 4:4); ranging through the air around us: compare Mr 4:4, "fowls of the air" (Greek, "heaven") that is, (Eph 2:15), "Satan" and his demons. Compare Eph 6:12; Joh 12:31. Christ's ascension seems to have cast Satan out of heaven (Re 12:5, 9, 10, 12, 13), where he had been heretofore the accuser of the brethren (Job 1:6-11). No longer able to accuse in heaven those justified by Christ, the ascended Saviour (Ro 8:33, 34), he assails them on earth with all trials and temptations; and "we live in an atmosphere poisonous and impregnated with deadly elements. But a mighty purification of the air will be effected by Christ's coming" [Auberlen], for Satan shall be bound (Re 12:12, 13, 15, 17; 20:2, 3). "The power" is here used collectively for the "powers of the air"; in apposition with which "powers" stand the "spirits," comprehended in the singular, "the spirit," taken also collectively: the aggregate of the "seducing spirits" (1Ti 4:1) which "work now (still; not merely, as in your case, 'in time past') in the sons of disobedience" (a Hebraism: men who are not merely by accident disobedient, but who are essentially sons of disobedience itself: compare Mt 3:7), and of which Satan is here declared to be "the prince." The Greek does not allow "the spirit" to refer to Satan, "the prince" himself, but to "the powers of the air" of which he is prince. The powers of the air are the embodiment of that evil "spirit" which is the ruling principle of unbelievers, especially the heathen (Ac 26:18), as opposed to the spirit of the children of God (Lu 4:33). The potency of that "spirit" is shown in the "disobedience" of the former. Compare De 32:20, "children in whom is no faith" (Isa 30:9; 57:4). They disobey the Gospel both in faith and practice (2Th 1:8; 2Co 2:12).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ephesians/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Wherein in time past ye walked; </span> conversed in a continual course of life.

God before conversion, walk in the same road that others do; and that conversion is a turning out of this way; and that when persons are converted, the course of their walking is altered, which before was <p>according to the course of this world meaning this world, in distinction from the world to come, or the present age, in which the apostle lived, and designs the men of it; and the course of it is their custom, manner, and way of life; to which God's elect, during their state of unregeneracy, conform, both with respect to conversation and religious worship: great is the force that prevailing customs have over men; it is one branch of redemption by Christ, to deliver men from this present evil world, and to free them from a vain conversation in it; and it is only the grace of God that effectually teaches to deny the lusts of it; and it is only owing to the prevalent intercession and power of Christ, that even converted persons are kept from the evil of it: <p>according to the prince of the power of the air: which is not to be understood of any supposed power the devil has over the air, by divine permission, to raise winds, but of a posse, or body of devils, who have their residence in the air; for it was not only the notion of the Jews (m), that there are noxious and accusing spirits, who fly about  "in the air", and that there is no space between the earth and the firmament free, and that the whole is full of a multitude of them; but also it was the opinion of the Chaldeans (n), and of Pythagoras (o), and Plato (p), that the air is full of demons: now there is a prince who is at the head of these, called Beelzebub, the prince of devils, or the lord of a fly, for the devils under him are as so many flies in the air, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-24.htm">Matthew 12:24</a> and by the Jews called (q), , "the prince of spirits"; and is here styled, the Spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience; by which spirit is meant, not the lesser devils that are under the prince, nor the spirit of the world which comes from him, and is not of God; but Satan himself, who is a spirit, and an evil, and an unclean one; and who operates powerfully in unbelievers, for they are meant by children of disobedience, or unbelief; just as , "children of faith" (r), in the Jewish dialect, designs believers; and over these Satan has great influence, especially the reprobate part of them; whose minds he blinds, and whose hearts he fills, and puts it into them to do the worst of crimes; and indeed, he has great power over the elect themselves, while in unbelief, and leads them captive at his will; and these may be said in their unregeneracy to walk after him, when they imitate him, and do his lusts, and comply with what he suggests, dictates to them, or tempts them to. <p>(m) Shaare Ora, fol. 4. 1.((n) Laert.

Others explain <span class="greekheb">αἰών</span> as <span class="ital">life</span> (so also Harless; comp. H. Stephanus: “secundum eam, quae in hoc mundo est, vivendi rationem,” Castalio, Beza, Grotius, <span class="ital">et al.</span>); for which Rückert—who, in a strangely erroneous way, explains it as equivalent to <span class="greekheb">κατὰ τὸν αἰῶνα τοῦτον τοῦ κόσμου</span>—and Matthies put: <span class="ital">spirit of the time</span>, and Olshausen: <span class="ital">tendency of the time</span>; comp. Bleek. But, however current <span class="greekheb">αἰών</span> in the signification of <span class="ital">life</span> may be in classical Greek, especially in Homer, Pindar, Herodotus, and the tragic poets (see Duncan, ed. Rost, p. 47; Blomf. <span class="ital">ad Aesch. Prom</span>. 887; Ellendt, <span class="ital">Lex. Soph.</span> I. p. 50), yet in the N.T., often as the habitually used word recurs, it is never so employed, but always in the signification of <span class="ital">juncture of time, age</span>. The shift to which Koppe has recourse (comp. Estius and Flatt), that <span class="greekheb">αἰών</span> and <span class="greekheb">κόσμος</span> are synonymous—hence Koppe makes <span class="greekheb">ὁ αἰὼν τοῦ κόσμου τούτου</span> equivalent to <span class="greekheb">ὁ κόσμος οὗτος</span>—stands on a level with the capricious inversion of Bretschneider, who makes it tantamount to <span class="greekheb">ὁ κόσμος τοῦ αἰῶνος τούτου</span>: <span class="ital">homines pravi ut nunc sunt.</span> No, Paul might have written briefly <span class="greekheb">κατὰ τὸν αἰῶνα τοῦτον</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-21.htm" title="Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come:">Ephesians 1:21</a>); but, in accordance with the graphic amplification of the passage carrying such terrible emphasis, he has paraphrased this <span class="greekheb">τοῦτον</span> by <span class="greekheb">τοῦ κόσμου τούτου</span>. According to Beausobre and Michaelis (“the God of this world”), <span class="greekheb">αἰὼν τοῦ κόσμου τούτου</span> is meant to denote the <span class="ital">devil</span> in polemic reference to the Gnostic doctrine of aeons (see what follows). According to Baur, p. 433 f., the expression itself is a Gnostic one, equivalent to the <span class="greekheb">κοσμοκράτωρ</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-12.htm" title="For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.">Ephesians 6:12</a>), and denoting the <span class="ital">devil</span>. But this is imported, inasmuch as the explanation of <span class="greekheb">αἰών</span> in the sense usual in the N.T. yields quite a Pauline thought. The <span class="ital">devil</span> appears only in <span class="ital">what follows</span>, and would, if he was to he designated already here, and that as Lord of the pre-Messianic period, have been designated, as at <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-4.htm" title="In whom the god of this world has blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine to them.">2 Corinthians 4:4</a>, as <span class="greekheb">ὁ θεὸς τοῦ αἰῶνος τούτου</span>, or in a like concrete manner.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">κατὰ τὸν ἄρχοντα τῆς ἐξουσίας τοῦ ἀέρος</span>] climactic parallel to the preceding. “Sic res fit expressior,” Bengel.

The <span class="ital">devil</span> Paul here represents as <span class="ital">the ruler over the might of the air</span>, in which <span class="greekheb">ἐξοσία</span> is <span class="ital">collective</span>, denoting the totality of the mighty ones (the demons, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-24.htm" title="But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, This fellow does not cast out devils, but by Beelzebub the prince of the devils.">Matthew 12:24</a>) concerned. Comp. Lobeck, <span class="ital">ad Phryn.</span> p. 469; Bernhardy, p. 47. This <span class="greekheb">ἐξουσία</span> has its seat in the air, which exists between heaven and earth (<span class="greekheb">τοῦ ἀέρος</span>); the atmosphere, pertaining, in contrast to the higher pure <span class="greekheb">αἰθήρ</span> (see Duncan, <span class="ital">Lex. Hom.</span>, ed. Rost, p. 36), still to the physical realm of earthly things (<span class="greekheb">γῆς ἰσόμοιρος ἀήρ</span>, Soph. <span class="ital">El</span>. 87), is the seat, the territory of the might of the demons. This and nothing else Paul expresses in distinct words, the <span class="greekheb">ἐναέριος διατριβή</span> (Oecumenius, comp. Theophylact), the <span class="greekheb">ὑπουράνιος τόπος</span> (Chrysostom) of the demons; and neither ought <span class="greekheb">τοῦ ἀέρος</span> to have been taken (Clericus, Heinsius, Michaelis, Storr, Flatt, Matthies, and others) as equivalent to <span class="greekheb">τοῦ σκότους</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-12.htm" title="For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.">Ephesians 6:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-13.htm" title=" Who has delivered us from the power of darkness, and has translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son:">Colossians 1:13</a>), because, though it may, as it often does in Homer, denote <span class="ital">misty gloom</span>, clouds, etc., in contradistinction to the pure <span class="greekheb">αἰθήρ</span>, it never takes the place of the absolute <span class="greekheb">σκότος</span> (comp. Buttmann, <span class="ital">Lexilog</span>. I. p. 115), and in the N.T. always means simply <span class="ital">air</span>; nor ought it to have been explained by a metonymy as <span class="ital">mundus</span> (Thomas, Bullinger, and others). According to Hahn, <span class="ital">Theol. d. N.T.</span> I. p. 328 f., <span class="greekheb">τοῦ ἀέρος</span> is designed to express the aeriform <span class="ital">nature</span> of the demons; they are not really <span class="ital">spiritual</span>, but only <span class="ital">spirit-like</span>; <span class="ital">aeriformness</span> is their physical constitution. This is already in itself incorrect, since the demons must of necessity have the same physical constitution as the angels (including also their supra-terrestrial corporeity, comp. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-30.htm" title="For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven.">Matthew 22:30</a>), and hence, although they have become <span class="greekheb">ἀκάθαρτα</span>, they have yet remained <span class="greekheb">πνεύματα</span>, see in this very Epistle, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-12.htm" title="For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.">Ephesians 6:12</a> (<span class="greekheb">τὰ πνευματικὰ τῆς πονηρίας</span>). Olshausen would remove the demons from the atmosphere by taking <span class="greekheb">ἀήρ</span> as equivalent to <span class="greekheb">οὐρανός</span>,[129] appealing to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-17.htm" title="Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.">1 Thessalonians 4:17</a> (where, however, <span class="greekheb">ἀήρ</span> is nothing else than <span class="ital">air</span>), and even giving out this passage as the only one in the N.T. where the word <span class="greekheb">ἀήρ</span> elsewhere occurs (but see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-23.htm" title="And as they cried out, and cast off their clothes, and threw dust into the air,">Acts 22:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-26.htm" title="I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that beats the air:">1 Corinthians 9:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-9.htm" title="So likewise you, except you utter by the tongue words easy to be understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? for you shall speak into the air.">1 Corinthians 14:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/9-2.htm" title="And he opened the bottomless pit; and there arose a smoke out of the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit.">Revelation 9:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/16-17.htm" title="And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air; and there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, It is done.">Revelation 16:17</a>). As an equally exemplary companion-piece of rationalizing artifice may be quoted the interpretation of Stolz, <span class="ital">Erläut</span>. p. 175: “We have here to think of the rational beings acting and walking <span class="ital">upon the earth</span>, of men, who as sensuous creatures <span class="ital">breathe in the air</span>, in the atmosphere surrounding the earth.” Hofmann, who elsewhere took <span class="greekheb">ἀήρ</span> erroneously as equivalent to <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΝΕῦΜΑ</span></span></span>, would now (<span class="ital">Schriftb</span>. I. p. 457) not less erroneously make <span class="greekheb">τοῦ πνεύματος</span> dependent upon <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΟῦ ἈΈΡΟς</span></span></span>, and by the latter understand <span class="ital">the atmosphere formed by the breathing of that</span> <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span>. “So long as they [the disobedient] allow this spirit to be their spirit, they live in the atmosphere thereof, and as it were inhale it—an atmosphere, which is the sphere of dominion [the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΞΟΥΣΊΑ</span></span></span>] of Satan.” But apart from the clumsy and obscure accumulation of three genitives (at <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-4.htm" title="In whom the god of this world has blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine to them.">2 Corinthians 4:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-7.htm" title="But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.">2 Corinthians 4:7</a>, they flow easily and clearly one out of the other), there may be urged against this view generally the strange awkwardness of the thought (“the air of the spirit which worketh in the disobedient is the atmosphere formed by the breathing of the same spirit”), and more specially the considerations, first, that <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΞΟΥΣΊΑ</span></span></span> does not mean <span class="ital">sphere</span> of dominion;[130] secondly, that there is nothing to indicate that the <span class="greekheb">ἀήρ</span> originated through the <span class="ital">breathing</span> (or blowing) of the spirit (we should at least expect the essential <span class="greekheb">πνέοντος</span> instead of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝΕΡΓΟῦΝΤΟς</span></span></span>); thirdly, that, if <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΞΟΥΣΊΑ</span></span></span> is to denote the <span class="ital">sphere</span> of dominion, <span class="greekheb">τῆς ἐξουσίας</span> would be only an ambiguous pleonasm, and we cannot see why Paul should not have written merely <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤῸΝ ἌΡΧΟΝΤΑ ΤΟῦ ἈΈΡΟς Κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Λ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>As regards the <span class="ital">historic basis</span> of the conception of the apostle, that the demons have their abode in the air, <span class="ital">he has carried it over from his pre-Christian, Jewish-Rabbinic circle of ideas into the contents of his Christian belief</span>. It is true that there are found among the Rabbins very diverse, confused, and at times very monstrous assertions concerning the dwelling-place of the demons (see, especially, Eisenmenger, <span class="ital">Entdeckt. Judenth</span>. II. p. 437 ff.), but Harless (followed by Olshausen) far too hastily thence concludes: “<span class="ital">in such sloughs as these one seeks in vain for the explanation of the apostle’s expression</span>.” For while there are found diverse opinions in the Rabbins, and among them also that which assigns to the demons the air as a territory, the expression of the apostle shows us which of the different Rabbinic conceptions he has <span class="ital">not</span> followed, and <span class="ital">which</span> is accepted by him. Thus doubtless, <span class="ital">e.g., the</span> doctrine which R. Bechai, <span class="ital">in Pentat</span>. f. 90, 1, presents as a <span class="ital">well-known</span> one, that only <span class="ital">those</span> demons which produce dreams dwell in the air, but those which seduce man to sin in the man himself, and yet others in the depths of the sea, is <span class="ital">not</span> the view of the apostle. But <span class="ital">the</span> belief, which Paul here announces as his own and presupposes in his readers, namely, that the demoniac kingdom in general, and not merely a single division of it, is in the air, is to be found very definitely preserved among the Rabbins also. For (1) the very Rabbinical tenet of the <span class="ital">winged</span> nature of the demons (Talmud, <span class="ital">Chagig</span>. 2; R. Eliezer in Bartolocc. I. p. 320 ff., <span class="ital">al.</span>) manifestly points to the <span class="ital">region of the air</span> as their abode, since they are shut out from the communion of <span class="ital">God</span>. (2) In particular passages this is expressly stated. <span class="ital">Comment. in libr. Aboth</span>. f. 83, Ephesians 2 : “Sciendum, a terra usque ad expansum omnia plena esse turmis et praefectis, et infra (that is precisely in the <span class="greekheb">ἀήρ</span>) plurimas esse creaturas laedentes et accusantes, et omnes stare ac volitare in aëre,” etc. Further, it is said in <span class="ital">Tuf haarez</span>, f. 9, 2, that under the sphere of the moon, which is the last under all, is a firmament (<span class="greekheb">רקיע</span>) … and there are the souls of the devils, etc. See Eisenmenger, II. p. 411. Further, R. Bechai says, <span class="ital">in Pentat</span>. f. 139, 4, where he is explaining how it comes about that the demons know what is future: “because they dwell in the air (<span class="greekheb">באויר</span>), … they learn future things from the princes of the planets.” The same R. Bechai, <span class="ital">in Pentat</span>. f. 18, 1, relates, as a Rabbinical tradition, that Noah had in his ark, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-19.htm" title="And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shall you bring into the ark, to keep them alive with you; they shall be male and female.">Genesis 6:19</a>, preserved devils also, and says in confirmation of this exposition: for it would have been impossible for them to remain in their own place, which is the air (<span class="greekheb">במקוטם שההוא חאויר</span>). Comp. <span class="ital">Nishmath chasim</span>, f. 115, 2. The assertion, too, of R. Menasseh, in Eisenmenger, II. p. 456 f., that the rising smoke of the incense which was offered to the devils was their food, points to the air as their dwelling-place; as, indeed, according to the Cabbala (<span class="ital">Cabb. denud</span>. I. p. 417), the demons dwell “below the upper sanctuary.”[131] Thus much, consequently, is <span class="ital">clear and transparent</span> enough in the “<span class="ital">muddy sloughs</span>” of Rabbinical tradition, that the kingdom of the demons was located in the air; and with this we find the apostle in agreement. Hence we have no right to deny that he has retained this conception from the sphere of his Rabbinical training, but at the same time it would be quite unwarrantable to attribute to him the singularities associated with this tenet by the Rabbins, since, in fact, he asserts <span class="ital">nothing more</span> than that the devilish powers are <span class="ital">in the air</span>. This is a simple historical statement, in which, we may add, it is quite arbitrary to discern a “<span class="ital">profound</span> hint,” namely, of their <span class="ital">dismal</span> and <span class="ital">spectral</span> nature (in opposition to Schenkel). The right explanation is given also by Schmid, <span class="ital">Bibl. Theol</span>. § 86, and Bleek. Among the Pythagoreans, too, we meet with an analogous view (Diog. Laert. viii. 32: <span class="greekheb">κατὰ τὸν μὲν Πυθάγοραν εἶναί τε πάντα τὸν ἀέρα ψυχῶν ἔμπλεον</span>, <span class="greekheb">καὶ τούτους δαίμονάς τε καὶ ἥρωας νομίζεσθαι</span>, and compare the other passages in Wetstein, and Elsner, p. 206; Dougt. <span class="ital">Anal</span>. p. 127); but quite unfounded is the assertion of Wetstein: “P. ita loquitur ex principiis philosophiae Pythagoreae, quibus illi, ad quos scribit, imbuti erant.” Paul presupposes in his readers an acquaintance with his expression as the expression of <span class="ital">his</span> doctrine, and speaks so emphatically and solemnly that any sort of accommodation is not to be thought of.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τοῦ πνεύματος</span>] is still dependent on <span class="greekheb">τὸν ἄρχοντα</span>, so that the power over which the devil rules, after being designated as regards its outward existence by the phrase <span class="greekheb">ἐξουσίας τοῦ ἀέρος</span>, is now designated as regards its active operation in men’s hearts, namely, as <span class="ital">the spirit which is at work in the disobedient</span>. This <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span>, of which Satan is the ruler, is not, however, to be thought of as being the <span class="ital">human mind</span>, since, thus understood, it would not suit as apposition to the <span class="greekheb">τῆς ἐξουσίας τοῦ ἀέρος</span> which is different from the human individuality, as, indeed, <span class="greekheb">τοῦ ἐνεργ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. points to an agent different from the human individual; but rather as the principle proceeding from its <span class="greekheb">ἄρχων</span>, the devil, and passing over into men to become operative in their hearts—<span class="ital">the antithesis of the Holy Spirit which proceeds from God</span>. Comp. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-12.htm" title="Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.">1 Corinthians 2:12</a>. This <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span> is, in contrast to <span class="greekheb">τὸ πνεῦμα τῆς ἀληθείας</span>, the <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα τῆς πλάνης</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-6.htm" title="We are of God: he that knows God hears us; he that is not of God hears not us. Hereby know we the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.">1 John 4:6</a>. It is not, however, “odd” (de Wette), nor is it “unnatural” (Bleek), to speak of a “<span class="ital">ruler of this spirit</span>;” but this is quite analogous to <span class="ital">the</span> conception, according to which Christ is spoken of as “<span class="ital">Lord of the Holy Spirit</span>” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-18.htm" title="But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the LORD.">2 Corinthians 3:18</a>). We have further not to understand <span class="greekheb">τοῦ πνεύματος</span> <span class="ital">collectively</span> (Vatablus, Grotius, Estius, Wolf, Michaelis, Holzhausen); for the <span class="greekheb">ἐξουσία τοῦ ἀέρος</span> is, indeed, the sum total of the plurality of the demons, but the <span class="ital">spirit</span>, which is brought by its ruler, the devil, into the hearts of men and operates within them, is in all <span class="greekheb">υἱοὶ τῆς ἀπειθ</span>. one and the self-same spirit, just as the Holy Spirit is in all individuals who believe one and the same. Others regard <span class="greekheb">τοῦ πνεύματος</span> as <span class="ital">apposition to</span> <span class="greekheb">τὸν ἄρχ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐξουσ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἀέρ</span>., in that they either assume the use of an abnormal case occasioned by a deviation from the construction (genitive for accusative), as Piscator, Calovius, Semler, Koppe, Rosenmüller, Rückert, de Wette, Bleek, or look upon the genitive as one of <span class="ital">apposition</span> to <span class="greekheb">τὸν ἄρχοντα</span>, as Flatt. But how purely arbitrary is the former! and how impossible the latter, since <span class="greekheb">τὸν ἄρχοντα</span> in accordance with its significance <span class="ital">demands</span> a <span class="ital">defining</span> genitive, and already <span class="ital">has</span> it in <span class="greekheb">τῆς ἐξουσ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἀέρ</span>., and consequently <span class="greekheb">τοῦ πνεύματος</span> <span class="ital">cannot</span> be taken in any other relation!<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">νῦν</span>] is emphatic,—not, however, as Meier supposes (comp.

But that could not be understood from the simple <span class="greekheb">ἐνεργ</span>., and would have required the addition of a <span class="greekheb">περισσοτέρως</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὑπερβαλλόντως</span>, or the like. According to Olshausen, <span class="greekheb">νῦν</span> is to be held as opposed to the <span class="ital">future</span> age, and to make the diabolic activity appear as <span class="ital">limited</span>, in contrast to the everlasting, divine activity of the Holy Spirit. But a contrast to the <span class="greekheb">αἰὼν μέλλων</span> is not at all implied in the context; indeed, it was entirely self-evident that the Satanic activity extends only to the time before the Parousia; how then could it occur to a reader to find in the <span class="greekheb">νῦν</span> a negation of the <span class="greekheb">αἰὼν μέλλων</span>?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐν τοῖς υἱοῖς τῆς ἀπειθ</span>.] in their souls. The expression <span class="greekheb">υἱοὶ τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἀπείθ</span>. is Hebraizing (for among Greek writers are found only such expressions as <span class="greekheb">υἷες Ἀχαιῶν</span>, <span class="greekheb">παῖδες ζωγράφων</span>, and the like, but not with abstract nouns; see Blomfield, <span class="ital">Gloss. Pers</span>. 408, p. 138; Stallb. <span class="ital">ad Plat. Phil.</span> p. 107), and denotes the dependence which has its basis in the relation of the person or thing concerned to the genitive-noun, here <span class="ital">the genesis of the spiritual condition</span>, so that <span class="greekheb">τοῖς ἐξ ἀπειθείας</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-8.htm" title="But to them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath,">Romans 2:8</a>) would signify the same thing. Comp. Winer, p. 213 [E. T. 298].

By <span class="greekheb">ἀπείθεια</span>, however, is not meant <span class="ital">unbelief</span> (Luther, Bengel, Koppe, Harless, and others); for this could only be logically included under the notion of disobedience as <span class="ital">refusal</span> of belief, consequently as opposite to the <span class="greekheb">ὑπακοὴ πίστεως</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-5.htm" title="By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations, for his name:">Romans 1:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-6.htm" title="Seeing therefore it remains that some must enter therein, and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief:">Hebrews 4:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-11.htm" title="Let us labor therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.">Hebrews 4:11</a>; and see Fritzsche on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-30.htm" title="For as you in times past have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief:">Romans 11:30</a>). And with <span class="ital">that</span> sense in the present case the following <span class="greekheb">ἐν αἷς καὶ ἡμεῖς πάντες</span> would be at variance, since not <span class="ital">all</span> Jewish-Christians had, like Paul, <span class="ital">resisted</span> the faith. Now, as Paul is speaking only of the <span class="ital">immorality</span> of the unbelievers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-1.htm" title="And you has he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins;">Ephesians 2:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-3.htm" title="Among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others.">Ephesians 2:3</a>), <span class="greekheb">ἀπείθεια</span> is here the want of compliance towards God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-30.htm" title="For as you in times past have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief:">Romans 11:30</a>), <span class="ital">i.e.</span> towards His revealed and natural law respectively (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-8.htm" title="But to them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath,">Romans 2:8</a> ff.), displaying itself through their <span class="ital">immoral conduct</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/ephesians/2.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-2.htm" title="Wherein in time past you walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now works in the children of disobedience:">Ephesians 2:2</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἐν αἶς ποτὲ περιεπατήσατε</span>: <span class="ital">wherein in time past</span> (RV, “aforetime”) <span class="ital">ye walked</span>. The <span class="greekheb">αἷς</span> takes the gender of the nearer noun, but refers to both the <span class="greekheb">παραπτώμασι</span> and the <span class="greekheb">ἁμαρτίαις</span>. Trespasses and sins were the domain in which they had their habitual course of life in their former heathen days.—<span class="greekheb">κατὰ τὸν αἰῶνα τοῦ κόσμου τούτου</span>: <span class="ital">according to the course</span> (or <span class="ital">age</span>) <span class="ital">of this world</span>. As the <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span> of the former clause gave the stated sphere within which their pre-Christian life moved, so the <span class="greekheb">κατά</span> of this clause and the next gives the standard to which it conformed and the spirit by which it was ruled. The phrase <span class="greekheb">κατὰ τὸν αἰῶνα τοῦτον</span> might have sufficed; the fuller form which introduces both <span class="greekheb">αἰὼν</span> and <span class="greekheb">κόσμος</span> is more expressive. The <span class="greekheb">κόσμος</span> is the world as the objective system of things, and that as evil. The <span class="greekheb">αἰών</span> is the world as a world-period—the world as transitory. In such a connection as the present <span class="greekheb">αἰών</span> comes near what we understand by “the spirit of the age,” but is perhaps most happily rendered <span class="ital">course</span>, as that word conveys the three ideas of <span class="ital">tenor, development</span>, and <span class="ital">limited continuance</span>. This course of a world which is evil is itself evil, and to live in accordance with it is to live in trespasses and sins.—<span class="greekheb">κατὰ τὸν ἄρχοντα τῆς ἐξουσίας τοῦ ἀέρος</span>: <span class="ital">according to the prince of the power of the air</span>. A yet darker colour is now given to the description of the former heathen walk of those addressed. Their life was determined and shaped by the master of all evil, the supreme ruler of all the powers of wickedness. The terms obviously designate Satan, but their precise sense is somewhat difficult to decide. Three different shades of meaning are suggested for <span class="greekheb">ἐξουσία</span> here, <span class="ital">viz.</span>, (<span class="ital">a</span>) supreme <span class="ital">right</span> or <span class="ital">power</span>, in which case the idea would be the prince to whom belongs the authority of the air; (<span class="ital">b</span>) the <span class="ital">domain</span> or <span class="ital">sphere</span> of authority, as possibly in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-13.htm" title=" Who has delivered us from the power of darkness, and has translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son:">Colossians 1:13</a> (Chrys., Theod., Hofm., Oltr.); (<span class="ital">c</span>) authority in the <span class="ital">collective</span> sense, the totality of evil powers, all that is known as evil authority. The third sense is supported in some measure by <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/13-1.htm" title="Let every soul be subject to the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God....">Romans 13:1-2</a>, and is preferred by most. The idea thus becomes “the prince who rules over all that is called authority”. The <span class="greekheb">ἀέρος</span> then is best taken as the gen. of place, denoting the <span class="ital">seat</span> of this overlordship of evil. The word <span class="greekheb">ἀήρ</span> cannot be taken as equivalent to <span class="ital">mundus</span> (Aquin.) or <span class="greekheb">οὐρανός</span> (Olsh.) or <span class="greekheb">σκότος</span> (Kl.) or <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span> (Hofm.); neither can it express the <span class="ital">quality</span> of these evil powers—their incorporeal or aeriform nature (Hahn). In all its other NT occurrences (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-23.htm" title="And as they cried out, and cast off their clothes, and threw dust into the air,">Acts 22:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-26.htm" title="I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that beats the air:">1 Corinthians 9:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-9.htm" title="So likewise you, except you utter by the tongue words easy to be understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? for you shall speak into the air.">1 Corinthians 14:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-17.htm" title="Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.">1 Thessalonians 4:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/9-2.htm" title="And he opened the bottomless pit; and there arose a smoke out of the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit.">Revelation 9:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/16-17.htm" title="And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air; and there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, It is done.">Revelation 16:17</a>) it has the literal sense. It has it here, and it describes these demonic powers as between earth and heaven, in that “supra-terrestrial but subcelestial region (<span class="greekheb">ὁ ὑπουράνιος τόπος</span>, Chrys.) which seems to be, if not the abode, yet the haunt of evil spirits” (Ell.). Thus the prince of evil is described as the Lord-Paramount over all the demonic powers; and these demonic powers, as having their seat in the air, are distinguished from the angels whose abode is in heaven (<span class="greekheb">ἄγγελοι τῶν οὐρανῶν</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-36.htm" title="But of that day and hour knows no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only.">Matthew 24:36</a>). The Rabbinical literature has many extraordinary and grotesque speculations about the demons as being <span class="ital">winged</span> (Talmud, <span class="ital">Chagig.</span>, 2), as dwelling in the air (R. Bechai, <span class="ital">Pent.</span>, f. 139, 4), about the souls of devils as dwelling in a firmament under the sphere of the moon (<span class="ital">Tuf haarez</span>, f. 9, 2), etc. Such fancies were also entertained by the Greek philosophers, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, the Pythagoreans (Diog. Laert., viii. 2). But these have little or no relation to the present passage. In Philo and in the Jewish Pseudepigraphic writings things more akin to it are found. There is, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, the description of Beliar as the <span class="greekheb">ἀέριον πνεῦμα</span> (<span class="ital">Test.</span> xii. <span class="ital">Patr.</span> p. 729); of the “prince of this world” as dwelling in the <span class="ital">firmament</span> (<span class="ital">Ascens. Isaiah , 10</span>); of the “air” as peopled by <span class="ital">souls</span> (Philo, <span class="ital">Gig.</span>, i. 263). But even these form very partial analogies, and the passages in the <span class="ital">Book of Enoch</span> (ch. xv., 10, 11, 12; xvi., 1), which have been taken to refer to the subject, are of uncertain interpretation (<span class="ital">cf.</span> Charles, <span class="ital">Book of Enoch</span>, p. 84). We have no definite knowledge, therefore, of the origin of this idea. But it seems to have been familiar enough to the readers to require no explanation.—<span class="greekheb">τοῦ πνεύματος τοῦ νῦν ἐνεργοῦνστος ἐν τοῖς υἱοῖς τῆς ἀπειθείας</span>: <span class="ital">of the spirit that worketh now in the sons of disobedience</span>. How is the gen. <span class="greekheb">τοῦ πνεύματος</span> to be construed? It naturally suggests itself to regard the “spirit” now mentioned as in apposition to the “prince” just described. But to understand the gen. here as continuing the acc. <span class="greekheb">ἄρχοντα</span> (Rück., De Wette, Bleek, etc.) is to take too violent a liberty with grammar. The <span class="greekheb">τοῦ πνεύματος</span> is under the regimen of the <span class="greekheb">ἄρχοντα</span> as the <span class="greekheb">ἐξουσίας</span> is, and it adds something to the idea. The ruler over all that is called authority is also the ruler over this particular spirit. It is objected that the designation of a ruler over <span class="ital">a spirit</span> is an anomaly. But we have a parallel in the Pauline description of Christ as <span class="greekheb">Κυρίου πνεύματος</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-18.htm" title="But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the LORD.">2 Corinthians 3:18</a>). The <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span> here is not the spirit or mind of <span class="ital">man</span> (which would be inconsistent with the force of the <span class="greekheb">ἐξουσίας</span>), nor is it a <span class="ital">collective</span> term equivalent to the <span class="greekheb">ἐξουσία</span> (for its form is against that, as is also the statement of its operation). It is either (<span class="ital">a</span>) the evil <span class="ital">principle</span> or <span class="ital">power</span> that comes into men from Satan, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <span class="greekheb">τὸ πνεῦμα τοῦ κόσμου</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-12.htm" title="Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.">1 Corinthians 2:12</a>; <span class="greekheb">τὸ τοῦ ἀντιχρίστου</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-3.htm" title="And every spirit that confesses not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof you have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world.">1 John 4:3</a>; <span class="greekheb">ἕτερον πνεῦμα λαμβάνειν</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-23.htm" title="And be renewed in the spirit of your mind;">Ephesians 4:23</a>; or (<span class="ital">b</span>) the personal Spirit—that particular Spirit whose domain and work are in evil men. The latter is perhaps to be preferred, as in more definite accordance with the contrast with the Holy Spirit of God which seems to be in view. By <span class="greekheb">ἀπειθεία</span> is meant not merely <span class="ital">unbelief</span> but <span class="ital">disobedience</span>. Its stated sense in the NT is that of “obstinate opposition to the Divine will” (Thay.-Grimm, <span class="ital">sub voce</span>). The term <span class="greekheb">υἱός</span> in its topical sense and followed by the gen. of a <span class="ital">thing</span>, expresses what is in intimate relation to the thing, what belongs to it and has it as its innate quality. “Sons of disobedience” are those to whom disobedience is their very nature and essential character, who belong wholly to it. It is a well-known Hebrew idiom, occurring often in the NT, especially in the case of Hebraisms of translation. But the same or similar forms are found now and again in profane Greek, especially in inscriptions and in dignified speech (<span class="ital">cf.</span> Plato’s use of <span class="greekheb">ἔκγονος</span>, <span class="ital">Phacdr.</span>, p. 275 D), the <span class="greekheb">υἱὸς τύχης</span> of the Tragedians, etc.; see Deissmann, <span class="ital">Bible Studies</span>, pp. 161–166. The <span class="greekheb">νῦν</span> does not refer to the present in contrast with the future of the Parousia (Olsh.), nor with any other future; nor again is it = “<span class="ital">Even</span> now,” which would have been <span class="greekheb">καὶ νῦν</span>. It looks back upon the previous <span class="greekheb">πότε</span>, and contrasts the present working of the <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span> with the past. <span class="ital">Once</span> that spirit worked in all those addressed; <span class="ital">now</span> it works not in them indeed, but in those given over to disobedience to God’s will. So the lordship belonging to the Prince of evil extends not only over all those malign powers whose seat is in the air, but also and more particularly over that Spirit who operates as an energy of wickedness in the hearts of men opposed to God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/ephesians/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">2</span>. <span class="ital">Wherein … ye walked</span>] The transgressions were the road, or region, of the moral “walk,” i.e. the successive acts and practices of life.

In almost all the above passages the word (<span class="ital">cosmos</span>) will be seen clearly to mean not the physical world, (or certainly not it alone,) but the sinful human race, as now conditioned on earth.

T., is largely dwelt upon in the N. T. To the Lord and the Apostles he was assuredly no mere personification of evil, but an evil personality, as truly as for example “Gabriel, who stands in the presence of God,” is a good personality. As such, his existence is a fact-mystery, so to speak, not greater in kind, though in degree, than that of the permitted existence of an evil man who tempts and influences others. There is a strong prejudice in our time against the recognition of the personality of Satan; but it must stand on the level of other mysteries of Revelation; and the prejudice should never be fostered by exaggeration. Some food for prejudice has perhaps been found in the grotesque terrors of medieval art and legendary demonology; but this is not Scripture, rather the deepest contrast to Scripture.—The belief of a Devil has been called (<span class="ital">Westminster Review</span>, April, 1865, in an article on the Positive Philosophy), “a thoroughly polytheistic conception;” but what excuse is there for this statement in the <span class="ital">Scripture</span> portrait of the Enemy, save the solitary and quite explicable phrase, “God of this age” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-4.htm" title="In whom the god of this world has blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine to them.">2 Corinthians 4:4</a>)?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>For St Paul’s recognition of the great fact, cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-10.htm" title="And said, O full of all subtlety and all mischief, you child of the devil, you enemy of all righteousness, will you not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord?">Acts 13:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-18.htm" title="To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me.">Acts 26:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-20.htm" title="And the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly.

But it is authority as distinguished from mere dynamic <span class="ital">force</span>. See Bp. Lightfoot on <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-13.htm" title=" Who has delivered us from the power of darkness, and has translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son:">Colossians 1:13</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“<span class="ital">Of the air:</span>”—on this phrase much has been written. It here stands alone (as connected with spiritual mysteries) in the N. T., and hence is the more difficult to analyse with certainty. In studying it we must dismiss the thought (Wetstein) that St Paul is speaking “the language of Pythagorean philosophy, in which his readers were versed,” or the like; no where is his tone more dogmatic. And we must seek a meaning of “air” literal and local, rather than otherwise, looking at his usage elsewhere (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-26.htm" title="I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that beats the air:">1 Corinthians 9:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-9.htm" title="So likewise you, except you utter by the tongue words easy to be understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? for you shall speak into the air.">1 Corinthians 14:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-17.htm" title="Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.">1 Thessalonians 4:17</a>). This however does not mean a narrow localization, or hard literality, only that “air” is not a mere figure of speech for “mystery,” “darkness,” or the like. On the whole we gather, as the revelation of this passage, that as earth is the present abode of embodied spirits, mankind, so the airy envelope of earth is the haunt, for purposes of action on man, of the spirits of evil, which, if not bodiless, have not “animal” bodies (cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-44.htm" title="It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.">1 Corinthians 15:44</a>). Observe our Lord’s use of “the <span class="ital">birds of the sky</span>” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-5.htm" title="A sower went out to sow his seed: and as he sowed, some fell by the way side; and it was trodden down, and the fowls of the air devoured it.">Luke 8:5</a>) as the figure for the Tempter in the parable of the Sower.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Abundant illustrations of such a view may be found in quotations from classical, Jewish, and medieval literature. But it would be a hasty inference either that the Apostle <span class="ital">derived</span> his doctrine from previous extraneous sources, or that below the wildest exaggerations there lay no fact.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the spirit</span>] This word is in grammatical apposition, in the Greek, with that rendered “power” or “authority” just before. That “authority” meant, as we have said, “those in authority,” the unseen lords of evil, including their head. “<span class="ital">The spirit</span>” seems accordingly to mean, practically, “<span class="ital">the spirits</span>,” summed up into one idea, and used by one central power.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">that now worketh</span>] “<span class="ital">Now,</span>” as opposed to the “<span class="ital">then</span>” of its former action on those now rescued from it.—For illustrations of its “working” cp. the language used of Satan’s power on Judas (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-3.htm" title="Then entered Satan into Judas surnamed Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve.">Luke 22:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-2.htm" title="And supper being ended, the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him;">John 13:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-27.htm" title="And after the sop Satan entered into him. Then said Jesus to him, That you do, do quickly.">John 13:27</a>), and Ananias (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-3.htm" title="But Peter said, Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Ghost, and to keep back part of the price of the land?">Acts 5:3</a>), and of his energies (through men) at a time of persecution (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-10.htm" title="Fear none of those things which you shall suffer: behold, the devil shall cast some of you into prison, that you may be tried; and you shall have tribulation ten days: be you faithful to death, and I will give you a crown of life.">Revelation 2:10</a>). See also <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-9.htm" title="Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders,">2 Thessalonians 2:9</a>. The subtle power of human personal influence may well prepare us to believe in the mysterious depth, force, and variety, of Satanic influences.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in the children of disobedience</span>] I.e., in men characterized by moral resistance to the Holy God; a “disobedience” which, whether explicit or implicit, patent or latent, marks fallen man as such. There is that in the central Ego of fallen man which is antagonistic to the true claims of <span class="ital">the God of Revelation</span>, and which waits only the presentation of those claims to come out in action.—For the phrase, <span class="bld">sons of disobedience</span>, cp. ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-6.htm" title="Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things comes the wrath of God on the children of disobedience.">Ephesians 5:6</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-6.htm" title=" For which things' sake the wrath of God comes on the children of disobedience:">Colossians 3:6</a>. It is an example of the frequent Hebrew phrase, “son of,” “child of,” in the sense of close connexion, whether a connexion, as here, of principle and motive, or, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/20-36.htm" title="Neither can they die any more: for they are equal to the angels; and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection.">Luke 20:36</a> (“sons of the resurrection”), and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-14.htm" title="Having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin; beguiling unstable souls: an heart they have exercised with covetous practices; cursed children:">2 Peter 2:14</a> (“children of a curse”), of result and reward.—“<span class="ital">Disobedience:</span>”—the Latin versions have <span class="ital">diffidentia</span>, unbelief; and so the A.V. renders the same word, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-30.htm" title="For as you in times past have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief:">Romans 11:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-32.htm" title="For God has concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy on all.">Romans 11:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-6.htm" title="Seeing therefore it remains that some must enter therein, and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief:">Hebrews 4:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-11.htm" title="Let us labor therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.">Hebrews 4:11</a>.

See Buxt. Dict. Rabb., col. 1495. Even the celestial orbs themselves are various.

Here the prince himself is not called a spirit: but the spirit in this passage is that internal principle, from which the actions of unbelievers flow, and is opposed to the spirit of the believing sons of God: comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-33.htm" title="And in the synagogue there was a man, which had a spirit of an unclean devil, and cried out with a loud voice,">Luke 4:33</a>.—<span class="greekheb">νῦν</span>, <span class="ital">now</span>) <span class="ital">in the present day;</span> or rather, [that] <span class="ital">now most of all;</span> for he does not say, <span class="ital">still</span>, or <span class="ital">as yet</span>, but <span class="ital">now</span>. Those who despise the Gospel through <span class="ital">disbelief</span>, remain the slaves of that spirit, and are more and more captivated by him.

It implies that a kind of life remained sufficient for walking; but not the true, full, normal life; rather the life of a galvanized corpse, or of one walking in sleep. The figurative use of <span class="accented">walking</span> for living, or carrying on our life, is frequent in this Epistle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-1.htm">Ephesians 4:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a>, etc.). "The course of this world," elsewhere" the world," denotes the present system of things, as conducted by those who have regard only to things seen and temporal, and no regard to God or to the future life. Where there is spiritual death there is insensibility to these things. <span class="cmt_word">According to the prince of the power of the air.</span> It is obvious that this is equivalent to "the god of this world" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-4.htm">2 Corinthians 4:4</a>), but the explanation of the term is difficult. Allusion is made to a corporate body, "the power [or, 'government'] (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>) of the air," and to one who is "prince" of this government. There is no difficulty in identifying the evil one and his host, of whom Milton gives such graphic pictures. But why should they be specially connected with the <span class="accented">air?</span> The notion, entertained by some of the Fathers and others, that storms and disturbances of the atmosphere are caused by them, is preposterous; it is unscriptural (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/148-8.htm">Psalm 148:8</a>) and quite unscientific. The term seems to denote that evil spirits, who have some power of influencing us by their temptations, have their abode in the atmosphere, or at least haunt it, being invisible like it, yet exercising a real influence on human souls, and drawing them in worldly directions, and contrary to the will of God. <span class="cmt_word">The spirit which is now working hi the sons of disobedience.</span> The fact that this spirit is still working in others makes the escape of the Ephesians from him the more striking. He is not destroyed, but vigorously at work even yet. Though Jesus beheld him fall from heaven as lightning, and though he said that the prince of this world had been judged, these expressions denote a prophetic rather than an actual condition. This spirit energizes in the "sons of disobedience." This designation is striking; it denotes persons born of disobedience, bred by disobedience, having disobedience in their very nature; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-7.htm">Romans 8:7</a>, "The carnal mind is enmity against God," and passages where fallen man is called a rebel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-2.htm">Isaiah 1:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-10.htm">Isaiah 63:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-6.htm">Psalm 68:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-23.htm">Jeremiah 5:23</a>, etc.). It denotes the essential antagonism of man's will to God's, arising from man's devotion to this world and its interests, and God's regard to what is higher and holier - an antagonism often held in check and suppressed - but bursting out wildly at times in fierce opposition, as at the tower of Babel or the crucifixion of Jesus. The devil inflames man's inherent dislike to God's will, and encourages outbreaks of it. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/ephesians/2.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Course (&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;)<p>Lit., age.
