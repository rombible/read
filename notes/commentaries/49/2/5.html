There the type and earnest of the working of God’s mighty power are placed in the resurrection, the ascension, the glorification of Christ Himself in His human nature. Here what is there implied is worked out—(1) All Christians are declared to be quickened (or, <span class= "ital">risen again</span>) to spiritual life with Christ, according to His promise, “Because I live, ye shall live also” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-19.htm" title="Yet a little while, and the world sees me no more; but you see me: because I live, you shall live also.">John 14:19</a>). (See the exact parallel in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-13.htm" title=" And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, has he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses;">Colossians 2:13</a>.) But there is a promise even beyond this: “I am the life: whosoever liveth and believeth in Me shall never die” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-25.htm" title="Jesus said to her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believes in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:">John 11:25</a>; comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-24.htm" title="Truly, truly, I say to you, He that hears my word, and believes on him that sent me, has everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death to life.">John 5:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-2.htm" title="As you have given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many as you have given him.">John 17:2</a>). Hence, even more emphatically, and in full accordance with this latter promise, we have in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-4.htm" title=" When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall you also appear with him in glory.">Colossians 3:4</a>, “Christ who is our life;” as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/4-10.htm" title="Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body.">2Corinthians 4:10-11</a>, “The life of Jesus is made manifest in us.” What this “life eternal” is He Himself declares (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-3.htm" title="And this is life eternal, that they might know you the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.">John 17:3</a>)—“to know the only true God and Jesus Christ, whom He has sent.” (2) Next, this partaking of the life of Christ is brought out in two striking forms—as a partaking, not only of His resurrection (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-5.htm" title="For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection:">Romans 6:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/15-20.htm" title="But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the first fruits of them that slept.">1Corinthians 15:20-22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-11.htm" title="If by any means I might attain to the resurrection of the dead.">Philippians 3:11</a>), but also (in a phase of thought peculiar to these Epistles) of His ascension “to the heavenly places.” This is “in Christ Jesus,” in virtue of a personal and individual union with Christ. It implies blessings, both present and future, or rather one blessing, of which we have the earnest now and the fulness hereafter—for the resurrection and ascension of Christ are even now the perfection and glorification of humanity in Him. (3) So far as we are really and vitally His members, such perfection and glorification are ours now, by His intercession (that is, His continued mediation for us in heaven) and by His indwelling in us by the Spirit on earth. The proof of partaking His resurrection is “newness of life,” “death unto sin, and new birth unto righteousness” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/6-5.htm" title="For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection:">Romans 6:5-11</a>), which is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-12.htm" title=" Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, long-suffering;">Colossians 3:12</a> expressly connected with the entrance upon unity with Christ in baptism. The proof of having “our life hid in Christ at the right hand of God,” is “the setting our affection on things above” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-1.htm" title=" If you then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sits on the right hand of God.">Colossians 3:1</a>), by which “in heart and mind we thither ascend, and with Him continually dwell.” (4) These proofs are seen only in measure here. Through the change which we call death, we pass at once to a still higher stage of life, by fuller union with Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/5-6.htm" title="Therefore we are always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord:">2Corinthians 5:6-8</a>), and at the great day we shall have both in perfection—perfect newness of life in “likeness to Him” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-2.htm" title="Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it does not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.">1John 3:2</a>), and perfect glorification in Him in that communion with God which is heaven (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-5.htm" title="And now, O Father, glorify you me with your own self with the glory which I had with you before the world was.">John 17:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-10.htm" title="And all my are yours, and your are mine; and I am glorified in them.">John 17:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-24.htm" title="Father, I will that they also, whom you have given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which you have given me: for you loved me before the foundation of the world.">John 17:24</a>). The one thing which St. Paul does not attribute to us is that which is His alone—the place “at the right hand of the Father.”<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:1-10 Sin is the death of the soul. A man dead in trespasses and sins has no desire for spiritual pleasures. When we look upon a corpse, it gives an awful feeling. A never-dying spirit is now fled, and has left nothing but the ruins of a man. But if we viewed things aright, we should be far more affected by the thought of a dead soul, a lost, fallen spirit. A state of sin is a state of conformity to this world. Wicked men are slaves to Satan. Satan is the author of that proud, carnal disposition which there is in ungodly men; he rules in the hearts of men. From Scripture it is clear, that whether men have been most prone to sensual or to spiritual wickedness, all men, being naturally children of disobedience, are also by nature children of wrath. What reason have sinners, then, to seek earnestly for that grace which will make them, of children of wrath, children of God and heirs of glory! God's eternal love or good-will toward his creatures, is the fountain whence all his mercies flow to us; and that love of God is great love, and that mercy is rich mercy. And every converted sinner is a saved sinner; delivered from sin and wrath. The grace that saves is the free, undeserved goodness and favour of God; and he saves, not by the works of the law, but through faith in Christ Jesus. Grace in the soul is a new life in the soul. A regenerated sinner becomes a living soul; he lives a life of holiness, being born of God: he lives, being delivered from the guilt of sin, by pardoning and justifying grace. Sinners roll themselves in the dust; sanctified souls sit in heavenly places, are raised above this world, by Christ's grace. The goodness of God in converting and saving sinners heretofore, encourages others in after-time, to hope in his grace and mercy. Our faith, our conversion, and our eternal salvation, are not of works, lest any man should boast. These things are not brought to pass by any thing done by us, therefore all boasting is shut out. All is the free gift of God, and the effect of being quickened by his power. It was his purpose, to which he prepared us, by blessing us with the knowledge of his will, and his Holy Spirit producing such a change in us, that we should glorify God by our good conversation, and perseverance in holiness. None can from Scripture abuse this doctrine, or accuse it of any tendency to evil. All who do so, are without excuse.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ephesians/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Even when we were dead in sins - notes, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-1.htm">Ephesians 2:1</a>; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-8.htm">Romans 5:8</a>. The construction here is, "God, who is rich in mercy, on account of the great love which he bare unto us, even being dead in sin, hath quickened us," etc. It does not mean that he quickened us when we were dead in sin, but that he loved us then, and made provision for our salvation. It was love to the children of wrath; love to those who had no love to return to him; love to the alienated and the lost. That is true love - the sincerest and the purest benevolence - love, not like that of people, but such only as God bestows. Man loves his friend, his benefactor, his kindred - God loves his foes, and seeks to do them good.<p>Hath quickened us - Hath made us alive see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-1.htm">Ephesians 2:1</a>.<p>Together with Christ - In connection with him; or in virtue of his being raised up from the grave. The meaning is, that there was such a connection between Christ and those whom the Father hath given to him, that his resurrection from the grave involved their resurrection to spiritual life. It was like raising up the head and the members - the whole body together; compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-5.htm">Romans 6:5</a>. Everywhere in the New Testament, the close connection of the believer with Christ is affirmed. We are crucified with him. We die with him. We rise with him. We live with him. We reign with him. We are joint heirs with him. We share his sufferings on earth <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-13.htm">1 Peter 4:13</a>, and we share his glory with him on his throne; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-21.htm">Revelation 3:21</a>.<p>By grace ye are saved - Margin, "by whose;" see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-24.htm">Romans 3:24</a>. Paul's mind was full of the subject of salvation by grace, and he throws it in here, even in an argument, as a point which he would never have them lose sight of. The subject before him was one eminently adapted to bring this truth to mind, and though, in the train of his arguments, he had no time now to dwell on it, yet he would not suffer any opportunity to pass without referring to it. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ephesians/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. dead in sins&#8212;The best reading is in the Greek, "dead in our (literally, 'the') trespasses."<p>quickened&#8212;"vivified" spiritually, and consequences hereafter, corporally.

But how is this to be justified from the context? If the reader was reminded by <span class="greekheb">νεκροὺς τοῖς παραπτ</span>. of the <span class="ital">eternal</span> death, to which he had been subjected by his pre-Christian life of sin (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-1.htm" title="And you has he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins;">Ephesians 2:1</a>), he would now have to think of the <span class="ital">eternal</span> life, which begins with the resurrection, and he could the less think of anything else than of this real resurrection-life, since afterwards there is further expressed the translation together into heaven, and then, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-7.htm" title="That in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus.">Ephesians 2:7</a>, the intention of God is referred to the times <span class="ital">after the Parousia</span>.

No, God has <span class="ital">made</span> believers <span class="ital">alive with Christ</span>; <span class="ital">i.e.</span> in Christ’s revivification, which God has wrought, theirs also is included. By virtue of the dynamic connection in which Christ stands with His believers, as the head with its body (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-23.htm" title="Which is his body, the fullness of him that fills all in all.">Ephesians 1:23</a>), their revivification is objectively comprehended in His,—a relation, in fact, of which the Christian is conscious in faith; “quum autem <span class="ital">fides</span> suscipitur, ea omnia a Deo applicantur homini, et ab homine rata habentur,” Bengel. So the matter stands in the view of the apostle as <span class="ital">accomplished</span>, because the making alive of Christ is <span class="ital">accomplished</span>; the future actual making alive, or, as the case may be, change <span class="ital">at the Parousia</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-23.htm" title="But every man in his own order: Christ the first fruits; afterward they that are Christ's at his coming.">1 Corinthians 15:23</a>), is then the subjective individual participation of that which is already objectively given on the part of God in the resurrection of Christ. Certainly Paul might, in accordance with another mode of looking at it, have expressed himself by the <span class="ital">future</span>, as at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-22.htm" title="For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.">1 Corinthians 15:22</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-17.htm" title="And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.">Romans 8:17</a>; but who does not feel that by means of the <span class="ital">aorist</span> (“ponitur autem aoristus de re, quae, quamvis futura sit, tamen pro peracta recte censeatur, cum … alia re jam facta contineatur,” Fritzsche, <span class="ital">ad Rom.</span> II. p. 206) the matter stands forth more forcibly and triumphantly out of the believing conviction of the apostle? <span class="greekheb">οὓς ἐδικαίωσε τούτους καὶ ἐδόξασε</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-30.htm" title="Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.">Romans 8:30</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΣΎΝ</span></span></span> in <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΣΥΝΕΖΩΟΠ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> is by Beza, erroneously referred to the <span class="ital">coagmentatio gentium et Judaeorum</span>, a reference which is forbidden by the <span class="greekheb">τῷ Χριστῷ</span>; and by Grotius, Koppe, Rosenmüller, and others, it is explained <span class="ital">ad exemplum</span> (comp.

That the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΧΆΡΙΤΙ</span></span></span> emphatically placed at the beginning (for “<span class="ital">gratiam</span> esse docet proram et puppim,” Bengel) means the grace of <span class="ital">God</span>, not of <span class="ital">Christ</span> (Beza; comp. the inserted <span class="greekheb">οὗ</span> in D* E F G, Vulg. It. Victorin. Aug.

The condition of death in which we are by nature is now reaffirmed, and in a still more emphatic way than in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-1.htm" title="And you has he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins;">Ephesians 2:1</a>. The <span class="greekheb">καί</span> is not the copula, simply attaching one statement to another (Mey.), nor a mere repetition of the <span class="greekheb">καί</span> of the opening verse, nor = “also,” “also us” collectively (which would require <span class="greekheb">καί ἡμᾶς</span>), but the ascensive <span class="greekheb">καί</span> = <span class="ital">even</span> (Syr.-Phil., AV, RV, Ell., etc.). It qualifies the <span class="greekheb">ὄντας</span> (while the <span class="greekheb">νεκροὺς</span> is thrown emphatically forward), and heightens the sense of the <span class="ital">greatness</span> of the Divine power—as a power operating on us when we were yet held fast in the state of inexorable death. The <span class="greekheb">τοῖς</span> defines the trespasses as those already mentioned in connection with that state of death, and so has much the sense of “our”.—<span class="greekheb">συνεζωοποίησεν τῷ Χριστῷ</span>: <span class="ital">quickened us together with the Christ</span>. Some authorities (including B 17, Arm.) insert <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span> before <span class="greekheb">τῷ Χριστῷ</span>; which is favoured so far by Lachm. and gets a place in the margin with WH and RV. But the mass of authorities omit it. The <span class="greekheb">συν</span>-, therefore, of the compound verb refers to the <span class="greekheb">Χριστῷ</span>, and the idea expressed is that of fellowship with Him, not the fellowship or comprehension of Jew and Gentile alike in the Divine act of quickening (Beza). Here again the article probably designates Christ in His official relation to us. The <span class="ital">quickening</span> here in view is understood by some (including Meyer) to refer to the first act in the raising of the dead at the great day; the following verbs <span class="greekheb">συνήγειρεν</span>, <span class="greekheb">συνεκάθισεν</span> being similarly understood in the literal sense, as referring proleptically to events that belong to the ultimate future. Thus the <span class="ital">standing</span> rather than the moral condition is supposed to be primarily in view, the idea being that when Christ was raised from the dead we also as members of His body were raised in principle with Him, so that the resurrection of the future which we await will be simply the application to the individual of what was accomplished once for all for the whole of His members then. It must be admitted that the analogous passage in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/colossians/2-12.htm" title=" Buried with him in baptism, wherein also you are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who has raised him from the dead....">Colossians 2:12-13</a>, which associates the <span class="ital">quickening</span> with the forgiveness of trespasses and the blotting out of the hand-writing of ordinances, on the whole favours that interpretation. Looking, however, to the express and particular description of the worldly walk and the conversation in the lusts of the flesh, which is given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/2-2.htm" title="Wherein in time past you walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now works in the children of disobedience:...">Ephesians 2:2-3</a>, and which seems to explain what is said in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-1.htm" title="And you has he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins;">Ephesians 2:1</a> of the state of being “dead by trespasses and sins”; and having regard also to the application to the moral life which is made in the second half of the Epistle, most interpreters understand the <span class="ital">quickening</span> here affirmed to be that of regeneration—the communication of spiritual life.—<span class="greekheb">χάριτί ἐστε σεσωσμένοι</span>: <span class="ital">by grace have ye been saved</span>. So the RV, while the AV is content with “are ye saved”. The idea is that they were saved and continued to be so. The <span class="greekheb">χάριτι</span> is put emphatically first—“by grace it is that ye have been saved”. The parenthetical mention of <span class="ital">grace</span> is in place. Nothing else than grace could give life to the dead, but grace could indeed do even that.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/ephesians/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">5</span>. <span class="ital">dead in sins</span>] Better, <span class="bld">in respect of our trespasses</span>. See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-1.htm" title="And you has he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins;">Ephesians 2:1</a> the construction is the same.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">hath quickened</span>] <span class="bld">Did quicken</span>, i.e., bring from death to life; ideally, when our Lord and Head rose to life; actually, when we, by faith, were united to Him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">together with Christ</span>] As vitally and by covenant one with Him. For all His true “members,” His Death of propitiation is as if theirs; His Life of acceptance before the Father, and of spiritual triumph and power, is as if theirs also. As it is to <span class="ital">Him</span> the Divine pledge of the finished work of satisfaction, that pledge is <span class="ital">theirs;</span> as <span class="ital">He</span> appears in it “in the power of indissoluble life” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-16.htm" title="Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life.">Hebrews 7:16</a>), <span class="ital">they,</span> “because He lives, live also” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-19.htm" title="Yet a little while, and the world sees me no more; but you see me: because I live, you shall live also.">John 14:19</a>). For the phrase cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-13.htm" title=" And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, has he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses;">Colossians 2:13</a>, which fixes the main reference to Acceptance. See accordingly <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-25.htm" title="Who was delivered for our offenses, and was raised again for our justification.">Romans 4:25</a>; “He was raised again by reason of <span class="ital">our justification.</span>”—Another reading, but not well supported, gives, “He quickened us together <span class="ital">in</span> Christ.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(<span class="ital">by grace ye are saved</span>)] Lit. <span class="bld">ye have been saved</span>; and so <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-8.htm" title="For by grace are you saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:">Ephesians 2:8</a>. The verb is perfect. More usually the present tense appears, “ye are being saved;” <span class="ital">e.g.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-2.htm" title="By which also you are saved, if you keep in memory what I preached to you, unless you have believed in vain.">1 Corinthians 15:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-15.htm" title="For we are to God a sweet smell of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish:">2 Corinthians 2:15</a> (“them that are being saved; them that are perishing”); the Christian being viewed as under the <span class="ital">process of preservation</span> which is to terminate in glory. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-5.htm" title="Who are kept by the power of God through faith to salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.">1 Peter 1:5</a>. And again a frequent meaning of the noun “salvation” is that glory itself, as in the text just quoted and <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-11.htm" title="And that, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out of sleep: for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed.">Romans 13:11</a>. Here, where the whole context favours such a reference, the reference is to the <span class="ital">completeness</span>, in the Divine purpose and covenant, of the rescue of the members of the true Church. From the Divine point of view that is a <span class="ital">fait accompli</span> which from the human point of view is a thing in process, or in expectation.—“<span class="ital">By grace:</span>”—for commentary, see the Ep. to the Romans, esp. cch. 3, 4. and <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/11-5.htm" title="Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace....">Romans 11:5-6</a>. The emphatic statement here is due to the whole context, (so full of the thought of a salvation which the saved could not possibly have generated, <span class="ital">dead</span> as they were,) and, immediately, to the phrase “quickened <span class="ital">with Christ</span>,” which involves the thought of the entire dependence of their “life” on Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/ephesians/2.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-5.htm" title="Even when we were dead in sins, has quickened us together with Christ, (by grace you are saved;)">Ephesians 2:5</a>. <span class="greekheb">Καὶ</span>, <span class="ital">even</span>) This is connected with <span class="ital">you, when you were</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-1.htm" title="And you has he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins;">Ephesians 2:1</a>.—<span class="greekheb">ἡμᾶς</span>, <span class="ital">us</span>) both, Jews and Gentiles.—<span class="greekheb">συνεζωοποίησε τῷ Χριστῷ</span>· <span class="greekheb">χάριτί ἐστε σεσωσμένοι</span>, <span class="ital">hath quickened together with Christ; by grace ye are saved</span>) Quickening precedes the “raising up” [<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-6.htm" title="And has raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus:">Ephesians 2:6</a>], and ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-20.htm" title="Which he worked in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places,">Ephesians 1:20</a>; the raising up presupposes life. We were made alive at the time when Christ was made alive; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-15.htm" title="And that he died for all, that they which live should not from now on live to themselves, but to him which died for them, and rose again.">2 Corinthians 5:15</a>, concerning the death of Christ, and so of the other steps. But when <span class="ital">faith</span> is received, all those things are applied to man by God, and they are considered as ratified by man. The apostle, enumerating this very order of salvation, shows that <span class="ital">grace</span> is the beginning and the end [proram et puppim] in this and in the eighth verse, and sometimes he uses indiscriminately the first and second person, on account of the equal footing of the Jews and Gentiles.—<span class="greekheb">τῷ Χριστῷ</span>, <span class="ital">together with Christ</span>) Hence He is the fountain-head, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/2-6.htm" title="And has raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus:...">Ephesians 2:6-10</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Even when we were dead in our sins.</span> Repeated from ver. 1, in order to set in its true light the declaration that follows of what God did for us to make more emphatic the free and sovereign mercy of God. Though sin is the abominable thing which he hates, loathsome to him in the last degree, he did not turn from us when we were immersed in it; nor did he wait till we began to move towards him: he began to influence us even when we were dead. Made us alive together with Christ (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span>). <span class="cmt_word">Made us alive with the life which is in Christ and which flows from Christ.</span> A parallel is run between the way in which God's power operated on the <span class="accented">body</span> of Christ, and the way in which it operates on the <span class="accented">souls</span> of believers in him in respect of <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the quickening; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the raising up from the grave; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the seating of them in heavenly places. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Father, having "given to the Son to have life in himself," and "the Son quickening whom he will" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-21.htm">John 6:21, 26</a>), by God's decree we were first quickened by him, made partakers of Christ's life (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-25.htm">John 11:25</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-19.htm">John 14:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-5.htm">John 15:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-4.htm">Colossians 3:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-20.htm">Galatians 2:20</a>, etc.). All the life we had lost was restored - the life forfeited by transgression, the life of a calm and well-ordered heart, the sublime life of fellowship with God. <span class="cmt_word">By grace have ye been saved.</span> This is a parenthetical clause, more fully dwelt on in ver. 8, thrown in here abruptly by the apostle in the fullness of his heart, to throw light on this great wonder - that Christ should impart his own life to souls dead in sin. Grace in opposition to human merit is at the root of the whole arrangement; free, undeserved mercy. It is not anything that God is bound to by the necessity of his nature. It is the result of his will, not of his nature. Had it not been for his good pleasure, salvation had never been. "Saved" is the past participle (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>), denoting, not the act of being saved, but the fact of having been saved. Salvation in a real sense is a present possession. When we are one with Christ we are justified freely by God's grace, our trespasses are all forgiven. The spirit of new moral life has been given to us; we are made alive to God. But while salvation is a present attainment in a real sense, its full realization is future, for that includes perfect holiness, and also the glorification of the body. In this sense salvation is to come (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-24.htm">Romans 8:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-11.htm">Romans 13:11</a>). </body></html>
