But the sense seems to demand the rendering of the text, unless, indeed, we adopt the only other possible rendering, “in whom every act of building”—that is, every addition to the building—“is bonded to the rest, and grows,” &c. The clause agrees substantially, and almost verbally with <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-16.htm" title="From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplies, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, makes increase of the body to the edifying of itself in love.">Ephesians 4:16</a>—“From whom the whole body, fitly joined (<span class= "ital">framed</span>) together and compacted . . . maketh increase of the body unto the edifying (<span class= "ital">building up</span>) of itself.” In this latter passage the leading idea is of the close union of the body to the head, to which, indeed, the metaphor more properly applies than to the relation of the building to the corner-stone. For we note that St. Paul, apparently finding this relation too slight to express the full truth of the unity of the Church with Christ, first speaks of the whole building as compacted together <span class= "ital">in</span> the corner-stone, and growing—that is, being gradually built up—in that closely compacted union; and next, calls the temple so built up a “temple holy in the Lord” (<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the Lord Jesus Christ), deriving, therefore, all its sacredness as a temple from a pervading unity with Him. The corner-stone is only a part, though a dominant part, of the building. Christ not only “keeps all together, whether you speak of roof, or wall, or any other part whatsoever” (Chrys.), but by contact with Himself makes the building to be a temple.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:19-22 The church is compared to a city, and every converted sinner is free of it. It is also compared to a house, and every converted sinner is one of the family; a servant, and a child in God's house. The church is also compared to a building, founded on the doctrine of Christ; delivered by the prophets of the Old Testament, and the apostles of the New. God dwells in all believers now; they become the temple of God through the working of the blessed Spirit. Let us then ask if our hopes are fixed on Christ, according to the doctrine of his word? Have we devoted ourselves as holy temples to God through him? Are we habitations of God by the Spirit, are we spiritually-minded, and do we bring forth the fruits of the Spirit? Let us take heed not to grieve the holy Comforter. Let us desire his gracious presence, and his influences upon our hearts. Let us seek to discharge the duties allotted to us, to the glory of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ephesians/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In whom - That is, "by" whom, or "upon" whom.

Compare 1Pe 2:5; "lively stones &#8230; built up a spiritual house."

This building is to be understood of all the saints, and people of God; of the whole universal church, which is God's building; and is a building of a spiritual nature, and will abide for ever: and this is fitly framed together; it consists of various parts, as a building does; some saints are comparable to beams, some to rafters, others to pillars, &amp;c. and these are joined and united to one another, and are set in an exact symmetry and proportion, and in a proper subserviency to each other; and so as to make for the good, the strength, and beauty of the whole. And it all centres in Christ; he has a great concern in this building; he is the master builder, and the foundation and cornerstone; and it being knit together in him, <p>groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord: it grows by an accession of new stones, or of souls called by grace, and added to it; for this building is not yet openly and visibly completed, as it will be; in order to which the ministry of the word, and administration of ordinances are continued; and this will be in the latter day, when the number of God's elect, among Jews and Gentiles, shall be gathered in: and this growth may be understood also of an increase of those, who are openly laid in the building; of their spiritual growth into their head, Christ; and of an, increase of grace in them; which the word and ordinances are means of, under a divine blessing: and this building grows unto an "holy temple", the Gospel church state, called a "temple", in allusion to the temple at Jerusalem; whose materials were stones made ready and hewn, before they were brought thither; and whose magnificence, beauty, and glory, were very great; and it was the place of public worship, and of the divine abode, and was a very significant emblem of the church of God; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-16.htm">2 Corinthians 6:16</a>, which is an "holy" one, set apart for holy uses, and internally sanctified by the Spirit of God; and which is discovered by external holiness of life, and conversation in the members of it: and this is said to be "in the Lord"; which phrase may refer to the word "groweth", and denotes that growth and increase, both of persons and grace, the church has in, and from the Lord Jesus Christ; or to the word "holy", and intimates, that the holiness of the church, and every member of it, is also in and from the Lord; or to the word "temple", which is built for him to dwell in. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/ephesians/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">In whom all the building <span class="cverse3">{s}</span> fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord:</span><p>(s) So that God is the workman not only of the foundation, but also of the whole building.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/ephesians/2.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-21.htm" title="In whom all the building fitly framed together grows to an holy temple in the Lord:">Ephesians 2:21</a>.

The former interpretation, moreover, the opposition of which to linguistic usage is rightly urged also by Reiche,[162] is by no means logically necessary, since Paul was not <span class="ital">obliged</span> to proceed from the conception of the <span class="ital">whole</span> body of Christians to the community of the readers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-22.htm" title="In whom you also are built together for an habitation of God through the Spirit.">Ephesians 2:22</a>), but might pass equally well from the conception “<span class="ital">every</span> community” to the conception “<span class="ital">also ye</span>” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-22.htm" title="In whom you also are built together for an habitation of God through the Spirit.">Ephesians 2:22</a>), and thus subordinate the particular to the general. The objection that there is only <span class="ital">one</span> <span class="greekheb">οἰκοδομή</span> (de Wette) is baseless, since the collective body of Christians might be just as reasonably, as <span class="ital">every community for</span> itself, conceived as a temple-building. The latter conception is found, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-16.htm" title="Know you not that you are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?">1 Corinthians 3:16</a>, so also here, where the former is linguistically <span class="ital">impossible</span>. Chrysostom, however, is wrong in holding that by <span class="greekheb">πᾶσα οἰκοδ</span>. is signified every <span class="ital">part</span> of the building (wall, roof, etc.), since <span class="greekheb">οἰκοδομή</span> rather denotes the <span class="ital">aggregate</span> of the single parts of the building, the <span class="ital">edifice</span>, and since not a wall, a roof, etc., but only the building as a whole which is thought of, can grow unto a temple.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">συναρμολ</span>.] <span class="ital">becoming framed together</span>; for the <span class="ital">present</span> participle represents the edifice as still <span class="ital">in the process of building</span>, as indeed every community is engaged in the progressive development of its frame of Christian life until the Parousia (comp. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-15.htm" title="If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire.">1 Corinthians 3:15</a>). The participle is closely connected with <span class="greekheb">ἐν ᾧ</span>: every building, while its framing together, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> the harmonious combination of its parts into the corresponding whole, takes place in Christ, grows, etc. The compound <span class="greekheb">συναρμολογεῖν</span> (with classical writers <span class="greekheb">συναρμόζειν</span>) is met with only here and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-16.htm" title="From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplies, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, makes increase of the body to the edifying of itself in love.">Ephesians 4:16</a>, but <span class="greekheb">ἁρμολογεῖν</span> in Philipp. <span class="ital">Thess</span>. 78.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">αὔξει</span>] On this form of the present, read in the N.T. only here and at <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-19.htm" title=" And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increases with the increase of God.">Colossians 2:19</a>, but genuinely classical, see Matthiae, p. 541.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">εἰς ναὸν ἅγιον</span>] Final result of this growth. It is not, however, to be translated: unto <span class="ital">a</span> holy temple, for the conception of <span class="ital">several</span> temples was foreign to the apostle with his Jewish nationality, but: <span class="ital">unto the</span> holy temple, in which there was no need of the article (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-16.htm" title="Know you not that you are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?">1 Corinthians 3:16</a>). To realize the idea of the <span class="ital">one</span> temple—that is the goal unto which <span class="ital">every</span> community, while its organic development of life has its firm support in Christ, groweth up.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐν κυρίῳ</span>] By this not <span class="ital">God</span> is meant, as Michaelis, Koppe, Rosenmüller, Holzshausen, and others suppose, but <span class="ital">Christ</span> (see the following <span class="greekheb">ἐν ᾧ</span>). By the majority it is connected with <span class="greekheb">ἅγιον</span>, in which case it would not have, with Beza, Koppe, Rosenmüller, Flatt, to be taken for the dative, but (so also de Wette, Hofmann, Bleek) would have to be explained of the <span class="greekheb">ἁγιότης</span> of the temple, <span class="ital">having its causal ground in Christ</span>, thus specifically Christian. But the holiness of the temple lies in the dwelling of God therein (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-22.htm" title="In whom you also are built together for an habitation of God through the Spirit.">Ephesians 2:22</a>); it does not, therefore, <span class="ital">first come into existence</span> in Christ, but <span class="ital">is</span> already <span class="ital">existent</span>, and <span class="ital">the church</span> becomes in Christ that which the holy temple <span class="ital">is</span>, inasmuch as in this church the idea of the holy temple realizes itself. Others have rightly, therefore, connected it with <span class="greekheb">αὔξει</span>, although <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span> is not, with Grotius, Wolf, <span class="ital">et al.</span>, to be translated by <span class="ital">per</span>. In the case of every building which is framed together in Christ, the growing into the holy temple takes place also <span class="ital">in Christ</span> (as the one on whom this further development depends). The being framed together and the growing up of the building to its sacred destination—<span class="ital">both</span> not otherwise than <span class="ital">in the Lord</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[161] Observe the apostle’s view of the church, as a whole and in its single parts, as one living <span class="ital">organism</span>. Comp. Thiersch, <span class="ital">die Kirche im apost. Zeitalt</span>. p. 154, 162; Ehrenfeuchier, <span class="ital">prakt. Theol</span>. I. p. 55 ff.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[162] The admissibility of the anarthrous form <span class="greekheb">πᾶσα αἰκοδομή</span>, in the sense of “the <span class="ital">whole</span> building,” cannot be at all conceded, since <span class="greekheb">οἰκοδομή</span> is neither a proper name, nor to be regarded as equivalent to such. See Winer, p. 101 [E. T. 140]; Buttmann, <span class="ital">neut. Gram</span>. p. 78 [E. T. 86]. In general <span class="greekheb">πᾶς</span> in the sense of <span class="ital">whole</span> can only be without an article, when the substantive to which it belongs would not need the article even without <span class="greekheb">πᾶς</span> (Krüger, § 50, 11. 9). Hence <span class="greekheb">πᾶσα οἰκοδ</span>. can only signify either <span class="ital">every building</span>, or else <span class="ital">a building utterly</span>. In the latter sense Chrysostom appears, very unsuitably, no doubt (see above), to have taken it. According to Hofmann, II. 2, p. 123, <span class="greekheb">πᾶσα οἰκοδ</span>. is meant to signify “<span class="ital">whatever becomes a constituent part</span> of a building” (thus also the Gentiles who become Christians). As if <span class="greekheb">οἰκοδομή</span> could mean <span class="ital">constituent part</span> of a building! It signifies, even in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-1.htm" title="And Jesus went out, and departed from the temple: and his disciples came to him for to show him the buildings of the temple.">Matthew 24:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/13-1.htm" title="And as he went out of the temple, one of his disciples said to him, Master, see what manner of stones and what buildings are here!">Mark 13:1</a> f., <span class="ital">edifice.</span> And as if <span class="greekheb">πᾶσα</span>, <span class="ital">every</span> part of the building, when in fact only <span class="ital">two</span> constituent parts, namely Jews and Gentiles, could be thought of, were in harmony with this relation! The rendering is <span class="ital">linguistically</span> and <span class="ital">logically</span> incorrect.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/ephesians/2.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-21.htm" title="In whom all the building fitly framed together grows to an holy temple in the Lord:">Ephesians 2:21</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἐν ᾧ πᾶσα ἡ οἰκοδομὴ συναρμολογουμένη αὔξει εἰς ναὸν ἅγιον ἐν Κυρίῳ</span>: <span class="ital">in whom each several building</span> (RV text; “every building,” RV marg.), <span class="ital">fitly framed together, groweth into a holy temple in the Lord</span>. The relative refers naturally to the nearest subject, what is also the leading subject, <span class="greekheb">Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ</span>, not to the <span class="greekheb">ἀκρογωνιαίου</span>, far less to the remoter <span class="greekheb">θεμελίῳ</span>; the <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span> also has its full sense of <span class="ital">in</span>, not <span class="ital">by</span> or <span class="ital">on</span>. That is to say, it is <span class="ital">in Christ Jesus</span>, and only by connection with Him, that the <span class="greekheb">οἰκοδομή</span> is what it is here declared to be. The word <span class="greekheb">οἰκοδομή</span> appears to be confined to late Greek, no <span class="ital">certain</span> instance of it having been found in classical Greek. It occurs in Diod., Philo, Plut., Joseph., the LXX, Macc., etc. It is used both for <span class="greekheb">οἰκοδόμησις</span> and <span class="greekheb">οἰκοδόμημα</span>. In the NT it has sometimes the literal sense of <span class="greekheb">οἰκοδόμημα</span> (<span class="ital">e.g.</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-1.htm" title="And Jesus went out, and departed from the temple: and his disciples came to him for to show him the buildings of the temple.">Matthew 24:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/13-1.htm" title="And as he went out of the temple, one of his disciples said to him, Master, see what manner of stones and what buildings are here!">Mark 13:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-1.htm" title="For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.">2 Corinthians 5:1</a>); and sometimes the figurative sense of <span class="ital">edification</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-19.htm" title="Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things with which one may edify another.">Romans 14:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-2.htm" title="Let every one of us please his neighbor for his good to edification.">Romans 15:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-10.htm" title="Therefore I write these things being absent, lest being present I should use sharpness, according to the power which the Lord has given me to edification, and not to destruction.">2 Corinthians 13:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-20.htm" title="But you have not so learned Christ;">Ephesians 4:20</a>), or, as here, that of a <span class="ital">body of Christian believers</span>. The question of the text here is important. There is considerable support for <span class="greekheb">πᾶσα ἡ οἰκοδομή</span> ([188] [189] [190], Arm., etc.), and it is conceivable that itacism might have caused the omission of the <span class="greekheb">ἡ</span>. But diplomatic evidence is decidedly in favour of <span class="greekheb">πᾶσα οἰκοδομή</span> ([191] [192] [193] [194] [195] [196] [197], etc.). Adopting this reading (with LTTrWHRV) we have to ask whether the phrase is to be rendered <span class="ital">the whole building</span> or <span class="ital">every building</span>. The former rendering is certainly the one that first suggests itself, while the latter seems at first difficult to relate to the context. The former is defended as legitimate by some weighty authorities; <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, Winer, on the ground that the subject is “the Church of Christ as a whole,” and Ellicott, who takes it to be a case of grammatical laxity. But the distinction between <span class="greekheb">πᾶς</span> with the article and <span class="greekheb">πᾶς</span> without it is so well maintained in the NT that only an absolutely intolerable sense can justify us in departing from it. The only exceptions to the general rule appear to be those that hold good also for ordinary Greek—in general and unqualified statements, with proper names, and with nouns which have acquired so stated a meaning that they can drop the article, etc. (<span class="ital">cf.</span> Win.-Moult., p. 138, and especially Buttm., <span class="ital">Gram. of N. T. Greek</span>, pp. 119, 120; Blass, <span class="ital">Gram. of N. T. Greek</span>, pp. 161, 162). The present instance does not come within the scope of these exceptions. It is not like <span class="greekheb">πᾶς οἶκος Ἰσραήλ</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-36.htm" title="Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God has made the same Jesus, whom you have crucified, both Lord and Christ.">Acts 2:36</a>), nor is it really analogous even to such cases as the <span class="greekheb">πᾶσα γῆ</span> of Thucyd., ii., 43, or the <span class="greekheb">πᾶσα ἐπιστολή</span> of Ignat., <span class="ital">Eph.</span>, 12. Hence the rendering here must be “every building” or “every several building”. The present participle <span class="greekheb">συναρμολογουμένη</span> (the verb occurs in the NT only here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-16.htm" title="From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplies, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, makes increase of the body to the edifying of itself in love.">Ephesians 4:16</a>, and corresponds to the classical <span class="greekheb">συναρμόζειν</span>) describes the joining together as a process now going on. The pres. <span class="greekheb">αὔξει</span> (a form occurring in the NT only here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-19.htm" title=" And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increases with the increase of God.">Colossians 2:19</a>, but common in Soph., Thucyd., Pind., etc.) in like manner expresses what is happening now, or, it may be, what is <span class="ital">normal</span>. The phrase <span class="greekheb">νάον ἅγιον</span> is sufficiently rendered “<span class="ital">a</span> holy temple” or “sanctuary”. Some (<span class="ital">e.g.</span>, Mey.), supposing that Paul has the Jewish temple in view and means to say that the Christian Church is now the true Temple of God, the house made His own sanctuary by His dwelling in it, would render it “<span class="ital">the</span> holy temple”. The <span class="greekheb">ἐν Κυρίῳ</span> is connected by some (Harl., etc.) immediately with <span class="greekheb">ἅγιον</span>, = a temple that is holy as being in the Lord; by others with <span class="greekheb">ναὸν ἅγιον</span> (Ell.); by others with <span class="greekheb">αὔξει</span> (Mey.). But it really qualifies the whole statement of the <span class="ital">joining</span> and <span class="ital">growing</span>. All this is in the Lord, <span class="ital">i.e., in Christ</span>, as both the context and the general NT application of <span class="greekheb">Κύριος</span> show. The sense of the whole, therefore, is this—in Christ the Lord every several building that goes to make up the ideal Temple of God, every Christian community, the one now addressed not less than others, is at present being surely framed and fitted together, and is growing and harmoniously developing so that it may form part of the great mystical Body of Christ, the vast spiritual fellowship of believers which is God’s true Temple.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[188] Codex Sinaiticus (sæc. iv.), now at St. Petersburg, published in facsimile type by its discoverer, Tischendorf, in 1862.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[189] Codex Alexandrinus (sæc. v.), at the British Museum, published in photographic facsimile by Sir E.

V., “<span class="ital">each several building;</span>” as if the great Temple were viewed for the moment in its multiplicity of porches, courts, and towers; each connected with the great bond of the substructure, in and on which the whole architecture was rising.—An interesting grammatical question arises over the reading here and this rendering, and will occur again <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-15.htm" title="Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named,">Ephesians 3:15</a> :—does the Greek phrase, in the best attested reading, <span class="ital">demand</span> the rendering of the R. V. as against that of the A. V.? We incline to the reply that it does not. The law of the definite article (the absence of which here occasions the question) is undoubtedly somewhat less exact in the Greek of the Scriptures than in that of the classics. And this leaves us free to use (with caution) <span class="ital">the</span> context to decide problems which in the classics would be decided by pure grammar. Such a case we take this to be; and the question to ask is, does the context favour the imagery of <span class="ital">detail</span> or that of <span class="ital">total?</span> Surely the latter. The idea points to one great building, getting completed within itself, rising to its ideal. We retain accordingly the A. V. See further, next note.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">fitly framed together</span>] One word, a present participle, in the Greek. The same occurs below, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-16.htm" title="From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplies, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, makes increase of the body to the edifying of itself in love.">Ephesians 4:16</a> (“fitly <span class="ital">joined</span> together”), and nowhere else in N. T. The idea is not of a completed but of a progressive work, a “framing together” of the structure ever more closely and firmly. The building shrinks into greater solidity, binds itself into more intense coherence, as it grows. The spiritual union of the saints needs but to be more believed and realized to tell more on their actual closeness of connexion.—The idea conveyed by this word, which is of course in the singular number, is (see last note) far rather that of one great building growing in internal solidity than of many buildings growing in contact.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">groweth</span>] with the perpetual addition of new “living stones” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-5.htm" title="You also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.">1 Peter 2:5</a>) and the resulting new connexions. Observe two distinct ideas in harmony; growth in compactness, growth in extension.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">unto a holy temple</span>] R. V., margin, “into an holy <span class="bld">sanctuary</span>.” The Greek (<span class="ital">nâos</span>) is not the temple-<span class="ital">area</span> with its courts and porches (<span class="ital">hiëron</span>), but the temple-<span class="ital">house;</span> the place of the Presence.—The phrase, “unto,” “into,” suggests (like that in the next verse) a sanctuary not yet complete and ready for the Presence. The true Church, indeed, <span class="ital">is already</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-16.htm" title="Know you not that you are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?">1 Corinthians 3:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-16.htm" title="And what agreement has the temple of God with idols? for you are the temple of the living God; as God has said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.">2 Corinthians 6:16</a>; and cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-19.htm" title="What? know you not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which you have of God, and you are not your own?">1 Corinthians 6:19</a> of its individual members) “the sanctuary of the living God.” But it is this as a still imperfect thing, and still imperfectly; the absolute and final in the matter is yet to come; and this will so transcend the partial and actual that it is spoken of <span class="ital">as if</span> the Indwelling were not yet. We may faintly illustrate by an unfinished cathedral, used already for Divine worship, but not yet ideally prepared for it.—See <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-22.htm" title="And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it.">Revelation 21:22</a> for another side of truth in temple-imagery. There, in the final state, there is “no sanctuary,” for God and the Lamb “are the sanctuary of” the holy City. All, absolutely all, is hallowed by Their Presence indwelling; Sanctuary and Shechinah are, <span class="ital">as it were</span>, one; and nothing is there that is not Sanctuary.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Great indeed is the conception in this passage. The saints, in their community “in the Lord,” are preparing, through an Indwelling partial though real, for an Indwelling complete and eternal; the two being, in continuity, one. In no mere figure of speech, their God already “dwells” in their bodies, and in their community; dwells there as in a Sanctuary—in manifested Light, in Peace of covenant and propitiation, in Oracle-speech of “the Spirit’s witness,” in eternal Life. And this precious present fact is germinating to the future result of a heavenly and everlasting Indwelling (likewise in individuals and in community), when the Sanctuary shall reflect without a flaw its Indweller’s glory; when our union and communion with Him, in other words, shall be perfect, absolute, ideal. “We shall be like Him; for we shall see Him as He is.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in the Lord</span>] The Lord Christ. We have “God” in the next verse, in a way which indicates this distinctive reference here. The imagery leaves the precise idea of the Corner Stone, to present the Lord as the living bond and principle, the secret both of growth and sanctity.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/ephesians/2.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-21.htm" title="In whom all the building fitly framed together grows to an holy temple in the Lord:">Ephesians 2:21</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἐν ᾧ</span>, <span class="ital">in whom</span>) In Christ.

"each several building." But surely the want of the article does not make imperative a rendering which is out of keeping with the apostle's object, viz. to illustrate the organic unity of believers, Jewish and Gentile, as one great body (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-4.htm">Ephesians 4:4</a>, "There is one body"). If there had been many several or separate buildings in the apostle's view, why not a Jewish building and a Gentile building?

The Church has many members in one body, and all members have not the same office. It is a co-operative body, each aiding in his own way and with his own talent. The Church is not a collection of loose stones and timbers; its members are in vital union with Christ, and ought to be in living and loving and considerate fellowship with each other. <span class="cmt_word">Groweth into a holy temple in the Lord.</span> Increase is an essential property of the Church; wherever there is life there is growth. But the growth of the Church is not mere increase of members or size; the growth is <span class="accented">towards</span> a temple, of which the character is holy, and it is in the Lord. The world-famed temple of Diana at Ephesus may have been in the apostle's mind - its symmetry, its glory, the relation of each several part to the rest and to the whole, as a suitable external emblem of the spiritual body which is being built up in Christ; but the Christian Church is a <span class="accented">holy</span> temple, dedicated to God, purified by his Spirit, entirely foreign to those defilements which disgraced the temple of Diana.
