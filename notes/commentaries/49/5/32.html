(1) The indissoluble and paramount sacredness of marriage, as all history shows, is “a mystery”—that is (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-9.htm" title="Having made known to us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he has purposed in himself:">Ephesians 1:9</a>), a secret of God’s law, fully revealed in Christ alone. For in heathen, and, to some extent, even in Jewish thought, marriage was a contract far less sacred than the indissoluble tie of blood; and wherever Christian principle is renounced or obscured, that ancient idea recurs in modern times. It may be noted that from the translation here of the word “mystery,” by <span class= "ital">sacramentum</span> in the Latin versions, the application of the word “sacrament” to marriage arose. (2) But the following words, “But I” (the word “I” being emphatic) “speak concerning Christ and the Church,” show—what indeed the whole passage has already shown—that St. Paul’s chief thought has passed from the type to the Antitype. He has constantly dwelt on points which suit only Christ’s relation to the Church, and to that relation he has, by an irresistible gravitation of thought, been brought back again and again. (3) Yet the two cannot be separate. The type brings out some features of the Antitype which no other comparison makes clear; and history shows that the sacredness of the type in the Church has depended on this great passage—bearing, as it does, emphatic witness against the ascetic tendency to look on marriage as simply a concession to weakness, and as leading to a life necessarily lower than the celibate life.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:22-33 The duty of wives is, submission to their husbands in the Lord, which includes honouring and obeying them, from a principle of love to them. The duty of husbands is to love their wives. The love of Christ to the church is an example, which is sincere, pure, and constant, notwithstanding her failures. Christ gave himself for the church, that he might sanctify it in this world, and glorify it in the next, that he might bestow on all his members a principle of holiness, and deliver them from the guilt, the pollution, and the dominion of sin, by those influences of the Holy Spirit, of which baptismal water was the outward sign. The church and believers will not be without spot or wrinkle till they come to glory. But those only who are sanctified now, shall be glorified hereafter. The words of Adam, mentioned by the apostle, are spoken literally of marriage; but they have also a hidden sense in them, relating to the union between Christ and his church. It was a kind of type, as having resemblance. There will be failures and defects on both sides, in the present state of human nature, yet this does not alter the relation. All the duties of marriage are included in unity and love. And while we adore and rejoice in the condescending love of Christ, let husbands and wives learn hence their duties to each other. Thus the worst evils would be prevented, and many painful effects would be avoided.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ephesians/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This is a great mystery - The Latin Vulgate translates this, "sacramentum hoc magnum est" - "this is a great sacrament" - and this is the proof, I suppose, and the only proof adduced by the papists that marriage is a "sacrament." But the original here conveys no such idea. The word "mystery" - &#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;  muste&#772;rion - means something which is concealed, hidden, before unknown; something into which one must be "initiated" or instructed before he can understand it. It does not mean that it is "incomprehensible" when it is disclosed, but that hitherto it has been kept secret. When disclosed it may be as intelligible as any other truth; see the word explained in the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-9.htm">Ephesians 1:9</a>. Here it means simply, that there was much about the union of the Redeemer with his people, resembling the marriage connection, which was not obvious, except to those who were instructed; which was obscure to those who were not initiated; which they did not understand who had not been "taught." It does not mean that no one could understand it, but that it pertained to the class of truths into which it was necessary for one to be "initiated" in order to comprehend them. The truth that was so great a mystery was, that the eternal Son of God should form such an union with people; that he should take them into a connection with himself, implying an ardor of attachment, and a strength of affection superior to even that which exists in the marriage relation. This was a great and profound truth, to understand which, it was necessary to receive instruction. No one would have understood it without a revelation; no one understands it now except they who are taught of God.<p>But I speak concerning Christ and the church - This, it seems to me, is an explicit disclaimer of any intention to be understood as affirming that the marriage contract was designed to be a "type" of the union of the Redeemer and his people. The apostle says expressly, that his remarks do not refer to "marriage at all" when he speaks of the mystery. They refer "solely" to the union of the Redeemer and his people. How strange and unwarranted, therefore, are all the comments of expositors on this passage designed to explain marriage as "a mysterious type" of the union of Christ and the church! If people would allow the apostle to speak for himself, and not force on him sentiments which he expressly disclaims, the world would be saved from such insipid allegories as Macknight and others have derived from this passage. The Bible is a book of sense; and the time will come, it is hoped, when, freed from all such allegorizing expositions, it will commend itself to the good sense of mankind. Marriage is an important, a holy, a noble, a pure institution, altogether worthy of God; but it does not thence follow that marriage was designed to be a type of the union between Christ and the church, and it is certain that the apostle Paul meant; to teach no such thing. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ephesians/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>32. Rather, "This mystery is a great one." This profound truth, beyond man's power of discovering, but now revealed, namely, of the spiritual union of Christ and the Church, represented by the marriage union, is a great one, of deep import. See on [2373]Eph 5:30. So "mystery" is used of a divine truth not to be discovered save by revelation of God (Ro 11:25; 1Co 15:51). The Vulgate wrongly translates, "This is a great sacrament," which is made the plea by the Romish Church (in spite of the blunder having been long ago exposed by their own commentators, Cajetan and Estius) for making marriage a sacrament; it is plain not marriage in general, but that of Christ and the Church, is what is pronounced to be a "great mystery," as the words following prove, "I [emphatic] say it in regard to Christ and to the Church" (so the Greek is best translated). "I, while I quote these words out of Scripture, use them in a higher sense" [Conybeare and Howson].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ephesians/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">This is a great mystery; </span> either, this that was spoken before of a marriage union between Christ and the church, and its being of his flesh and of his bones, is a great mystery, and so in the latter part of the verse the apostle explains himself. Or, this that was said of the conjunction of Adam and Eve was a great mystery, (i.e. a great secret in religion), as being a type of Christ’s marriage with his church; though not an instituted type appointed by God to signify this, yet a kind of natural type, as having a resemblance to it. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/ephesians/5.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>This is a great mystery,.... It has something mysterious in it; it is a figure and emblem of the mysterious union between Christ and his people: for so it follows, <p>but I speak concerning Christ and the church; or mention this law and institution of marriage, with respect to them; for the leaving of father and mother prefigured Christ's coming forth from the Father, and coming into this world in human nature, and his disregard to his earthly parents, in comparison with his people, and his service for them; the man cleaving to the wife very aptly expresses the strong affection of Christ to his church, and the near communion there is between them; and their being one flesh denotes the union of them; and indeed, the marriage of Adam and Eve was a type of Christ and his church; for in this the first Adam was a figure of him that was to come, as well as in being a federal head to his posterity: Adam was before Eve, so Christ was before his church; God thought it not proper that man should be alone, so neither Christ, but that he should have some fellows and companions with him: the formation of Eve from Adam was typical of the church's production from Christ; she was made of him while he was asleep, which sleep was from the Lord, and it was not an ordinary one; which may resemble the sufferings and death of Christ, which were from the Lord, and were not common; and which are the redemption of his church and people; and which secure their comfort and happiness, and wellbeing: she was taken out of his side, and built up a woman of one of his ribs; both the justification and sanctification of the church are from Christ, from the water and the blood which issued out of his side, when on the cross: the bringing and presentation of Eve to Adam has its mystery; it was God that brought her to him; and she was the same that was made out of him; and to the same Adam was she brought of whose rib she was made, and that not against her will: so it is God that draws souls to Christ, and espouses them to him, even the same that he has chosen in him, and Christ has redeemed by his blood; and to the same are they brought, who was wounded for their transgressions, and bruised for their sins; and they are made willing in the day of his power upon them, to come and give themselves to him. Adam's consent and acknowledgment of Eve to be his wife, shadow forth Christ's hearty reception and acknowledgment of the saints, as being of him, and his, when they are brought unto him under the influences of his grace and Spirit. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/ephesians/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{15}</span> This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church.</span><p>(15) That no man might dream of natural union or knitting of Christ and his Church together (such as the husbands and the wives is) he shows that it is secret, that is, spiritual and such as differs greatly from the common capacity of man.

With the Rabbins, too, the formula <span class="ital">mysterium magnum</span> (<span class="ital">Jalkut. Rub</span>. f. 59, Ephesians 4 : <span class="greekheb">דא רזא יקירא</span>) is very common. See Schoettgen, Horae, p. 783 f.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐγὼ δέ</span>] <span class="greekheb">ἐγώ</span>, which Holzhausen even declares to be superfluous, has emphasis: I, however (<span class="greekheb">δέ</span> metabatic), opposed to the possible interpretations which might be given to the mysterious utterance.[289]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">εἰς Χριστὸν καὶ εἰς τὴν ἐκκλησίαν</span>] so that we have thus under <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἌΝΘΡΩΠΟς</span></span></span> to understand <span class="ital">Christ</span>, and under <span class="greekheb">ἡ γυνὴ αὐτοῦ</span> the <span class="ital">church</span>. This has been rightly discerned already by the Fathers (see Chrysostom, Theodoret, Theophylact, Jerome), only they should not have thought of the coming of Christ in the flesh (in connection with which Jerome interpreted <span class="greekheb">τὴν μητέρα</span> of the heavenly Jerusalem; comp. Estius), but of the Parousia. See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-31.htm" title="For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined to his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.">Ephesians 5:31</a>. Lastly, it is worthy of notice simply under a historical point of view, that Roman Catholics (but not Erasmus, Cajetanus, or Estius), on the ground of the Vulgate, which translates <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΜΥΣΤΉΡΙΟΝ</span></span></span> by <span class="ital">sacramentum</span>, proved from our passage[290] that marriage is a sacrament. It is not this that is conveyed in the passage, as indeed in general marriage “non habet a Christo <span class="ital">institutionem</span> sacramentalem, non <span class="ital">formam</span>, non <span class="ital">materiam</span>, non <span class="ital">finem</span> sacramentalem” (Calovius, and see the <span class="ital">Apol. Conf. Aug</span>. p. 202), but it is rather the sacredly ideal and deeply moral character, which is for ever assured to marriage by this typical significance in the Christian view. We may add that monogamy is <span class="ital">presupposed</span> as self-evident, but does not form the <span class="ital">set purpose</span> of the passage, which would be purely <span class="ital">imported</span> (in opposition to Schwegler, p. 387).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[289] Later Rabbinico-mystical interpretations of marriage may be seen in Schoettgen, <span class="ital">Hor</span>. p. 784. Philo, p. 1096, allegorizes those words in reference to reason, which forsakes wisdom and follows the senses.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[290] See also <span class="ital">Catech.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-8.htm" title="But to them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath,">Romans 2:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-16.htm" title="In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel.">Romans 2:16</a> f.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/ephesians/5.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-32.htm" title="This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church.">Ephesians 5:32</a>. <span class="greekheb">τὸ μυστήριον τοῦτο μέγα ἐστίν</span>: <span class="ital">this mystery is great</span>. Not “this is a great mystery,” as it is rendered by the AV and Rhem.; nor “this is a great secret,” Tynd., Cran., gen. The term <span class="greekheb">μυστήριον</span> (on which see under <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-9.htm" title="Having made known to us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he has purposed in himself:">Ephesians 1:9</a> above) cannot mean <span class="ital">allegory</span> or <span class="ital">dark-saying</span>, but must have its usual sense of something once hidden and now revealed, a secret disclosed. It cannot refer, therefore, as Mey. makes it do, to the quotation from <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-24.htm" title="Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall join to his wife: and they shall be one flesh.">Genesis 2:24</a> as a passage with a hidden typical or mystical meaning, one <span class="ital">deep</span> (<span class="greekheb">μέγα</span>) and difficult to reach. Nor can it well refer to the spiritual union of Christ and the Church by itself (Beng.), or to the comparison between the union of husband and wife and that of Christ and the Church (Est.), as the <span class="greekheb">ἐγὼ δὲ λέγω</span> would then lose its point. It is simplest to take it as referring to Christian truth touching the relation between husband and wife as set forth in these verses. That truth is described by <span class="greekheb">μέγα</span> as <span class="ital">great, i.e.</span>, in the sense of grandeur and importance. The Vulg. rendering <span class="ital">sacramentum</span> (followed by Wicl. and the Rhem.) has induced many Roman Catholic theologians to found on this as a passage presenting <span class="ital">marriage</span> in the character of a <span class="ital">sacrament</span>—a perverted interpretation which was disavowed indeed by distinguished scholars like Cajetan and Estius in the Roman Catholic Church itself. It may be added that Alford understands by the <span class="greekheb">μυστήριον</span> “the matter mystically alluded to in the Apostle’s application of the text just quoted; the mystery of the spiritual union of Christ with our humanity, typified by the close conjunction of the marriage state”. And Von Soden, taking the <span class="greekheb">τοῦτο</span>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-51.htm" title="Behold, I show you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,">1 Corinthians 15:51</a>, to refer to what <span class="ital">follows</span>, supposes the sense to be “this secret, that is, what I am about to say as the secret sense of this sentence, is great”. Hatch, again, who regards <span class="greekheb">μυστήριον</span> as closely related in sense to <span class="greekheb">τύπος</span>, <span class="greekheb">σύμβολον</span> and <span class="greekheb">παραβολή</span> and interchangeable with them, gives <span class="greekheb">μυστήριον</span> the sense of “symbol” (which he thinks is its meaning also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-20.htm" title="The mystery of the seven stars which you saw in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches: and the seven candlesticks which you saw are the seven churches.">Revelation 1:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-7.htm" title="And the angel said to me, Why did you marvel? I will tell you the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carries her, which has the seven heads and ten horns.">Revelation 17:7</a>), and renders it “this symbol (<span class="ital">sc.</span> of the joining of husband and wife into one flesh) is a great one” (<span class="ital">Essays in Biblical Greek</span>, p. 61).—<span class="greekheb">ἐγὼ δὲ λέγω εἰς Χριστόν</span>, <span class="greekheb">καὶ</span> [<span class="greekheb">εἰς</span>] <span class="greekheb">τὴν ἐκκλησίαν</span>: <span class="ital">but I speak with reference to Christ and the Church</span>. The second <span class="greekheb">εἰς</span> is omitted by LWH, as not found in [715] [716], Iren., Tert., etc.; it is inserted, however, in [717] [718] [719] [720] [721], Orig., Meth., Theodor., Cypr., Hil., etc. The formula <span class="greekheb">λέγω δέ</span> is used in various Pauline passages where an <span class="ital">explanation</span> of something previously said is in view (<span class="ital">e.g.</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-12.htm" title="Now this I say, that every one of you said, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.">1 Corinthians 1:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-17.htm" title="And this I say, that the covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot cancel, that it should make the promise of none effect.">Galatians 3:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-1.htm" title="Now I say, That the heir, as long as he is a child, differs nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all;">Galatians 4:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-16.htm" title="This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh.">Galatians 5:16</a>; <span class="ital">cf.</span> <span class="greekheb">τοῦτο δέ φημι</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-29.htm" title="But this I say, brothers, the time is short: it remains, that both they that have wives be as though they had none;">1 Corinthians 7:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-50.htm" title="Now this I say, brothers, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither does corruption inherit incorruption.">1 Corinthians 15:50</a>). Here too, the sense is not “I <span class="ital">interpret</span> it,” but simply “I <span class="ital">say</span> it,” “I <span class="ital">mean</span> it”. The <span class="greekheb">δέ</span> has here its <span class="ital">disjunctive</span> force, introducing an explanation and separating it from the thing explained (Thayer-Grimm, <span class="ital">Greek-Engl. Lex. of N. T.</span>, p. 125). The <span class="greekheb">εἰς</span> is the prep, of <span class="ital">ethical direction</span>, indicating that towards which the mind is looking (Thayer-Grimm, <span class="ital">ut sup.</span>, p. 184; and <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-25.htm" title="For David speaks concerning him, I foresaw the Lord always before my face, for he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved:">Acts 2:25</a>), = “<span class="ital">with reference</span> to Christ,” not “<span class="ital">of</span> Christ,” far less “<span class="ital">in</span> Christ” as the Vulg. unhappily renders it. The emphatic position of the <span class="greekheb">ἐγώ</span> gives it to be understood that what immediately follows is the writer’s own way of putting the matter just stated, or his own application of the words of Scripture. The sense, therefore, is this—“the truth of which I have spoken, the relation of husband and wife as one flesh, is a revelation of profound importance; but let me explain that, in speaking of it as I have done, <span class="ital">my</span> meaning is to direct your minds to that higher relation between Christ and His Church, in its likeness to which lies its deepest significance.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[715] Codex Vaticanus (sæc. iv.), published in photographic facsimile in 1889 under the care of the Abbate Cozza-Luzi.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[716] Codex Mosquensis (sæc. ix.), edited by Matthæi in 1782.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[717] Codex Sinaiticus (sæc. iv.), now at St. Petersburg, published in facsimile type by its discoverer, Tischendorf, in 1862.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[718] Codex Alexandrinus (sæc. v.), at the British Museum, published in photographic facsimile by Sir E.

The thing answering to such a description in this context is, surely, “the mystical union and fellowship betwixt Christ and His Church.” It can scarcely be the marriage union of mortal man and wife.

He declines to see, with Harless, a mere accommodation of the words of Genesis. For him, those words, narrating true facts, are also a Divinely planned type. “When St Paul quotes, by the Holy Spirit, a declaration of the Holy Spirit, it is the Holy Spirit’s thought and not his own that he gives us … The relation which he indicates between the two unions … is based in the depths of the Divine thought, and on the harmony established between things visible and invisible … The marriage instituted in Eden was really, in the plan of God, a type of the union of Christ with His Church.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>For a reference by the Lord Himself to the passage in Genesis, though with another purpose, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/19-4.htm" title="And he answered and said to them, Have you not read, that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female,...">Matthew 19:4-5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/mark/10-6.htm" title="But from the beginning of the creation God made them male and female....">Mark 10:6-9</a>.

It is called a mystery, and it is not said, as is said of another mystery, referred to before (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-5.htm">Ephesians 3:5</a>), that it has been completely explained. Some light has been thrown upon it, but that is all. It is implied that there is something of mystery in many of the relations between things natural and things spiritual, but that in the depth and grandeur of the subject, the mystery connected with the marriage relation is pre-eminent - it is "a great mystery" The analogy of the wind to the Holy Spirit; the springing up of plants to the resurrection; the melancholy sounds of nature to the prevalence of sin; and many other analogies, present vague shadows of truth, the clear, full forms of which we cannot see. When the day breaks and "the shadows flee away," such things will appear in a clearer light. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/ephesians/5.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>A great mystery<p>Great is predicative, not attributive.
