The duty of husbands is to love their wives. The love of Christ to the church is an example, which is sincere, pure, and constant, notwithstanding her failures. Christ gave himself for the church, that he might sanctify it in this world, and glorify it in the next, that he might bestow on all his members a principle of holiness, and deliver them from the guilt, the pollution, and the dominion of sin, by those influences of the Holy Spirit, of which baptismal water was the outward sign. The church and believers will not be without spot or wrinkle till they come to glory. But those only who are sanctified now, shall be glorified hereafter. The words of Adam, mentioned by the apostle, are spoken literally of marriage; but they have also a hidden sense in them, relating to the union between Christ and his church. It was a kind of type, as having resemblance. There will be failures and defects on both sides, in the present state of human nature, yet this does not alter the relation. All the duties of marriage are included in unity and love. And while we adore and rejoice in the condescending love of Christ, let husbands and wives learn hence their duties to each other. Thus the worst evils would be prevented, and many painful effects would be avoided.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ephesians/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>That he may present it to himself - In the last day, when he shall receive the church as his spouse to heaven; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-9.htm">Revelation 21:9</a>. Perhaps the word "prepare" would better express the sense here than "present" - that he may prepare it for himself as a holy church. Tyndale renders it, "to make it unto himself."<p>A glorious church - A church full of honor, splendor, beauty. The idea of "shining," or of being "bright," would convey the sense here. Probably there is still here an allusion to a bride "adorned for her husband" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-2.htm">Revelation 21:2</a>; compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/45-9.htm">Psalm 45:9-14</a>); and the ideal is, that the church will be worthy of the love of the bridegroom, to whom it will then be presented.<p>Not having spot - Not having a stain, a defect, or any impurity - still retaining the allusion to a bride, and to the care taken to remove every blemish.<p>Or wrinkle - In the vigor and beauty of youth like a bride in whom there is no wrinkle of age.<p>Or any such thing - Nothing to deform, disfigure, or offend. To this beautiful illustration of the final glory of the church, the apostle was led by the mention of the relation of the husband and the wife. It shows:<p>(1) The tendency of the thoughts of Paul. He delighted to allow the associations in his mind, no matter what the subject was, to draw him along to the Redeemer.<p>(2) the passage here shows us what the church will yet be. There will be a period in its history when there shall not be any imperfection; when there shall be neither spot, nor wrinkle, nor any such thing. In heaven all will be pure. On earth we are preparing for that world of purity; and it cannot be denied that here there is much that is imperfect and impure. But in that future world, where the church shall be presented to Christ, clothed in the robes of salvation, there shall not be one unholy member; one deceiver or hypocrite; one covetous or avaricious man; one that shall pain the hearts of the friends of purity by an unholy life. And in all the million that shall be gathered there out of every land, and people, and tongue, and age, there shall be no envy, malice, backbiting, pride, vanity, worldliness; there shall be no annoying and vexing conflict in the heart with evil passions, "nor any such thing."

Holiness and glory are inseparable. "Cleansing" is the necessary preliminary to both. Holiness is glory internal; glory is holiness shining forth outwardly. The laver of baptism is the vehicle, but the word is the nobler and true instrument of the cleansing [Bengel]. It is Christ that prepares the Church with the necessary ornaments of grace, for presentation to Himself, as the Bridegroom at His coming again (Mt 25:1, &c.; Re 19:7; 21:2).<p>not having spot&#8212;(So 4:7). The visible Church now contains clean and unclean together, like Noah's ark; like the wedding room which contained some that had, and others that had not, the wedding garment (Mt 22:10-14; compare 2Ti 2:20); or as the good and bad fish are taken in the same net because it cannot discern the bad from the good, the fishermen being unable to know what kind of fish the nets have taken under the waves. Still the Church is termed "holy" in the creed, in reference to her ideal and ultimate destination. When the Bridegroom comes, the bride shall be presented to Him wholly without spot, the evil being cut off from the body for ever (Mt 13:47-50). Not that there are two churches, one with bad and good intermingled, another in which there are good alone; but one and the same Church in relation to different times, now with good and evil together, hereafter with good alone [Pearson].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ephesians/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">That he might present it to himself; </span> hereafter in heaven; that the whole church of the elect may be present with him, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-6.htm" title="Therefore we are always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord:">2 Corinthians 5:6</a>,8 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-17.htm" title="Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.">1 Thessalonians 4:17</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">A glorious church; </span> perfect in knowledge and holiness, shining with a heavenly glory, and fully conformed to himself, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-2.htm" title="Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it does not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.">1Jo 3:2</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Not having spot; </span> spot of sin, in allusion to spots in garments. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Or wrinkle; </span> any relic of old Adam, in allusion to wrinkles in the body, which are signs of old age, and imply deformity. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Or any such thing, </span> viz. which is contrary to the beauty of the church, and might make her unpleasing to Christ her Husband. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Without blemish; </span> without any fault to be found in her.

There is a presentation of the church by Christ to his Father at his death, when he gathered the elect together in one, brought them nigh, and reconciled them to God, and presented them to holy, unblamable, and unreproveable in his sight; and now in heaven, where he represents their persons, appears and makes intercession for them; and at the last day, when he will deliver the whole number of them complete and perfect, in consequence of his suretyship engagements: but this is a presentation of them to himself; and is either in this life, when they are brought to him in raiment of needlework, clothed with his righteousness, and washed in his blood, and he beholds them all fair, and without spot; or at the first resurrection, and during the thousand years' reign; as well as in the ultimate glory, when the open marriage of the Lamb will be come, when his bride will be arrayed with line linen, clean and white; and have the glory of God upon her, and appear in glory with Christ, and will be a glorious church indeed: <p>not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; the bodies of the saints will be like to Christ's glorious body, and will shine as the sun in the kingdom of their Father; and in their souls they will be completely conformed to the image of Christ, and enjoy uninterrupted communion with him, and have perfect knowledge of him; they will be always in his presence, and he will take unspeakable delight and complacency in them, which his presentation of them to himself is expressive of; the church will then be free from all spots and blemishes; from all hypocrites and formal professors; and all heresies and heretics; from all declensions and infirmities, and from all sin and iniquity: the allusion seems to be to the customs and practices of the Jews, in their espousals: if a man espoused a woman on condition that she had no spots in her, and afterwards spots were found in her, she was not espoused; for spots or blemishes, as in priests, so in women, render them unfit; as the one for service, so the other for marriage; and they reckon up eight several spots or blemishes, for which they may be rejected (q): but Christ's church has no spots or blemishes, nor anything like them; and will never be rejected by him, but will be always pleasing in his sight: <p>but that it should be holy and without blemish; as it is, being justified by his righteousness, washed in his blood, and sanctified by his Spirit. <p>(q) Misn.

Statement of the remote, ultimate object with which Christ “gave Himself up” to death; as the <span class="ital">immediate</span> object, which has that final purpose in view, is expressed by the <span class="greekheb">ἁγιάσῃ</span>. For <span class="greekheb">αὐτήν</span> of the TR, supported by [648]3[649], most cursives, Syr.-P., etc., the reading <span class="greekheb">αὐτός</span> is to be substituted on the authority of [650] [651] [652] [653]*[654] [655], Syr.-Harc, Vulg., etc. It is Christ <span class="ital">Himself</span> who is to present the Church, and it is to <span class="ital">Himself</span> He is to present it. He is at once the Agent and the End or Object of the presentation. The <span class="greekheb">παραστήσῃ</span> is not to be taken here to mean the presenting of the Church as an <span class="ital">offering</span>. It is true that the verb is so used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-1.htm" title="I beseech you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service.">Romans 12:1</a>; but the case is different here, in respect both of the ruling idea of the paragraph and of the introduction of <span class="greekheb">ἑαυτῷ</span>. It would be incongruous with Paul’s teaching to speak of Christ as presenting an <span class="ital">offering</span> to Himself. The idea, as the context suggests, is that of the bridegroom <span class="ital">presenting</span> or <span class="ital">setting forth</span> the bride; <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-2.htm" title="For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ.">2 Corinthians 11:2</a>. The anarthrous <span class="greekheb">ἔνδοξον</span> is a case of tertiary predicate (<span class="ital">cf.</span> Buttm., <span class="ital">Gram. of N. T. Greek</span>, p. 473). The rendering, therefore, is not “present a glorious Church,” but “present the Church, glorious,” <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, in the aspect, or character of gloriousness. The presentation in view, which is given here as the <span class="ital">final</span> object of Christ’s surrendering of Himself to death, and is exhibited (by use of the aor.) as a single def. act, cannot be anything done in the world that now is (as is supposed by Beng., Harl., Hofm., etc.), but must be referred (with Aug., Jer., Rück., De Wette, Bleek, Mey., Ell., Alf. and most) to the future consummation, the event of the <span class="ital">Parousia</span>.—<span class="greekheb">μὴ ἔχουσαν σπῖλον</span>: <span class="ital">not having spot</span>. Explanation of what is implied on the negative side in the <span class="greekheb">ἔνδοξον</span>. The neg. <span class="greekheb">μή</span> is in place, as the clause refers to the purpose in the mind of Christ. The word <span class="greekheb">σπῖλος</span> = <span class="ital">spot, moral blemish</span>, takes the place of the Attic <span class="greekheb">κηλίς</span> in later Greek writers (Dionys., Harl., Plut., Lucian, Joseph., etc.). It occurs only once again in the NT (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-13.htm" title="And shall receive the reward of unrighteousness, as they that count it pleasure to riot in the day time. Spots they are and blemishes, sporting themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with you;">2 Peter 2:13</a>). The “<span class="greekheb">ι</span>” being short in composition (<span class="greekheb">ἄσπῐλος</span>), WH, Ell., Alf., etc., accentuate it <span class="greekheb">σπίλος</span>; Lach., Tisch., Lipsius, Mey., etc., retain <span class="greekheb">σπῖλος</span>.—<span class="greekheb">ἢ ῥυτίδα</span>: <span class="ital">or wrinkle</span>. The word <span class="greekheb">ῥυτίς</span> occurs only this once in the NT, and is not found in the Apocrypha or in the LXX, but is not infrequent in profane Greek, whether classical (Aristoph., Plato, etc.), or late (Diod., Plut., Lucian, etc.). Attempts have been made (by Aug., Grot., etc.) to establish a distinction between <span class="greekheb">σπίλον</span> and <span class="greekheb">ῥυτίδα</span> here, but without success.—<span class="greekheb">ἤ τι τῶν τοιούτων</span>; <span class="ital">or any such thing</span>. The article gives this the force of anything belonging to the <span class="ital">class</span> of such things as deform and defile.—<span class="greekheb">ἀλλʼ ἵνα ᾖ ἁγία καὶ ἄμωμος</span>: <span class="ital">but that it should be holy and unblamable</span>. The regular construction would have taken some such form as <span class="greekheb">ἀλλʼ οὖσαν</span>, etc. It is changed here, perhaps with a view to variety, as if the paragraph had begun with <span class="greekheb">ἵνα μὴ ἔχῃ</span>.
