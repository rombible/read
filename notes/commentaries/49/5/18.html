How necessary the admonition was we see by the directions as to the choice of clergy in the Pastoral Epistles (1 Tim. 3:28; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-7.htm" title="For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not self-willed, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre;">Titus 1:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-3.htm" title="The aged women likewise, that they be in behavior as becomes holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things;">Titus 2:3</a>); the more necessary, because (as <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-23.htm" title="Drink no longer water, but use a little wine for your stomach's sake and your often infirmities.">1Timothy 5:23</a> shows) the right use of wine was recognised. Hence St. Paul emphatically brands drunkenness as “excess,” a word properly signifying “recklessness”—“incapable of saving,” or denying itself anything, and naturally passing through this want of self-restraint into profligacy—rightly translated “riot” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-6.htm" title="If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly.">Titus 1:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-4.htm" title="Wherein they think it strange that you run not with them to the same excess of riot, speaking evil of you:">1Peter 4:4</a>, as the corresponding adverb is rendered “riotous living” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-13.htm" title="And not many days after the younger son gathered all together, and took his journey into a far country, and there wasted his substance with riotous living.">Luke 15:13</a>. For drunkenness is at once the effect and cause of utter recklessness. It is the effect of a self-abandonment, by which the sensual or passionate elements of the nature are stimulated to frenzy, while the self-controlling judgment is drugged to sleep. It is the cause of yet greater recklessness: for as these passions and appetites become jaded, they need stronger and stronger stimulants, till the whole nature, bodily and mental, is lost in delirium or stupor.<p><span class= "bld">But be filled with the Spirit.</span>—The antithesis is startling, but profoundly instructive. To the artificial and degrading excitement of drunkenness St. Paul boldly opposes the divine enthusiasm of the Spirit, one form of which was scoffingly compared to it on the Day of Pentecost (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-13.htm" title="Others mocking said, These men are full of new wine.">Acts 2:13</a>). He is not content with warning us of its ruinous excess, or urging the strictness of stern self-restraint. Drunkenness comes from an unnatural craving for excitement, stimulated by unwholesome conditions of life, physical and mental. He would satisfy the craving, so far as it is natural, by a divine enthusiasm, brighter and stronger than even duty to God and man, breaking out in thanksgiving, adoration, and love.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/ephesians/5.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/5-18.htm" title="And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit;...">Ephesians 5:18-21</a></span>. <span class="ital">And be not drunk with wine </span>— As the heathen are when they celebrate the feasts of Bacchus, their god of wine; <span class="ital">wherein is excess</span> — Which is the source of all manner of extravagance, and leads to debauchery of every kind. The original word <span class="greekheb">ασωτια</span>, here rendered <span class="ital">excess, </span>signifies entire dissoluteness of mind and manners, and such a course of life as is void of counsel and prudent intention, like the behaviour of persons who are continually drunk. While the above-mentioned Bacchanalia continued, men and women made it a point of religion to intoxicate themselves, and ran about the streets, fields, and vineyards, singing and shouting in a wild and tumultuous manner; in opposition to which extravagant vociferations, singing praises to God is with great propriety recommended.

Time is a talent given us by God, and it is misspent and lost when not employed according to his design. If we have lost our time heretofore, we must double our diligence for the future. Of that time which thousands on a dying bed would gladly redeem at the price of the whole world, how little do men think, and to what trifles they daily sacrifice it! People are very apt to complain of bad times; it were well if that stirred them more to redeem time. Be not unwise. Ignorance of our duty, and neglect of our souls, show the greatest folly. Drunkenness is a sin that never goes alone, but carries men into other evils; it is a sin very provoking to God. The drunkard holds out to his family and to the world the sad spectacle of a sinner hardened beyond what is common, and hastening to perdition. When afflicted or weary, let us not seek to raise our spirits by strong drink, which is hateful and hurtful, and only ends in making sorrows more felt. But by fervent prayer let us seek to be filled with the Spirit, and to avoid whatever may grieve our gracious Comforter. All God's people have reason to sing for joy. Though we are not always singing, we should be always giving thanks; we should never want disposition for this duty, as we never want matter for it, through the whole course of our lives. Always, even in trials and afflictions, and for all things; being satisfied of their loving intent, and good tendency. God keeps believers from sinning against him, and engages them to submit one to another in all he has commanded, to promote his glory, and to fulfil their duties to each other.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ephesians/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And be not drunk with wine - A danger to which they were exposed and a vice to which those around them were much addicted. Compare notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/21-34.htm">Luke 21:34</a>. It is not improbable that in this verse there is an allusion to the orgies of Bacchus, or to the festivals celebrated in honor of that pagan god. He was "the god of wine," and during those festivals, men and women regarded it as an acceptable act of worship to become intoxicated, and with wild songs and cries to run through streets, and fields, and vineyards. To these things the apostle opposes psalms, and hymns, and spiritual songs, as much more appropriate modes of devotion, and would have the Christian worship stand out in strong contrast with the wild and dissolute habits of the pagan. Plato says, that while those abominable ceremonies in the worship of Bacchus continued, it was difficult to find in all Attica a single sober man. Rosenmuller, Alt. u. neu. Morgenland, in loc. On the subject of wine, and the wines used by the ancients, see the notes on <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/2-10.htm">John 2:10-11</a>. We may learn from this verse:<p>(1) that it was not uncommon in those times to become intoxicated on wine; and,<p>(2) that it was positively forbidden. All intoxication is prohibited in the Scriptures - no matter by what means it is produced. There is, in fact, but one thing that produces intoxication. It is "alcohol" - the poisonous substance produced by fermentation. This substance is neither created nor changed, increased nor diminished, by distillation. It exists in the cider, the beer, and the wine, after they are fermented, and the whole process of distillation consists in driving it off by heat, and collecting it in a concentrated form, and so that it may be preserved. But distilling does not "make" it, nor change it. Alcohol is precisely the same thing in the wine that it is in the brandy after it is distilled; in the cider or the beer that it is in the whisky or the rum; and why is it right to become intoxicated on it in one form rather than in another? Since therefore there is danger of intoxication in the use of wine, as well as in the use of ardent spirits, why should we not abstain from one as well as the other? How can a man prove that it is right for him to drink alcohol in the form of wine, and that it is wrong for me to drink it in the form of brandy or rum?<p>Wherein is excess - There has been much difference of opinion about the word rendered here as excess - &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;  aso&#772;tia. It occurs only in two other places in the New Testament, where it is rendered "riot;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-6.htm">Titus 1:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-4.htm">1 Peter 4:4</a>. The "adjective" occurs once <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-13.htm">Luke 15:13</a>, where it is rendered riotous. The word (derived, according to Passow, from &#x3b1;  a, the alpha privative (not), and &#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;  so&#772;zo&#772; - to save, deliver) means that which is unsafe, not to be recovered; lost beyond recovery; then that which is abandoned to sensuality and lust; dissoluteness, debauchery, revelry. The meaning here is, that all this follows the use of wine. Is it proper then for Christians to be in the habit of drinking it? "Wine is so frequently the cause of this, by the ungrateful abuse of the bounty of providence in giving it, that the enormity is represented by a very strong and beautiful "figure" as contained in the very liquor." Doddridge.<p>But be filled with the Spirit - The Holy Spirit. How much more appropriate to Christians than to be filled with the spirit of intoxication and revelry! Let Christians, when about to indulge in a glass of wine, think of this admonition. Let them remember that their bodies should be the temple of the Holy Spirit, rather than a receptacle for intoxicating drinks. Was any man ever made a better Christian by the use of wine? Was any minister ever better suited to counsel an anxious sinner, or to pray, or to preach the gospel, by the use of intoxicating drinks? Let the history of wine-drinking and intemperate clergymen answer. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ephesians/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18. excess&#8212;worthless, ruinous, reckless prodigality.<p>wherein&#8212;not in the wine itself when used aright (1Ti 5:23), but in the "excess" as to it.<p>but be filled with the Spirit&#8212;The effect in inspiration was that the person was "filled" with an ecstatic exhilaration, like that caused by wine; hence the two are here connected (compare Ac 2:13-18). Hence arose the abstinence from wine of many of the prophets, for example, John the Baptist, namely, in order to keep distinct before the world the ecstasy caused by the Spirit, from that caused by wine. So also in ordinary Christians the Spirit dwells not in the mind that seeks the disturbing influences of excitement, but in the well-balanced prayerful mind. Such a one expresses his joy, not in drunken or worldly songs, but in Christian hymns of thankfulness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ephesians/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Wherein, </span> in which drunkenness, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">is excess; </span> profuseness, lasciviousness, and all manner of lewdness, as the effects of drunkenness, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-29.htm" title="Who has woe? who has sorrow? who has contentions? who has babbling? who has wounds without cause? who has redness of eyes?">Proverbs 23:29</a></span>, &c. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">But be filled with the Spirit; </span> the Holy Spirit, often compared to water; or the joy of the Spirit, in opposition to being filled with wine, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-13.htm" title="Others mocking said, These men are full of new wine.">Acts 2:13</a></span>, and that carnal mirth which is caused by it: q.d.

The sin of drunkenness here dehorted from, is a custom, or habit, of voluntary excessive drinking of any strong liquor, whereby the mind is disturbed, and deprived of the use of reason: though wine is only here mentioned, that being the usual liquor drank in the eastern countries, yet the same holds good of any other strong liquor, as of that; nor is drinking wine for necessary use prohibited, nor for honest delight and lawful pleasure; but excessive drinking of it, and this voluntary, and with design, and on purpose; otherwise persons may be overtaken and intoxicated, through ignorance of the strength of the liquor, and their own weakness; and it is a custom, or habit of excessive drinking, for not a single act, but a series of actions, a course of living in this sin, denominates a man a drunkard; and generally speaking, excessive drinking deprives persons of the use of reason, though not always; and such are criminal, who are mighty to drink wine, and strong to mingle strong drink; as are also such, who though not guilty of this sin themselves, are the means of it in others: the sin is very sinful; it is one of the works of the flesh; it is an abuse of the creature; it is opposed to walking honestly; for it persons are to be excluded from the communion of the church; and, without the grace of true repentance, shall not inherit the kingdom of heaven: many things might be said to dissuade from it; it hurts the mind, memory, and judgment; deprives of reason, and sets a man below a beast; it brings diseases on the body, and wastes the estate; it unfits for business and duty; it opens a door for every sin, and exposes to shame and danger; and therefore should be carefully avoided, and especially by professors of religion: <p>but be filled with the Spirit; that is, "with the Holy Spirit", as read the Vulgate Latin and Ethiopic versions; with the gifts and graces of the Spirit: some have been filled with them in an extraordinary way, as the apostles on the day of Pentecost; and others in an ordinary manner, as common believers; and who may be said to be filled with the Spirit, as with wine, or instead of it, or in opposition to it, when the love of God is shed abroad in their hearts by the Spirit, which is compared to wine, for its antiquity, purity, and refreshing nature; and they are filled with it, who have a comfortable sense of it, and a firm persuasion of interest in it, and are delighted with the views of it, and are as it were inebriated with it; and they are filled with the Spirit, in whom his grace is a well of living water, and out of whose belly flow rivers of it; and who have a large measure of spiritual peace and joy, expressed in the following manner. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/ephesians/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{5}</span> And be not drunk with wine, wherein is <span class="cverse3">{k}</span> excess; but be filled with the Spirit;</span><p>(5) He sets the sober and holy assemblies of the faithful against the immoral banquets of the unfaithful, in which the praises of the only Lord must ring, whether it is it in prosperity or diversity.<p>(k) Every type of disorder, together with every manner of filthiness and shamefulness.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/ephesians/5.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-18.htm" title="And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit;">Ephesians 5:18</a>. <span class="greekheb">Καί</span>] <span class="ital">and in particular</span>, to mention a single vice, which would belong to <span class="greekheb">ἀφροσύνη</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">μὴ μεθύσκ</span>. <span class="greekheb">οἴνῳ</span>] <span class="ital">become not drunken through wine</span>, which stands opposed to the <span class="ital">allowable</span> use of wine, without our having on that account to seek here a reference to Montanism (Schwegler).

A vivid description of the grosser and more refined <span class="greekheb">ἀσωτία</span> may be seen in Cicero, <span class="ital">de Fin.</span> ii. 8.

Hence some prefer to understand <span class="greekheb">πνεύματι</span> of man’s spirit, and render it (as RV margin) “be filled in spirit”. The contrast would then be between being filled in one’s physical or carnal nature and filled in one’s spiritual nature (so Braune, and in effect Abb.). In NT Greek, however, verbs that are followed by the simple dat. sometimes vary it by a prepositional form, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, <span class="greekheb">βαπτίζεσθαι ὕδατι</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-16.htm" title="John answered, saying to them all, I indeed baptize you with water; but one mightier than I comes, the lace of whose shoes I am not worthy to unloose: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire:">Luke 3:16</a>) and <span class="greekheb">ἐν ὕδατι</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-11.htm" title="I indeed baptize you with water to repentance. but he that comes after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear. he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire.">Matthew 3:11</a>), <span class="greekheb">παντὶ τρόπῳ</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-18.htm" title="What then? notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretense, or in truth, Christ is preached; and I therein do rejoice, yes, and will rejoice.">Php 1:18</a>) and <span class="greekheb">ἐνπαντὶ τρόπῳ</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-16.htm" title="Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God, even our Father, which has loved us, and has given us everlasting consolation and good hope through grace,">2 Thessalonians 2:16</a>), etc.; and the formula <span class="greekheb">πληροῦν</span> or <span class="greekheb">πληροῦσθαι ἐν</span> is not wholly without analogy; <span class="ital">cf.</span> <span class="greekheb">τοῦ τὰ πάντα ἐν πᾶσιν πληρουμένου</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-23.htm" title="Which is his body, the fullness of him that fills all in all.">Ephesians 1:23</a> above; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-12.htm" title=" Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ, salutes you, always laboring fervently for you in prayers, that you may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God.">Colossians 4:12</a>, <span class="greekheb">πεπληροφορημένοι ἐν παντὶ θελήματι τοῦ Θεοῦ</span>, where indeed the <span class="greekheb">πεπληρωένοι</span> of the TR must give place to another verb, yet one with the same idea, the sense being probably “filled <span class="ital">with</span> everything willed by God” (<span class="ital">cf.</span> Win.-Moult., p. 272; Blass, <span class="ital">Gram. of N. T. Greek</span>, p. 117). The <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span> may be taken, therefore, as the <span class="ital">instrum.</span> <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span>, and the sense will be “filled <span class="ital">with</span> or <span class="ital">by</span> the Spirit”. Some (<span class="ital">e.g.</span>, Ell., Alf.) would combine the ideas of <span class="ital">in</span> and <span class="ital">by</span>, supposing the unusual phrase to be chosen with a view to convey the fact that the Holy Spirit is not only the instrument <span class="ital">by</span> which the Christian man is filled, but that also <span class="ital">in</span> which he is so filled. But this is a needless refinement. The contrast, as most commentators recognise, is not merely between the <span class="greekheb">οἴνῳ</span> and the <span class="greekheb">πνεύματι</span>, but between the <span class="greekheb">μεθύσκεσθε</span> and the <span class="greekheb">πληροῦσθε</span>. Otherwise the order would have been <span class="greekheb">μὴ οἴνῳ μεθύσκεσθε</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀλλʼ ἐν πνεύματι πληροῦσθε</span> (Mey.). The contrast is not between the <span class="ital">instruments</span> but between the <span class="ital">states</span>—between two elevated states, one due to the excitement of wine, the other to the inspiration and enlightenment of the Spirit.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/ephesians/5.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">18</span>. <span class="ital">drunk with wine</span>] Cp. for similar cautions, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-1.htm" title="Wine is a mocker, strong drink is raging: and whoever is deceived thereby is not wise.">Proverbs 20:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/proverbs/23-30.htm" title="They that tarry long at the wine; they that go to seek mixed wine....">Proverbs 23:30-31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/21-34.htm" title="And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that day come on you unawares.">Luke 21:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-13.htm" title="Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying.">Romans 13:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-11.htm" title="But now I have written to you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or an extortionist; with such an one no not to eat.">1 Corinthians 5:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-10.htm" title="Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortionists, shall inherit the kingdom of God.">1 Corinthians 6:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-21.htm" title="Contentions, murders, drunkenness, revelings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.">Galatians 5:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-3.htm" title="Not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre; but patient, not a brawler, not covetous;">1 Timothy 3:3</a>. “He fitly follows up a warning against impurity with a warning against drunkenness” (Bengel).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">wherein</span>] In “being drunken with wine;” in the act and habit of intemperance.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">excess</span>] R.V., <span class="bld">riot</span>.

But the text R.V., and the A.V., are assuredly right. The definite article may well be omitted here (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-17.htm" title="That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him:">Ephesians 1:17</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-22.htm" title="In whom you also are built together for an habitation of God through the Spirit.">Ephesians 2:22</a>), without obscuring the ref. to the Divine Spirit, if context favours it. And surely the context does so, in the words “<span class="ital">in which</span>” just above. The two “<span class="ital">in</span>” (<span class="ital">in</span> which,” “<span class="ital">in</span> Spirit,”) are parallel. And as the first “in” points to an objective cause of “riot,” so surely the second “in” points to the objective cause, not subjective sphere, of joy; to the Spirit, not to our spirit.—On the phrase “in (the) Spirit” cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-43.htm" title="He said to them, How then does David in spirit call him Lord, saying,">Matthew 22:43</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-9.htm" title="But you are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you.

On the whole, the idea conveyed appears to be that the possessing Power, Divine or evil, which from one point of view <span class="ital">inhabits</span> the man, from another <span class="ital">surrounds</span> him, as with an atmosphere.—“If the Spirit be <span class="ital">in you</span>, you are <span class="ital">in It</span>” (Jer.

Let the Divine Spirit, in Whom you, believing, are, pervade your being, as water fills the sponge.” And the context gives the special thought that this “filling” will tend to that sacred exhilaration, “the Spirit’s calm excess[39]”, of which wine-drinking could produce only a horrible parody.
