There is, however, a certain connection of idea with the preceding section also, and especially with the encouragement of a Christian enthusiasm in the last clause. The strong and frequent emphasis laid in the New Testament on subjection, whether (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/13-1.htm" title="Let every soul be subject to the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God.">Romans 13:1-7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_peter/2-13.htm" title="Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme;">1Peter 2:13-17</a>) to the civil powers, or (as here, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-18.htm" title=" Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord.">Colossians 3:18</a> to <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-1.htm" title=" Masters, give to your servants that which is just and equal; knowing that you also have a Master in heaven.">Colossians 4:1</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-18.htm" title="Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the fraudulent.">1Peter 2:18</a> to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-7.htm" title="Likewise, you husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge, giving honor to the wife, as to the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life; that your prayers be not hindered.">1Peter 3:7</a>) to domestic authority, or (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_thessalonians/5-12.htm" title="And we beseech you, brothers, to know them which labor among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you;">1Thessalonians 5:12-13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-6.htm" title="Now we command you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you withdraw yourselves from every brother that walks disorderly, and not after the tradition which he received of us.">2Thessalonians 3:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_thessalonians/3-14.htm" title="And if any man obey not our word by this letter, note that man, and have no company with him, that he may be ashamed.">2Thessalonians 3:14-15</a>) to ecclesiastical authority, probably indicates some tendency, in the first exuberance of Christian liberty and enthusiasm, to disregard the wholesome restraints, laws, and conventions of outward life. Hence St. Paul’s general caution here, prefatory to the more detailed teaching of subjection which follows.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:15-21 Another remedy against sin, is care, or caution, it being impossible else to maintain purity of heart and life. Time is a talent given us by God, and it is misspent and lost when not employed according to his design. If we have lost our time heretofore, we must double our diligence for the future. Of that time which thousands on a dying bed would gladly redeem at the price of the whole world, how little do men think, and to what trifles they daily sacrifice it! People are very apt to complain of bad times; it were well if that stirred them more to redeem time. Be not unwise. Ignorance of our duty, and neglect of our souls, show the greatest folly. Drunkenness is a sin that never goes alone, but carries men into other evils; it is a sin very provoking to God. The drunkard holds out to his family and to the world the sad spectacle of a sinner hardened beyond what is common, and hastening to perdition. When afflicted or weary, let us not seek to raise our spirits by strong drink, which is hateful and hurtful, and only ends in making sorrows more felt. But by fervent prayer let us seek to be filled with the Spirit, and to avoid whatever may grieve our gracious Comforter. All God's people have reason to sing for joy. Though we are not always singing, we should be always giving thanks; we should never want disposition for this duty, as we never want matter for it, through the whole course of our lives. Always, even in trials and afflictions, and for all things; being satisfied of their loving intent, and good tendency. God keeps believers from sinning against him, and engages them to submit one to another in all he has commanded, to promote his glory, and to fulfil their duties to each other.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ephesians/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Submitting yourselves one to another - Maintaining due subordination in the various relations of life. This general principle of religion, the apostle proceeds now to illustrate in reference to wives <a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-22.htm">Ephesians 5:22-24</a>; to children <a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-1.htm">Ephesians 6:1-3</a>; and to servants, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-5.htm">Ephesians 6:5-8</a>. At the same time that he enforces this duty of submission, however, he enjoins on others to use their authority in a proper manner, and gives solemn injunctions that there should be no abuse of power. Particularly he enjoins on husbands the duty of loving their wives with all tenderness <a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25-33</a>; on fathers, the duty of treating their children so that they might easily obey them <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-4.htm">Ephesians 6:4</a>; and on masters, the duly of treating their servants with kindness, remembering that they have a Master also in heaven; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-9.htm">Ephesians 6:9</a>. The general mean ing here is, that Christianity does not break up the relations of life, and produce disorder, lawlessness, and insubordination; but that it will confirm every proper authority, and make every just yoke lighter. Infidelity is always disorganizing; Christianity, never. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ephesians/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21. (Php 2:3; 1Pe 5:5.) Here he passes from our relations to God, to those which concern our fellow men.<p>in the fear of God&#8212;All the oldest manuscripts and authorities read, "in the fear of Christ." The believer passes from under the bondage of the law as a letter, to be "the servant of Christ" (1Co 7:22), which, through the instinct of love to Him, is really to be "the Lord's freeman"; for he is "under the law to Christ" (1Co 9:21; compare Joh 8:36). Christ, not the Father (Joh 5:22), is to be our judge. Thus reverential fear of displeasing Him is the motive for discharging our relative duties as Christians (1Co 10:22; 2Co 5:11; 1Pe 2:13).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ephesians/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Submitting yourselves one to another, </span> viz. to those to whom ye ought to be subject in natural, civil, or church relations. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">In the fear of God; </span> either for fear of offending God, the Author of all power, who commands this subjection; or so far as is consistent with the fear of God, and so in those things which are not forbidden of him. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/ephesians/5.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Submitting yourselves one to another,....

Then begins with <span class="greekheb">αἱ γυναῖκες</span> a new section, into the first precept of which we have to take over the verb from the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὙΠΟΤΑΣΣΌΜΕΝΟΙ</span></span></span> just used, namely, <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὙΠΟΤΆΣΣΕΣΘΕ</span></span></span> (Elzevir) or <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὙΠΟΤΑΣΣΈΣΘΩΣΑΝ</span></span></span> (Lachmann). Calvin, Zanchius, Koppe, Flatt, Meier, Matthies, and others (comp. also Reiche, <span class="ital">Comm. crit.</span> p. 183), incorrectly hold that the participle is to be taken <span class="ital">imperatively</span>; in that case an <span class="greekheb">ἐστέ</span> to be supplied in thought must, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-9.htm" title="Let love be without dissimulation.

It would not militate against this view, that in the sequel only the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὙΠΌΤΑΞΙς</span></span></span> of the <span class="ital">wives</span> follows, while the <span class="greekheb">ὑπακοή</span> of the <span class="ital">children</span> and <span class="ital">servants</span>, in chap. 6, can no longer be brought into connection with our <span class="greekheb">ὑποτασσόμενοι</span>. For often with the classical writers also, after the prefixing of such absolute nominatives, which have reference to the whole collectively, the discourse passes only over to one part (not to several); see particularly Nägelsbach, z. <span class="ital">Ilias</span>, ed. 3, p. 385 f. But against it may be urged the consideration that <span class="greekheb">αἱ γυναῖκες</span> has no special verb; such a verb, and one correlative as to notion with <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὙΠΟΤΑΣΣ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span>, could not but be associated with it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>On the thought <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὙΠΟΤΆΣΣΕΣΘΑΙ ἈΛΛΉΛΟΙς</span></span></span>, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-5.htm" title="Likewise, you younger, submit yourselves to the elder.

From the very context, in itself <span class="greekheb">ὁ ἀνήρ</span> is husband (Hom. <span class="ital">Od.</span> xix. 294; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-16.htm" title="And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.">Matthew 1:16</a>). That which, on the other hand, Bengel finds in <span class="greekheb">ἰδίοις</span>: “etiamsi alibi meliora viderentur habere consilia,” is imported.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Ὡς Τῷ ΚΥΡΊῼ</span></span></span>] By this is not meant the <span class="ital">husbands</span> (Thomas Aquinas, Semler), which must have been <span class="greekheb">τοῖς κυρίοις</span>, but <span class="ital">Christ</span>, and <span class="greekheb">ὡς</span> expresses the mode of view in which the wives are to regard their obedience towards the husbands, namely, as <span class="ital">rendered to the Lord</span>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/6-6.htm" title="Not with eye-service, as men pleasers; but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart;...">Ephesians 6:6-7</a>. For the husband (see what follows) stands in relation to the wife not otherwise than as Christ to the church; in the conjugal relation the husband is the one who represents Christ to the wife, in so far as he is head of the wife, as Christ is the Head of the church. To find in <span class="greekheb">ὡς</span> the mere <span class="ital">relation, of resemblance</span> (“uxoris erga maritum officia <span class="ital">similia quodammodo sunt officiis Christianorum erga Christum</span>,” Koppe) is erroneous on account of what follows; the passage must have run in the form <span class="greekheb">ὡς ἡ ἐκκλησία τῷ κυρίῳ</span>, which Erasmus has imported into his paraphrase: “non aliter, quam <span class="ital">ecclesia</span> subdita est Domino Jesu.” We may add that the view of Michaelis—that here and <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-18.htm" title=" Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord.">Colossians 3:18</a> the teachings as to marriage are directed <span class="ital">against errors of the Essenes</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-3.htm" title="Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God has created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth.">1 Timothy 4:3</a>)—is the more to be regarded as a fiction, inasmuch as Paul is speaking not of the propriety of marriage, but of the duties of the married life.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[270] A more sublime, more ideal regulation of the married state is not conceivable than that which is here set forth by the apostle, vv. 21–33, and yet it is one which has flowed from the living depth of the Christian consciousness, and hence is practically applicable to all concrete relations.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/ephesians/5.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-21.htm" title="Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God.">Ephesians 5:21</a>. <span class="greekheb">ὑποτασσόμενοι ἀλλήλοις</span>: <span class="ital">subjecting yourselves one to another</span>. The connection of this clause is by no means clear. It is taken by not a few (Calv., Matthies, etc.) as an independent clause, the participle being dealt with as an imperative. But there is nothing to suggest the <span class="greekheb">ἐστε</span> which would have to be supplied. To relate the clause to the paragraph which <span class="ital">follows</span> means that it is the introductory, <span class="ital">general</span> statement, of which we have a particular application in what is said of the <span class="greekheb">γυναῖκες</span>. But in that case we should expect the duty of the <span class="greekheb">γυναῖκες</span> to be conveyed by a noun distinct from <span class="greekheb">ὑποτασσόμενοι</span>, but denoting a form of behaviour that would come easily under the comprehensive duty expressed by the participle. It is best to connect the clause, therefore, with what <span class="ital">precedes</span> it, and to take it as a <span class="ital">fourth coordinate</span> clause, giving yet another way in which the condition of being “filled with the Spirit” should express itself. The former three dealt with spiritual converse, praise, and thanksgiving; this one deals with what is due from ourselves to others. It is appended to the other three as a summary statement of duty in our relations one to another, of which particular applications are to be made. Thus it leads easily on to the special obligations which are next enforced. The same comprehensive statement of Christian duty in our earthly relations as summed up in the one idea of mutual <span class="greekheb">ὑπόταξις</span>, in contrast with pagan self-seeking and self-assertion, is given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-5.htm" title="Likewise, you younger, submit yourselves to the elder.

In some sense we are all servants, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> we are bound to serve others; the very father is, in this sense, servant of his child. So in the Christian Church we are all in a sense servants ("By love serve one another," <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-15.htm">Galatians 5:15</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-26.htm">Matthew 20:26-28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-15.htm">John 13:15, 16</a>). This view is in harmony with the <span class="accented">humble</span> spirit of the gospel. Pride leads us to demand rigorously from others what we fancy they owe to us; humility, to give to others what Christ teaches that we owe to them. The one feeling is to be discouraged, the other exercised and strengthened. In the verses following we have this precept split up into its constituent filaments. The reading of R.V., "in the fear of Christ," has more authority than A.V., "in the fear of God." It brings to our mind the wonderful example of Christ in this clement of character (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-51.htm">Luke 2:51</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-8.htm">Hebrews 5:8</a>). Reverential regard for him should inspire us with the same spirit (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-5.htm">Philippians 2:5-8</a>). </body></html>
