So the word is used, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-14.htm" title="Notwithstanding you have well done, that you did communicate with my affliction.">Philippians 4:14</a>, of “communicating with my affliction;” and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/18-4.htm" title="And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that you be not partakers of her sins, and that you receive not of her plagues.">Revelation 18:4</a>, of “being partakers with the sins” of Babylon. It is through such weak or cowardly indulgence, more than the actual love of evil, that sin is suffered to prevail. Hence St. Paul adds, “rather reprove them.” Our Lord Himself has declared in all such cases, “He that is not with Me is against Me.”<p><span class= "bld">The unfruitful works of darkness.</span>—St. Paul has a similar antithesis in the Epistle to the Romans (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/6-19.htm" title="I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as you have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity to iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness to holiness.">Romans 6:19-22</a>). They who are in sin “yield their members servants to iniquity unto iniquity.” Iniquity has no result but iniquity; and hence he goes on to ask, “What fruit had ye then in those things of which ye are now ashamed?” This weary fruitlessness is at once the sign and the penalty of sin, so that men have fancied it to be one chief element of the suffering of the lost. But they who are in Christ “yield their members servants to righteousness unto holiness.” “They have,” he says, “their fruit unto holiness” now, and “in the end the everlasting life,” which is everlasting holiness. Similarly, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/galatians/5-20.htm" title="Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, jealousies, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,">Galatians 5:20-22</a>, we have “the works of the flesh,” but “the fruit of the Spirit.” Rarely, indeed, does Scripture speak of “evil fruit” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-17.htm" title="Even so every good tree brings forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree brings forth evil fruit.">Matthew 7:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-33.htm" title="Either make the tree good, and his fruit good; or else make the tree corrupt, and his fruit corrupt: for the tree is known by his fruit.">Matthew 12:33</a>). Generally, “to be unfruitful” is an all-sufficient condemnation. “Every branch that beareth not fruit he taketh away” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-2.htm" title="Every branch in me that bears not fruit he takes away: and every branch that bears fruit, he purges it, that it may bring forth more fruit.">John 15:2</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Rather reprove them.</span>—In the word “reprove,” whether in its application to the witness of the Holy Ghost (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-8.htm" title="And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:">John 16:8</a>), or to the witness of men (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-24.htm" title="But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believes not, or one unlearned, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all:">1Corinthians 14:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-20.htm" title="Them that sin rebuke before all, that others also may fear.">1Timothy 5:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/titus/1-9.htm" title="Holding fast the faithful word as he has been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the disputers.">Titus 1:9-13</a>, <span class= "ital">et al.</span>), there is described a double function—to “convince,” if it may be, the sinner in himself; to “convict” him, if the other function fails, before men and angels. Both these functions St. Paul urges here. It is not enough to “have no fellowship with them.” To this tacit reproof open reproof in word and deed is to be added; only in such reproof it should be remembered that it would be disgraceful “even to speak” in detail of the actual “things done in secret.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/maclaren/ephesians/5.htm">MacLaren's Expositions</a></div>EPHESIANS<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">UNFRUITFUL WORKS OF DARKNESS</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-11.htm" title="And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them.">Ephesians 5:11</a>We have seen in a former sermon that ‘the fruit,’ or outcome, ‘of the Light’ is a comprehensive perfection, consisting in all sorts and degrees of goodness and righteousness and truth. Therefore, the commandment, ‘Walk as children of the light,’ sums up all Christian morality. Is there need, then, for any additional precept? Yes; for Christian people do not live in an empty world. If there were no evil round them, and no proclivity to evil within them, it would be amply sufficient to say to them, ‘Be true to the light which you behold.’ But since both these things are, the commandment of my text is further necessary. We do not work in vacuo, and therefore friction and atmosphere have to be taken account of; and an essential part of ‘walking as children of the light’ is to know how to behave ourselves when confronted with ‘the works of darkness.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>These Ephesian Christians lived in a state of society honeycombed with hideous immorality, the centre of which was the temple, which was their city’s glory and shame. It was all but impossible for them to have nothing to do with the works of evil, unless, indeed, they went out of the world. But the difficulty of obedience does not affect the duty of obedience, nor slacken in the smallest degree the stringency of a command. This obligation lies upon us as fully as it did upon them, and the discharge of it by professing Christians would bring new life to moribund churches.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. Let me ask you to note with me, first, the fruitlessness inherent in all the works of darkness.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>You may remember that I pointed out, in a former discourse on the context, that the Apostle, here and elsewhere, draws a very significant distinction between ‘works’ and ‘fruit,’ and that distinction is put very strikingly in the words of my text. There are works which are barren. It is a grim thought that there may be abundant activity which, in the eyes of God, comes to just nothing; and that pages and pages of laborious calculations, when all summed up, have for result a great round 0. Men are busy, and hosts of them are doing what the old fairy stories tell us that evil spirits were condemned to do-spinning ropes out of sea-sand; and their life-work is nought when they come to reckon it up.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>I have no time to dwell upon this thought, but I wish, just for a moment or two, to illustrate it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>All godless life is fruitless, inasmuch as it has no permanent results. Permanent results of a sort, indeed, follow everything that men do, for all our actions tend to make character, and they all have a share in fixing that which depends upon character-viz. destiny, both here and yonder. And thus the most fleeting of our deeds, which in one aspect is as transitory as the snow upon the great plains when the sun rises, leaves everlasting traces upon ourselves and upon our condition. But yet acts concerned with transitory things may have permanent fruit, or may be as transient as the things with which they are concerned. And the difference depends on the spirit in which they are done. If the roots are only in the surface-skin of soil, when that is pared off the plant goes. A life that is to be eternal must strike its roots through all the superficial humus down to the very heart of things. When its roots twine themselves round God then the deeds which blossom from them will blossom unfading for ever.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Think of men going empty-handed into another world, and saying, ‘O Lord! I made a big fortune in Manchester when I lived there, and I left it all behind me’; or, ‘I mastered a science, and one gleam of the light of eternity has antiquated it’; or, ‘I gained prizes, won my aims, and they have all dropped from my hands, and here I stand, having to say in the most tragic sense: Nothing in my hands I bring.’ And another man dies in the Lord, and his ‘works do follow’ him. It is not every vintage that bears exportation. Some wines are mellowed by crossing the ocean; some are turned into vinegar. The works of darkness are unfruitful because they are transient.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And they are unfruitful because, whilst they last, they yield no real satisfaction. The Apostle could say to another Church with a certainty as to what the answer would be, ‘What fruit had ye then’-when ye were doing them-’in the things whereof ye are now ashamed?’ And the answer is ‘None!’ Of course, it is true that men do bad things because they like them better than good. Of course, it is true that the misery of mankind is that they have no appetite in the general for the only real satisfaction. But it is also true that no man who feeds his heart and mind on anything short of God is really at rest in anything that he does or possesses. Occasional twinges of conscience, dim perceptions that after all they are walking in a vain show; glimpses of nobler possibilities, a vague unrest, an unwillingness to reflect and look the facts of their condition in the face, like men that will not take stock because they half suspect that they are insolvent-these are the conditions that attach to all godless men’s lives. There is no real fruit for their thirsty lips to feed upon. The smallest man is too large to be satisfied with anything short of Infinity, The human heart is like some narrow opening on a hill-side, so narrow that it looks as if a glassful of water would fill it. But it goes away down, down, down into the depths of the mountain, and you may pour in hogsheads and no effect is visible. God, and God alone, brings to the thirsty heart the fruit that it needs.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Another solemn thought illustrates the unfruitfulness of a godless life. There is no correspondence between what such a man does and what he is intended to do. Think of what the most degraded and sensuous wretch that shambles about the slums of a city, sodden with beer and rotten with profligacy, could be. Think of the raptures of devout contemplation and the energies of holy work which are possible for that soul, and then say-though it is an extreme case, the principle holds in less extreme cases-Are these things that men do apart from God, however shining, noble, illustrious they may be in the eyes of the world, and trumpeted forth by the mouthpieces of popular opinion, are these things worth calling fruits fit to be borne by such a tree? No more than the cankers on a rose-bush or the galls on an oak-tree are worthy of being called fruit are these works that some of you have as the only products of a life’s activity. ‘Wherefore, when I looked that it should bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes?’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. And now, secondly, notice the plain Christian duty of abstinence.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>‘Have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness.’ Now, the text, as it stands in our version, seems to suggest that these dark works are personified as companions whom a good man ought to avoid; and that, therefore, the bearing of the exhortation is, ‘Have nothing to do, in your own individual lives, with evil things that one man can commit.’ But I take it that, important as that injunction and prohibition is, the Apostle’s meaning is somewhat different, and that my text would perhaps be more accurately translated if another word were substituted for ‘have no fellowship with.’ The original expression seems rather to mean, ‘Do not go partners with other people in works of darkness, which it takes more than one to commit.’ Or, to put it into another language, the Apostle is regarding Christian people here as members of society, and exhorting them to a certain course of conduct in reference to plain and palpable existing evils around them. And such an exhortation to the duty of plain abstinence from things that the opinion of the world around us has no objection to, but which are contrary to the light, is addressed to all Christian people.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The need of it I do not require to illustrate at any length. But let me remind you that the devil has no more cunning way of securing a long lease of life for any evil than getting Christian people and Christian Churches to give it their sanction. What was it that kept slavery alive for centuries? Largely, that Christian men solemnly declared that it was a divine institution. What is it that has kept war alive for all these centuries? Largely, that bishops and preachers have always been ready to bless colours, and to read a Christening service over a man-of-war-and, I suppose, to ask God that an eighty-ton gun might be blessed to smash our enemies to pieces, and not to blow our sailors to bits. And what is it that preserves the crying evils of our community, the immoralities, the drunkenness, the trade dishonesty, and all the other things that I do not need to remind you of in the pulpit? Largely this, that professing Christians are mixed up with them. If only the whole body of those who profess and call themselves Christians would shake their hands clear of all complicity with such things, they could not last. Individual responsibility for collective action needs to be far more solemnly laid to heart by professing Christians than ever it has been.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Nor need I remind you, I suppose, with what fatal effects on the Gospel and the Church itself all such complicity is attended. Even the companions of wrongdoers despise, whilst they fraternise with, the professing Christian who has no higher standard than their own. What was it that made the Church victorious over the combined forces of imperial persecution, pagan superstition, and philosophic speculation? I believe that among all the causes that a well-known historian has laid down for the triumph of Christianity, what was as powerful as-I was going to say even more than-the Gospel of peace and love which the Church proclaimed was the standard of austere morality which it held up to a world rotting in its own filth. And sure I am that wherever the Church says, ‘So do not I, because of the fear of the Lord,’ it will gain a power, and will be regarded with a possibly reluctant, but a very real, respect which no easy-going coming down to the level of popular moralities will ever secure for a silver-slippered Christianity. And so, brethren, I would say to you, Do not be afraid of the old name Puritan. Ignorant people use it as a scoff. It should be a crown of glory. ‘Have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But how is this to be done? Well, of course, there is only one way of abstaining, and that is, to abstain. But there are a great many different ways of abstaining. Light is not fire. And the more that Christian people feel themselves bound to stand aloof from common evils, the more are they bound to see that they do it in the spirit of the Master, which is meekness. It is always an invidious position to take up. And if we take it up with any heat and temper, with any lack of moderation, with any look of ostentation of superior righteousness, or with any trace of the Boanerges spirit which says, ‘Let us call down fire from heaven and consume them,’ our testimony will be weakened, and the world will have a right to say to us, ‘Jesus we know, and Paul we know; but who are ye?’ ‘Who made this man a judge and a divider over us?’ ‘In meekness instructing them that oppose themselves.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">III. Lastly, note the still harder Christian duty of vigorous protest.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The further duty beyond abstinence which the text enjoins is inadequately represented by our version, ‘but rather reprove them.’ For the word rendered in our version ‘reprove’ is the same which our Lord employed when He spoke of the mission of the Comforter as being to ‘convince {or convict} the world of sin.’ And it does not merely mean ‘reprove,’ but so to reprove as to produce the conviction which is the object of the reproof.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This task is laid on the shoulders of all professing Christians. A silent abstinence is not enough. No doubt, the best way, in some circumstances, to convict the darkness is to shine. Our holiness will convict sin of its ugliness. Our light will reveal the gloom. The presentation of a Christian life is the Christian man’s mightiest weapon in his conflict with the world’s evil. But that is not all. And if Christian people think that they have done all their duty, in regard to clamant and common iniquities, by simply abstaining from them and presenting a nobler example, they have yet to learn one very important chapter of their duty. A dumb Church is a dying Church, and it ought to be; for Christ has sent us here in order, amongst other things, that we may bring Christian principles to bear upon the actions of the community; and not be afraid to speak when we are called upon by conscience to do so.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Now I am not going to dwell upon this matter, but I want just to point out to you how, in the context here, there are two or three very important principles glanced at which bear upon it. And one of them is this, that one reason for speaking out is the very fact that the evils are so evil that a man is ashamed to speak about them. Did you ever notice this context, in which the Apostle, in the next verse to my text, gives the reason for his commandment to ‘reprove’ thus-’For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret’? Did you ever hear of a fantastic tenderness for morality so very sensitive that it is not at all shocked when the immoral things are done, but glows with virtuous indignation when a Christian man speaks out about them? There are plenty of people nowadays who tell us that it is ‘indelicate’ and ‘indecent’ and ‘improper,’ and I do not know how much else, for a Christian teacher or minister to say a word about certain moral scandals. But they do not say anything about the immorality and the indelicacy and the indecency of doing them. Let us have done with that hypocrisy, brethren. I am arguing for no disregard for proprieties; I want all fitting reticence observed, and I do not wish indiscriminate rebukes to be flung at foul things; but it is too much to require that, by reason of the very inky cloud of filth that they fling up like cuttlefish, they should escape censure. Let us remember Paul’s exhortation, and reprove because the things are too bad to be spoken about.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Further, note in the context the thought that the conviction of the darkness comes from the flashing upon it of the light. ‘All things when they are reproved are made manifest by the light.’ Which, being translated into other words, is this:-Be strong in your brave protest, because it only needs that the thing should be seen as it is, and called by its right name, in order to be condemned.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Assyrians had a belief that if ever, by any chance, a demon saw himself in a mirror, he was frightened at his own ugliness and incontinently fled. And if Christian people would only hold up the mirror of Christian principle to the hosts of evil things that afflict our city and our country, they would vanish like ghosts at sunrise. They cannot stand the light, therefore let us cast the light upon them.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And do not forget the other final principle here, which is imperfectly represented by our translation. We ought to read, ‘Whatever is made manifest is light.’ Yes. In the physical world when light falls upon a thing, you see it because there is on it a surface of light. And in the moral world the intention of all this conviction is that the thing disclosed to be darkness should, in the very disclosure, cease to be dark, should forsake its nature and be transformed into light. Such transformation is not always the case. Alas! There are evil deeds on which the light falls, and it does nothing. But the purpose in all cases should be, and the issue in many will be, that the merciful conviction by the light will be followed by the conversion of darkness into light.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And so, dear brethren, I bring this text to your hearts, and lay it upon your consciences. We may not all be called upon to speak; we are all called upon to be. You can shine, and by shining show how dark the darkness is. The obligation is laid upon us all; the commandment still comes to every Christian which was given to the old prophet, ‘Declare unto My people their transgression, and to the house of Jacob their sin.’ A quaint old writer says that the presence of a saint ‘hinders the devil of elbow room to do his tricks.’ We can all rebuke sin by our righteousness, and by our shining reveal the darkness to itself. We do not walk as children of the light unless we keep ourselves from all connivance with works of darkness, and by all means at our disposal reprove and convict them. ‘Come out from among them, and be ye separate, and touch no unclean thing, saith the Lord.’<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/ephesians/5.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/5-11.htm" title="And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them....">Ephesians 5:11-12</a>. </span><span class="ital">And have no fellowship </span>— No society, no participation <span class="ital">with </span>wicked men in <span class="ital">the unfruitful works of darkness </span>— Works which bring no advantage, but mischief, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-23.htm" title="For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.">Romans 6:23</a>,) and called <span class="ital">works of darkness, </span>because they usually proceed from ignorance, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-17.htm" title="And now, brothers, I know that through ignorance you did it, as did also your rulers.">Acts 3:17</a>; are contrary to the light of the word, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-20.htm" title="For every one that does evil hates the light, neither comes to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.">John 3:20</a>; are usually committed in the dark, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-7.htm" title="For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that be drunken are drunken in the night.">1 Thessalonians 5:7</a>; and bring those who live and die in the commission of them to utter and eternal darkness, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-30.htm" title="And cast you the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.">Matthew 25:30</a>; <span class="ital">but rather reprove them — </span>Show your disapprobation of them by seasonable and suitable reproof, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-17.htm" title="You shall not hate your brother in your heart: you shall in any wise rebuke your neighbor, and not suffer sin on him.">Leviticus 19:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-15.htm" title="Moreover if your brother shall trespass against you, go and tell him his fault between you and him alone: if he shall hear you, you have gained your brother.">Matthew 18:15</a>,) and especially by the holiness of your conversation.

Monsieur Saurin thinks there is a sarcasm in this verse, as if the apostle said, “The heathens call these things <span class="greekheb">απορρητα</span>, <span class="ital">things not to be spoken of; </span>true, they are properly so; things not too sacred, but too infamous to be mentioned.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:3-14 Filthy lusts must be rooted out. These sins must be dreaded and detested. Here are not only cautions against gross acts of sin, but against what some may make light of. But these things are so far from being profitable. that they pollute and poison the hearers. Our cheerfulness should show itself as becomes Christians, in what may tend to God's glory. A covetous man makes a god of his money; places that hope, confidence, and delight, in worldly good, which should be in God only. Those who allow themselves, either in the lusts of the flesh or the love of the world, belong not to the kingdom of grace, nor shall they come to the kingdom of glory. When the vilest transgressors repent and believe the gospel, they become children of obedience, from whom God's wrath is turned away. Dare we make light of that which brings down the wrath of God? Sinners, like men in the dark, are going they know not whither, and doing they know not what. But the grace of God wrought a mighty change in the souls of many. Walk as children of light, as having knowledge and holiness. These works of darkness are unfruitful, whatever profit they may boast; for they end in the destruction of the impenitent sinner. There are many ways of abetting, or taking part in the sins of others; by commendation, counsel, consent, or concealment. And if we share with others in their sins, we must expect to share in their plagues. If we do not reprove the sins of others, we have fellowship with them. A good man will be ashamed to speak of what many wicked men are not ashamed to do. We must have not only a sight and a knowledge that sin is sin, and in some measure shameful, but see it as a breach of God's holy law. After the example of prophets and apostles, we should call on those asleep and dead in sin, to awake and arise, that Christ may give them light.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ephesians/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And have no fellowship - See the sentiment here expressed fully explained in the notes on <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-14.htm">2 Corinthians 6:14-18</a>.<p>The unfruitful works - The deeds of darkness that produce no "benefit" to the body or the soul.

Their only fruit is that which is not in a true sense fruit (De 32:32), namely, "death" (Ro 6:21; Ga 6:8). Plants cannot bear "fruit" in the absence of light. Sin is "darkness," and its parent is the prince of darkness (Eph 6:12). Graces, on the other hand, as flourishing in "the light," are reproductive, and abound in fruits; which, as harmoniously combining in one whole, are termed (in the singular) "the FRUIT of the Spirit" (Eph 5:9).<p>rather, &c.&#8212;Translate as Greek, "rather even reprove them" (compare Mt 5:14-16). Not only "have no fellowship, but even reprove them," namely, in words, and in your deeds, which, shining with "the light," virtually reprove all that is contrary to light (Eph 5:13; Joh 3:19-21). "Have no fellowship," does not imply that we can avoid all intercourse (1Co 5:10), but "avoid such fellowship as will defile yourselves"; just as light, though it touch filth, is not soiled by it; nay, as light detects it, so, "even reprove sin."<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ephesians/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Have no fellowship with; </span> not only do not practise them yourselves, but do not join with others in them, by consent, advice, assistance, or any other way whereby ye may be defiled by them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The unfruitful; </span> by a meiosis, for bringing forth evil fruit, destructive, pernicious, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-21.htm" title="What fruit had you then in those things whereof you are now ashamed? for the end of those things is death.">Romans 6:21</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-8.htm" title="For he that sows to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that sows to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.">Galatians 6:8</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Works of darkness; </span> wicked works, so called because they proceed from darkness in the mind, the ignorance of God, and men are put upon them by the devil, the prince of darkness, and because they are afraid of the light. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">But rather reprove them; </span> or convince them, viz. not only by your words, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-17.htm" title="You shall not hate your brother in your heart: you shall in any wise rebuke your neighbor, and not suffer sin on him.">Leviticus 19:17</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-15.htm" title="Moreover if your brother shall trespass against you, go and tell him his fault between you and him alone: if he shall hear you, you have gained your brother.">Matthew 18:15</a></span>, but especially by your actions, which being contrary to them, will both evidence them to be, and reprove them as being, works of darkness. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/ephesians/5.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness,.... It is not said with the workers of darkness, or with the men of the world, who are in darkness, and are darkness itself; to have fellowship with them in a civil way, or to dwell among them, is not prohibited; it is allowed of, and countenanced by the greatest examples; and especially it is lawful and right, when there is any prospect of doing good to the souls of men; and even when natural right, relation, and necessity require it; and indeed, the contrary is impracticable: conversation with them in things sinful and superstitious should be abstained from; and when it tends to draw off the soul from Christ and his interest, and is infectious; and when weak ones are offended, and sinners are hereby hardened and confirmed in sin; and the name of God is blasphemed, and the Gospel is evil spoken of: but fellowship is not to be maintained "with the works of darkness"; which are sins, so called, because they are opposite to light; to the light of nature, to the light of the divine word, both law and Gospel, to the light of grace, to God the fountain of light, and to Christ the light of the world; and because the source and spring of them are the original darkness of the mind, and Satan the prince of darkness; and because they are generally committed in the dark; and because the effect and consequence of them is utter darkness, and blackness of darkness: and these are "unfruitful"; they are of no profit and advantage, they bring forth no fruit, unless it be guilt, fear, shame, corruption, and death; wherefore no fellowship should be had with them, by committing the same, by assisting in them, by consenting to them, by approving of them, by receiving any worldly advantage from them, and by winking and conniving at them: it is contrary to the character of saints to have fellowship with such, as the apostle says, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-14.htm">2 Corinthians 6:14</a>, where he gives the mystical explanation of the law, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-10.htm">Deuteronomy 22:10</a>; agreeably to which, and to the passage here, is the sense of a Jewish commentators (l) who upon it observes, that that law <p>"intimates that a righteous man, , "should have no fellowship" with a wicked man;'' <p>this is to be unequally yoked, signified by the ox and the ass ploughing together: <p>but rather reprove them; both by words and by deeds, by an agreeable life and conversation, which last seems to be the design of the apostle here; because it is not a brother, but such who are in darkness, and live in works of darkness; yea, not sinners, but sins are to be reproved, which can be done no other way; nor are all saints proper to reprove verbally, nor are they qualified for it; but all should, and may by facts; and the light discovers darkness, by its own splendour; and this appears from the apostle's reasoning in the next words. <p>(l) Baal Hatturira in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22.htm">Deuteronomy 22</a>.10. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/ephesians/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> reprove <i>them</i>.</span><p>(e) Make them open to all the world, by your good life.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/ephesians/5.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-11.htm" title="And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them.">Ephesians 5:11</a>. <span class="greekheb">Συγκοινωνεῖτε</span>] <span class="ital">have not fellowship with</span> (the disobedient) <span class="ital">in the works of darkness</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-7.htm" title="Be not you therefore partakers with them.">Ephesians 5:7</a>; and as regards the dative, see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-14.htm" title="Notwithstanding you have well done, that you did communicate with my affliction.">Php 4:14</a>), <span class="ital">i.e.</span> in those works, which are wrought in consequence of spiritual darkness—of the ethical frame of mind opposed to divine truth.

The only question is whether it governs the <span class="greekheb">ἔργοις</span> itself, or an <span class="greekheb">αὐτοῖς</span> or <span class="greekheb">αὐτῶν</span> understood. Looking to the <span class="greekheb">συμμέτοχοι αὐτῶν</span> above, the <span class="greekheb">συγκοινωνήσαντές μου τῇ θλίψει</span> of <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-14.htm" title="Notwithstanding you have well done, that you did communicate with my affliction.">Php 4:14</a>, etc., some prefer the latter, = “have no fellowship with them in the works”. But the <span class="ital">gen.</span> probably would then be the proper case for the <span class="ital">things</span> in which the participation took place; <span class="ital">cf.</span> the use of <span class="greekheb">συγκοινωνεῖν</span> with <span class="greekheb">τινί τινος</span> (<span class="ital">Dio Cass.</span>, xxxvii., 41, etc.), and <span class="greekheb">συγκοινωνὸς τῆς ῥίζης</span>, etc. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-17.htm" title="And if some of the branches be broken off, and you, being a wild olive tree, were grafted in among them, and with them partake of the root and fatness of the olive tree;">Romans 11:17</a>). Here, therefore, as in the case of the <span class="greekheb">ἁμαρτίαις</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/18-4.htm" title="And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that you be not partakers of her sins, and that you receive not of her plagues.">Revelation 18:4</a> and even the <span class="greekheb">θλίψει</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-14.htm" title="Notwithstanding you have well done, that you did communicate with my affliction.">Php 4:14</a>, the verb is best understood as governing the <span class="greekheb">ἔργοις</span> directly. Elsewhere we read of <span class="greekheb">ἔργα πονηρά</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-21.htm" title=" And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now has he reconciled">Colossians 1:21</a>), and <span class="greekheb">νεκρὰ ἔργα</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-1.htm" title="Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on to perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,">Hebrews 6:1</a>); here of <span class="greekheb">ἔργα ἄκαρπα</span>, works which result in no gain, yield nothing pleasant or profitable, bring no blessing or reward with them; <span class="ital">cf.</span> the contrast between the <span class="ital">works</span> of the flesh and the <span class="ital">fruit</span> of the Spirit in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-19.htm" title="Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,">Galatians 5:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-22.htm" title="But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,">Galatians 5:22</a>.—<span class="greekheb">μᾶλλον δὲ καὶ ἐλέγχετε</span>: <span class="ital">but rather even reprove them</span>. This rendering of the RV is on the whole the best. AV omits the <span class="ital">even</span>. The other old English Versions render similarly, except Wicl., who has “but more”; Genesis , 2, which gives “but even reprove them rather”; and Bish., “but even rebuke”. The formula <span class="greekheb">μᾶλλον δὲ καί</span>, combines the ideas of the corrective (<span class="greekheb">μᾶλλον</span>), the adversative (<span class="greekheb">δέ</span>) and the ascensive (<span class="greekheb">καί</span>), and means, therefore, “but rather even,” not merely “yea, much more”. Without the <span class="greekheb">καί</span> the phrase <span class="greekheb">μᾶλλον δέ</span> has the force of a corrective climax; <span class="ital">cf.</span> Mey. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-34.htm" title="Who is he that comdemns?

It is Christ that died, yes rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also makes intercession for us.">Romans 8:34</a>. It was not enough, therefore, for them simply to <span class="ital">abstain</span> from such works; they must even <span class="ital">reprove</span> them. The question, however, is what is the proper sense of <span class="greekheb">ἐλέγχετε</span> here, and what is the force of the whole sentence? Some give the verb the sense of <span class="ital">reproving</span>, but understand the <span class="ital">reproof</span> in view to be both in <span class="ital">word</span> and in <span class="ital">deed</span> (Olsh.), or only in <span class="ital">deed, i.e.</span>, the reproof conveyed by the spectacle of a pure life and consistently moral walk. Others, looking to the following <span class="greekheb">τὰ γὰρ κρυφῆ γινόμενα</span>, etc., and thinking it incongruous to speak of an <span class="ital">oral</span> rebuke in connection with a statement of the shame it is even to <span class="ital">speak</span> of the sins in question, would give the verb the sense of <span class="ital">exposing</span> (Abb.). But both the context and the general idea connected with <span class="greekheb">ἐλέγχειν</span> in the Pauline writings (<span class="ital">cf., e.g.</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-24.htm" title="But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believes not, or one unlearned, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all:">1 Corinthians 14:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-2.htm" title="Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long-suffering and doctrine.">2 Timothy 4:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-9.htm" title="Holding fast the faithful word as he has been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the disputers.">Titus 1:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-13.htm" title="This witness is true.

Let no man despise you.">Titus 2:15</a>) point to the notion of <span class="ital">oral</span> reproof. The idea, therefore, is that these Christians were not at liberty to deal lightly with such sins, or connive at them, or be silent about them, but had to speak out against them and hold them up to rebuke, with the view of bringing their heathen neighbours to apprehend their turpitude and forsake them.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/ephesians/5.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">11</span>. <span class="ital">unfruitful</span>] “For the end of these things is death” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-21.htm" title="What fruit had you then in those things whereof you are now ashamed? for the end of those things is death.">Romans 6:21</a>).
