Hence we must conclude that the phrase “in the Word” is in some way connected with that sacrament. Of the two Greek words translated “word,” the one here used is that which signifies not “the word” existing as a definite thought in the mind, but “the word” as audibly spoken. It has, indeed, in the original no article, but this is probably because it had assumed so technical a sense as to resemble a proper name; and it is best connected with the phrase “having cleansed it,” thus being coordinated, not subordinated, to the “laver of the water.” Accordingly it would seem to signify all that element of baptism which is “in word”—that is, the question of faith, “the answer of a good conscience” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-21.htm" title="The like figure whereunto even baptism does also now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ:">1Peter 3:21</a>), and, lastly, the solemn formula of baptism “in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.” If we are to single out any of these, we must surely (with Chrysostom) take the last. But it is better to embrace the whole, and so include the whole spiritual element of baptism, both the acceptance of faith on the part of man, and the grace-giving blessing of God.<p>To “sanctify” is here to consecrate to Himself (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-17.htm" title="Sanctify them through your truth: your word is truth.">John 17:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-19.htm" title="And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth.">John 17:19</a>) after purification. In the same connection we have in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-11.htm" title="And such were some of you: but you are washed, but you are sanctified, but you are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.">1Corinthians 6:11</a>, “Ye were washed, ye were sanctified, ye were justified.” In virtue of such consecration the Church visible is “holy” in idea and in capacity—the Church invisible here (which will be the Church triumphant hereafter), holy in the actual purity which becomes a consecrated nature. Of such consecration baptism is unquestionably the means; as we see in command in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-19.htm" title="Go you therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:">Matthew 28:19</a>, and in fact in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-38.htm" title="Then Peter said to them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.">Acts 2:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-41.htm" title="Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added to them about three thousand souls.">Acts 2:41</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/ephesians/5.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/5-26.htm" title="That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word,...">Ephesians 5:26-27</a></span>. <span class="ital">That he might sanctify and cleanse it </span>— Might remove the guilt, power, and pollution of sin; <span class="ital">with the washing of water </span>— In baptism, as the sign of regeneration by the Holy Spirit, which can only renew, sanctify, and cleanse the soul.

Where is such a scheme of thought to be found in the world, but in the New Testament, and those who have been taught by it?”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ephesians/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:22-33 The duty of wives is, submission to their husbands in the Lord, which includes honouring and obeying them, from a principle of love to them. The duty of husbands is to love their wives. The love of Christ to the church is an example, which is sincere, pure, and constant, notwithstanding her failures. Christ gave himself for the church, that he might sanctify it in this world, and glorify it in the next, that he might bestow on all his members a principle of holiness, and deliver them from the guilt, the pollution, and the dominion of sin, by those influences of the Holy Spirit, of which baptismal water was the outward sign. The church and believers will not be without spot or wrinkle till they come to glory. But those only who are sanctified now, shall be glorified hereafter. The words of Adam, mentioned by the apostle, are spoken literally of marriage; but they have also a hidden sense in them, relating to the union between Christ and his church. It was a kind of type, as having resemblance. There will be failures and defects on both sides, in the present state of human nature, yet this does not alter the relation. All the duties of marriage are included in unity and love. And while we adore and rejoice in the condescending love of Christ, let husbands and wives learn hence their duties to each other. Thus the worst evils would be prevented, and many painful effects would be avoided.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ephesians/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>That he might sanctify - The great object of the Redeemer was to purify and save the church. The meaning here is, that a husband is to manifest similar love toward his wife, and a similar desire that she should be prepared to "walk before him in white".<p>And cleanse it with the washing of water - In all this there is an allusion doubtless to the various methods of purifying and cleansing those who were about to be married, and who were to be united to monarchs as their brides. In some instances this previous preparation continued for twelve months. The means of purification were various, but consisted usually in the use of costly unguents; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/2-12.htm">Esther 2:12</a>. "Six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with sweet odors, and with other things for the purifying of women;" compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/45-13.htm">Psalm 45:13-14</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-7.htm">Ezekiel 16:7-14</a>. As such a virgin was purified and prepared for her husband by washing and by anointing, so the church is to be prepared for Christ. It is to be made pure and holy. Outwardly there is to be the application of water - the symbol of purity; and within there is to be holiness of heart; see the notes on <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-2.htm">2 Corinthians 11:2</a>, where Paul says of the Corinthians, "I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ."<p>By the word - There has been much diversity of opinion respecting the meaning of this. Probably the sense of the expression is, that all this was to be accomplished by the instrumentality of the truth - the Word of God. By that truth they were to be sanctified <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-17.htm">John 17:17</a>; and in accordance with that the whole work from the commencement to the close was to be accomplished. It was not by external ceremonies, and not by any miraculous power on the heart, but by the faithful application of truth to the heart. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ephesians/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>26. sanctify&#8212;that is, consecrate her to God. Compare Joh 17:19, meaning, "I devote Myself as a holy sacrifice, that My disciples also may be devoted or consecrated as holy in (through) the truth" [Neander] (Heb 2:11; 10:10; 13:12 see on [2371]Heb 10:10).<p>and cleanse&#8212;rather, as Greek, "cleansing," without the "and."<p>with the washing of water&#8212;rather as Greek, "with," or "by the laver of the water," namely, the baptismal water. So it ought to be translated in Tit 3:5, the only other passage in the New Testament where it occurs. As the bride passed through a purifying bath before marriage, so the Church (compare Re 21:2). He speaks of baptism according to its high ideal and design, as if the inward grace accompanied the outward rite; hence he asserts of outward baptism whatever is involved in a believing appropriation of the divine truths it symbolizes, and says that Christ, by baptism, has purified the Church [Neander] (1Pe 3:21).<p>by the word&#8212;Greek, "IN the word." To be joined with "cleansing it," or "her." The "word of faith" (Ro 10:8, 9, 17), of which confession is made in baptism, and which carries the real cleansing (Joh 15:3; 17:17) and regenerating power (1Pe 1:23; 3:21) [Alford]. So Augustine [Tract 80, in John], "Take away the word, and what is the water save water? Add the word to the element, and it becomes a sacrament, being itself as it were the visible word." The regenerating efficacy of baptism is conveyed in, and by, the divine word alone.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ephesians/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">That he might sanctify; </span> purify from its filth, and consecrate unto God: implying the whole translation of it out of a state of sin and misery into a state of grace and life, consisting in the remission of sin, and renovation of nature. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And cleanse it; </span> or, cleansing it, importing the means whereby he works the former effect. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">With the washing of water, </span> viz. in baptism, in which the external washing represents seals, and exhibits the internal cleansing from both the guilt and defilement of sin by the blood of Christ, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-14.htm" title="How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?">Hebrews 9:14</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-5.htm" title="And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth.

But all these explanations break down in presence of the fact, that we should need to read <span class="greekheb">τῷ λουτρῷ τοῦ ὕδατος τῷ</span>, or <span class="greekheb">τοῦ ἐν ῥήμ</span>., since neither <span class="greekheb">τὸ λουτρόν</span> nor <span class="greekheb">τὸ ὕδωρ</span> admits of being joined into unity of idea with <span class="greekheb">ἐν ῥήματι</span> (such as <span class="greekheb">αἱ ἐντολαὶ ἐν δόγμασι</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-15.htm" title="Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself of two one new man, so making peace;">Ephesians 2:15</a>, or <span class="greekheb">ἡ πίστις ἐν Χρ</span>., or the like); as well as of the fact, that the special interpretations of <span class="greekheb">ῥῆμα</span>, except that of <span class="ital">gospel</span>, are purely invented. Others have combined <span class="greekheb">ἐν ῥήμ</span>. with <span class="greekheb">καθαρίσας</span> (Syriac, which inserts <span class="greekheb">καί</span> before <span class="greekheb">ἐν ῥήμ</span>.; Bengel, Baumgarten, Matthies, Harless, Baumgarten-Crusius, Hofmann; perhaps also Beza and Calvin; Meier is quite indistinct), in which case likewise <span class="greekheb">ἐν ῥήμ</span>. has been explained by some of the words of the institution and their promise (Baumgarten), by others of the gospel (Syriac, Bengel: “in verbo est vis mundifica, et haec exseritur per lavacrum,” comp. Matthies and Baumgarten-Crusius, as also Schenkel), while Harless translates: “<span class="ital">by way of utterance, by way of promise</span>,” which can refer only to the promise given with the <span class="ital">institution</span>; and Hofmann: <span class="ital">with a word</span>, which is alleged to mean: <span class="ital">so that Me uttered His effective will, that it should become clean</span>. But it is altogether arbitrary, since <span class="greekheb">καθαρίσας</span> already has a modal definition, to attach <span class="greekheb">ἐν ῥήματι</span> thereto in addition, and on the other hand to leave <span class="greekheb">ἁγιάσῃ</span> isolated, although <span class="greekheb">ἐν ῥήμ</span>. <span class="ital">can</span> very suitably as regards sense be attached to <span class="greekheb">ἁγιάσῃ</span>; further, that which cleanses, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> that which not merely symbolically represents the cleansing (Schenkel), but does away with the pre-Christian guilt of sin, is <span class="ital">baptism</span>,[277] comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-21.htm" title="The like figure whereunto even baptism does also now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ:">1 Peter 3:21</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-38.htm" title="Then Peter said to them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.">Acts 2:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-16.htm" title="And now why tarry you? arise, and be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling on the name of the Lord.">Acts 22:16</a>, and not the <span class="greekheb">ῥῆμα</span>, whether we understand thereby the gospel or the words of the institution; lastly, the sense by “way of promise” Paul would have known how to express otherwise than in so indefinite and enigmatic a manner, such as, possibly, by <span class="greekheb">κατʼ ἐπαγγελίαν</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-29.htm" title="And if you be Christ's, then are you Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.">Galatians 3:29</a>; as, indeed, also the sense understood by Hofmann could not have been more indistinctly conveyed than by the bare <span class="greekheb">ἐν ῥήματι</span>.[278] Grotius combines <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝ ῬΉΜΑΤΙ</span></span></span> with <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑΘΑΡ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span>, but supplies <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Ὡς</span></span></span> before <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝ Τῷ ΛΟΥΤΡῷ</span></span></span>: “<span class="ital">verbo suo quasi balneo</span>.” As if one could simply thus <span class="ital">supply</span> <span class="greekheb">ὡς</span>! Lastly, Koppe is quite wrong in holding that <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝ ῬΉΜΑΤΙ ἽΝΑ</span></span></span> is in accordance with the Hebrew <span class="greekheb">על דבר אשר</span> nothing more than the bare <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἽΝΑ</span></span></span>.

Statement of the great object with which Christ in His love for the Church gave Himself up to death for it. An object worthy of the self-sacrifice, described in definite terms and with a solemn significance—the sanctification and cleansing of the Church with a view to its final presentation in perfect holiness at the great day. The verb <span class="greekheb">ἁγιάζειν</span>, a later form of <span class="greekheb">ἁγίζειν</span> (used, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, by Soph., <span class="ital">Oed. Col.</span>, 1495; Pindar, <span class="ital">O.</span>, iii., 34, etc.), frequent in biblical and patristic Greek, means to <span class="ital">set apart</span> to a sacred use, to <span class="ital">consecrate</span>, by external or ceremonial cleansing (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-13.htm" title="For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifies to the purifying of the flesh:">Hebrews 9:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-5.htm" title="For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.">1 Timothy 4:5</a>); by an <span class="ital">expiation</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-11.htm" title="And such were some of you: but you are washed, but you are sanctified, but you are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.">1 Corinthians 6:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-10.htm" title="By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.">Hebrews 10:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-14.htm" title="For by one offering he has perfected for ever them that are sanctified.">Hebrews 10:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-29.htm" title="Of how much sorer punishment, suppose you, shall he be thought worthy, who has trodden under foot the Son of God, and has counted the blood of the covenant, with which he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and has done despite to the Spirit of grace?">Hebrews 10:29</a>); or by inward, <span class="ital">ethical</span> purification (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-23.htm" title="And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.">1 Thessalonians 5:23</a>). Most exegetes take <span class="greekheb">ἁγιάσῃ</span> in the third sense here, and this is favoured by the terms which follow in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-27.htm" title="That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.">Ephesians 5:27</a>. On the other hand, both in the Pauline writings and in the Epistle to the Hebrews (<span class="ital">cf.</span> Pfleiderer, <span class="ital">Paulinism</span>, Engl. transl., vol. ii., 68, etc.) the dominant application of the verb is deliverance from the <span class="ital">guilt</span> of sin by means of an expiation.—<span class="greekheb">καθαρίσας</span>: <span class="ital">cleansing it</span>. The verb <span class="greekheb">καθαρίζειν</span>, Hellenistic for <span class="greekheb">καθαίρειν</span>, has certain occasional applications in the NT (<span class="ital">e.g., literal</span> cleansing. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-26.htm" title="You blind Pharisee, cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter, that the outside of them may be clean also.">Matthew 23:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-39.htm" title="And the Lord said to him, Now do you Pharisees make clean the outside of the cup and the platter; but your inward part is full of ravening and wickedness.">Luke 11:39</a>; pronouncing <span class="ital">ceremonially</span> clean, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-15.htm" title="And the voice spoke to him again the second time, What God has cleansed, that call not you common.">Acts 10:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-9.htm" title="But the voice answered me again from heaven, What God has cleansed, that call not you common.">Acts 11:9</a>; <span class="ital">consecrating</span> by cleansing, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/9-22.htm" title="And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission....">Hebrews 9:22-23</a>); but apart from these it has two main senses—that of <span class="ital">ethical</span> purification (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-1.htm" title="Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.">2 Corinthians 7:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/4-8.htm" title="Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners; and purify your hearts, you double minded.">Jam 4:8</a>), and that of <span class="ital">forgiveness</span>, freeing from the <span class="ital">guilt</span> of sin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-14.htm" title="Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify to himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.">Titus 2:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-14.htm" title="How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?">Hebrews 9:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-7.htm" title="But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleans us from all sin.">1 John 1:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-9.htm" title="If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.">1 John 1:9</a>). In the case of this verb, again, the prevailing idea is that of the changed, rectified <span class="ital">relation</span> to God. The two ideas probably are not sharply divided in the writer’s mind. They are brought together again, both as definite acts of the past, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-11.htm" title="And such were some of you: but you are washed, but you are sanctified, but you are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.">1 Corinthians 6:11</a>, <span class="greekheb">ἀλλὰ ἀπελούσασθε</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀλλὰ ἡγιάσθητε</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀλλὰ ἐδικαιώθητε</span>. But the effect on <span class="ital">standing</span> appears to be the thing immediately in view here. In classical Greek, too, the term <span class="greekheb">καθαρμός</span> is used in the sense of a purification from <span class="ital">guilt</span> (<span class="ital">e.g.</span>, Soph., <span class="ital">O. T.</span>, 1228). The participle is taken by many as, in relation to <span class="greekheb">ἁγιάσῃ</span>, a proper past = “that he might sanctify it <span class="ital">after</span> cleansing it” (Mey., Alf., Ell.; RV “having cleansed it,” etc.). The purification in view is thus made something <span class="ital">prior</span> to the sanctifying. But <span class="greekheb">καθαρίσας</span>, as is often the case with aor. participles connected with a fin. aorist (Bernh., <span class="ital">Synt.</span>, x. 9, p. 383), may also be of the <span class="ital">same</span> time as <span class="greekheb">ἁγιάσῃ</span> and express the <span class="ital">way</span> in which the sanctifying takes effect. The latter is the more probable view here (Syr., Vulg., Harl., Abb., etc.), especially as the aor. <span class="greekheb">ἁγιάσῃ</span> points to a single, definite act, and one predicated of the <span class="ital">Church</span> as a whole.—<span class="greekheb">τῷ λουτρῷ τοῦ ὕδατος</span>: <span class="ital">by the bath of the water</span>. Designation of the <span class="ital">means</span> by which the purification takes place. The phrase is a difficult one. The word <span class="greekheb">λουτρόν</span> occurs only once again in the NT (<a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-5.htm" title="Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;">Titus 3:5</a>). It is used in both cases with reference to <span class="ital">baptism</span> (although some do not admit this), and it is so used in eccles. Greek. In classical Greek it has the occasional, secondary sense of a <span class="ital">libation</span> for the dead (Soph., <span class="ital">El.</span>, 84, 434; Eurip., <span class="ital">Phoen.</span>, 1667), but is used properly as = “<span class="ital">bath, bathing-place</span> (<span class="ital">e.g.</span>, Homer’s <span class="greekheb">θερμὰ λοετρά</span>, <span class="ital">Il.</span>, xiv., 6; <span class="greekheb">λοετρὰ Ὠκεανοῖο</span>, <span class="ital">Il.</span>, xviii., 489, etc.); <span class="ital">bathing</span> (Herod., vi., 52; Xen., <span class="ital">Cyr.</span>, vii., 5, 20); or the <span class="ital">water for bathing</span> or <span class="ital">washing</span> (Soph., <span class="ital">Oed. Col.</span>, 1599)”. It is doubtful whether any clear instance can be found of its use as = <span class="ital">washing</span>. The <span class="greekheb">ὕδατος</span> is prob. the <span class="ital">gen. materiæ</span>, and the articles mark the <span class="greekheb">λουτρόν</span> as the well-known bath of the (baptismal) water. The Versions vary in their renderings. The Vulg. gives <span class="ital">lavacrum</span>, and similarly the Syr. and the Goth. The Rhem. follows the Vulg. and renders <span class="ital">laver</span>. But the other old English Versions have either “the <span class="ital">washing</span>” or “the <span class="ital">fountain</span>” of water. The RV gives “the washing of water” in the text, but “the laver” in the margin. But “laver,” in the sense of the <span class="ital">vessel</span>, does not appear to be a legitimate translation. The only legitimate rendering is “the <span class="ital">bath</span> of water,” <span class="ital">i.e., the bath of the baptismal water</span>. Many interpreters find in the phrase an allusion to the bath taken by a bride before her wedding. The subsequent imagery, and especially the <span class="greekheb">παραστῆσαι</span>, may favour that; but the fact that the Subject here who cleanses by the bath of the water is Christ, while it was not the <span class="ital">bridegroom</span> who administered the pre-nuptial bath to the bride, makes that doubtful.—<span class="greekheb">ἐν ῥήματι</span>: <span class="ital">with</span> (or <span class="ital">through</span>) <span class="ital">the word</span>. In respect both of <span class="ital">sense</span> and of <span class="ital">connection</span> this is a peculiarly difficult phrase. With respect to the latter the <span class="greekheb">ἐν ῥήματι</span> is connected by some with the <span class="greekheb">ἁγιάσῃ</span> = “sanctify it by the word,” <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span> being taken as the <span class="ital">instrum. dat.</span> (Winer, Rück., Bisp., Bleek, Mey., etc.; <span class="ital">cf.</span> Win.-Moult., p. 172). The objection to this is the remoteness of the defining phrase from the verb. On the other hand it may be the case that the order is selected with a view to bringing things together, first the two verbs and then the two defining terms (so Meyer). The analogy of <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-17.htm" title="Sanctify them through your truth: your word is truth.">John 17:17</a>, <span class="greekheb">ἁγίασον αὐτοὺς ἐν τῇ ἀληθείᾳ</span>, is also urged. Others connect it with the <span class="greekheb">λουτρῷ τοῦ ὕδατος</span>, = “the bath of water <span class="ital">in</span> or <span class="ital">by</span> the word”. But to this there is the serious objection that the <span class="greekheb">ἐν ῥήματι</span> is anarthrous. The Greek would require either <span class="greekheb">τῷ</span> or <span class="greekheb">τοῦ ἐν ῥήματι</span>, the phrase not being one of the kind (like <span class="greekheb">τῶν ἐντολῶν ἐν δόγμασι</span>, chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-15.htm" title="Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself of two one new man, so making peace;">Ephesians 2:15</a> above) to make a single idea with the <span class="greekheb">λουτρῷ τοῦ ὕδατος</span> and so dispense with the article; <span class="ital">cf.</span> on chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-17.htm" title="That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him:">Ephesians 1:17</a> above. There remains the third course—to connect it with <span class="greekheb">καθαρίσας</span>, or with the idea expressed by the clause <span class="greekheb">καθαρίσας τῷ λουτρῷ τοῦ ὕδατος</span> as a whole. This on the whole is the connection freest from difficulty, and it gives a congruous idea, which may take more than one form, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, that the purification is <span class="ital">effected by</span> the <span class="greekheb">ῥῆμα</span>; that it is <span class="ital">accompanied</span> by it; or that it takes place <span class="ital">in</span> it as its <span class="ital">element</span> or <span class="ital">condition</span>. But what of the <span class="ital">sense</span> of the <span class="greekheb">ῥήματι</span>? How difficult it is to obtain a satisfactory meaning appears at once from the variety and the peculiarity of the interpretations proposed. Some, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, take it to refer to the baptismal <span class="ital">formula</span>, “in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost,” or “in the name of Jesus” (Chrys.); in which case, however, we should expect either <span class="greekheb">καὶ ῥήματος</span> or <span class="greekheb">ἐν τῷ ῥήματι</span>. Others give the noun the simple sense of “an <span class="ital">utterance</span>” and take the phrase to mean “<span class="ital">attended</span> or <span class="ital">conditioned</span> by an utterance”; with the explanation that the particular <span class="ital">utterance</span> in view is “the revelation of salvation embodied in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost” (Moule). Haupt, again, makes it = “by means of a word,” supposing the term to be added in order to bring out the wonderfulness of the purification as seen in the fact that it is effected simply by a <span class="ital">word</span>, that is to say the word spoken by the person who baptises. Hofmann also gives it the sense of “with a word,” <span class="ital">i.e.</span> = cleansing it <span class="ital">by the utterance of His effective will</span>. Others make it = “by the bath resting on a word,” <span class="ital">viz.</span>, the Divine <span class="ital">command</span> (Storr, Kl., etc.). If we look, however, at the use of the word <span class="greekheb">ῥῆμα</span> in the NT we find that it is applied to anything spoken—a <span class="ital">sound</span> produced by the voice (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-4.htm" title="How that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.">2 Corinthians 12:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-19.htm" title="And the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which voice they that heard entreated that the word should not be spoken to them any more:">Hebrews 12:19</a>); a <span class="ital">declaration</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-75.htm" title="And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said to him, Before the cock crow, you shall deny me thrice.

The word is near you, even in your mouth, and in your heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach;">Romans 10:8</a>), a <span class="ital">command</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/5-5.htm" title="And Simon answering said to him, Master, we have toiled all the night, and have taken nothing: nevertheless at your word I will let down the net.">Luke 5:5</a>), or a <span class="ital">promise</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-38.htm" title="And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it to me according to your word.

In Paul’s Epistles and in Hebrews, it appears to be used mostly, if not exclusively, of a word proceeding directly or indirectly from <span class="ital">God</span> (<span class="ital">cf.</span> Ell. <span class="ital">in loc</span>). It has indeed another sense, that of “thing,” corresponding to the Hebr. <span class="greekheb">דָּבָר</span>, “the thing spoken of,” “the thing enjoined,” etc. (<span class="ital">e.g.</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-16.htm" title="But if he will not hear you, then take with you one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.">Matthew 18:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-37.htm" title="For with God nothing shall be impossible.">Luke 1:37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-15.htm" title="And it came to pass, as the angels were gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even to Bethlehem, and see this thing which is come to pass, which the Lord has made known to us.">Luke 2:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-37.htm" title="That word, I say, you know, which was published throughout all Judaea, and began from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached;">Acts 10:37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-1.htm" title="This is the third time I am coming to you. In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established.">2 Corinthians 13:1</a>). This sense is claimed for it by some in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-8.htm" title="First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world.">Romans 1:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/1-13.htm" title="Now I would not have you ignorant, brothers, that oftentimes I purposed to come to you, (but was let till now,) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles....">Romans 1:13-21</a>. But it is scarcely applicable here. Hence here it may best be taken to refer either to the <span class="ital">word of promise</span>, that is the Divine promise of forgiveness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/16-16.htm" title="He that believes and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believes not shall be damned.">Mark 16:16</a>), or to the <span class="ital">preached Gospel</span>. It has also the great advantage of being in harmony with the <span class="greekheb">ῥῆμα Θεοῦ</span> in chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-17.htm" title="And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:">Ephesians 6:17</a>. It is true that <span class="greekheb">ῥῆμα</span> is not quite the same as <span class="greekheb">λόγος</span>, but carries with it the definite sense of the <span class="ital">spoken</span> word; and that, consequently, it may not be taken to designate the <span class="ital">Gospel</span> here in the subjective sense of <span class="ital">divine truth</span>, the Word of God in respect of its spiritual contents, or as a revelation of grace. But it may have the sense of that truth as <span class="ital">proclaimed</span>, the <span class="ital">preached</span> Word or Gospel. With the former sense the clause will define the purification as being <span class="ital">in accordance with</span> or <span class="ital">dependent on</span> the Divine promise, or having that promise as its <span class="ital">ground</span>. The latter interpretation (which is preferred by Meyer, etc.) is thought to be most in harmony with <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-8.htm" title="But what said it? The word is near you, even in your mouth, and in your heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach;">Romans 10:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-17.htm" title="So then faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.">Romans 10:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-17.htm" title="And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:">Ephesians 6:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-5.htm" title="And have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come,">Hebrews 6:5</a>, and it gives a good sense however the <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span> is construed. The main objection urged against these two interpretations is the absence of the article, and the fact that where <span class="greekheb">ῥῆμα</span> has such a sense it is accompanied by some defining term, <span class="greekheb">Θεοῦ</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-17.htm" title="And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:">Ephesians 6:17</a>), <span class="greekheb">Χριστοῦ</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-17.htm" title="So then faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.">Romans 10:17</a>) or the like. To this the only reply is that the omission of the article is due to the presence of the preposition (Middleton, <span class="ital">Gr. Artic.</span>, vi. 1; <span class="ital">cf.</span> Ell. <span class="ital">in loc.</span>), or that <span class="greekheb">ῥῆμα</span> may have become, like <span class="greekheb">νόμος</span>, <span class="greekheb">χάρις</span>, etc., so well-understood and constant a term in the sense of “the spoken word” <span class="ital">par excellence</span>, that it could dispense with the article (Mey.). Thus the import of the whole verse will be—“that he might set apart and consecrate the Church by cleansing it of guilt by baptism in accordance with the Divine promise” (or, “on the ground of the preached word of the Gospel”). The clause defines the <span class="greekheb">καθαρισμός</span> as one that does not take effect by means of the <span class="greekheb">λουτρὸν τοῦ ὕδατος</span> in and by itself, but by that only as administered in the <span class="ital">power</span> or on the <span class="ital">ground</span> of the preached Word. It is to be observed also that the <span class="ital">sanctifying</span> and the <span class="ital">purifying</span> are referred to Christ’s giving up of Himself, His death being that in virtue of which these things take place.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/ephesians/5.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">26</span>. <span class="ital">sanctify and cleanse</span> it] Better, again, <span class="bld">her</span>. And the pronoun is slightly emphatic by position; as if to say, “It was in <span class="ital">her</span> interest that He did this, and so in the wife’s interest the husband should be ready for sacrifice.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“<span class="ital">Sanctify and cleanse:</span>”—lit., <span class="bld">sanctify, cleansing</span>; both the verbs being in the aorist, and being thus most naturally referred to one and same crisis, not, as R.V. seems to imply, (“sanctify, <span class="ital">having cleansed</span>,”) to a sanctifying process consequent on a cleansing. The Church was decisively “sanctified,” separated from the claim and dominion of sin unto God, when she was decisively “cleansed,” accepted as guiltless.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It needs remembrance that the word “to sanctify” lends itself equally, according to context, to ideas of <span class="ital">crisis</span> and of <span class="ital">process</span>. In one aspect the human being, decisively claimed and regenerated by God for Himself, <span class="ital">is</span> sanctified. In another aspect, in view of each successive subjective experience of renunciation of self for God, he is <span class="ital">being</span> sanctified.—The sanctifying crisis here in view is that of regeneration. This is put before us ideally as the regeneration <span class="ital">of the Church</span>. The Idea is realized historically in the regeneration of individuals, with a view to the final total.—On this individual aspect of the matter, cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-3.htm" title="Jesus answered and said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.">John 3:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-5.htm" title="Jesus answered, Truly, truly, I say to you, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.">John 3:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-11.htm" title="And such were some of you: but you are washed, but you are sanctified, but you are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.">1 Corinthians 6:11</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">with the washing of water</span>] Lit., <span class="bld">by the laver of the water</span>. So <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-5.htm" title="Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;">Titus 3:5</a>; “through the laver of regeneration,” the only other N.T. passage where the noun rendered “laver” occurs.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Here, undoubtedly, Holy Baptism is referred to. It is another and most important question, what is the precise bearing of the Rite upon regeneration; whether it is the special channel of infusion of the new life, or its federal and legal “conveyance,” the Seal upon the Covenant of it, and upon the actual grant of it. But in any case there <span class="ital">is a</span> connexion, divinely established, between Regeneration and Baptism. For ourselves, we hold that Baptism is a true analogue to the sacrament of Circumcision, and that its direct and essential work is that of a Divine seal. This view we believe to be (1) the view in truest harmony with the whole spirit of the Gospel, (2) the view most consonant with observed facts, (3) the view which, under wide varieties of expression, was held, in essence, by the pre-medieval Church (and not wholly forgotten even in the medieval Church), and by the great Anglican Protestant doctors of the 16th and 17th centuries. But it is to be remembered that this view leaves untouched the fact of <span class="ital">a</span> profound and sacred connexion between New Birth and Baptism. And it is entirely consonant with language of high reverence and honour for the Rite, language often applicable, properly, only to the related Blessing, under remembrance that the Rite derives all its greatness from the spiritual Reality to which it stands related.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">by the word</span>] Quite lit., <span class="bld">in utterance</span>, or <span class="bld">in an utterance</span>. The Gr. is <span class="ital">rhêma</span>, not <span class="ital">logos</span>. We may translate (having regard to the N. T. usage of “<span class="ital">in</span>,” similar cases), <span class="bld">attended by</span>, or <span class="bld">conditioned by, an utterance</span>: as if to say, not a <span class="ital">mere</span> laver of water, but one which is what it is only as joined to declared truth.—What is the “utterance” in question? The Gr. word (in the singular), occurs elsewhere in the Epistles, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-8.htm" title="But what said it?

And this is the word which by the gospel is preached to you.">1 Peter 1:25</a> (twice). In almost every case it refers to a definite Divine utterance, whether of truth or of will. We explain it here accordingly as the utterance of that New Covenant of the Gospel of which Baptism is the seal, or, to put it more generally, the revelation of salvation embodied in “the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-19.htm" title="Go you therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:">Matthew 28:19</a>), or in “the Name of the Lord Jesus” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-5.htm" title="When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.">Acts 19:5</a>). Baptism, <span class="ital">in connexion with</span> that revelation and the reception of it, is “the laver of new birth”(<a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-5.htm" title="Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;">Titus 3:5</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Cp. the parallel <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-21.htm" title="The like figure whereunto even baptism does also now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ:">1 Peter 3:21</a>; in which we see the same care to correct any possible inferences from the material aspect of Baptism, as if the rite itself, apart from the moral surroundings of the rite, were a saving thing.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/ephesians/5.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-26.htm" title="That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word,">Ephesians 5:26</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἁγιάσῃ</span>, <span class="ital">might sanctify</span>) Often <span class="ital">holiness</span> and <span class="ital">glory</span> are synonymous; wherefore here also follows, <span class="ital">He might present it to Himself a glorious Church</span>.—<span class="greekheb">καθαρίσας</span>, <span class="ital">cleansing</span>) <span class="ital">Cleansing</span> precedes the <span class="ital">bestowal of glory</span> and the formation of the nuptial tie.—<span class="greekheb">ἵνα</span>, <span class="ital">that</span>) The construction is, <span class="ital">He gave Himself—cleansing</span> (<span class="ital">i.e. and cleansed</span>); <span class="ital">that</span> [<span class="greekheb">ἵνα</span>] depends upon both [<span class="greekheb">παρέδωκεν</span> and <span class="greekheb">καθαρίσας</span>], being put twice [<span class="greekheb">ἵνα ἁγιάσῃ</span> and <span class="greekheb">ἵνα παραστήσῃ</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-26.htm" title="That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word,">Ephesians 5:26</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-27.htm" title="That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.">Ephesians 5:27</a>] in the text. <span class="ital">Sanctification</span> is derived from the death or blood of Christ; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-12.htm" title="Why Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people with his own blood, suffered without the gate.">Hebrews 13:12</a> : <span class="ital">cleansing</span> or <span class="ital">purification</span>, as we shall see presently, from baptism and the word.

The difference between selfish and unselfish love is seen here: a selfish lover cares for his wife in his own interest - like Samson, desires to have her simply because she pleases him, and, in his converse with her, thinks, not of her good, but of his own enjoyment; but the love of an unselfish lover constrains him to seek her good, to do nothing that will hurt her and damage her in any manner of way, but to do everything that he believes will advance her well-being, especially in the highest sense. He finds her polluted (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16.htm">Ezekiel 16</a>.), and his great instrument of cleansing is "the Word" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-3.htm">John 15:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-5.htm">John 17:5</a>) - the Word in all its searching, humbling, rebuking, correcting, informing, stimulating, refreshing, consoling power.
