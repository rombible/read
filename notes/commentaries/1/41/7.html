Now that God no longer speaks to us in that way, it is no matter how little we either heed dreams, or tell them. The telling of foolish dreams can make no better than foolish talk. But these dreams showed that they were sent of God; when he awoke, Pharaoh's spirit was troubled.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/genesis/41.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The dreams are recited. "By the river." In the dream Pharaoh supposes himself on the banks of the Nile. "On rite green." The original word denotes the reed, or marsh grass, on the banks of the Nile. The cow is a very significant emblem of fruitful nature among the Egyptians, the hieroglyphic symbol of the earth and of agriculture; and the form in which Isis the goddess of the earth was adored. "Dreamed a second time." The repetition is designed to confirm the warning given, as Joseph afterward explains <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-32.htm">Genesis 41:32</a>. Corn (grain) is the natural emblem of fertility and nurture. "Blasted with the east wind The east wind". The east wind is any wind coming from the east of the meridian, and may be a southeast or a northeast, as well as a direct east. The Hebrews were accustomed to speak only of the four winds, and, therefore, must have used the name of each with great latitude. The blasting wind in Egypt is said to be usually from the southeast. "And, behold, it was a dream." The impression was so distinct as to be taken for the reality, until he awoke and perceived that it was only a dream. "His spirit was troubled." Like the officers in the prison <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/40-6.htm">Genesis 40:6</a>, he could not get rid of the feeling that the twofold dream portended some momentous event. "The scribes" - the hieroglyphs, who belonged to the priestly caste, and whose primary business was to make hieroglyphic and other inscriptions; while they were accustomed to consult the stars, interpret dreams, practise soothsaying, and pursue the other occult arts. The sages; whose chief business was the cultivation of the various arts above mentioned, while the engraving or inscribing department strictly belonged to the hieroglyphs or scribes. "His dream;" the twofold dream. "Interpreted them" - the two dreams.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/genesis/41.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 41<p>Ge 41:1-24. Pharaoh's Dream.<p>1. at the end of two full years&#8212;It is not certain whether these years are reckoned from the beginning of Joseph's imprisonment, or from the events described in the preceding chapter&#8212;most likely the latter. What a long time for Joseph to experience the sickness of hope deferred! But the time of his enlargement came when he had sufficiently learned the lessons of God designed for him; and the plans of Providence were matured.<p>Pharaoh dreamed&#8212;"Pharaoh," from an Egyptian word Phre, signifying the "sun," was the official title of the kings of that country. The prince, who occupied the throne of Egypt, was Aphophis, one of the Memphite kings, whose capital was On or Heliopolis, and who is universally acknowledged to have been a patriot king. Between the arrival of Abraham and the appearance of Joseph in that country, somewhat more than two centuries had elapsed. Kings sleep and dream, as well as their subjects. And this Pharaoh had two dreams in one night so singular and so similar, so distinct and so apparently significant, so coherent and vividly impressed on his memory, that his spirit was troubled.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/genesis/41.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Not a real thing, as Pharaoh in his sleep imagined it to be. Heb. <span class="ital">Behold the dream, </span> i.e. the dream did not vanish, as dreams commonly do, but was fixed in his mind, and he could not shake it off; by which he saw that it was no common or natural, but a Divine and significant dream. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/genesis/41.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears,....

"in days," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/29-14.htm">Genesis 29:14</a>) Pharaoh had a dream. He was standing by the Nile, and saw seven fine fat cows ascend from the Nile and feed in the Nile-grass (&#1488;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468; an Egyptian word); and behind them seven others, ugly (according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/41-19.htm">Genesis 41:19</a>, unparalleled in their ugliness), lean (&#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512; &#1491;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; "thin in flesh," for which we find in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-19.htm">Genesis 41:19</a> &#1491;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; "fallen away," and &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512; &#1512;&#1511;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; withered in flesh, fleshless), which placed themselves beside those fat ones on the brink of the Nile and devoured them, without there being any effect to show that they had eaten them. He then awoke, but fell asleep again and had a second, similar dream: seven fat (<a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/41-22.htm">Genesis 41:22</a>, full) and fine ears grew upon one blade, and were swallowed up by seven thin (<a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/41-23.htm">Genesis 41:23</a>, "and hardened") ones, which were blasted by the east wind (&#1511;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; i.e., the S.E. wind, Chamsin, from the desert of Arabia). </body></html>
