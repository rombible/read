Out of covetousness, Lot had settled in fruitful, but wicked Sodom. Its inhabitants were the most ripe for vengeance of all the descendants of Canaan. The invaders were from Chaldea and Persia, then only small kingdoms. They took Lot among the rest, and his goods. Though he was righteous, and Abram's brother's son, yet he was with the rest in this trouble. Neither our own piety, nor our relation to the favourites of Heaven, will be our security when God's judgments are abroad. Many an honest man fares the worse for his wicked neighbours: it is our wisdom to separate, or at least to distinguish ourselves from them, 2Co 6:17. So near a relation of Abram should have been a companion and a disciple of Abram. If he chose to dwell in Sodom, he must thank himself if he share in Sodom's losses. When we go out of the way of our duty, we put ourselves from under God's protection, and cannot expect that the choice made by our lusts, should end to our comfort. They took Lot's goods; it is just with God to deprive us of enjoyments, by which we suffer ourselves to be deprived of the enjoyment of him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/genesis/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>We have now arrived again at the point we had reached in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-3.htm">Genesis 14:3</a>. The five kings came out and joined battle with the four in the dale of Siddim. This dale abounded in pits of mineral pitch, or asphalt. The kings of Sodom and Amorah fled toward these pits, and seem to have fallen into them and perished. The others betook themselves to the mountain - probably the heights on the cast of the dale.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/genesis/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 14<p>Ge 14:1-24. War.<p>1. And it came to pass&#8212;This chapter presents Abram in the unexpected character of a warrior. The occasion was this: The king of Sodom and the kings of the adjoining cities, after having been tributaries for twelve years to the king of Elam, combined to throw off his yoke. To chastise their rebellion, as he deemed it, Chedorlaomer, with the aid of three allies, invaded the territories of the refractory princes, defeated them in a pitched battle where the nature of the ground favored his army (Ge 14:10), and hastened in triumph on his homeward march, with a large amount of captives and booty, though merely a stranger.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/genesis/14.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/genesis/14.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And there went out the king of Sodom,....

The kings named here are not mentioned again. On Shinar, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-10.htm">Genesis 10:10</a>; and on Elam, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-22.htm">Genesis 10:22</a>. It cannot be determined with certainty where Ellasar was. Knobel supposes it to be Artemita, which was also called &#x3a7;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;, in southern Assyria, to the north of Babylon. Goyim is not used here for nations generally, but is the name of one particular nation or country. In Delitzsch's opinion it is an older name for Galilee, though probably with different boundaries (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/12-23.htm">Joshua 12:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-2.htm">Judges 4:2</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-1.htm">Isaiah 9:1</a>). - The verb &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1468; (made), in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/14-2.htm">Genesis 14:2</a>, is governed by the kings mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-1.htm">Genesis 14:1</a>. To Bela, whose king is not mentioned by name, the later name Zoar (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-22.htm">Genesis 19:22</a>) is added as being better known.</body></html>
