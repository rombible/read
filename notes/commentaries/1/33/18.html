Pent. has <span class= "ital">shalom,”</span>safe”; but <span class= "ital">shalem </span>is right, and means <span class= "ital">whole, sound. </span>Onkelos, however, followed by most modern commentators, renders it <span class= "ital">in peace, </span>but this too would not mean <span class= "ital">peaceably, </span>but that his troubles were now at an end, and his lameness cured. Philippsohn’s rendering, however, is more exact, namely, <span class= "ital">wohlbehalten, </span>in good condition. Rashi also, no mean authority, sees in it an allusion to the cure of Jacob’s lameness. As Shechem was a man, his city would not be Shalem, but that called after his own name. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-6.htm" title="And Abram passed through the land to the place of Sichem, to the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.">Genesis 12:6</a> it is called “Sichern,” where see Note. Sichern was probably the old name, but after the cruel fate brought upon it by Shechem’s misconduct the spelling was modified to suit the history.<p><span class= "bld">In the land of Canaan.</span>—Jacob therefore had now crossed the river Jordan, and so far completed his homeward journey. Probably as soon as he had recovered from his lameness he visited his father, but as his possessions were large, and Esau was the chief at Hebron, there was no room at present for him to dwell there, nor in fact was this possible until Isaac’s death. But as we find Deborah with them soon afterwards, it is plain that he had gone to visit Isaac, and, finding his mother dead, had brought away with him her beloved nurse.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/33.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>33:17-20 Jacob did not content himself with words of thanks for God's favour to him, but gave real thanks. Also he kept up religion, and the worship of God in his family. Where we have a tent, God must have an altar. Jacob dedicated this altar to the honour of El-elohe-Israel, God, the God of Israel; to the honour of God, the only living and true God; and to the honour of the God of Israel, as a God in covenant with him. Israel's God is Israel's glory. Blessed be his name, he is still the mighty God, the God of Israel. May we praise his name, and rejoice in his love, through our pilgrimage here on earth, and for ever in the heavenly Canaan.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/genesis/33.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Jacob at length crosses the Jordan, and enters again the land of Kenaan. "In peace." The original word (&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1501;  sha&#772;le&#772;m "safe, in peace") is rendered Shalem, the name of the town at which Jacob arrived, by the Septuagint. The rendering safe, or in peace, is here adopted, because (1) the word is to be taken as a common noun or adjective, unless there be a clear necessity for a proper name; (2) "the place" was called Shekem in the time of Abraham <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/12-6.htm">Genesis 12:6</a>, and the "town" is so designated in the thirty-fifth chapter <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-4.htm">Genesis 35:4</a>; and (3) the statement that Jacob arrived in safety accounts for the additional clauses, "which is in the land of Kenaan," and "when he went from Padan-aram," and is in accordance with the promise <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-21.htm">Genesis 28:21</a> that he would return in peace. If, however, the Salim found by Robinson to the west of Nablous be the present town, it must be called the city of Shekem, because it belonged to the Shekem mentioned in the following verse and chapter. "Pitched before the city."<p>Jacob did not enter into the city, because his flocks and herds could not find accommodation there, and he did not want to come into close contact with the inhabitants. "He bought a parcel of the field." He is anxious to have a place he may call his own, where he may have a permanent resting-place. "For a hundred kesitahs." The kesitah may have been a piece of silver or gold, of a certain weight, equal in value to a lamb (see Gesenius). "El-Elohe-Israel." Jacob consecrates his ground by the erection of an altar. He calls it the altar of the Mighty One, the God of Israel, in which he signalizes the omnipotence of him who had brought him in safety to the land of promise through many perils, the new name by which he himself had been lately designated, and the blessed communion which now existed between the Almighty and himself. This was the very spot where Abraham, about one hundred and eighty-five years ago, built the first altar he erected in the promised land <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/12-6.htm">Genesis 12:6-7</a>. It is now consecrated anew to the God of promise. <p> - Dinah's Dishonor<p>This chapter records the rape of Dinah and the revenge of her brothers.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/genesis/33.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18. Shalem&#8212;that is, "peace"; and the meaning may be that Jacob came into Canaan, arriving safe and sound at the city Shechem&#8212;a tribute to Him who had promised such a return (compare Ge 28:15). But most writers take Shalem as a proper name&#8212;a city of Shechem, and the site is marked by one of the little villages about two miles to the northeast. A little farther in the valley below Shechem "he bought a parcel of a field," thus being the first of the patriarchs who became a proprietor of land in Canaan.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/genesis/33.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Shalem; </span> most take it for the proper name of a place belonging to <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Shechem, </span> as it here follows, called <span class="ital">Salim, </span><span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-23.htm" title="And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.">John 3:23</a></span>, and <span class="ital">Sichem</span> or <span class="ital">Sychar, </span><span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-5.htm" title="Then comes he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.">John 4:5</a></span>.

The rendering in the margin is possible. It is supported by LXX and Vulg. There is a village, <span class="ital">Salim</span>, still to be found near Shechem. On the other hand, the context speaks of Jacob “before the city” of Shechem; and the fact of his arrival there “in peace” is not without significance in view of the events narrated in ch. 34.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Canaan … Paddan-aram</span>] The transition in this verse is abrupt.

P.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">before the city</span>] “In front of it,” lit. “in the presence of the city” of Shechem.

But Jacob politely declined not only his own company, but also the escort, which Esau afterwards offered him, of a portion of his attendants; the latter as being unnecessary, the former as likely to be injurious to his flocks. This did not spring from any feeling of distrust; and the ground assigned was no mere pretext. He needed no military guard, "for he knew that he was defended by the hosts of God;" and the reason given was a very good one: "My lord knoweth that the children are tender, and the flocks and herds that are milking (&#1506;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514; from &#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;, giving milk or suckling) are upon me" (&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;): i.e., because they are giving milk they are an object of especial anxiety to me; "and if one should overdrive them a single day, all the sheep would die." A caravan, with delicate children and cattle that required care, could not possibly keep pace with Esau and his horsemen, without taking harm. And Jacob could not expect his brother to accommodate himself to the rate at which he was travelling. For this reason he wished Esau to go on first; and he would drive gently behind, "according to the foot of the cattle (&#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1499;&#1492; possessions  equals  cattle), and according to the foot of the children," i.e., "according to the pace at which the cattle and the children could go" (Luther). "Till I come to my lord to Seir:" these words are not to be understood as meaning that he intended to go direct to Seir; consequently they were not a wilful deception for the purpose of getting rid of Esau. Jacob's destination was Canaan, and in Canaan probably Hebron, where his father Isaac still lived. From thence he may have thought of paying a visit to Esau in Seir. Whether he carried out this intention or not, we cannot tell; for we have not a record of all that Jacob did, but only of the principal events of his life. We afterwards find them both meeting together as friends at their father's funeral (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-29.htm">Genesis 35:29</a>). Again, the attitude of inferiority which Jacob assumed in his conversation with Esau, addressing him as lord, and speaking of himself as servant, was simply an act of courtesy suited to the circumstances, in which he paid to Esau the respect due to the head of a powerful band; since he could not conscientiously have maintained the attitude of a brother, when inwardly and spiritually, in spite of Esau's friendly meeting, they were so completely separated the one from the other. </body></html>
