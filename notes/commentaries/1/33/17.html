But the fact, coupled with the right translation of <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/33-18.htm" title="And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Padanaram; and pitched his tent before the city.">Genesis 33:18</a>, is a strong but undesigned testimony to the truth of the narrative. Jacob had been pursued by Laban, and suffered much from anxiety and the labour attendant upon the hurried removal of so large a household. Delivered from danger in the rear, he has to face a greater danger in front, and passes many days and nights in terror. At last Esau is close at hand, and having done all that man could do, he stays behind to recover himself, and prepare for the dreaded meeting next day. But instead of a few calm restful hours he has to wrestle fiercely all night, and when at sunrise he moves. forward he finds that he has sprained his hip. He gets through the interview with Esan with much feeling, agitated alternately by fear, and hope, and joy, enduring all the while his bodily pain as best he can, and then, delivered from all danger, he breaks down. The word “journeyed” simply means that he broke up his camp from the high ground where he had met his brother, and went into the corner close by, where the two rivers would both protect him and provide his cattle with water and herbage. And there he not only put up some protection, probably wattled enclosures made with branches of trees, for his cattle, but built a house for himself—something, that is, more solid than a tent: and there he lay until he was healed of his lameness. The strained sinew would require some months of perfect rest before Jacob could move about; but it was healed, for “Jacob came whole and sound to the city of Shechem.” (See next verse.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/genesis/33.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/33-17.htm" title="And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him an house, and made booths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is called Succoth.">Genesis 33:17</a></span>. <span class="ital">Jacob journeyed to Succoth — </span>A place afterward known by that name, in the tribe of Gad, on the other side Jordan; here he rested for the present, set up booths for his cattle, and built a house; doubtless some slight building, because he intended not to stay there; with other conveniences for himself and family. <span class="ital">Therefore the name of the place is called Succoth — </span>That is, <span class="ital">booths, </span>that when his posterity afterward dwelt in houses of stone, they might remember that <span class="ital">the Syrian, ready to perish, was their father, </span>who was glad of <span class="ital">booths, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-5.htm" title="And you shall speak and say before the LORD your God, A Syrian ready to perish was my father, and he went down into Egypt, and sojourned there with a few, and became there a nation, great, mighty, and populous:">Deuteronomy 26:5</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/33-18.htm" title="And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Padanaram; and pitched his tent before the city....">Genesis 33:18-19</a>. </span><span class="ital">Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem — </span>Or rather, as the Hebrew may be rendered, he came <span class="ital">safe, </span>or <span class="ital">in peace, </span>to <span class="ital">the city of Shechem. </span>After a perilous journey, in which he had met with many difficulties, he came safe at last into Canaan. <span class="ital">He bought a parcel of a field — </span>For his present possession and use; for the right which he already had to it was only in reversion, after the time that God had appointed. <span class="ital">Of the children of Hamor — </span>That is, subjects, called <span class="ital">children, </span>to signify the duty which they owed to him, and the care and affection he owed to them. <span class="ital">Shechem’s father — </span>He only of Hamor’s sons is mentioned, because he was more honourable than the rest of his brethren, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/34-19.htm" title="And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had delight in Jacob's daughter: and he was more honorable than all the house of his father.">Genesis 34:19</a>,) and so might probably transact this affair with Jacob, the rest consenting thereto.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/33.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>33:17-20 Jacob did not content himself with words of thanks for God's favour to him, but gave real thanks. Also he kept up religion, and the worship of God in his family. Where we have a tent, God must have an altar. Jacob dedicated this altar to the honour of El-elohe-Israel, God, the God of Israel; to the honour of God, the only living and true God; and to the honour of the God of Israel, as a God in covenant with him. Israel's God is Israel's glory. Blessed be his name, he is still the mighty God, the God of Israel. May we praise his name, and rejoice in his love, through our pilgrimage here on earth, and for ever in the heavenly Canaan.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/genesis/33.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>"Sukkoth" was south of the Jabbok, and east of the Jordan, as we learn from <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/8-4.htm">Judges 8:4-9</a>. From the same passage it appears to have been nearer the Jordan than Penuel, which was at the ford of Jahbok. Sukkoth cannot therefore, be identified with Sakut, which Robinson finds on the other side of the Jordan, about ten miles north of the mouth of the Jabbok. "And built him a house." This indicates a permanent residence. Booths, or folds, composed of upright stakes wattled together, and sheltered with leafy branches. The closed space in the text is properly introduced here, to indicate the pause in the narrative, while Jacob sojourned in this place. Dinah, who is not noticed on the journey, was now not more than six years of age. Six or seven years more, therefore, must have elapsed before the melancholy events of the next chapter took place. In the interval, Jacob may have visited his father, and even returned the visit of Esau.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/genesis/33.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17. Jacob journeyed to Succoth&#8212;that is, "booths," that being the first station at which Jacob halted on his arrival in Canaan. His posterity, when dwelling in houses of stone, built a city there and called it Succoth, to commemorate the fact that their ancestor, "a Syrian ready to perish" [De 26:5], was glad to dwell in booths.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/genesis/33.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Built him an house, </span> which doubtless was some slight building, because he intended not to stay there. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/genesis/33.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Jacob journeyed to Succoth,.... Perhaps after he had been at Seir, and stayed there some little time. Succoth was on the other side of Jordan, so called by anticipation, for it had its name from what follows; as yet there was no city built here, or at least of this name; afterwards there was, it lay in a valley, and belonged to Sihon king of Heshbon, and was given to the tribe of Gad, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-27.htm">Joshua 13:27</a>; it is mentioned along with Penuel, and was not far from it, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-8.htm">Judges 8:8</a>. It is said to be but two miles distant from it (u), but one would think it should be more: <p>and built him an house, and made booths for his cattle; an house for himself and family, and booths or tents for his servants or shepherds, and for the cattle they had the care of, some for one, and some for the other. This he did with an intention to stay some time here, as it should seem; and the Targum of Jonathan says he continued here a whole year, and Jarchi eighteen months, a winter and two summers; but this is all uncertain: <p>therefore the name of the place is called Succoth; from the booths or tents built here, which this word signifies. <p>(u) Bunting's Travels, p. 72. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/genesis/33.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him an house, and made booths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is called Succoth.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/genesis/33.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">17</span>. <span class="ital">Succoth</span>] This verse preserves the traditional explanation of the origin of the name <span class="ital">Succoth</span>, “booths,” “huts”; LXX <span class="greekheb">σκῆναι</span>.
