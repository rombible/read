There was no bread, and the people were ready to die. See how we depend upon God's providence. All our wealth would not keep us from starving, if rain were withheld for two or three years. See how much we are at God's mercy, and let us keep ourselves always in his love. Also see how much we smart by our own want of care. If all the Egyptians had laid up corn for themselves in the seven years of plenty, they had not been in these straits; but they regarded not the warning. Silver and gold would not feed them: they must have corn. All that a man hath will he give for his life. We cannot judge this matter by modern rules. It is plain that the Egyptians regarded Joseph as a public benefactor. The whole is consistent with Joseph's character, acting between Pharaoh and his subjects, in the fear of God. The Egyptians confessed concerning Joseph, Thou hast saved our lives. What multitudes will gratefully say to Jesus, at the last day, Thou hast saved our souls from the most tremendous destruction, and in the season of uttermost distress! The Egyptians parted with all their property, and even their liberty, for the saving of their lives: can it then be too much for us to count all but loss, and part with all, at His command, and for His sake, who will both save our souls, and give us an hundredfold, even here, in this present world? Surely if saved by Christ, we shall be willing to become his servants.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/genesis/47.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The seventh year is now come. The silver and cattle are now gone. Nothing remains but their lands, and with these themselves as the serfs of the soil. Accordingly they make this offer to Joseph, which he cannot refuse. Hence, it is evident that Pharaoh had as yet no legal claim to the soil. In primeval times the first entrants into an unoccupied country became, by a natural custom, the owners of the grounds they held and cultivated. The mere nomad, who roamed over a wide range of country, where his flocks merely cropped the spontaneous herbage, did not soon arrive at the notion of private property in land. But the husbandman, who settled on a promising spot, broke up the soil, and sowed the seed, felt he had acquired by his labor a title to the acres he had cultivated and permanently occupied, and this right was instinctively acknowledged by others. Hence, each cultivator grew into the absolute owner of his own farm. Hence, the lands of Egypt belonged to the peasantry of the country, and were at their disposal. These lands had now become valueless to those who had neither provisions for themselves nor seed for their ground. They willingly part with them, therefore, for a year's provision and a supply of seed. In this way the lands of Egypt fell into the hands of the crown by a free purchase. "And the people he removed into the cities." This is not an act of arbitrary caprice, but a wise and kind measure for the more convenient nourishment of the people until the new arrangements for the cultivation of the soil should be completed. The priestly class were sustained by a state allowance, and therefore, were not obliged to alienate their lands. Hence, they became by this social revolution a privileged order. The military class were also exempted most probably from the surrender of their patrimonial rights, as they were maintained on the crown lands.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/genesis/47.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16.

The settlement of the Israelites is called the land of Ramses (&#1512;&#1506;&#1502;&#1505;&#1505;, in pause &#1512;&#1506;&#1502;&#1505;&#1505; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/1-11.htm">Exodus 1:11</a>), instead of Goshen, either because the province of Goshen (&#x393;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bc;, lxx) is indicated by the name of its former capital Ramses (i.e., Heroopolis, on the site or in the immediate neighbourhood of the modern Abu Keisheib, in Wady Tumilat (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/1-11.htm">Exodus 1:11</a>), or because Israel settled in the vicinity of Ramses. The district of Goshen is to be sought in the modern province of el Sharkiyeh (i.e., the eastern), on the east side of the Nile, towards Arabia, still the most fertile and productive province of Egypt (cf. Robinson, Pal. i. 78, 79). For Goshen was bounded on the east by the desert of Arabia Petraea, which stretches away to Philistia (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/13-17.htm">Exodus 13:17</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-21.htm">1 Chronicles 7:21</a>) and is called &#x393;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bc; &#x391;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; in the Septuagint in consequence (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/45-10.htm">Genesis 45:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/46-34.htm">Genesis 46:34</a>), and must have extended westwards to the Nile, since the Israelites had an abundance of fish (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-5.htm">Numbers 11:5</a>). It probably skirted the Tanitic arm of the Nile, as the fields of Zoan, i.e., Tanis, are said to have been the scene of the mighty acts of God in Egypt (<a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/78-12.htm">Psalm 78:12</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/78-43.htm">Psalm 78:43</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-22.htm">Numbers 13:22</a>). In this province Joseph assigned his relations settlements near to himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/45-10.htm">Genesis 45:10</a>), from which they could quickly and easily communicate with one another (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/46-28.htm">Genesis 46:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/48-1.htm">Genesis 48:1</a>.). Whether he lived at Ramses or not, cannot be determined, just because the residence of the Pharaoh of that time is not known, and the notion that it was at Memphis is only based upon utterly uncertain combinations relating to the Hyksos. </body></html>
