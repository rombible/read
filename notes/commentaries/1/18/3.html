Abraham’s conduct is marked by all that stately courtesy usual among Orientals. He calls himself their slave: regards it as a favour that they should partake of his hospitality; speaks slightingly of the repast prepared as a mere morsel of bread; and treats it as a providential act that they had come into his neighbourhood. It was only afterwards that he knew that he was entertaining angels unawares (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-2.htm" title="Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares.">Hebrews 13:2</a>). While, moreover, he addresses the chief traveller first, as courtesy required, he immediately afterwards changes to the plural, lest he should seem wanting in hospitable welcome to his companions.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/genesis/18.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/18-3.htm" title="And said, My LORD, if now I have found favor in your sight, pass not away, I pray you, from your servant:...">Genesis 18:3-4</a>. </span><span class="ital">And he said, My Lord — </span>He addressed himself to one of the three, who seemed to have the pre-eminence, probably because of some peculiar majesty which appeared in his countenance, or the respect which the other two paid him. <span class="ital">Let a little water be fetched — </span>As in those hot climates people went bare-footed, or wore only sandals, washing the feet often was both customary and necessary.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/18.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>18:1-8 Abraham was waiting to entertain any weary traveller, for inns were not to be met with as among us. While Abraham was thus sitting, he saw three men coming. These were three heavenly beings in human bodies. Some think they were all created angels; others, that one of them was the Son of God, the Angel of the covenant. Washing the feet is customary in those hot climates, where only sandals are worn. We should not be forgetful to entertain strangers, for thereby some have entertained angels unawares, Heb 13:2; nay, the Lord of angels himself; as we always do, when for his sake we entertain the least of his brethren. Cheerful and obliging manners in showing kindness, are great ornaments to piety. Though our condescending Lord vouchsafes not personal visits to us, yet still by his Spirit he stands at the door and knocks; when we are inclined to open, he deigns to enter; and by his gracious consolations he provides a rich feast, of which we partake with him, Re 3:20.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/genesis/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>O Lord. - Abraham uses the word &#1488;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497;  'adona&#772;y denoting one having authority, whether divine or not. This the Masorites mark as sacred, and apply the vowel points proper to the word when it signifies God. These men in some way represent God; for "the Lord" on this occasion appeared unto Abraham <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-1.htm">Genesis 18:1</a>. The number is in this respect notable. Abraham addresses himself first to one person <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/18-3.htm">Genesis 18:3</a>, then to more than one <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/18-4.htm">Genesis 18:4-5</a>. It is stated that "'they' said, So do <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/18-5.htm">Genesis 18:5</a>, 'they' did eat <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/18-8.htm">Genesis 18:8</a>, ' they' said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife" <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-9.htm">Genesis 18:9</a>. Then the singular number is resumed in the phrase "'and he said'" <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/18-10.htm">Genesis 18:10</a>, and at length, "The Lord said unto Abraham" <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/18-13.htm">Genesis 18:13</a>, and then, "and he said" <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-15.htm">Genesis 18:15</a>. Then we are told "'the men' rose up, and Abraham went with them" <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-16.htm">Genesis 18:16</a>. Then we have "The Lord said" twice <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/18-17.htm">Genesis 18:17</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-20.htm">Genesis 18:20</a>. And lastly, it is said <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-22.htm">Genesis 18:22</a> "'the men' turned their faces and went toward Sodom, and Abraham was yet standing before the Lord." From this it appears that of the three men one, at all events, was the Lord, who, when the other two went toward Sodom, remained with Abraham while he made his intercession for Sodom, and afterward he also went his way. The other two will come before us again in the next chapter. Meanwhile, we have here the first explicit instance of the Lord appearing as man to man, and holding familiar conversation with him.<p>The narrative affords a pleasing instance of the primitive manners of the East. The hospitality of the pastoral tribes was spontaneous and unreserved. The washing of the feet, which were partly at least uncovered in walking, the reclining under the tree, and the offer of refreshment, are indicative of an unchanging rural simplicity. The phrases "a little water, a morsel of bread," flow from a thoughtful courtesy. "Therefore are ye come." In the course of events it has so fallen out, in order that you might be refreshed. The brief reply is a frank and unaffected acceptance of the hospitable invitation.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/genesis/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3.

This third rendering seems the most probable: (<span class="ital">a</span>) there is no sign of Abraham’s recognizing the real character of the strangers; (<span class="ital">b</span>) it would seem probable that he instinctively recognized one of them as the superior in position, though he does not perceive in him the manifestation of Jehovah until after <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-15.htm" title="Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid.

Those who regard Abraham as unconscious of the Divinity of him to whom he spake see in his language nothing but the customary formula of Oriental address (Rosenm&uuml;ller; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/30-27.htm">Genesis 30:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-29.htm">1 Samuel 20:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/7-3.htm">Esther 7:3</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">put not away, I pray thee, from thy servant.</span> The hospitality of the Eastern, and even of the Arab, has been frequently remarked by travelers.

Because Ishmael was 13 years old when he was circumcised, the Arabs even now defer circumcision to a much later period than the Jews, generally till between the ages of 5 and 13, and frequently even till the 13th year. </body></html>
