Abraham prayed earnestly that Sodom might be spared, if but a few righteous persons should be found in it. Come and learn from Abraham what compassion we should feel for sinners, and how earnestly we should pray for them. We see here that the effectual, fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much. Abraham, indeed, failed in his request for the whole place, but Lot was miraculously delivered. Be encouraged then to expect, by earnest prayer, the blessing of God upon your families, your friends, your neighbourhood. To this end you must not only pray, but you must live like Abraham. He knew the Judge of all the earth would do right. He does not plead that the wicked may be spared for their own sake, or because it would be severe to destroy them, but for the sake of the righteous who might be found among them. And righteousness only can be made a plea before God. How then did Christ make intercession for transgressors? Not by blaming the Divine law, nor by alleging aught in extenuation or excuse of human guilt; but by pleading HIS OWN obedience unto death.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/genesis/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Abraham intercedes for Sodom. His spiritual character is unfolded and exalted more and more. He employs the language of a free-born son with his heavenly Father. He puts forward the plea of justice to the righteous in behalf of the city. He ventures to repeat his intervention six times, every time diminishing the number of the righteous whom he supposes to be in it. The patience of the Lord is no less remarkable than the perseverance of Abraham. In every case he grants his petition. "Dust and ashes." This may refer to the custom of burning the dead, as then coexistent with that of burying them. Abraham intimates by a homely figure the comparative insignificance of the petitioner. He is dust at first, and ashes at last.<p>This completes the full and free conversation of God with Abraham. He accepts his hospitable entertainment, renews his promise of a son by Sarah, communicates to him his counsel, and grants all his requests. It is evident that Abraham has now fully entered upon all the privileges of the sons of God. He has become the friend of God <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-23.htm">James 2:23</a>. <p> - The Destruction of Sodom and Amorah<p>9. &#1490;&#1513;&#1473;&#1470;&lt;&#1492;&#1500;&#1488;&#1492;  gesh-ha&#772;l'a&#770;h, "approach to a distant point," stand back.<p>11. &#1505;&#1504;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;  saneve&#772;r&#305;&#770;ym, "blindness," affecting the mental more than the ocular vision.<p>37. &#1502;&#1493;&#1488;&#1489;  mo&#770;'a&#772;b, Moab; &#1502;&#1488;&#1489;  me&#772;'a&#772;b, "from a father." &#1489;&#1503;&#1470;&#1506;&#1502;&#1497;  ben-&#8219;am&#305;&#770;y, Ben-'ammi, "son of my people." &#1506;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503;  &#8219;amo&#770;n, 'Ammon, "of the people."<p>This chapter is the continuation and conclusion of the former. It records a part of God's strange work - strange, because it consists in punishment, and because it is foreign to the covenant of grace. Yet it is closely connected with Abraham's history, inasmuch as it is a signal chastisement of wickedness in his neighborhood, a memorial of the righteous judgment of God to all his posterity, and at the same time a remarkable answer to the spirit, if not to the letter, of his intercessory prayer. His kinsman Lot, the only righteous man in Sodom, with his wife and two daughters, is delivered from destruction in accordance with his earnest appeal on behalf of the righteous.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/genesis/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Ge 18:23-33. Abraham's Intercession.<p>23. Abraham drew near, and said, &c.&#8212;The scene described is full of interest and instruction&#8212;showing in an unmistakable manner the efficacy of prayer and intercession. (See also Pr 15:8; Jas 5:16). Abraham reasoned justly as to the rectitude of the divine procedure (Ro 3:5, 6), and many guilty cities and nations have been spared on account of God's people (Mt 5:13; 24:22).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/genesis/18.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/genesis/18.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city,.... Sodom is particularly mentioned because Lot dwelt there, and being the metropolis, and the city of greatest note, as Jarchi observes, it is put for the rest; and the sense is, if fifty righteous persons could be found in all the five cities, mercy should be shown them: <p>then will I spare all the place for their sakes; not Sodom only, but the whole country, of which Sodom was the chief; the Lord takes up and agrees to the number Abraham pitched upon, and grants the request he makes. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/genesis/18.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And the LORD said, If I find in Sodom <span class="cverse3">{m}</span> fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.</span><p>(m) God declares that his judgments were done with great mercy, even though all were so corrupt that not only fifty but ten righteous men could not be found there, and also that the wicked are spared for the sake of the righteous.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city</span> (thus accepting the test proposed by Abraham, but not necessarily thereby acquiescing in the absolute soundness of his logic), <span class="cmt_word">then I will spare</span> (not as an act of justice, but as an exercise of mercy, and not because of any suspicions that might otherwise attach to my rectitude, but solely in vindication of my clemency) <span class="cmt_word">all the place</span> (not the righteous merely, which was all that justice could have legitimately demanded) <span class="cmt_word">for their sakes</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> because of the claims upon my mercy which grace admits the righteous to prefer. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/genesis/18.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"The cry of Sodom and Gomorrah, yea it is great; and their sin, yea it is very grievous."
