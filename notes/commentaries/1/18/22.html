The one who is called Jehovah throughout the chapter, continued with Abraham, and would not hide from him the thing he intended to do. Though God long forbears with sinners, from which they fancy that the Lord does not see, and does not regard; yet when the day of his wrath comes, he will look toward them. The Lord will give Abraham an opportunity to intercede with him, and shows him the reason of his conduct. Consider, as a very bright part of Abraham's character and example, that he not only prayed with his family, but he was very careful to teach and rule them well. Those who expect family blessings must make conscience of family duty. Abraham did not fill their heads with matters of doubtful dispute; but he taught them to be serious and devout in the worship of God, and to be honest in their dealings with all men. Of how few may such a character be given in our days! How little care is taken by masters of families to ground those under them in the principles of religion!

As Abraham is not said to hays stood before the three men, the expression points to spiritual rather than to local contiguity. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 18:23-33 <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/genesis/18.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>After this conversation with Sarah, the heavenly guests rose up and turned their faces towards the plain of Sodom (&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1506;&#1500;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-28.htm">Genesis 19:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-20.htm">Numbers 21:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-28.htm">Numbers 23:28</a>). Abraham accompanied them some distance on the road; according to tradition, he went as far as the site of the later Caphar barucha, from which you can see the Dead Sea through a ravine, - solitudinem ac terras Sodomae. And Jehovah said, "Shall I hide from Abraham what I propose to do? Abraham is destined to be a great nation and a blessing to all nations (<a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2-3</a>); for I have known, i.e., acknowledged him (chosen him in anticipative love, &#1497;&#1491;&#1506; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/3-2.htm">Amos 3:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/13-4.htm">Hosea 13:4</a>), that he may command his whole posterity to keep the way of Jehovah, to practise justice and righteousness, that all the promises may be fulfilled in them." God then disclosed to Abraham what he was about to do to Sodom and Gomorrah, not, as Kurtz supposes, because Abraham had been constituted the hereditary possessor of the land, and Jehovah, being mindful of His covenant, would not do anything to it without his knowledge and assent (a thought quite foreign to the context), but because Jehovah had chosen him to be the father of the people of God, in order that, by instructing his descendants in the fear of God, he might lead them in the paths of righteousness, so that they might become partakers of the promised salvation, and not be overtaken by judgment. The destruction of Sodom and the surrounding cities was to be a permanent memorial of the punitive righteousness of God, and to keep the fate of the ungodly constantly before the mind of Israel. To this end Jehovah explained to Abraham the cause of their destruction in the clearest manner possible, that he might not only be convinced of the justice of the divine government, but might learn that when the measure of iniquity was full, no intercession could avert the judgment-a lesson and a warning to his descendants also. </body></html>
