Esau is here called Edom, that name which kept up the remembrance of his selling his birth-right for a mess of pottage. Esau continued the same profane despiser of heavenly things. In outward prosperity and honour, the children of the covenant are often behind, and those that are out of the covenant get the start. We may suppose it a trial to the faith of God's Israel, to hear of the pomp and power of the kings of Edom, while they were bond-slaves in Egypt; but those that look for great things from God, must be content to wait for them; God's time is the best time. Mount Seir is called the land of their possession. Canaan was at this time only the land of promise. Seir was in the possession of the Edomites. The children of this world have their all in hand, and nothing in hope, Lu 16:25; while the children of God have their all in hope, and next to nothing in hand. But, all things considered, it is beyond compare better to have Canaan in promise, than mount Seir in possession.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/genesis/36.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The first dukes of Edom. The Alluph or duke is the head of the tribe among the Edomites, like the Nasi or prince among the Israelites. The ten grandsons of Esau by Adah and Basemath take rank with his three sons by Oholibamah. This favors the presumption that she was his fourth and latest wife. "Duke Corah." This appears to be inserted by a slip of the pen, though it occurs in the Septuagint and Onkelos. It is missing, however, in the Samaritan Pentateuch. It would make twelve dukes, whereas it appears from the closing verses of the chapter that there were only eleven. It is possible, however, that there may have been a Corah descended from Eliphaz who attained to a dukedom; and that Amalek separated himself from the rest of the Edomites and asserted his independence. In the absence of explanatory testimony we must leave this point undecided as we find it.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/genesis/36.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15-19. dukes&#8212;The Edomites, like the Israelites, were divided into tribes, which took their names from his sons. The head of each tribe was called by a term which in our version is rendered "duke"&#8212;not of the high rank and wealth of a British peer, but like the sheiks or emirs of the modern East, or the chieftains of highland clans.

Esau's Sons and Grandsons as Fathers of Tribes. - Through them he became the father of Edom, i.e., the founder of the Edomitish nation on the mountains of Seir. Mouth Seir is the mountainous region between the Dead Sea and the Elanitic Gulf, the northern half of which is called Jebl (&#x393;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;) by the Arabs, the southern half, Sherah (Rob. Pal. ii. 552). - In the case of two of the wives of Esau, who bore only one son each, the tribes were founded not by the sons, but by the grandsons; but in that of Aholibamah the three sons were the founders. Among the sons of Eliphaz we find Amalek, whose mother was Timna, the concubine of Eliphaz. He was the ancestor of the Amalekites, who attacked the Israelites at Horeb as they came out of Egypt under Moses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/17-8.htm">Exodus 17:8</a>.), and not merely of a mixed tribe of Amalekites and Edomites, belonging to the supposed aboriginal Amalekite nation. For the Arabic legend of Amlik as an aboriginal tribe of Arabia is far too recent, confused, and contradictory to counterbalance the clear testimony of the record before us. The allusion to the fields of the Amalekites in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-7.htm">Genesis 14:7</a> does not imply that the tribe was in existence in Abraham's time, nor does the expression "first of the nations," in the saying of Balaam (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-20.htm">Numbers 24:20</a>), represent Amalek as the aboriginal or oldest tribe, but simply as the first heathen tribe by which Israel was attacked. The Old Testament says nothing of any fusion of Edomites or Horites with Amalekites, nor does it mention a double Amalek (cf. Hengstenberg, Dissertations 2, 247ff., and Kurtz, History i. 122, 3, ii.240ff.).<p>(Note: The occurrence of "Timna and Amalek" in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/1-36.htm">1 Chronicles 1:36</a>, as coordinate with the sons of Eliphaz, is simply a more concise form of saying "and from Timna, Amalek.")<p>If there had been an Amalek previous to Edom, with the important part which they took in opposition to Israel even in the time of Moses, the book of Genesis would not have omitted to give their pedigree in the list of the nations. At a very early period the Amalekites separated from the other tribes of Edom and formed an independent people, having their headquarters in the southern part of the mountains of Judah, as far as Kadesh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-7.htm">Genesis 14:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-29.htm">Numbers 13:29</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-43.htm">Numbers 14:43</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-45.htm">Numbers 14:45</a>), but, like the Bedouins, spreading themselves as a nomad tribe over the whole of the northern portion of Arabia Petraea, from Havilah to Shur on the border of Egypt (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-3.htm">1 Samuel 15:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-7.htm">1 Samuel 15:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/27-8.htm">1 Samuel 27:8</a>); whilst one branch penetrated into the heart of Canaan, so that a range of hills, in what was afterwards the inheritance of Ephraim, bore the name of mountains of the Amalekites (<a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/12-15.htm">Judges 12:15</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/5-14.htm">Genesis 5:14</a>). Those who settled in Arabia seem also to have separated in the course of time into several branches, so that Amalekite hordes invaded the land of Israel in connection sometimes with the Midianites and the sons of the East (the Arabs, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-3.htm">Judges 6:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/7-12.htm">Judges 7:12</a>), and at other times with the Ammonites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-13.htm">Judges 3:13</a>). After they had been defeated by Saul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-48.htm">1 Samuel 14:48</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-2.htm">1 Samuel 15:2</a>.), and frequently chastised by David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/27-8.htm">1 Samuel 27:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-1.htm">1 Samuel 30:1</a>.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-12.htm">2 Samuel 8:12</a>), the remnant of them was exterminated under Hezekiah by the Simeonites on the mountains of Seir (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-42.htm">1 Chronicles 4:42-43</a>). </body></html>
