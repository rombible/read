Esau is here called Edom, that name which kept up the remembrance of his selling his birth-right for a mess of pottage. Esau continued the same profane despiser of heavenly things. In outward prosperity and honour, the children of the covenant are often behind, and those that are out of the covenant get the start. We may suppose it a trial to the faith of God's Israel, to hear of the pomp and power of the kings of Edom, while they were bond-slaves in Egypt; but those that look for great things from God, must be content to wait for them; God's time is the best time. Mount Seir is called the land of their possession. Canaan was at this time only the land of promise. Seir was in the possession of the Edomites. The children of this world have their all in hand, and nothing in hope, Lu 16:25; while the children of God have their all in hope, and next to nothing in hand. But, all things considered, it is beyond compare better to have Canaan in promise, than mount Seir in possession.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/genesis/36.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The sentence that was left incomplete in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/36-2.htm">Genesis 36:2</a> is now resumed and completed. His departure from Kenaan is ascribed to the abounding wealth of himself and his brother. What remained in the hands of Isaac was virtually Jacob's, though he had not yet entered into formal possession of it. Mount Seir is the range of hills extending from the Elanitic Gulf to the Salt Sea; the northern part of which is called Jebal &#x393;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;  Gebale&#769;ne&#772; and the southern part esh-Sherah, and parallel to which on the west lies Wady Arabah.

Esau &#8230; went into the country from the face of his brother Jacob&#8212;literally, "a country," without any certain prospect of a settlement. The design of this historical sketch of Esau and his family is to show how the promise (Ge 27:39, 40) was fulfilled. In temporal prosperity he far exceeds his brother; and it is remarkable that, in the overruling providence of God, the vast increase of his worldly substance was the occasion of his leaving Canaan and thus making way for the return of Jacob.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/genesis/36.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="ital">1740</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Quest.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

But when his father was dead, and Jacob and he agreed about the partition of the estate, he did totally and finally forsake Canaan, partly, for the reason here following; partly, for the other reasons now alleged; and partly, to avoid all occasion both of communication and contention with his brother. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/genesis/36.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters,....

Some render the words to this sense, that he went thither "before the coming of Jacob" (p); and it is true that he did go thither before his brother came again into Canaan; but of this the text speaks not, for what follows will not agree with it; others better, "because of Jacob" (q); not for fear of him, as the Targum of Jonathan, which paraphrases the words,"for the terror of his brother Jacob was cast upon him;''but because he knew, by the blessing of his father, and the oracle of God, and his concurring providence in all things, that the land of Canaan belonged to him, and also for a reason that follows. <p>(o) "animus", Pagninus, Montanus, &amp;c.

He had probably visited his father during the ten years that had elapsed since his return from Mesopotamia, though no allusion is made to this, since such visits would have no importance, either in themselves or their consequences, in connection with the sacred history. This was not the case, however, with his return to enter upon the family inheritance. With this, therefore, the history of Isaac's life is brought to a close. Isaac died at the age of 180, and was buried by his two sons in the cave of Machpelah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-31.htm">Genesis 49:31</a>), Abraham's family grave, Esau having come from Seir to Hebron to attend the funeral of his father. But Isaac's death did not actually take place for 12 years after Jacob's return to Hebron. For as Joseph was 17 years old when he was sold by his brethren (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/37-2.htm">Genesis 37:2</a>), and Jacob was then living at Hebron (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/37-14.htm">Genesis 37:14</a>), it cannot have been more than 31 years after his flight from Esau when Jacob returned home (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/34-1.htm">Genesis 34:1</a>). Now since, according to our calculation at <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-1.htm">Genesis 27:1</a>, he was 77 years old when he fled, he must have been 108 when he returned home; and Isaac would only have reached his 168th year, as he was 60 years old when Jacob was born (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-26.htm">Genesis 25:26</a>). Consequently Isaac lived to witness the grief of Jacob at the loss of Joseph, and died but a short time before his promotion in Egypt, which occurred 13 years after he was sold (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-46.htm">Genesis 41:46</a>), and only 10 years before Jacob's removal with his family to Egypt, as Jacob was 130 years old when he was presented to Pharaoh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/47-9.htm">Genesis 47:9</a>). But the historical significance of his life was at an end, when Jacob returned home with his twelve sons. </body></html>
