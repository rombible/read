While Keturah’s sons were apparently sent far away into Arabia, Ishmael at Paran (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/21-21.htm" title="And he dwelled in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt.">Genesis 21:21</a>) would be at no very great distance from the well Lahai-roi, which was Isaac’s favourite residence.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/25.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>25:1-10 All the days, even of the best and greatest saints, are not remarkable days; some slide on silently; such were these last days of Abraham. Here is an account of Abraham's children by Keturah, and the disposition which he made of his estate. After the birth of these sons, he set his house in order, with prudence and justice. He did this while he yet lived. It is wisdom for men to do what they find to do while they live, as far as they can. Abraham lived 175 years; just one hundred years after he came to Canaan; so long he was a sojourner in a strange country. Whether our stay in this life be long or short, it matters but little, provided we leave behind us a testimony to the faithfulness and goodness of the Lord, and a good example to our families. We are told that his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him. It seems that Abraham had himself brought them together while he lived. Let us not close the history of the life of Abraham without blessing God for such a testimony of the triumph of faith.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/genesis/25.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Isaac and Ishmael, - in brotherly cooperation. Ishmael was the oldest son, dwelt in the presence of all his brethren, and had a special blessing. The sons of Keturah were far away in the East, very young, and had no particular blessing. Ishmael is therefore properly associated with Isaac in paying the last offices to their deceased father. The burying-place had been prepared before. Its purchase is here rehearsed with great precision as a testimony of the fact. This burial-ground is an earnest of the promised possession.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/genesis/25.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9, 10. his sons &#8230; buried him&#8212;Death often puts an end to strife, reconciles those who have been alienated, and brings rival relations, as in this instance, to mingle tears over a father's grave.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/genesis/25.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Ishmael, though banished from his father’s house, lived in a place not very far from him; and as no doubt he received many favours from his father after his departure, which is implied here, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-6.htm" title="But to the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, to the east country.">Genesis 25:6</a></span>, though it be not mentioned elsewhere; so it is probable that he had a true respect and affection to his father, which he here expresseth. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/genesis/25.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah,.... Isaac, though the younger brother, is set first, because he was born of the lawful wife of Abraham, the free woman, whereas Ishmael was born of a concubine and a bondwoman; Isaac was heir not only to Abraham's temporal estate, but of the promise made concerning the Messiah, (not so Ishmael,) and was on all accounts the greater man. It appears from hence, that, though them had been a quarrel between Ishmael and Isaac, and the latter had been persecuted by the former, yet the difference was now made up, and they were reconciled, at least they agreed in this act of showing their last respect to their father; and that, though Ishmael had been expelled his father's house, yet he was not at any great distance from him, and there was a correspondence between him and his father; nor was he forgotten by him, as is clear from <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-6.htm">Genesis 25:6</a>; and he retained a filial affection for him; and Jarchi from hence concludes, that he was a penitent and a good man. The place where these two brothers buried their father was the cave of Machpelah: <p>in the field of Ephron, the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/23-8.htm">Genesis 23:8</a>; wherefore very false is the tradition of the Mahometans (g), that Abraham's sepulchre is at Mecca, which they, now show, and stands about twelve paces from the temple there, enclosed with iron rails. <p>(g) Pitt's Account of the Religion of the Mahometans, c. 7. p. 93. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/genesis/25.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre;</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/genesis/25.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">9</span>. <span class="ital">Isaac and Ishmael</span>] The two sons are mentioned once more together, as paying the last tribute of honour to their father.

Dedan was probably the trading people mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-23.htm">Jeremiah 25:23</a> along with Tema and Bus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-13.htm">Isaiah 21:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-8.htm">Jeremiah 49:8</a>), in the neighbourhood of Edom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-15.htm">Ezekiel 24:15</a>), with whom the tribe of Banu Dudan, in Hejas, has been compared. On their relation to the Cushites of the same name, vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-7.htm">Genesis 10:7</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/10-28.htm">Genesis 10:28</a>, - Of the sons of Dedan, the Asshurim have been associated with the warlike tribe of the Asir to the south of Hejas, the Letushim with the Banu Leits in Hejas, and the Leummim with the tribe of the Banu Lm, which extended even to Babylon and Mesopotamia. Of the descendants of Midian, Ephah is mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-6.htm">Isaiah 60:6</a>, in connection with Midian, as a people trading in gold and incense. Epher has been compared with the Banu Gifar in Hejas; Hanoch, with the place called Hanakye, three days' journey to the north of Medinah; Abidah and el-daah, with the tribes of Abide and Vadaa in the neighbourhood of Asir. But all this is very uncertain. </body></html>
