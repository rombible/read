They peopled a very large country that lay between Egypt and Assyria, called Arabia. The number and strength of this family were the fruit of the promise, made to Hagar and to Abraham, concerning Ishmael.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/genesis/25.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Nebaioth - <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-7.htm">Isaiah 60:7</a> is preserved in the Nabataei inhabiting Arabia Petraea, and extending far toward the East.

After mentioned: by their names, according to their generations; which were imposed upon them at their birth, and are recited according to the order in which they were born, as follows: <p>the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth: mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-7.htm">Isaiah 60:7</a>; and from whence a people of the Arabs are called Nabathaeans, and their country Nabathaea. Josephus (i) says, that all the country from Euphrates to the Red sea is called the Nabatene country. The posterity of this man inhabited part of Arabia Deserta and of Arabia Petraea, even to the entrance of Arabia Felix. Strabo (k) reckons the Nabataeans among the Arabians, and calls Petra the metropolis of Arabia Petraea, Petra Nabataea, and Petra of the Arabian Nabataeans, who he says dwelt about Syria, and often made excursions into it; and observes, that their country is populous and abounds with pastures; hence the rams of Nebaioth, mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-7.htm">Isaiah 60:7</a>; Pliny also (l) places them in Arabia, and says they inhabit the town called Petra, and that they border upon Syria. <p>And Kedar is the second son of Ishmael; and the posterity of this man and their country are reckoned in Arabia by Isaiah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-13.htm">Isaiah 21:13</a>; and they are so well known to be Arabians, that the Arabic language is most frequently, in Jewish writings, called the language of Kedar. These are the people whom Pliny (m) names Cedrei, and mentions them along with the Nabathaeans, as near unto them, and indeed they dwelt in the same country, Arabia Petraea, and in tents, living by pasturage, hence they are sometimes called Scenites; and mention is made of the tents of Kedar in Sol 1:5; these are the Scenite Arabs, called Saracens by Ammianus Marcellinus (n). Two other sons of Ishmael follow: <p>and Adbeel and Mibsam; of whom no mention is made elsewhere, nor are there any traces of their names, unless the Agubeni, placed by Ptolemy (o) near Arabia Felix. <p>(i) Antiqu. l. 1. c. 12. sect. 4.
