As, however, Esau and Jacob were born when Isaac was sixty years of age (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-26.htm" title="And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was three score years old when she bore them.">Genesis 25:26</a>), they would be fifteen at Abraham’s death, and probably had often seen their grandfather, and received his blessing.<p><span class= "bld">Abraham . . . was gathered to his people.</span>—Upon the belief in a future life implied in these words, see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-15.htm" title="And you shall go to your fathers in peace; you shall be buried in a good old age.">Genesis 15:15</a>, and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-16.htm" title="But now they desire a better country, that is, an heavenly: why God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he has prepared for them a city.">Hebrews 11:16</a>.<span class= "bld"><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/genesis/25.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-7.htm" title="And these are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he lived, an hundred three score and fifteen years.">Genesis 25:7</a></span>. <span class="ital">These are the days of Abraham — </span>He lived just a hundred years after he came to Canaan; so long he was a sojourner in a strange land.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/25.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>25:1-10 All the days, even of the best and greatest saints, are not remarkable days; some slide on silently; such were these last days of Abraham. Here is an account of Abraham's children by Keturah, and the disposition which he made of his estate. After the birth of these sons, he set his house in order, with prudence and justice. He did this while he yet lived. It is wisdom for men to do what they find to do while they live, as far as they can. Abraham lived 175 years; just one hundred years after he came to Canaan; so long he was a sojourner in a strange country. Whether our stay in this life be long or short, it matters but little, provided we leave behind us a testimony to the faithfulness and goodness of the Lord, and a good example to our families. We are told that his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him. It seems that Abraham had himself brought them together while he lived. Let us not close the history of the life of Abraham without blessing God for such a testimony of the triumph of faith.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/genesis/25.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The death of Abraham. His years were a hundred and seventy-five. He survived Sarah thirty-eight years, and Isaac's marriage thirty-five. His grandfather lived a hundred and forty-eight years, his father two hundred and five, his son Isaac a hundred and eighty, and his grandson Jacob a hundred and forty-seven; so that his years were the full average of that period. "Expired" - breathed his last. "In a happy old age," in external and internal blessedness <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-15.htm">Genesis 15:15</a>. "Old and full" - having attained to the standard length of life in his days, and being satisfied with this life, so that he was ready and willing to depart. "Gathered to his peoples" <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-15.htm">Genesis 15:15</a>. To be gathered is not to cease to exist, but to continue existing in another sphere. His peoples, the departed families, from whom he is descended, are still in being in another not less real world. This, and the like expression in the passage quoted, give the first fact in the history of the soul after death, as the burial is the first step in that of the body.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/genesis/25.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Ge 25:7-11.

We might have wished some memorials of his deathbed experience; but the Spirit of God has withheld them&#8212;nor was it necessary; for (see Mt 7:16) from earth he passed into heaven (Lu 16:22).

But there is no firm ground for this assumption; as it is not stated anywhere, that Abraham did not take Keturah as his wife till after Sarah's death. It is merely an inference drawn from the fact, that it is not mentioned till afterwards; and it is taken for granted that the history is written in strictly chronological order. But this supposition is precarious, and is not in harmony with the statement, that Abraham sent away the sons of the concubines with gifts during his own lifetime; for in the case supposed, the youngest of Keturah's sons would not have been more than twenty-five or thirty years old at Abraham's death; and in those days, when marriages were not generally contracted before the fortieth year, this seems too young for them to have been sent away from their father's house. This difficulty, however, is not decisive. Nor does the fact that Keturah is called a concubine in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/25-6.htm">Genesis 25:6</a>, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/1-32.htm">1 Chronicles 1:32</a>, necessarily show that she was contemporary with Sarah, but may be explained on the ground that Abraham did not place her on the same footing as Sarah, his sole wife, the mother of the promised seed. Of the sons and grandsons of Keturah, who are mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/1-32.htm">1 Chronicles 1:32</a> as well as here, a few of the names may still be found among the Arabian tribes, but in most instances the attempt to trace them is very questionable. This remark applies to the identification of Zimran with &#x396;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bc; (Ptol. vi. 7, 5), the royal city of the &#x39a;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; to the west of Mecca, on the Red Sea; of Jokshan with the &#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, on the Red Sea (Ptol. vi. 7, 6), or with the Himyaritish tribe of Jakish in Southern Arabia; of Ishbak with the name Shobek, a place in the Edomitish country first mentioned by Abulfeda; of Shuah with the tribe Syayhe to the east of Aila, or with Szyhhan in Northern Edom (Burckhardt, Syr. 692, 693, and 945), although the epithet the Shuhite, applied to Bildad, points to a place in Northern Idumaea. There is more plausibility in the comparison of Medan and Midian with &#x39c;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1; on the eastern coast of the Elanitic Gulf, and &#x39c;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;, a tract to the north of this (Ptol. vi. 7, 2, 27; called by Arabian geographers Madyan, a city five days' journey to the south of Aila). The relationship of these two tribes will explain the fact, that the Midianim, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-28.htm">Genesis 37:28</a>, are called Medanim in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/37-36.htm">Genesis 37:36</a>. </body></html>
