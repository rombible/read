Burckhardt tells us that the Bedaween still follow Abraham’s practice. When their children are grown up, they give each of the younger sons his share of their goods (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-12.htm" title="And the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me the portion of goods that falls to me. And he divided to them his living.">Luke 15:12</a>), whereupon they move to a distance, and leave the eldest brother in quiet possession of the home.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/genesis/25.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-6.htm" title="But to the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, to the east country.">Genesis 25:6</a></span>. <span class="ital">Abraham gave gifts — </span>Or portions. Abraham may be an example to us in almost every circumstance of life: we find him, with great prudence: making, in his lifetime, proper provision for his sons by his secondary wives, Hagar and Keturah, and sending them away from Isaac; whereby, in all probability, he prevented great animosities and dissensions.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>How happy would it be if all parents, in the time of health, would take care to settle, by will, the division of their goods among their children! What confusion! what quarrels! what discord! what never to be reconciled animosity among brethren, might this prevent! These <span class="ital">sons of the concubines, </span>as they are here called, were sent into the country that lay east of Canaan, and their posterity were termed <span class="ital">the children of the east, </span>famous for their number. Their great increase was the fruit of the promise made to Abraham, that God would multiply his seed.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/25.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>25:1-10 All the days, even of the best and greatest saints, are not remarkable days; some slide on silently; such were these last days of Abraham. Here is an account of Abraham's children by Keturah, and the disposition which he made of his estate. After the birth of these sons, he set his house in order, with prudence and justice. He did this while he yet lived. It is wisdom for men to do what they find to do while they live, as far as they can. Abraham lived 175 years; just one hundred years after he came to Canaan; so long he was a sojourner in a strange country. Whether our stay in this life be long or short, it matters but little, provided we leave behind us a testimony to the faithfulness and goodness of the Lord, and a good example to our families. We are told that his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him. It seems that Abraham had himself brought them together while he lived. Let us not close the history of the life of Abraham without blessing God for such a testimony of the triumph of faith.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/genesis/25.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Abraham makes Isaac his heir <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-36.htm">Genesis 24:36</a>. He gives portions to the sons of the concubines during his lifetime, and sends them away to the East. Ishmael had been portioned off long before <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/21-14.htm">Genesis 21:14</a>. The East is a general name for Arabia, which stretched away to the southeast and east of the point where Abraham resided in the south of Palestine. The northern part of Arabia, which lay due east of Palestine, was formerly more fertile and populous than now. The sons of Keturah were probably dismissed before they had any children. Their notable descendants, according to custom, are added here before they are dismissed from the main line of the narrative.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/genesis/25.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5, 6.

For though the children of Jacob’s concubines did equally partake of the inheritance with the other children, that was done by Divine appointment, and Jacob’s voluntary act, and upon special reason, because of the vast inheritance promised, and afterwards given to them, which made it no loss, but a great convenience and advantage to the children of the chief wives to have their half-brethren, the sons of the concubines, seated so near to them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Sent them away from Isaac; </span> partly, that the entire possession of that land might be reserved to the children of Isaac; and partly, lest nearness of relation joined with cohabitation or neighbourhood should beget a great familiarity between them, whereby Isaac’s seed were likely to be infected by their brethren, whose degeneration and apostacy Abraham might easily foresee from the evil inclinations of their own hearts, and God’s exclusion of them from that covenant of grace and life, which was the only effectual remedy against that powerful and universal corruption. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Eastward, unto the east country; </span> into Arabia, and other parts of Asia the Greater, which were situate eastward from the southern part of Canaan where Abraham now was, whence these people are oft called <span class="ital">the children of the east, </span> as <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-3.htm" title="And so it was, when Israel had sown, that the Midianites came up, and the Amalekites, and the children of the east, even they came up against them;">Judges 6:3</a> 7:12 <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-3.htm" title="His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east.">Job 1:3</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/genesis/25.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But unto the sons of the concubines which Abraham had,....

It is impossible to determine whether Isaac had been to the well of Hagar which called to mind the omnipresence of God, and there, in accordance with his contemplative character, had laid the question of his marriage before the Lord (Delitzsch), or whether he had merely travelled thither to look after his flocks and herds (Knobel). But the object of his going to the field to meditate, was undoubtedly to lay the question of his marriage before God in solitude. &#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;, meditari, is rendered "to pray" in the Chaldee, and by Luther and others, with substantial correctness. The caravan arrived at the time; and Rebekah, as soon as she saw the man in the field coming to meet them, sprang (&#1504;&#1508;&#1500; signifying a hasty descent, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/5-21.htm">2 Kings 5:21</a>) from the camel to receive him, according to Oriental custom, in the most respectful manner.

The servant then related to Isaac the result of his journey; and Isaac conducted the maiden, who had been brought to him by God, into the tent of Sarah his mother, and she became his wife, and he loved her, and was consoled after his mother, i.e., for his mother's death. &#1492;&#1488;&#1492;&#1500;&#1492;, with &#1492; local, in the construct state, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/20-1.htm">Genesis 20:1</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/28-2.htm">Genesis 28:2</a>, etc.; and in addition to that, with the article prefixed (cf.
