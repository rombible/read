They peopled a very large country that lay between Egypt and Assyria, called Arabia. The number and strength of this family were the fruit of the promise, made to Hagar and to Abraham, concerning Ishmael.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/genesis/25.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Nebaioth - <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-7.htm">Isaiah 60:7</a> is preserved in the Nabataei inhabiting Arabia Petraea, and extending far toward the East.

It is supposed to be &#x3a7;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;  Chatteenia (Polyb.), Attene, and to lie between Oman and Bahrein.

Descendants of Ishmael. Before passing to the line of the promised seed, the historian gives a brief notice of Ishmael, to show that the promises respecting that son of Abraham were fulfilled&#8212;first, in the greatness of his posterity (compare Ge 17:20); and, secondly, in their independence.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/genesis/25.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Dumah; </span> from him Dumah, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-11.htm" title="The burden of Dumah.

Of Mishma and Massa, and of their posterity, there is not anything said elsewhere, unless the Masani, Ptolemy (p) places near Arabia Felix, came from Massa. Dumah seems to be the same Isaiah speaks of in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/21-11.htm">Genesis 21:11</a>; and in Arabia Deserta, where some of Ishmael's posterity settled, is a place called Dumaetha, by Ptolemy (q), which perhaps had its name from this son of his. The Targum of Jonathan translates these three names,"hearing, silence, and patience;''which the Jews use as a proverb, when they would signify that there are some things to be heard and not spoken of, and to be patiently borne. If Ishmael had in view to teach such lessons by the names he gave his children, he will seem to be a better man than he is usually thought to be. <p>(p) Georaph. l. 16. p. 528. 534. 536.
