Though very rare, yet similar cases have been chronicled from time to time.<p><span class= "bld">His name was called Jacob.</span>—The name signifies <span class= "ital">one who follows at another’s heels. </span>It was Esau who first put upon it a bad meaning (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/27-36.htm" title="And he said, Is not he rightly named Jacob? for he has supplanted me these two times: he took away my birthright; and, behold, now he has taken away my blessing.

Jacob and Esau were prayed for; their parents, after being long childless, obtained them by prayer. The fulfilment of God's promise is always sure, yet it is often slow. The faith of believers is tried, their patience exercised, and mercies long waited for are more welcome when they come. Isaac and Rebekah kept in view the promise of all nations being blessed in their posterity, therefore were not only desirous of children, but anxious concerning every thing which seemed to mark their future character. In all our doubts we should inquire of the Lord by prayer. In many of our conflicts with sin and temptation, we may adopt Rebekah's words, If it be so, why am I thus? If a child of God, why so careless or carnal? If not a child of God, why so afraid of, or so burdened with sin?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/genesis/25.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The twins are born in due time.

He is called "Esau the hairy," or "the made up," the prematurely developed. His brother is like other children. An act takes place in the very birth foreshadowing their future history. The second has a hold of his brother's heel, as if he would trip him up from his very birth.

Twenty years he continued unblessed with offspring, whose seed was to be "as the stars" [Ge 26:4]. But in answer to their mutual prayers (1Pe 3:7), Rebekah was divinely informed that she was to be the mother of twins, who should be the progenitors of two independent nations; that the descendants of the younger should be the more powerful and subdue those of the other (Ro 9:12; 2Ch 21:8).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/genesis/25.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="ital">1837</span> <span class="bld">Jacob, </span> i.e. <span class="ital">supplanter, </span> or one that taketh hold of or trippeth up his brother’s heels.

The Heb. for “heel” is <span class="ital">‘âḳêb</span>, and the name “Jacob” was popularly regarded as having been derived from the same root, with the meaning of “one who seeks to trip up or supplant”; compare the use of the word; “supplant” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-4.htm" title="Take you heed every one of his neighbor, and trust you not in any brother: for every brother will utterly supplant, and every neighbor will walk with slanders.">Jeremiah 9:4</a>.

It has been supposed, for instance, that <span class="ital">Jacob</span> is really an elliptical form of <span class="ital">Jaḳob’çl</span>: in this case El, ‘God,’ would be the subject of the verb (like <span class="ital">Ishmâ’çl</span>, ‘God heareth,’ <span class="ital">Isrâ’el</span>, ‘God persisteth,’ <span class="ital">Yeraḥme’çl</span>, ‘God is compassionate’), and the word might be explained from the Arab., ‘God follows,’ or … ‘God rewards.’ In fact there is now evidence that the name is much older than the date at which, according to the Biblical narrative, Jacob must have lived. Mr Pinches has found on contract tables of the age of Khammurabi (c. 2300 b.c.) the personal name <span class="ital">Ya‘ḳub-ilu</span> (analogous to <span class="ital">Yashup-ilu, Yarbi-ilu, Yamlik-ilu, Yakbar-ilu</span>, etc., of the same age); and, according to Hommel (<span class="ital">AHT.</span> 203), the contracted form <span class="ital">Yaḳubu</span> occurs likewise. Further, in the lists of 118 places in Palestine conquered by Thothmes III (b.c. 1503–1449, Sayce and Petrie), which are inscribed on the pylons of the temple at Karnak, there occur (Nos. 78 and 102) the names <span class="ital">Y-ša-p-’a-rḁ</span> and <span class="ital">Y-‘-ḳ-b-’â-rḁ</span>. These names (the Egyp. <span class="ital">r</span> standing, as is well known, also for <span class="ital">l</span>) can be only <span class="greekheb">יספאל</span> <span class="ital">Joseph-’çl</span> and <span class="greekheb">יעקבאל</span> <span class="ital">Jaḳob-’çl</span>; and we learn consequently that places bearing these names (cf. for the form the place-names <span class="ital">Jezre’çl, Jabne’çl</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-11.htm" title="And the border went out to the side of Ekron northward: and the border was drawn to Shicron, and passed along to mount Baalah, and went out to Jabneel; and the goings out of the border were at the sea.">Joshua 15:11</a> [= <span class="ital">Jabneh</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-6.htm" title="And he went forth and warred against the Philistines, and broke down the wall of Gath, and the wall of Jabneh, and the wall of Ashdod, and built cities about Ashdod, and among the Philistines.">2 Chronicles 26:6</a>]; <span class="ital">Yiphtaḥ’çl</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-14.htm" title="And the border compasses it on the north side to Hannathon: and the outgoings thereof are in the valley of Jiphthahel:">Joshua 19:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-27.htm" title="And turns toward the sun rise to Bethdagon, and reaches to Zebulun, and to the valley of Jiphthahel toward the north side of Bethemek, and Neiel, and goes out to Cabul on the left hand,">Joshua 19:27</a>; <span class="ital">Yeḳabze’çl</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-25.htm" title="And for the villages, with their fields, some of the children of Judah dwelled at Kirjatharba, and in the villages thereof, and at Dibon, and in the villages thereof, and at Jekabzeel, and in the villages thereof,">Nehemiah 11:25</a>; <span class="ital">Yirpe’çl</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-27.htm" title="And Rekem, and Irpeel, and Taralah,">Joshua 18:27</a>) existed in Palestine, apparently in the central part, in the 15th cent. b.c. What connexion, if any, exists between these names and those of the patriarchs, may never perhaps be ascertained; but their existence at such a date in Palestine is remarkable. These facts, however, make it not improbable that (as had indeed been supposed even before their discovery) names of the type of <span class="ital">Jacob, Joseph, Jephthah</span>, etc., are elliptical forms of a more original <span class="ital">Jaḳob’çl, Joseph’çl</span>, etc. But, however that may be, to the Hebrews, as we know them, the idea which <span class="ital">Jacob</span> suggested, and in which it was supposed to have originated, was that of <span class="ital">supplanter</span>.” Driver in Art. <span class="ital">Jacob</span> in Hastings’ <span class="ital">Dict. of the Bible</span>, ii. 526.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau's heel.</span> The inf. constr, standing for the finite verb (Ewald's 'Hebrews Synt.,' 304).

The name was apparently transferred to the town itself afterwards. The history of Isaac consists of two stages: (1) the period of his active life, from his marriage and the birth of his sons till the departure of Jacob for Mesopotamia (<a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/25-20.htm">Genesis 25:20-28:9</a>); and (2) the time of his suffering endurance in the growing infirmity of age, when the events of Jacob's life form the leading feature of the still further expanded history of salvation (<a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/28-10.htm">Genesis 28:10-35:29</a>). This suffering condition, which lasted more than 40 years, reflected in a certain way the historical position which Isaac held in the patriarchal triad, as a passive rather than active link between Abraham and Jacob; and even in the active period of his life many of the events of Abraham's history were repeated in a modified form.<p>The name Jehovah prevails in the historical development of the tholedoth of Isaac, in the same manner as in that of Terah; although, on closer examination of the two, we find, first, that in this portion of Genesis the references to God are less frequent than in the earlier one; and secondly, that instead of the name Jehovah occurring more frequently than Elohim, the name Elohim predominates in this second stage of the history. The first difference arises from the fact, that the historical matter furnishes less occasion for the introduction of the name of God, just because the revelations of God are more rare, since the appearances of Jehovah to Isaac and Jacob together are not so numerous as those to Abraham alone. The second may be explained partly from the fact, that Isaac and Jacob did not perpetually stand in such close and living faith in Jehovah as Abraham, and partly also from the fact, that the previous revelations of God gave rise to other titles for the covenant God, such as "God of Abraham," "God of my father," etc., which could be used in the place of the name Jehovah (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/26-24.htm">Genesis 26:24</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/31-5.htm">Genesis 31:5</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-42.htm">Genesis 31:42</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/35-1.htm">Genesis 35:1</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/35-3.htm">Genesis 35:3</a>, and the remarks on <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-9.htm">Genesis 35:9</a>). </body></html>
