These brief notices, moreover, of personages not in the direct line of Christ’s ancestry have their value in God’s great purpose that the Jewish Messiah should be the Redeemer of the Gentiles also (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-12.htm" title="For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich to all that call on him.">Romans 10:12</a>); and consequently from the first their history was not alien from God’s counsels. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/10-13.htm" title="For whoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.">Romans 10:13-15</a>) The sons of Ishmael.—Of the Arabian tribes sprung from Ishmael we read of Nebajoth and Kedar in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-7.htm" title="All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered together to you, the rams of Nebaioth shall minister to you: they shall come up with acceptance on my altar, and I will glorify the house of my glory.">Isaiah 60:7</a> as pastoral tribes, rich in flocks. Dumah is deemed worthy of a special prophecy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-11.htm" title="The burden of Dumah. He calls to me out of Seir, Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of the night?">Isaiah 21:11</a>); while the people of Tema are described there in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-14.htm" title="And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,">Genesis 25:14</a> as generous and hospitable, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-19.htm" title="The troops of Tema looked, the companies of Sheba waited for them.">Job 6:19</a> they appear as active traders. (See also <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-23.htm" title="Dedan, and Tema, and Buz, and all that are in the utmost corners,">Jeremiah 25:23</a>.) Jetur, Naphish, and other Hagarite tribes, were conquered by Reuben and his allies (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-19.htm" title="And they made war with the Hagarites, with Jetur, and Nephish, and Nodab.">1Chronicles 5:19</a>), and Jetur became the Iturea of <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-1.htm" title="Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judaea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of Ituraea and of the region of Trachonitis, and Lysanias the tetrarch of Abilene,">Luke 3:1</a>. For the occasional references made to these and other sons of Ishmael in classical writers, the reader may consult Smith’s <span class= "ital">Dictionary of the Bible, </span>or similar works. The abode of the twelve tribes sprung from Ishmael was the northern part of Arabia, whence gradually they extended their influence, and apparently soon absorbed the Joktanites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/10-26.htm" title="And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah,">Genesis 10:26-30</a>), themselves a kindred Semitic race. These genealogies would be inexplicable if we did not remember that successive waves of people occupied these lands, and that while the old names remained, the dominant race was new. So the rapid growth of individuals into tribes (as of Midian, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-2.htm" title="And she bore him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah.">Genesis 25:2</a>) was the result of races of higher civilisation and greater energy subduing feeble and less highly-developed tribes. Hence in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-16.htm" title="These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations.">Genesis 25:16</a> the sons of Ishmael are called “princes.” We gather from this that Ishmael had gathered round him a body of men of the Semitic race, of whom large numbers were constantly on the move towards Egypt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-15.htm" title="The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.">Genesis 12:15</a>), and by their aid had established his rule in Paran, and handed it on to his sons.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/25.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>25:11-18 Ishmael had twelve sons, whose families became distinct tribes. They peopled a very large country that lay between Egypt and Assyria, called Arabia. The number and strength of this family were the fruit of the promise, made to Hagar and to Abraham, concerning Ishmael.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/genesis/25.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div> - Section XI. - Isaac<p> - LII.

Thus, Cain's history is closed before Sheth's is commenced; Japheth and Ham are before Shem; Haran and Nahor before Abram.
