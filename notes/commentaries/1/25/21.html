Jacob and Esau were prayed for; their parents, after being long childless, obtained them by prayer. The fulfilment of God's promise is always sure, yet it is often slow. The faith of believers is tried, their patience exercised, and mercies long waited for are more welcome when they come. Isaac and Rebekah kept in view the promise of all nations being blessed in their posterity, therefore were not only desirous of children, but anxious concerning every thing which seemed to mark their future character. In all our doubts we should inquire of the Lord by prayer. In many of our conflicts with sin and temptation, we may adopt Rebekah's words, If it be so, why am I thus? If a child of God, why so careless or carnal? If not a child of God, why so afraid of, or so burdened with sin?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/genesis/25.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div> - LIII.

It contains the history of the second of the three patriarchs, or rather, indeed, as the opening phrase intimates, of the generations of Isaac; that is, of his son Jacob. Isaac himself makes little figure in the sacred history. Born when his mother was ninety, and his father a hundred years of age, he is of a sedate, contemplative, and yielding disposition. Consenting to be laid on the altar as a sacrifice to God, he had the stamp of submission early and deeply impressed on his soul. His life corresponds with these antecedents. Hence, in the spiritual aspect of his character he was the man of patience, of acquiescence, of susceptibility, of obedience. His qualities were those of the son, as Abraham's were those of the father. He carried out, but did not initiate; he followed, but did not lead; he continued, but did not commence. Accordingly, the docile and patient side of the saintly character is now to be presented to our view.<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/25-19.htm">Genesis 25:19-26</a><p>The birth of Esau and Jacob. "The son of forty years." Hence, we learn that Isaac was married the third year after his mother's death, when Abraham was in his hundred and fortieth year. "Bethuel the Aramaean." As Bethuel was a descendant of Arpakshad, not of Aram, he is here designated, not by his descent, but by his adopted country Aram. By descent he was a Kasdi or Kaldee. Sarah was barren for at least thirty years; Rebekah for nineteen years. This drew forth the prayer of Isaac in regard to his wife. The heir of promise was to be a child of prayer, and accordingly when the prayer ascended the fruit of the womb was given. Rebekah had unwonted sensations connected with her pregnancy. She said to herself, "If it be so," if I have conceived seed, "why am I thus," why this strange struggle within me? In the artlessness of her faith she goes to the Lord for an explanation. We are not informed in what way she consulted God, or how he replied. The expression, "she went to inquire of the Lord," implies that there was some place of worship and communion with God by prayer. We are not to suppose that she went to Abraham, or any other prophet, if such were then at hand, when we have no intimation of this in the text. Her communication with the Lord seems to have been direct. This passage conveys to us the intimation that there was now a fixed mode and perhaps place of inquiring at the Lord. The Lord answers the mother of the promised seed. Two children are in her womb, the parents of two nations, differing in their dispositions and destinies. The one is to be stronger than the other. The order of nature is to be reversed in them; for the older will serve the younger. Their struggles in the womb are a prelude to their future history.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/genesis/25.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21. Isaac entreated the Lord for his wife&#8212;Though tried in a similar way to his father, he did not follow the same crooked policy. Twenty years he continued unblessed with offspring, whose seed was to be "as the stars" [Ge 26:4]. But in answer to their mutual prayers (1Pe 3:7), Rebekah was divinely informed that she was to be the mother of twins, who should be the progenitors of two independent nations; that the descendants of the younger should be the more powerful and subdue those of the other (Ro 9:12; 2Ch 21:8).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/genesis/25.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="ital">1838</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>He prayed, as the Hebrew word signifies, instantly or fervently, frequently and continually, for near twenty years together; for so long, it was between their marriage and the first child.

Was very earnest and constant in his supplications for her, as the word signifies, as is observed by Jarchi; or, "before his wife" (a), she being present, and joining with him in his prayers: the reason was: <p>because she was barren; which appeared by the length of time they had been married, which was near twenty years, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-26.htm">Genesis 25:26</a>. The Jewish writers (b) say, that, after twenty years, Isaac took her and went with her to Mount Moriah, to the place where he was bound, and prayed that she might conceive; putting the Lord in mind of the promise he there made of the multiplication of Abraham's seed, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/22-17.htm">Genesis 22:17</a>, <p>and the Lord was entreated of him; he granted him his request; for, though God has purposed and promised to do many things for his people, yet he will be sought unto by them to do them for them: <p>and Rebekah his wife conceived; two sons at once, as it follows. <p>(a)  "praesente uxore sua", Munster, Fagins.

Rebekah has at first no children. The Chosen People are the children of God’s gift. In each generation patience is made the test of faith.

Tobit 12:12; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-4.htm">Acts 10:4</a>. The word is commonly regarded as noting precum <span class="accented">multiplicationem</span>, <span class="accented">et vehementiam et perseverantiam</span> (Poole): cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-13.htm">Ezekiel 35:13</a> - <span class="cmt_word">the Lord</span> - <span class="accented">Jehovah</span>; not because vers. 21-23 are the composition of the Jehovist (Tuch, Bleek, Davidson, <span class="accented">et alii</span>), but because the desired son was to be the heir of promise (Hengstenberg). The less frequent occurrence of the Divine name in the Thol-doth of Isaac than in those of Terah has been explained by the fact that the historical matter of the later portion furnishes less occasion for its introduction than that of the earlier; and the predominance of the name <span class="accented">Elohim</span> over that of <span class="accented">Jehovah</span> in the second stage of the patriarchal history has been partly ascribed to the employment after Abraham's time of such like equivalent expressions as "God of Abraham" and "God of my father" (Keil) - <span class="cmt_word">for his wife,</span> - literally, <span class="accented">opposite to</span> his wife, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. beside his wife, placing himself opposite her, and conjoining his supplications with hers (Ainsworth, Bush); or, better, in behalf of his wife (<span class="accented">LXX</span>., Vulgate, Calvin, Keil, Kalisch), <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. setting her over against him as the sole object to which he had regard in his intercessions (Luther) - <span class="cmt_word">because she was barren</span>: - as Sarah had been before her (<span class="accented">vide</span> Genesis 11:80); the long-continued sterility of both having been designed to show partly that "children are the heritage of the Lord" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/127-3.htm">Psalm 127:3</a>), but chiefly that the children of the promise were to be not simply the fruit of nature, but the gift of grace <span class="cmt_word">and the Lord was entreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-10.htm">Romans 9:10</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/genesis/25.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>~~c==============================gen <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/25.htm">Genesis 25</a>:<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/1-28.htm">1 Chronicles 1:28-31</a>)<p>To show that the promises of God, which had been made to Ishmael (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/16-10.htm">Genesis 16:10</a>. and <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-20.htm">Genesis 17:20</a>), were fulfilled, a short account is given of his descendants; and according to the settled plan of Genesis, this account precedes the history of Isaac. This is evidently the intention of the list which follows of the twelve sons of Ishmael, who are given as princes of the tribes which sprang from them. Nebajoth and Kedar are mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-7.htm">Isaiah 60:7</a> as rich possessors of flocks, and, according to the current opinion which Wetzstein disputes, are the Nabataei et Cedrei of Pliny (h. n. 5, 12). The Nabataeans held possession of Arabia Petraea, with Petra as their capital, and subsequently extended toward the south and north-east, probably as far as Babylon; so that the name was afterwards transferred to all the tribes to the east of the Jordan, and in the Nabataean writings became a common name for Chaldeans (ancient Babylonians), Syrians, Canaanites, and others. The Kedarenes are mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-17.htm">Isaiah 21:17</a> as good bowmen. They dwelt in the desert between Arabia Petraea and Babylon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-11.htm">Isaiah 42:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/120-5.htm">Psalm 120:5</a>). According to Wetzstein, they are to be found in the nomad tribes of Arabia Petraea up to Harra. The name Dumah, &#x394;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1; &#x391;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b1; (Ptol. v. 19, 7, Steph.

According to Wetzstein, Dma and Tma are still two important places in Eastern Hauran, three-quarters of an hour apart. Jetur and Naphish were neighbours of the tribes of Israel to the east of the Jordan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-19.htm">1 Chronicles 5:19</a>), who made war upon them along with the Hagrites, the &#x391;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; of Ptol. and Strabo. From Jetur sprang the Ituraeans, who lived, according to Strabo, near the Trachonians in an almost inaccessible, mountainous, and cavernous country; according to Wetzstein, in the mountains of the Druses in the centre of the Hauran, possibly the forefathers of the modern Druses. The other names are not yet satisfactorily determined. For Adbeel, Mibsam, and Kedma, the Arabian legends give no corresponding names. Mishma is associated by Knobel with the &#x39c;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c2; of Ptol. vi. 7, 21, to the N.E. of Medina; Massa with the &#x39c;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769; on the N.E. of Duma; Hadad (the proper reading for Hadar, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/1-30.htm">1 Chronicles 1:30</a>, the lxx, Sam., Masor., and most MSS) with the Arabian coast land, Chathth, between Oman and Bahrein, a district renowned for its lancers (&#x3a7;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;, Polyb.; Attene, Plin.).</body></html>
