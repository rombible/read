Literally the word signifies a confused noise like the din of a populous city. Abram is to be the father of a thronging crowd of nations. And so in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-5.htm" title="Neither shall your name any more be called Abram, but your name shall be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made you.">Genesis 17:5</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/genesis/17.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-4.htm" title="As for me, behold, my covenant is with you, and you shall be a father of many nations.">Genesis 17:4</a></span>. The promise is here introduced with solemnity: <span class="ital">As for me, </span>saith the great God, <span class="ital">behold — </span>Admire, and be assured of it; <span class="ital">my covenant is with thee; and thou shalt be a father of many nations </span>— This implies, 1st, That his seed after the flesh should be very numerous, both in Isaac and in Ishmael, and in the sons of Keturah. And the event answered; for there have been, and are, more of the children of men descended from Abraham, than from any one man at an equal distance with him from Noah, the common root. 2d, That all believers in every age should be looked upon as his spiritual seed. In this sense the apostle directs us to understand this promise, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-16.htm" title="Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham; who is the father of us all,">Romans 4:16</a>. He is <span class="ital">the father of the faithful, </span>of those, in every nation, that, by faith, enter into covenant with God, and (as the Jewish writers express it) are gathered under the wings of the Divine Majesty.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/17.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>17:1-6 The covenant was to be accomplished in due time. The promised Seed was Christ, and Christians in him. And all who are of faith are blessed with faithful Abram, being partakers of the same covenant blessings. In token of this covenant his name was changed from Abram, a high father, to Abraham, the father of a multitude. All that the Christian world enjoys, it is indebted for to Abraham and his Seed.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/genesis/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>As for me. - The one party to the covenant is here made prominent, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-9.htm">Genesis 17:9</a> the other party is brought out with like emphasis. The exalted Being who has entered into it imparts a grandeur, solemnity, and excellence to the covenant. "Father of many nations." The promise of seed is here expanded and particularized. A multitude of nations and kings are to trace their descent from Abram. This is true in a literal sense. The twelve tribes of Israel and many Arab tribes, the twelve princes of Ishmael, Keturah's descendants, and the dukes of Edom sprang from him. But it is to be more magnificently realized in a spiritual sense. "Nations" is a term usually applied, not to the chosen people, but to the other great branches of the human race. This points to the original promise, that in him should all the families of the earth be blessed. "Abraham." The father of many nations is to be called by a new name, as he has come to have a new nature, and been elevated to a new dignity. The high father has become the father of the multitude of the faithful.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/genesis/17.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. my covenant is with thee&#8212;Renewed mention is made of it as the foundation of the communication that follows.

Believing that a man must die if he saw God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-19.htm">Exodus 20:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-20.htm">Exodus 33:20</a>), Hagar was astonished that she had seen God and remained alive, and called Jehovah, who had spoken to her, "God of seeing," i.e., who allows Himself to be seen, because here, on the spot where this sight was granted her, after seeing she still saw, i.e., remained alive. From this occurrence the well received the name of "well of the seeing alive," i.e., at which a man saw God and remained alive. Beer-lahai-roi: according to Ewald, &#1512;&#1488;&#1497; &#1495;&#1497; is to be regarded as a composite noun, and &#1500; as a sign of the genitive; but this explanation, in which &#1512;&#1488;&#1497; is treated as a pausal form of &#1512;&#1488;&#1497;, does not suit the form &#1512;&#1488;&#1497; with the accent upon the last syllable, which points rather to the participle &#1512;&#1488;&#1492; with the first pers. suffix. On this ground Delitzsch and others have decided in favour of the interpretation given in the Chaldee version, "Thou art a God of seeing, i.e., the all-seeing, from whose all-seeing eye the helpless and forsaken is not hidden even in the farthest corner of the desert." "Have I not even here (in the barren land of solitude) looked after Him, who saw me?" and Beer-lahai-roi, "the well of the Living One who sees me, i.e., of the omnipresent Providence." But still greater difficulties lie in the way of this view. It not only overthrows the close connection between this and the similar passages <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-31.htm">Genesis 32:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-20.htm">Exodus 33:20</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/13-22.htm">Judges 13:22</a>, where the sight of God excites a fear of death, but it renders the name, which the well received from this appearance of God, an inexplicable riddle. If Hagar called the God who appeared to her &#1512;&#1488;&#1497; &#1488;&#1500; because she looked after Him whom she saw, i.e., as we must necessarily understand the word, saw not His face, but only His back; how could it ever occur to her or to any one else, to call the well Beer-lahai-roi, "well of the Living One, who sees me," instead of Beer-el-roi? Moreover, what completely overthrows this explanation, is the fact that neither in Genesis nor anywhere in the Pentateuch is God called "the Living One;" and throughout the Old Testament it is only in contrast with the dead gods of idols of the heathen, a contrast never thought of here, that the expressions &#1495;&#1497; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; and &#1495;&#1497; &#1488;&#1500; occur, whilst &#1492;&#1495;&#1497; is never used in the Old Testament as a name of God. For these reasons we must abide by the first explanation, and change the reading &#1512;&#1488;&#1497; into &#1512;&#1488;&#1497;.<p>(Note: The objections to this change in the accentuation are entirely counterbalanced by the grammatical difficulty connected with the second explanation. If, for example, &#1512;&#1488;&#1497; is a participle with the 1st pers. suff., it should be written &#1512;&#1488;&#1504;&#1497; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-15.htm">Isaiah 29:15</a>) or &#1512;&#1488;&#1504;&#1497; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/47-10.htm">Isaiah 47:10</a>). &#1512;&#1488;&#1497; cannot mean, "who sees me," but "my seer," an expression utterly inapplicable to God, which cannot be supported by a reference to <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/7-8.htm">Job 7:8</a>, for the accentuation varies there; and the derivation of &#1512;&#1488;&#1497; from &#1512;&#1488;&#1497; "eye of the seeing," for the eye which looks after me, is apparently fully warranted by the analogous expression &#1500;&#1491;&#1492; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-21.htm">Jeremiah 13:21</a>.)<p>With regard to the well, it is still further added that it was between Kadesh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-7.htm">Genesis 14:7</a>) and Bered. Though Bered has not been discovered, Rowland believes, with good reason, that he has found the well of Hagar, which is mentioned again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-62.htm">Genesis 24:62</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/25-11.htm">Genesis 25:11</a>, in the spring Ain Kades, to the south of Beersheba, at the leading place of encampment of the caravans passing from Syria to Sinai, viz., Moyle, or Moilahi, or Muweilih (Robinson, Pal. i. p. 280), which the Arabs call Moilahi Hagar, and in the neighbourhood of which they point out a rock Beit Hagar. Bered must lie to the west of this. </body></html>
