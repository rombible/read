We may, however, well doubt whether there really was this difference between them; but our Lord confirms the View that joy was uppermost in Abraham’s heart (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-56.htm" title="Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it, and was glad.">John 8:56</a>). Still with belief there was surprise, and the feeling that what was promised was so strange as to be well-nigh incredible. One who was ready to sacrifice his only son at God’s word (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-19.htm" title="Accounting that God was able to raise him up, even from the dead; from where also he received him in a figure.">Hebrews 11:19</a>) would not be staggered by this strangeness, and yet the thought of Sarah’s bearing a child at the age of ninety might easily present itself to his mind in a ludicrous aspect. As for Sarah, there is no proof that at the time when she laughed she knew or even suspected that the three travellers were more than men. She overheard their conversation, and laughed, imagining perhaps that they did not know how old she was. Really, the idea brought out by this double laughter is that Isaac’s birth was contrary to nature.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/genesis/17.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-17.htm" title="Then Abraham fell on his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a child be born to him that is an hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?">Genesis 17:17</a></span>. <span class="ital">Then Abraham fell on his face, and laughed — </span>It was a laughter of delight, not of distrust.

The assurance of this promise was the change of Sarai's name into Sarah. Sarai signifies my princess, as if her honour were confined to one family only; Sarah signifies a princess. The more favours God confers upon us, the more low we should be in our own eyes. Abraham showed great joy; he laughed, it was a laughter of delight, not of distrust. Now it was that Abraham rejoiced to see Christ's day; now he saw it and was glad, Joh 8:56. Abraham, dreading lest Ishmael should be abandoned and forsaken of God, put up a petition on his behalf. God gives us leave in prayer to be particular in making known our requests. Whatever is our care and fear, should be spread before God in prayer. It is the duty of parents to pray for their children, and the great thing we should desire is, that they may be kept in covenant with Him, and may have grace to walk before him in uprightness. Common blessings are secured to Ishmael. Outward good things are often given to those children of godly parents who are born after the flesh, for their parents' sake. Covenant blessings are reserved for Isaac, and appropriated to him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/genesis/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>On the journey, Rachel dies at the birth of her second son. "A stretch." It was probably a few furlongs. "Fear not." The cause for encouragement was that the child was born, and that it was a son. Rachel's desire and hope expressed at the birth of Joseph were therefore, fulfilled <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/30-24.htm">Genesis 30:24</a>. "When her soul was departing." This phrase expresses not annihilation, but merely change of place. It presupposes the perpetual existence of the soul. "Ben-oni," son of my pain, is the natural expression of the departing Rachel. "Benjamin." The right hand is the seat of power. The son of the right hand is therefore, the child of power. He gave power to his father, as he was his twelfth son, and so completed the number of the holy family. "Ephrath and Beth-lehem" are names the origin of which is not recorded. "The pillar of Rachel's grave." Jacob loves the monumental stone. "Unto this day." This might have been written ten or twenty years after the event, and therefore, before Jacob left Kenaan (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-37.htm">Genesis 19:37</a>). The grave of Rachel was well known in the time of Samuel <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-2.htm">1 Samuel 10:2</a>, and the Kubbet Rahil, dome or tomb of Rachel, stands perhaps on the identical spot, about an English mile north of Bethlehem.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/genesis/17.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17.

In reverence of the divine Being, and as amazed at what was told him: <p>and laughed; not through distrust and diffidence of the promise, as Sarah did, for he staggered not at that through unbelief, but for joy at such good news; and so Onkelos renders it, "and he rejoiced", with the joy of faith; it may be our Lord refers to this in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-56.htm">John 8:56</a>; he saw Christ in the promise of Isaac, and rejoiced that he should spring from his seed: the Targums of Jonathan and Jerusalem paraphrase it, "and he wondered"; he was amazed at the grace of God that gave him such a promise, and he was astonished at the power of God that must be exerted in the fulfilment of it: and therefore it follows: <p>and said in his heart; within himself, without expressing anything as to be heard and understood by any creature; but the omniscient God knew what he said, and the language of it, whether of unbelief or not: <p>shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old? not that he was now a full an hundred years old, he was ninety nine, and going in his hundredth year; but then he would be, as he was, an hundred years old when this child was born to him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/21-5.htm">Genesis 21:5</a>. It had been no unusual thing for a child to be born to a man when an hundred, and even many hundred years old, but it was so in Abraham's time; though indeed after this we read that Abraham himself had six sons by Keturah, when, his natural strength was afresh invigorated, and his youth was renewed like the eagle's; and besides Abraham said this, not so much with respect to himself, though his age was a circumstance that served to heighten the wonder, as with respect to Sarah, and the circumstances in which she was, who was to bear this son to him: <p>and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear? and with whom it had ceased to be after the manner of women, which made it more difficult of belief how it could be. Some think that Abraham said this, as somewhat doubting of it, until he was more strongly assured by the Lord that so it would be indeed, as is expressed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-19.htm">Genesis 17:19</a>; but meeting with no reproof for what he said and did, as Sarah, it seems to show the contrary. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/genesis/17.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Then Abraham fell upon his face, and <span class="cverse3">{f}</span> laughed, and said in his heart, Shall <i>a child</i> be born unto him that is an hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?</span><p>(f) Which proceeded from a sudden joy, and not from lack of faith.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/genesis/17.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">17</span>. <span class="ital">fell upon his face</span>] See <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-3.htm" title="And Abram fell on his face: and God talked with him, saying,">Genesis 17:3</a></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">laughed</span>] The incredulous laughter of Abraham here, according to P, should be compared with that of Sarah, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-12.htm" title="Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?">Genesis 18:12</a>, according to J, as a play upon the name “Isaac” and its meaning of “laughter.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Along with the incredulity must be reckoned the joy of the assurance that the promise of a son should be fulfilled.

As the sign of the covenant, circumcision is called in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/17-13.htm">Genesis 17:13</a>, "the covenant in the flesh," so far as the nature of the covenant was manifested in the flesh. It was to be extended not only to the seed, the lineal descendants of Abraham, but to all the males in his house, even to every foreign slave not belonging to the seed of Abram, whether born in the house or acquired (i.e., bought) with money, and to the "son of eight days," i.e., the male child eight days old; with the threat that the uncircumcised should be exterminated from his people, because by neglecting circumcision he had broken the covenant with God.
