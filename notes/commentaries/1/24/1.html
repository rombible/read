To live in such families, or to have such servants, both are blessings from God which should be highly valued, and thankfully acknowledged. But no concern in life is of greater importance to ourselves, to others, or to the church of God, than marriage. It therefore ought always to be undertaken with much care and prudence, especially with reference to the will of God, and with prayer for his direction and blessing. Where good parents are not consulted and regarded, the blessing of God cannot be expected. Parents, in disposing of their children, should carefully consult the welfare of their souls, and their furtherance in the way to heaven. Observe the charge Abraham gave to a good servant, one whose conduct, faithfulness, and affection, to him and his family, he had long known. Observe also, that Abraham remembers that God had wonderfully brought him out of the land of his birth, by the call of his grace; and therefore doubts not but He will prosper his care, not to bring his son thither again. God will cause that to end in our comfort, in which we sincerely aim at his glory.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/genesis/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Abraham binds the chief servant of his house to seek a wife for his son Isaac among his kindred. The first movement in this matrimonial arrangement is on the part of the father, who does not consult his son, but the chief manager of his household affairs. Abraham is now a hundred and forty years of age, and Sarah has been three years dead. Isaac seems to have been of an easy, sedate turn of mind, and was not in circumstances to choose a partner for life such as his father would approve. The promise of a numerous offspring by the son of Sarah is before the mind of the patriarch. All these considerations impel him to look out for a suitable wife for his son, and the blessing of the Lord encourages him to proceed. The person whom Abraham intrusted with this delicate task has a threefold designation. First, he is "his servant" or minister. Secondly, he is the old man, ancient, or elder of his house. Here the term "elder" approaches its official signification. In early times age was taken into account, along with good conduct and aptitude, as the qualification for services of trust. Thirdly, he "ruled over all that he had." He was therefore a master as well as a minister. If this be Eliezer of mascus <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/15-2.htm">Genesis 15:2</a>, he was the steward of Abraham before the birth of Ishmael fifty-four Years ago. "Under my thigh." The thigh was the seat of generative power, and the region of sacramental consecration, and to put the hand under the thigh was to acknowledge and pledge obedience to him who requires the oath.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/genesis/24.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 24<p>Ge 24:1-9.

The negotiations were carried on in the most formal style, in a public assembly "of the people of the land," i.e., of natives (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/23-7.htm">Genesis 23:7</a>), in the gate of the city (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/23-10.htm">Genesis 23:10</a>). As a foreigner and sojourner, Abraham presented his request in the most courteous manner to all the citizens ("all that went in at the gate," <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/23-10.htm">Genesis 23:10</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/23-18.htm">Genesis 23:18</a>; a phrase interchangeable with "all that went out at the gate," <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/34-24.htm">Genesis 34:24</a>, and those who "go out and in," <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-19.htm">Jeremiah 17:19</a>). The citizens with the greatest readiness and respect offered "the prince of God," i.e., the man exalted by God to the rank of a prince, "the choice" (&#1502;&#1489;&#1495;&#1512;, i.e., the most select) of their graves for his use (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/23-6.htm">Genesis 23:6</a>). But Abraham asked them to request Ephron, who, to judge from the expression "his city" in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/23-10.htm">Genesis 23:10</a>, was then ruler of the city, to give him for a possession the cave of Machpelah, at the end of his field, of which he was the owner, "for full silver," i.e., for its full worth. Ephron thereupon offered to make him a present of both field and cave. This was a turn in the affair which is still customary in the East; the design, so far as it is seriously meant at all, being either to obtain a present in return which will abundantly compensate for the value of the gift, or, what is still more frequently the case, to preclude any abatement in the price to be asked. The same design is evident in the peculiar form in which Ephron stated the price, in reply to Abraham's repeated declaration that he was determined to buy the piece of land: "a piece of land of 400 shekels of silver, what is that between me and thee" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/23-15.htm">Genesis 23:15</a>)? Abraham understood it so (&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/23-16.htm">Genesis 23:16</a>), and weighed him the price demanded. The shekel of silver "current with the merchant," i.e., the shekel which passed in trade as of standard weight, was 274 Parisian grains, so that the price of the piece of land was 52, 10s.; a very considerable amount for that time. </body></html>
