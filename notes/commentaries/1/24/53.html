Quickly indeed in a country of such ceremonial politeness the purchase took a more honourable form, but Orientals do not let their courtesy interfere with their interests, and the relatives would take care that the freewill offerings did not fall below the usual standard. These went partly to the bride, and partly to her relatives: and as they are described here as going exclusively to the brother and mother, Jewish tradition has invented the story that Bethuel was ill at the time, and died on the day of the servant’s arrival. But the manner in which Isaac speaks of him in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-2.htm" title="Arise, go to Padanaram, to the house of Bethuel your mother's father; and take you a wife from there of the daughers of Laban your mother's brother.">Genesis 28:2</a> does not allow us to suppose that he was either dead at the time of her departure, or that he was a person of no ability or importance. Possibly, therefore, polygamy had led to the custom of the purchase presents going to the mother’s tent.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/24.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>24:29-53 The making up of the marriage between Isaac and Rebekah is told very particularly. We are to notice God's providence in the common events of human life, and in them to exercise prudence and other graces. Laban went to ask Abraham's servant in, but not till he saw the ear-ring, and bracelet upon his sister's hands. We know Laban's character, by his conduct afterwards, and may think that he would not have been so free to entertain him, if he had not hoped to be well rewarded for it. The servant was intent upon his business. Though he was come off a journey, and come to a good house, he would not eat till he had told his errand. The doing our work, and the fulfilling our trusts, either for God or man, should be preferred by us before our food: it was our Saviour's meat and drink, Joh 4:34. He tells them the charge his master had given him, with the reason of it. He relates what had happened at the well, to further the proposal, plainly showing the finger of God in it. Those events which to us seem the effect of choice, contrivance, or chance, are appointed out of God. This hinders not, but rather encourages the use of all proper means. They freely and cheerfully close with the proposal; and any matter is likely to be comfortable, when it proceeds from the Lord. Abraham's servant thankfully acknowledges the good success he had met with. He was a humble man, and humble men are not ashamed to own their situation in life, whatever it may be. All our temporal concerns are sweet if intermixed with godliness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/genesis/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The servant's return with Rebekah. So plain an interposition of Providence admits of no refusal on the part of those who revere the Lord. Bethuel now appears as a concurring party. Laban, as the full brother of Rebekah, has a voice in the disposal of her hand; but the father only has the power to ratify the contract. The patriarch's servant first bows in acknowledgment to the Lord, who had now manifested his approval of the choice he had made, and then proceeds to distribute costly gifts to the bride, and to her brother and mother. Now at length the thankful guest partakes of the fare set before him along with his entertainers, and after the night's repose requests to be dismissed. "A few days;" perhaps a week or ten days. The mother and brother naturally plead for a little time to prepare for parting with Rebekah. They could not expect the servant, however, to stay months.<p>"Inquire at her mouth." This is the only free choice in the matter that seems to be given to Rebekah. Her consent may have been modestly indicated, before her family ratified the contract. It is plain, however, that it was thought proper that the parents should receive and decide upon a proposal of marriage. The extent to which the maiden's inclinations would be consulted would depend very much on the custom of the country, and the intelligence and good feeling of the parents. In later times the custom became very arbitrary. Rebekah's decision shows that she concurred in the consent of her relatives. "And her nurse." Her name, we learn afterward <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/35-8.htm">Genesis 35:8</a>, was Deborah. The nurse accompanied the bride as her confidential adviser and faithful attendant, and died in her service; a beautiful trait of ancient manners. The blessing consists in a boundless offspring, and the upper hand over their enemies. These are indicative of a thin population, and a comparatively rude state of society. "And her damsels." We here learn, again, incidentally, that Rebekah had more female attendants than her nurse.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/genesis/24.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>53.

Ornaments for women, which he had brought along with him for presents, and which were a proof of the riches of his master, and of his generosity and liberality, who had furnished him with such a profusion of rich things to bestow on the person that should be got for his son's wife: <p>and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah; costly suits of clothes such as in those times were given to persons at their marriage, or in order to it; and which custom still continues among the Arabs, who, as Dr. Shaw says (p), have the marriage contract previously made between the parents, wherein is express mention made not only of the "saddock", as they call that particular sum which the bridegroom settles on the bride; but of the several changes of raiment, and the quantity of jewels, and the number of slaves that the bride is to be attended with when she first waits upon her husband; a gold and silver "sarmah", he says (q), which is a thin flexible plate of gold or silver, of a triangular shape, artfully cut through and engraven in imitation of lace; one or two sets of earrings bracelets and shekels, a gold chain to hang over their breasts, with half a dozen vests, some of brocades, others of rich silk, were usually the wedding clothes of a lady of fashion. And so in Barbary, the man buys his bride a suit of apparel, earrings, bracelets, a chest, &amp;c. and gives the father a considerable sum of money, according to the qualities and circumstances of the parties (r): <p>and he gave also to her brother, and to her mother, precious things; things of worth and value, which were part of the good things he brought with him from Abraham, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-10.htm">Genesis 24:10</a>; the word being sometimes used for fruit, Jarchi interprets it of various kinds of the fruits (s) of the land of Israel; but it is not likely that these should be carried by him on so long a journey; much better Aben Ezra understands by them honourable and costly raiment; and it is observed by some (t), that the word in general signifies everything valuable and excellent, as gold, silver, &amp;c. no mention being made of her father, only of her brother Laban, and of her mother, seems to confirm the notion of Josephus that he was dead; or however he concerned himself no further in this affair than to give his consent to the marriage, and left everything else to his wife and son to take care of, and therefore the presents are only made to them. <p>(p) Travels, p. 239.

The servant’s first act is to ratify the betrothal by making the betrothal gifts to the bride. Oriental custom required that, at the betrothal, gifts should be made to the parents or nearest representative relations of the bride. Mention of marriage gifts (<span class="ital">mohar</span>) to the bride’s family is found also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/34-12.htm" title="Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give according as you shall say to me: but give me the damsel to wife.">Genesis 34:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/22-16.htm" title="And if a man entice a maid that is not betrothed, and lie with her, he shall surely endow her to be his wife....">Exodus 22:16-17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-19.htm" title="And they shall amerce him in an hundred shekels of silver, and give them to the father of the damsel, because he has brought up an evil name on a virgin of Israel: and she shall be his wife; he may not put her away all his days.">Deuteronomy 22:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-25.htm" title="And Saul said, Thus shall you say to David, The king desires not any dowry, but an hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged of the king's enemies. But Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines.">1 Samuel 18:25</a>. The custom must be regarded as a remnant of still earlier times, when the bride was purchased, and the marriage ceremony consisted chiefly of a financial transaction. In this verse, the “precious things,” given by the servant to Rebekah’s brother and mother, constitute the customary <span class="ital">mohar</span> to the bride’s family. This custom is also mentioned in the Code of Hammurabi, §§ 159–161.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is noticeable that the “precious things” are given, not to Rebekah’s father, Bethuel, but to her brother and mother. This is an important point in favour of the view, mentioned above, that Bethuel’s name in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-50.htm" title="Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceeds from the LORD: we cannot speak to you bad or good.">Genesis 24:50</a></span> is an interpolation (see note on <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-15.htm" title="And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that, behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother, with her pitcher on her shoulder.">Genesis 24:15</a></span>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 53, 54.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the servant brought forth jewels</span> - literally, <span class="accented">vessels</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b7;</span>, <span class="accented">LXX</span>.), the idea being that of things finished or completed; from <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, <span class="cmt_word">to finish</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-37.htm">Genesis 31:37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/45-20.htm">Genesis 45:20</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">of silver, and jewels</span> (or vessels) <span class="cmt_word">of gold, and raiment</span>, - covering garments, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> the outer robes of Orientals (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/20-11.htm">Genesis 20:11, 12, 13, 15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-42.htm">Genesis 41:42</a>); especially precious ones (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-10.htm">1 Kings 22:10</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">and gave them to Rebekah</span> - as betrothal presents, which are absolutely essential, and usually given with much ceremony before witnesses (<span class="accented">vide</span> 'Land and Book,' p. 593). <span class="cmt_word">He gave also to her brother and to her mother</span> (here mentioned for the first time) precious things, <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d2;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b9;&#x5ea;</span> from <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b6;&#x5d2;&#x5b6;&#x5d3;</span> precious, occurring only elsewhere in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-3.htm">2 Chronicles 21:3</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-6.htm">Ezekiel 1:6</a>; both times as here, in connection with gold and silver - probably describes valuable articles in general. <span class="cmt_word">And</span> (having thus formally concluded the engagement) <span class="cmt_word">they did eat and drink,</span> - i.e. partook of the victims which had been set before them at an earlier stage (ver. 33) - <span class="cmt_word">he and the men that were with him, and tarried all night</span>; - literally, <span class="accented">and passed the night</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-2.htm">Genesis 19:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-25.htm">Genesis 24:25</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">and they rose up in the morning</span> (indicative of alacrity and zeal), <span class="cmt_word">and he said, Send me away unto my master</span> - being impatient to report to Abraham the success of his expedition. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/genesis/24.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>As soon as Laban her brother had seen the splendid presents and heard her account, he hurried out to the stranger at the well, to bring him to the house with his attendants and animals, and to show to him the customary hospitality of the East.
