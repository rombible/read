To live in such families, or to have such servants, both are blessings from God which should be highly valued, and thankfully acknowledged. But no concern in life is of greater importance to ourselves, to others, or to the church of God, than marriage. It therefore ought always to be undertaken with much care and prudence, especially with reference to the will of God, and with prayer for his direction and blessing. Where good parents are not consulted and regarded, the blessing of God cannot be expected. Parents, in disposing of their children, should carefully consult the welfare of their souls, and their furtherance in the way to heaven. Observe the charge Abraham gave to a good servant, one whose conduct, faithfulness, and affection, to him and his family, he had long known. Observe also, that Abraham remembers that God had wonderfully brought him out of the land of his birth, by the call of his grace; and therefore doubts not but He will prosper his care, not to bring his son thither again. God will cause that to end in our comfort, in which we sincerely aim at his glory.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/genesis/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The appeal is to God as "Yahweh, God of heaven and God of the earth." Yahweh is the personal name of God, which is properly used by those who are in fellowship with him. He is the Author of all being, and therefore of heaven and earth; and hence the arbiter of the destiny of the oath-taker, both in spiritual and material things, both in this life and in what is to come. "Not of the daughters of the Kenaanite," a race sinking fast into ungodliness and unrighteousness, doomed to extirpation, to whom the promised seed is to succeed. The kindred of Abraham were Shemites, Hebrews, and still retained some knowledge of the true God, and some reverence for him and his will. The experienced elder of Abraham's house does not wish to bind himself by an oath to what it may be impossible to fulfill. He makes the supposition of the unwillingness of the bride whom he may select, and obtains a quittance from his oath in that ease. The patriarch, however, charges him not to bring his son back to the land of his fathers, and expresses his confidence in the God of promise, that he will direct his servant to the suitable wife for his son. "His angel" <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/16-7.htm">Genesis 16:7</a>. This is the Lord in the function of an angel or messenger opening the way for the servant of Abraham. He does not make any appearance to the servant, though a superintending Providence is strikingly displayed in the whole affair. The faithful elder now understands and takes the required oath.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/genesis/24.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. thou shalt not take a wife, &c.&#8212;Among pastoral tribes the matrimonial arrangements are made by the parents, and a youth must marry, not among strangers, but in his own tribe&#8212;custom giving him a claim, which is seldom or never resisted, to the hand of his first cousin.

The expression "the field of Ephron which is at Machpelah" may be explained, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/23-9.htm">Genesis 23:9</a>, from the fact that the cave of Machpelah was at the end of the field, the field, therefore, belonged to it. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/23-19.htm">Genesis 23:19</a> the shorter form, "cave of Machpelah," occurs; and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/23-20.htm">Genesis 23:20</a> the field is distinguished from the cave. The name Machpelah is translated by the lxx as a common noun, &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd;, from &#1502;&#1499;&#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492; doubling; but it had evidently grown into a proper name, since it is sued not only of the cave, but of the adjoining field also (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-30.htm">Genesis 49:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/50-13.htm">Genesis 50:13</a>), though it undoubtedly originated in the form of the cave. The cave was before, i.e., probably to the east of, the grove of Mamre, which was in the district of Hebron. This description cannot be reconciled with the tradition, which identifies Mamre and the cave with Ramet el Khalil, where the strong foundation-walls of an ancient heathen temple (according to Rosenmller's conjecture, an Idumaean one) are still pointed out as Abraham's house, and where a very old terebinth stood in the early Christian times; for this is an hour's journey to the north of modern Hebron, and even the ancient Hebron cannot have stretched so far over the mountains which separate the modern city from Rameh, but must also, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-14.htm">Genesis 37:14</a>, have been situated in the valley (see Robinson's later Biblical Researches, pp. 365ff.). There is far greater probability in the Mohammedan tradition, that the Harem, built of colossal blocks with grooved edges, which stands on the western slope of the Beabireh mountain, in the north-western portion of the present town, contains hidden within it the cave of Machpelah with the tomb of the patriarchs (cf. Robinson, Pal. ii. 435ff.); and Rosen. is induced to look for Mamre on the eastern slope of the Rumeidi hill, near to the remarkable well Ain el Jedid. </body></html>
