But it should seem he went out to take the advantage of a silent evening, and a solitary field, for meditation and prayer. Our walks in the field are then truly pleasant, when in them we apply ourselves to meditation and prayer: we there have a free and open prospect of the heavens above us, and the earth around us, and the hosts and riches of both, by the view of which we should be led to the contemplation of the Maker and Owner of all. Merciful providences are then doubly comfortable, when they find us in the way of our duty. It is probable Isaac was now praying for good success in this affair, and meditating upon that which was proper to encourage his hope in God concerning it; and now, when he <span class="ital">sets himself, </span>as it were, <span class="ital">upon his watchtower, to see what God would answer him, </span>he <span class="ital">sees the camels coming.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/24-64.htm" title="And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she lighted off the camel....">Genesis 24:64-65</a>. </span><span class="ital">She lighted off her camel, and took a veil, </span>&c. — In token of humility, modesty, and subjection.

Lingering and loitering no way become a wise and good man who is faithful to his duty. As children ought not to marry without their parents' consent, so parents ought not to marry them without their own. Rebekah consented, not only to go, but to go at once. The goodness of Rebekah's character shows there was nothing wrong in her answer, though it be not agreeable to modern customs among us. We may hope that she had such an idea of the religion and godliness in the family she was to go to, as made her willing to forget her own people and her father's house. Her friends dismiss her with suitable attendants, and with hearty good wishes. They blessed Rebekah. When our relations are entering into a new condition, we ought by prayer to commend them to the blessing and grace of God. Isaac was well employed when he met Rebekah. He went out to take the advantage of a silent evening, and a solitary place, for meditation and prayer; those divine exercises by which we converse with God and our own hearts. Holy souls love retirement; it will do us good to be often alone, if rightly employed; and we are never less alone than when alone. Observe what an affectionate son Isaac was: it was about three years since his mother died, and yet he was not, till now, comforted. See also what an affectionate husband he was to his wife. Dutiful sons promise fair to be affectionate husbands; he that fills up his first station in life with honour, is likely to do the same in those that follow.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/genesis/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Isaac receives his bride. He had been at Beer-lahai-roi, the scene of the interview of Hagar with the angel of the Lord - a spot calculated to awaken thoughts of an overruling Providence. "To meditate." This is a characteristic of Isaac's retiring, contemplative mood. Abraham was the active, authoritative father; Isaac was the passive, submissive son. To meditate was to hold converse with his own thoughts, to ponder on the import of that never-to-be-forgotten scene when he was laid on the altar by a father's hand, and a ram caught in the thicket became his substitute, and to pour out his soul unto the God of his salvation. In this hour of his grave reflection comes his destined bride with her faithful escort upon his view. Rebekah lights off the camel. Doubtless the conversation by the way with the elder of Abraham's house had made her aware of their approach to the residence of her future husband.<p>She concludes at once that this must be he, and, alighting, asks if it be. On being informed by the servant that this is his young master, she puts on the veil, which covers the head, and hangs down gracefully both behind and before. The aged servant reports the success of his mission, and presents Rebekah. Isaac brings his cousin's daughter into the apartments formerly occupied by his mother, and accepts her as his wife. The formalities of the interview, and of her presentation to Abraham as his daughter-in-law, are all untold. "And he loved her." This is the first mention of the social affections. It comes in probably because Isaac had not before seen his bride, and now felt his heart drawn toward her, when she was presented to his view. All things were evidently done in the fear of God, as became those who were to be the progenitors of the seed of promise. We have here a description of the primeval marriage. It is a simple taking of a woman for a wife before all witnesses, and with suitable feelings and expression of reverence toward God, and of desire for his blessing. It is a pure and holy relation, reaching back into the realms of innocence, and fit to be the emblem of the humble, confiding, affectionate union between the Lord and his people. <p> - The Death of Abraham<p>1. &#1511;&#1496;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492;  qet&#803;u&#770;ra&#770;h, "Qeturah, incense."<p>2. &#1494;&#1502;&#1512;&#1503;  z&#305;&#770;mra&#772;n, "Zimran, celebrated in song." &#1497;&#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1503;  ya&#772;qsha&#772;n, "Joqshan, fowler." &#1502;&#1491;&#1503;  meda&#772;n, "Medan, judge." &#1502;&#1491;&#1497;&#1503;  m&#305;&#770;dya&#772;n, "Midian, one who measures." &#1500;&#1488;&#1489;&#1511;  y&#305;&#770;shba&#772;q, "Jishbaq, he leaves." &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;  shu&#770;ach, "Shuach, pit."<p>3. &#1500;&#1496;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501;  let&#803;u&#770;sh&#305;&#770;ym, "Letushim, hammered, sharpened." &#1500;&#1488;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;  le'um&#305;&#770;ym, "Leummim, peoples."<p>4. &#1506;&#1497;&#1508;&#1492;  &#8219;e&#770;ypa&#770;h, "'Ephah, darkness." &#1506;&#1508;&#1512;  &#8219;e&#770;per, "'Epher, dust." &#1488;&#1489;&#1497;&#1491;&#1506;  'a&#780;b&#305;&#770;yda&#772;&#8219;, "Abida', father of knowledge." &#1488;&#1500;&#1491;&#1506;&#1492;  'elda&#772;&#8219;a&#770;h, "Elda'ah, knowing?"<p>Another family is born to Abraham by Keturah, and portioned off, after which he dies and is buried.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/genesis/24.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>53.

Both the time and place were very proper for meditation: the place, "in the field": where he might view the works of nature, and be led to the Creator of them, and the praise of him, and where he might be alone, and nothing to disturb his thoughts: and the time, "at evening"; after the labour, care, and hurry of the day were over, and before repose at night, and when the air was cool and refreshing, and everything was assisting to, and served to compose the mind, and help thought and contemplation. Onkelos and Jonathan render the word "to pray", and the time and place he chose were very fit for that service; and perhaps his thoughts in prayer might be directed to, and greatly employed in desiring success to his father's servant in the business he was gone on his account, and that he might safely and speedily arrive, and if so, his prayers were quickly answered: <p>and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, the camels were coming; which his servant had took with him in his journey, and was now returning with them, and which Isaac knew full well. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/genesis/24.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And Isaac went out to <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> meditate in the field at the eventide: and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, the camels <i>were</i> coming.</span><p>(e) This was the habit of the godly fathers to meditate on God's promises, and to pray for the accomplishment of it.
