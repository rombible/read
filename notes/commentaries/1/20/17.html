Agreements to deceive generally end in shame and sorrow; and restraints from sin, though by suffering, should be thankfully acknowledged. Though the Lord rebuke, yet he will pardon and deliver his people, and he will give them favour in the sight of those with whom they sojourn; and overrule their infirmities, when they are humbled for them, so that they shall prove useful to themselves and others.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/genesis/20.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>These verses record the fact of Abraham's intercession for Abimelek, and explain in what sense he was on the point of dying (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/20-3.htm">Genesis 20:3</a>). "They bare" means that they were again rendered capable of procreating children, and in the natural course of things did so. The verb is in the masculine form, because both males and females were involved in this judicial malady. The name Yahweh is employed at the end of the chapter, because the relation of the Creator and Preserver to Sarah is there prominent. <p> - The Birth of Isaac<p>7. &#1502;&#1500;&#1500;  m&#305;&#770;le&#772;l "speak," an ancient and therefore solemn and poetical word.<p>14. &#1495;&#1502;&#1514;  che&#770;met "bottle," akin to &#1495;&#1502;&#1492;  cha&#772;ma&#770;h, "surround, enclose," and &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;  chu&#770;m "black. &#1489;&#1488;&#1512;  &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1506;  bee&#770;r-sheba&#8219;, Beer-sheba', "well of seven."<p>22. &#1508;&#1497;&#1499;&#1500;  p&#305;&#770;ykol, Pikhol, "mouth or spokesman of all."<p>23. &#1504;&#1497;&#1503;  n&#305;&#770;yn "offspring, kin;" related: "sprout, flourish." &#1504;&#1499;&#1491;  neked "progeny," perhaps "acquaintance," cognate with &#1504;&#1490;&#1491;  ngd, "be before" (the eyes) and &#1504;&#1511;&#1491;  nqd, "mark."<p>33. &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;  'e&#770;shel "grove;" &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;  aroura, Septuagint.; &#1488;&#1497;&#1500;&#1489;&#1492;  '&#305;&#770;yla&#772;ba&#770;h, "a tree," Onkelos.<p>This chapter records the birth of Isaac with other concomitant circumstances.

What a poor defense Abraham made. The statement absolved him from the charge of direct and absolute falsehood, but he had told a moral untruth because there was an intention to deceive (compare Ge 12:11-13). "Honesty is always the best policy." Abraham's life would have been as well protected without the fraud as with it: and what shame to himself, what distrust to God, what dishonor to religion might have been prevented!

Abimelech did this publicly in the presence of his servants, partly for his own justification in the sight of his dependents, and partly to put Abraham to shame. The latter had but two weak excuses: (1) that he supposed there was no fear of God at all in the land, and trembled for his life because of his wife; and (2) that when he left his father's house, he had arranged with his wife that in every foreign place she was to call herself his sister, as she really was his half-sister. On the subject of his emigration, he expressed himself indefinitely and with reserve, accommodating himself to the polytheistic standpoint of the Philistine king: "when God (or the gods, Elohim) caused me to wander," i.e., led me to commence an unsettled life in a foreign land; and saying nothing about Jehovah, and the object of his wandering as revealed by Him. </body></html>
