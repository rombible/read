Reuben, or See a son, with this thought, Now will my husband love me; Levi, or joined, expecting, Now will my husband be joined unto me. Mutual affection is both the duty and comfort of the married relation; and yoke-fellows should study to recommend themselves to each other, 1Co 7:33,34. She thankfully acknowledges the kind providence of God in hearing her. Whatever supports and comforts us under afflictions, or tends to our deliverance from them, God must be owned in it. Her fourth son she called Judah, or praise, saying, Now will I praise the Lord. This was he, of whom, as concerning the flesh, Christ came. Whatever is the matter of our rejoicing, ought to be the matter of our thanksgiving. Fresh favours should quicken us to praise God for former favours; Now will I praise the Lord more and better than I have done. All our praises must centre in Christ, both as the matter of them, and as the Mediator of them. He descended after the flesh from him whose name was Praise, and He is our praise. Is Christ formed in my heart? Now will I praise the Lord.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/genesis/29.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Leah bears four sons to Jacob. "The Lord saw." The eye of the Lord is upon the sufferer. It is remarkable that both the narrator and Leah employ the proper name of God, which makes the performance of promise a prominent feature of his character. This is appropriate in the mouth of Leah, who is the mother of the promised seed. "That Leah was hated" - less loved than Rachel. He therefore recompenses her for the lack of her husband's affections by giving her children, while Rachel was barren. "Reuben" - behold a son. "The Lord hath looked on my affliction." Leah had qualities of heart, if not of outward appearance, which commanded esteem. She had learned to acknowledge the Lord in all her ways. "Simon" - answer. She had prayed to the Lord, and this was her answer. "Levi" - union, the reconciler. Her husband could not, according to the prevailing sentiments of those days, fail to be attached to the mother of three sons. "Judah" - praised. Well may she praise the Lord; for this is the ancestor of the promised seed. It is remarkable that the wife of priority, but not of preference, is the mother of the seed in whom all nations are to be blessed. Levi the reconciler is the father of the priestly tribe. Simon is attached to Judah. Reuben retires into the background.<p>Reuben may have been born when Jacob was still only eighty-four, and consequently Judah was born when Jacob was eighty-seven. <p> - Jacob's Family and Wealth<p>6. &#1491;&#1503;  da&#772;n, Dan, "judge, lord."<p>8. &#1504;&#1508;&#1514;&#1500;&#1497;  napta&#772;l&#305;&#770;y, Naphtali, "wrestling."<p>11. &#1490;&#1491;  ga&#772;d, Gad, "overcoming, victory." &#1489;&#1490;&#1491;  ba&#772;ga&#772;d, "in victory or"  equals &#1490;&#1491; &#1489;&#1488;  ba&#772;' ga&#772;d, "victory cometh." &#1490;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;  gu&#770;d, "press down." &#1490;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;  gedu&#770;d, "troop."<p>13. &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;  'a&#780;ashe&#772;r, Asher, "prosperity, happiness."<p>18. &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1513;&#1499;&#1512;  y&#305;&#770;s&#769;a&#772;ska&#772;r, Jissakar, "reward." The second Hebrew letter (&#1513;  s) seems to have been merely a full mode of writing the word, instead of the abbreviated form &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1512;  y&#305;&#770;s&#769;a&#772;ka&#772;r.<p>20. &#1494;&#1489;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;  zebulu&#770;n, Zebulun, "dwelling." There is here a play upon the two words &#1494;&#1489;&#1491;  za&#772;bad, "to endow" and &#1494;&#1489;&#1500;  za&#772;bal, "to dwell," the latter of which, however, prevails in the name.

There is, however, an obvious allusion to the thought. "God hath taken away (&#1488;&#1505;&#1507;  'a&#772;sap) my reproach." Double references, we find, are usual in the giving of names (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-30.htm">Genesis 25:30</a>).<p>This chapter is the continuation of the former, and completes the history of Jacob in Haran. The event immediately following probably took place after Leah had borne two of her sons, though not admitted into the narrative until she had paused for a short time.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/genesis/29.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>32-35. son &#8230; his name Reuben&#8212;Names were also significant; and those which Leah gave to her sons were expressive of her varying feelings of thankfulness or joy, or allusive to circumstances in the history of the family. There was piety and wisdom in attaching a signification to names, as it tended to keep the bearer in remembrance of his duty and the claims of God.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/genesis/29.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">This time will my husband be joined unto me</span> in more sincere and fervent affection. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/genesis/29.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And she conceived again, and bare a son,....

The wedding feast generally lasted a week (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/14-12.htm">Judges 14:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/11-19.htm">Job 11:19</a>). After this week had passed, he received Rachel also: two wives in eight days. To each of these Laban gave one maid-servant to wait upon her; less, therefore, than Bethuel gave to his daughter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-61.htm">Genesis 24:61</a>). - This bigamy of Jacob must not be judged directly by the Mosaic law, which prohibits marriage with two sisters at the same time (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-18.htm">Leviticus 18:18</a>), or set down as incest (Calvin, etc.), since there was no positive law on the point in existence then. At the same time, it is not to be justified on the ground, that the blessing of God made it the means of the fulfilment of His promise, viz., the multiplication of the seed of Abraham into a great nation. Just as it had arisen from Laban's deception and Jacob's love, which regarded outward beauty alone, and therefore from sinful infirmities, so did it become in its results a true school of affliction to Jacob, in which God showed to him, by many a humiliation, that such conduct as his was quite unfitted to accomplish the divine counsels, and thus condemned the ungodliness of such a marriage, and prepared the way for the subsequent prohibition in the law. </body></html>
