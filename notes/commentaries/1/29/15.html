And he told Laban all these things.">Genesis 29:13</a>), Laban probably expected the very answer he received; nevertheless, the proposal was fair and upright. Doubtless he had seen, during Jacob’s stay of a month, that his services would be very valuable.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/genesis/29.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/29-15.htm" title="And Laban said to Jacob, Because you are my brother, should you therefore serve me for nothing? tell me, what shall your wages be?">Genesis 29:15</a></span>. <span class="ital">Because thou art my brother — </span>That is, kinsman; <span class="ital">shouldst thou therefore serve me for naught? — </span>Is that reasonable? If Jacob be so respectful as to give him his service, without demanding any consideration for it, yet Laban will not be so unjust as to take advantage either of his necessity or of his good-nature. Relations frequently look for more from each other than they ought, as if mere affinity were a sufficient reason for expecting to be served gratuitously. But the conduct of the nearest relations toward each other, as well as that of strangers, should be regulated by justice and equity. It appears by computation that Jacob was now seventy years old or upward, when he bound himself apprentice for a wife; probably Rachel was young and scarcely marriageable when Jacob came first, which might make him the more willing to stay for her till his seven years were expired.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/29-18.htm" title="And Jacob loved Rachel; and said, I will serve you seven years for Rachel your younger daughter....">Genesis 29:18-19</a>. </span><span class="ital">I will serve thee seven years for Rachel — </span>It was not the custom of those countries for fathers to give a dowry with their daughters, but to receive a considerable present from those who married them; therefore Jacob, having no riches to give, as not being the inheritor of his father’s substance, offers his service for seven years instead thereof. <span class="ital">It is better that I should give her to thee than to another — </span>His answer is ambiguous and crafty. For he does not directly grant Jacob’s desire, but only insinuates his consent to it, in such terms as hid his design, which the event showed.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/29.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>29:15-30 During the month that Jacob spent as a guest, he was not idle. Wherever we are, it is good to employ ourselves in some useful business. Laban was desirous that Jacob should continue with him. Inferior relations must not be imposed upon; it is our duty to reward them. Jacob made known to Laban the affection he had for his daughter Rachel. And having no wordly goods with which to endow her, he promises seven years' service Love makes long and hard services short and easy; hence we read of the labour of love, Heb 6:10. If we know how to value the happiness of heaven, the sufferings of this present time will be as nothing to us. An age of work will be but as a few days to those that love God, and long for Christ's appearing. Jacob, who had imposed upon his father, is imposed upon by Laban, his father-in-law, by a like deception. Herein, how unrighteous soever Laban was, the Lord was righteous: see Jud 1:7. Even the righteous, if they take a false step, are sometimes thus recompensed in the earth. And many who are not, like Jacob, in their marriage, disappointed in person, soon find themselves, as much to their grief, disappointed in the character. The choice of that relation ought to be made with good advice and thought on both sides. There is reason to believe that Laban's excuse was not true. His way of settling the matter made bad worse. Jacob was drawn into the disquiet of multiplying wives. He could not refuse Rachel, for he had espoused her; still less could he refuse Leah. As yet there was no express command against marrying more than one wife. It was in the patriarchs a sin of ignorance; but it will not justify the like practice now, when God's will is plainly made known by the Divine law, Le 18:18, and more fully since, by our Saviour, that one man and woman only must be joined together, 1Co 7:2.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/genesis/29.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Jacob serves seven years for Rachel. "What shall thy wages be?" An active, industrious man like Jacob was of great value to Laban. "Two daughters." Daughters in those countries and times were also objects of value, for which their parents were accustomed to receive considerable presents <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-53.htm">Genesis 24:53</a>. Jacob at present, however, is merely worth his labor. He has apparently nothing else to offer. As he loves Rachel, he offers to serve seven years for her, and is accepted. Isaac loved Rebekah after she was sought and won as a bride for him. Jacob loves Rachel before he makes a proposal of marriage. His attachment is pure and constant, and hence the years of his service seem but days to him. The pleasure of her society both in the business and leisure of life makes the hours pass unnoticed. It is obvious that in those early days the contact of the sexes before marriage was more unrestrained than it afterward became.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/genesis/29.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14-20. he abode a month&#8212;Among pastoral people a stranger is freely entertained for three days; on the fourth day he is expected to tell his name and errand; and if he prolongs his stay after that time, he must set his hand to work in some way, as may be agreed upon.

When Jacob thereupon told the shepherds to water the flocks and feed them again, for the day was still "great," - i.e., it wanted a long while to the evening, and was not yet time to drive them in (to the folds to rest for the night) - he certainly only wanted to get the shepherds away from the well, that he might meet with his cousin alone. But as Rachel came up in the meantime, he was so carried away by the feelings of relationship, possibly by a certain love at first sight, that he rolled the stone away from the well, watered her flock, and after kissing her, introduced himself with tears of joyous emotion as her cousin (&#1488;&#1489;&#1497;&#1492; &#1488;&#1495;&#1497;, brother, i.e., relation of her father) and Rebekah's son. What the other shepherds thought of all this, is passed over as indifferent to the purpose of the narrative, and the friendly reception of Jacob by Laban is related immediately afterwards. When Jacob had told Laban "all these things," - i.e., hardly "the cause of his journey, and the things which had happened to him in relation to the birthright" (Rosenmller), but simply the things mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/29-2.htm">Genesis 29:2-12</a> - Laban acknowledged him as his relative: "Yes, thou art my bone and my flesh" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-23.htm">Genesis 2:23</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-2.htm">Judges 9:2</a>); and thereby eo ipso ensured him an abode in his house. </body></html>
