Reuben, or See a son, with this thought, Now will my husband love me; Levi, or joined, expecting, Now will my husband be joined unto me. Mutual affection is both the duty and comfort of the married relation; and yoke-fellows should study to recommend themselves to each other, 1Co 7:33,34. She thankfully acknowledges the kind providence of God in hearing her. Whatever supports and comforts us under afflictions, or tends to our deliverance from them, God must be owned in it. Her fourth son she called Judah, or praise, saying, Now will I praise the Lord. This was he, of whom, as concerning the flesh, Christ came. Whatever is the matter of our rejoicing, ought to be the matter of our thanksgiving. Fresh favours should quicken us to praise God for former favours; Now will I praise the Lord more and better than I have done. All our praises must centre in Christ, both as the matter of them, and as the Mediator of them. He descended after the flesh from him whose name was Praise, and He is our praise. Is Christ formed in my heart? Now will I praise the Lord.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/genesis/29.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Leah bears four sons to Jacob. "The Lord saw." The eye of the Lord is upon the sufferer. It is remarkable that both the narrator and Leah employ the proper name of God, which makes the performance of promise a prominent feature of his character. This is appropriate in the mouth of Leah, who is the mother of the promised seed. "That Leah was hated" - less loved than Rachel. He therefore recompenses her for the lack of her husband's affections by giving her children, while Rachel was barren. "Reuben" - behold a son. "The Lord hath looked on my affliction." Leah had qualities of heart, if not of outward appearance, which commanded esteem. She had learned to acknowledge the Lord in all her ways. "Simon" - answer. She had prayed to the Lord, and this was her answer. "Levi" - union, the reconciler. Her husband could not, according to the prevailing sentiments of those days, fail to be attached to the mother of three sons. "Judah" - praised. Well may she praise the Lord; for this is the ancestor of the promised seed. It is remarkable that the wife of priority, but not of preference, is the mother of the seed in whom all nations are to be blessed. Levi the reconciler is the father of the priestly tribe. Simon is attached to Judah. Reuben retires into the background.<p>Reuben may have been born when Jacob was still only eighty-four, and consequently Judah was born when Jacob was eighty-seven. <p> - Jacob's Family and Wealth<p>6. &#1491;&#1503;  da&#772;n, Dan, "judge, lord."<p>8. &#1504;&#1508;&#1514;&#1500;&#1497;  napta&#772;l&#305;&#770;y, Naphtali, "wrestling."<p>11. &#1490;&#1491;  ga&#772;d, Gad, "overcoming, victory." &#1489;&#1490;&#1491;  ba&#772;ga&#772;d, "in victory or"  equals &#1490;&#1491; &#1489;&#1488;  ba&#772;' ga&#772;d, "victory cometh." &#1490;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;  gu&#770;d, "press down." &#1490;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;  gedu&#770;d, "troop."<p>13. &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;  'a&#780;ashe&#772;r, Asher, "prosperity, happiness."<p>18. &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1513;&#1499;&#1512;  y&#305;&#770;s&#769;a&#772;ska&#772;r, Jissakar, "reward." The second Hebrew letter (&#1513;  s) seems to have been merely a full mode of writing the word, instead of the abbreviated form &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1512;  y&#305;&#770;s&#769;a&#772;ka&#772;r.<p>20. &#1494;&#1489;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;  zebulu&#770;n, Zebulun, "dwelling."

There is, however, an obvious allusion to the thought. "God hath taken away (&#1488;&#1505;&#1507;  'a&#772;sap) my reproach." Double references, we find, are usual in the giving of names (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-30.htm">Genesis 25:30</a>).<p>This chapter is the continuation of the former, and completes the history of Jacob in Haran. The event immediately following probably took place after Leah had borne two of her sons, though not admitted into the narrative until she had paused for a short time.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/genesis/29.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>31.

Not properly and simply hated by Jacob, as appears by his doing the duty of an husband to her, but comparatively; she was less loved than Rachel: and there are many things to be said for it; she was not beautiful as Rachel was; she was not Jacob's choice, as she was but imposed upon him through deceit, and he was forced to marry her, or he could not have Rachel his beloved wife: but the Lord had pity on her, and that she might have a share in her husband's affections: <p>he opened her womb; or gave her conception; as Onkelos paraphrases it: <p>but Rachel was barren; bare no children as yet, and for many years after, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/30-22.htm">Genesis 30:22</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/genesis/29.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And when the LORD saw that Leah <i>was</i> hated, he <span class="cverse3">{k}</span> opened her womb: but Rachel <i>was</i> barren.</span><p>(k) This declares that often they who are despised by men are favoured by God.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/genesis/29.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">31</span>. <span class="ital">hated</span>] By this is meant that Jacob had less affection for Leah than for Rachel.

Six of the sons, viz. Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar and Zebulun, and the daughter Dinah, are the children of Leah; Gad and Asher are the sons of Zilpah, Leah’s handmaid; Dan and Naphtali are the sons of Bilhah, Rachel’s handmaid; and Joseph is the son of Rachel. These are all born to Jacob in Haran. The only son born in Canaan is Benjamin (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/35-16.htm" title="And they journeyed from Bethel; and there was but a little way to come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labor....">Genesis 35:16-19</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It has been conjectured that this account not only furnishes the popular etymology of the names of the tribes of Israel, but may also symbolize, under the terms of family life, the growth of Israelite clans into a united, though composite, people in the land of Mesopotamia, before the migration into Canaan.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The explanation of the meaning of the names is of the usual popular kind, based upon resemblances of sound. The fact that in some cases more than one etymology is given reflects the composite nature of the narrative (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/30-16.htm" title="And Jacob came out of the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him, and said, You must come in to me; for surely I have hired you with my son's mandrakes.

The fruitfulness of Leah and the sterility of Rachel were designed not so much to equalize the conditions of the sisters, the one having beauty and the other children (Lange), or to punish Jacob for his partiality (Keil), or to discourage the admiration of mere beauty (Kalisch), but to prove that "the origin of Israel was to be a work not of nature, but of grace" (Keil). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/genesis/29.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>But when Jacob complained to Laban the next morning of his deception, he pleaded the custom of the country: &#1499;&#1468;&#1503; &#1497;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1500;&#1488;, "it is not accustomed to be so in our place, to give the younger before the first-born." A perfectly worthless excuse; for if this had really been the custom in Haran as in ancient India and elsewhere, he ought to have told Jacob of it before. But to satisfy Jacob, he promised him that in a week he would give him the younger also, if he would serve him seven years longer for her. </body></html>
