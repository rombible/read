There seems at first sight to be an inconsistency between the two passages, and the Jehovist is accused of here contradicting the Elohist. For in the former place man’s inborn sinfulness is described as an aggravation of his offence, while here it is used as a reason for mercy. But it is a characteristic of the Bible that it states the two sides of every principle with abrupt simplicity, and most heresies have arisen from seizing upon one side only, and omitting the other from view. Man is one whose every imagination of the heart is only evil continually. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-19.htm" title="For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies:">Matthew 15:19</a>.) In the antediluvian world, with death indefinitely postponed, these imaginations had been unrestrained, and had therefore led to habitual and inveterate sin; and so justice at last had smitten it. But when man strives against them, and sin is the result of infirmity. then mercy heals and grace strengthens the penitent. When man, therefore, began his renewed life by hallowing it with religion, God saw therein the pledge of a struggle on his part after holiness, and the proof that the world would never again become totally corrupt. In this changed state of things human weakness was a reason only for mercy, and God gave the promise that so long as the world shall last, so total a destruction of man and his works upon it shall never again take place by the same agency.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/genesis/8.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/8-21.htm" title="And the LORD smelled a sweet smell; and the LORD said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake; for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing living, as I have done.">Genesis 8:21</a></span>. <span class="ital">God smelled a sweet savour — </span>In the Hebrew it is a <span class="ital">savour of rest: </span>that is, he accepted the person, and faith, and thank-offering of Noah, and was well pleased therewith, and with these hopeful beginnings of the new world, as men are with agreeable and fragrant smells. <span class="ital">I will not again curse the ground — </span>Hebrews <span class="ital">I will not add to curse the ground any more. </span>God had cursed the ground upon the first entrance of sin, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-17.htm" title="And to Adam he said, Because you have listened to the voice of your wife, and have eaten of the tree, of which I commanded you, saying, You shall not eat of it: cursed is the ground for your sake; in sorrow shall you eat of it all the days of your life;">Genesis 3:17</a>; when he drowned it he added to that curse: but now he determines not to add to it any more. <span class="ital">For the imagination of man’s heart is evil — </span>The original word, rendered <span class="ital">for, </span>may properly be rendered <span class="ital">although. </span>And then the meaning will be, I will not any more destroy the earth, although I have just cause so to do. But the sense given in our translation is confirmed by the <span class="ital">Septuagint, </span>and is probably the true meaning of the passage. But what a surprising reason it is for God’s resolving no more to curse the earth! It seems to be the same with the reason given for its destruction, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-5.htm" title="And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.">Genesis 6:5</a>. There is, however, this difference: there it is said, The imagination of man’s heart is evil <span class="ital">continually, </span>which implies, his actual transgressions continually cry against him. Here it is said, <span class="ital">his heart is evil from his youth, </span>or childhood: he brought it into the world with him, he was shapen and conceived in it. Therefore I will no more take this severe method; for he is rather to be pitied than punished, and it is only what might be expected from such a degenerate race.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:20-22 Noah was now gone out into a desolate world, where, one might have thought, his first care would have been to build a house for himself, but he begins with an alter for God. He begins well, that begins with God. Though Noah's stock of cattle was small, and that saved at great care and pains, yet he did not grudge to serve God out of it. Serving God with our little is the way to make it more; we must never think that is wasted with which God is honoured. The first thing done in the new world was an act of worship. We are now to express our thankfulness, not by burnt-offerings, but by praise, and pious devotions and conversation. God was well pleased with what was done. But the burning flesh could no more please God, than the blood of bulls and goats, except as typical of the sacrifice of Christ, and expressing Noah's humble faith and devotedness to God. The flood washed away the race of wicked men, but it did not remove sin from man's nature, who being conceived and born in sin, thinks, devises, and loves wickedness, even from his youth, and that as much since the flood as before. But God graciously declared he never would drown the world again. While the earth remains, and man upon it, there shall be summer and winter. It is plain that this earth is not to remain always. It, and all the works in it, must shortly be burned up; and we look for new heavens and a new earth, when all these things shall be dissolved. But as long as it does remain, God's providence will cause the course of times and seasons to go on, and makes each to know its place. And on this word we depend, that thus it shall be. We see God's promises to the creatures made good, and may infer that his promises to all believers shall be so.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/genesis/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The effect of this plea is here described. The Lord smelled the sweet savor. He accepted the typical substitute, and, on account of the sacrifice, the offerers, the surviving ancestors of the post-diluvian race. Thus, the re-entrance of the remnant of mankind upon the joys and tasks of life is inaugurated by an articulate confession of sin, a well-understood foreshadowing of the coming victim for human guilt, and a gracious acceptance of this act of faith. "The Lord said in his heart." It is the inward resolve of his will. The purpose of mercy is then expressed in a definite form, suited to the present circumstances of the delivered family. "I will not again curse the soil any more on account of man." This seems at first sight to imply a mitigation of the hardship and toil which man was to experience in cultivating the ground <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-17.htm">Genesis 3:17</a>. At all events, this very toil is turned into a blessing to him who returns from his sin and guilt, to accept the mercy, and live to the glory of his Maker and Saviour. But the main reference of the passage is doubtless to the curse of a deluge such as what was now past. This will not be renewed. "Because the imagination of his heart is evil from his youth." This is the reason for the past judgment, the curse upon the soil: not for the present promise of a respite for the future. Accordingly, it is to be taken in close connection with the cursing of the soil, of which it assigns the judicial cause. It is explanatory of the preceding phrase, on account of man. The reason for the promise of escape from the fear of a deluge for the future is the sacrifice of Noah, the priest and representative of the race, with which the Lord is well pleased. The closing sentence of this verse is a reiteration in a more explicit form of the same promise. "Neither will I again smite all living as I have done." There will be no repetition of the deluge that had just overswept the land and destroyed the inhabitants.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/genesis/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21.

Some interpret the phrase, "for man's sake", for the man Christ's sake, for the sake of his sacrifice, of which Noah's was a type, and the sense be, that God would no more curse the earth; for by his sacrifice the curse of the law is removed, with respect to his people; they are redeemed from it, and shall inherit that new earth, of which this earth, renewed after the flood, was a type, in which there will be no more curse, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-1.htm">Revelation 21:1</a> which sense, though evangelical, cannot be admitted, because of the reason following, unless the first word be rendered "though", as it may: <p>for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth; his nature is depraved, his heart is corrupt, the thoughts of it evil, yea, the imagination of it, and of them, is sinful, and that originally, even from his birth; from the time he is shook out of his mother's womb, as Jarchi interprets the phrase: man is conceived in sin, and shapen in iniquity, and is a transgressor from the womb, and so a child of wrath, and deserving of the curse of the law upon himself, and all that belong to him; and yet this is given as a reason why God will not any more curse the ground for his sake: that which was a reason for destroying the earth, is now one against it, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-5.htm">Genesis 6:5</a> which may be reconciled thus, God for this reason destroyed the earth once, for an example, and to display his justice; but such is his clemency and mercy, that he will do it no more to the end of the world; considering that man has brought himself into such a condition, that he cannot but sin, it is natural to him from his birth; his nature is tainted with it, his heart is full of it, and all his thoughts and imaginations are wicked and sinful, from whence continually flow a train of actual sins and transgressions; so that if God was to curse and drown the world as often as man sins, he must be continually doing it; for the words may be rendered, "though the imagination of man's heart is evil", &amp;c. (h); yet I will not do it; and so they are expressive of the super abounding grace of God over abounding sin: <p>neither will I again smite any more everything living, as I have done; this hinders not but that there might be, as has been since, partial calamities, or particular judgments on individual persons, towns, and cities, as those of Sodom and Gomorrah, or partial inundations, but not a general deluge, or an universal destruction of the world and creatures in it, at least not by water, as has been, but by fire, as will be; for that the earth will have an end, at least as to its present nature, form, and use, may be concluded from the following words. <p>(e)  "odorem quietis", Pagninus, Montanus, Munster, &amp;c.

Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-9.htm" title="But his inwards and his legs shall he wash in water: and the priest shall burn all on the altar, to be a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet smell to the LORD.">Leviticus 1:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-13.htm" title="But he shall wash the inwards and the legs with water: and the priest shall bring it all, and burn it on the altar: it is a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet smell to the LORD.">Leviticus 1:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-17.htm" title="And he shall split it with the wings thereof, but shall not divide it asunder: and the priest shall burn it on the altar, on the wood that is on the fire: it is a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet smell to the LORD.">Leviticus 1:17</a>. Literally, it meant “the smell of complacence” or “satisfaction,” with the idea of restfulness and calm produced. “Sweet savour” is, therefore, somewhat of a paraphrase based on the LXX <span class="greekheb">ὀσμὴ εὐωδίας</span>, Lat. <span class="ital">odor suavitatis</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The technical term is employed to express that the offering is acceptable to God. The heart of the offerer is acceptable (the converse of <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-5.htm" title="But to Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.">Genesis 4:5</a>). See the use made of the phrase “sweet savour” by St Paul in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/2-15.htm" title="For we are to God a sweet smell of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish:...">2 Corinthians 2:15-16</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Babylonian version describes how “the gods smelt the goodly savour of the sacrifice, and swarmed like flies over the sacrifice.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in his heart</span>] Lit. “to his heart” = “to himself,” an anthropomorphism similar to that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-6.htm" title="And it repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.">Genesis 6:6</a>.

The difference of the two renderings is obvious: (<span class="ital">a</span>) that of the text gives the reason for which God’s curse had been inflicted upon the ground, i.e. man’s sinfulness: (<span class="ital">b</span>) that of the margin gives the reason why God will not <span class="ital">again</span> curse the ground, i.e. man is essentially sinful; he must not be expected to be otherwise. Perhaps the rendering of the margin which emphasizes the element of mercy is in better harmony with the context. The sentence already pronounced upon the earth in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-17.htm" title="And to Adam he said, Because you have listened to the voice of your wife, and have eaten of the tree, of which I commanded you, saying, You shall not eat of it: cursed is the ground for your sake; in sorrow shall you eat of it all the days of your life;">Genesis 3:17</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/4-11.htm" title="And now are you cursed from the earth, which has opened her mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand;...">Genesis 4:11-12</a>) had rendered life arduous and distressing.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the imagination of man’s heart</span>] Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-5.htm" title="And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.">Genesis 6:5</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord</span> (Jehovah) <span class="cmt_word">smelled</span>  - as is done by drawing the air in and out through the nostrils; from the root <span class="accented">ruach, to</span> breathe; high., to smell - <span class="cmt_word">a sweet savor</span>. <span class="accented">Reach hannichoach</span> literally, an odor of satisfaction, acquiescence, or rest; from <span class="accented">nuach</span>, to rest, with an allusion to Noah's name (vide <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/5-29.htm">Genesis 5:29</a>); <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c9;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> (LXX.); (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-12.htm">Leviticus 2:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-31.htm">Leviticus 26:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/15-3.htm">Numbers 15:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-13.htm">Ezekiel 6:13</a>).

Some endeavor to remove the incongruity by translating <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> as <span class="accented">although</span> (Bush, Inglis), but "there are few (if any) places were <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> can be rendered <span class="accented">although"</span> (T. Lewis). Others connect it with "<span class="accented">for</span> man's sake," as explanatory not of the promise, but of the past judgment (Murphy), or as stating that any future cursing of the ground would not be for man's sake (Jacobus). The true solution of the difficulty appears to lie in the clause "from his youth," as if God meant to say that whereas formerly he had visited man with judicial extermination on account of his absolute moral corruption, he would now have regard to the circumstance that man inherited his depravity through his birth, and, instead of smiting man with punitive destruction, would visit him with compassionate forbearance (Keil, 'Speaker's Commentary'). Tayler Lewis regards the expression as strongly anthropopathic, like <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-6.htm">Genesis 6:6</a>, and indicative of the Divine regret at so calamitous an act as the Deluge, although that act was absolutely just and necessary. <span class="cmt_word">Neither will I again smite any more every living thing, as I have done.</span> There should be no more deluge, but - <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/genesis/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The first thing which Noah did, was to build an altar for burnt sacrifice, to thank the Lord for gracious protection, and pray for His mercy in time to come. This altar - &#1502;&#1494;&#1489;&#1468;&#1495;, lit., a place for the offering of slain animals, from &#1494;&#1489;&#1495;, like &#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; from &#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; - is the first altar mentioned in history. The sons of Adam had built no altar for their offerings, because God was still present on the earth in paradise, so that they could turn their offerings and hearts towards that abode. But with the flood God had swept paradise away, withdrawn the place of His presence, and set up His throne in heaven, from which He would henceforth reveal Himself to man (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/9-5.htm">Genesis 9:5</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-7.htm">Genesis 9:7</a>). In future, therefore, the hearts of the pious had to be turned towards heaven, and their offerings and prayers needed to ascend on high if they were to reach the throne of God. To give this direction to their offerings, heights or elevated places were erected, from which they ascended towards heaven in fire. From this the offerings received the name of &#1506;&#1500;&#1514; from &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492;, the ascending, not so much because the sacrificial animals ascended or were raised upon the altar, as because they rose from the altar to haven (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-40.htm">Judges 20:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-15.htm">Jeremiah 48:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/4-10.htm">Amos 4:10</a>). Noah took his offerings from every clean beast and every clean fowl - from those animals, therefore, which were destined for man's food; probably the seventh of every kind, which he had taken into the ark. "And Jehovah smelled the smell of satisfaction," i.e., He graciously accepted the feelings of the offerer which rose to Him in the odour of the sacrificial flame. In the sacrificial flame the essence of the animal was resolved into vapour; so that when man presented a sacrifice in his own stead, his inmost being, his spirit, and his heart ascended to God in the vapour, and the sacrifice brought the feeling of his heart before God. This feeling of gratitude for gracious protection, and of desire for further communications of grace, was well-pleasing to God. He "said to His heart' (to, or in Himself; i.e., He resolved), "I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake, because the image (i.e., the thought and desire) of man's heart is evil from his youth up (i.e., from the very time when he begins to act with consciousness)." This hardly seems an appropriate reason. As Luther says: "Hic inconstantiae videtur Deus accusari posse. Supra puniturus hominem causam consilii dicit, quia figmentum cordis humani malum est. Hic promissurus homini gratiam, quod posthac tali ira uti nolit, eandem causam allegat." Both Luther and Calvin express the same thought, though without really solving the apparent discrepancy. It was not because the thoughts and desires of the human heart are evil that God would not smite any more every living thing, that is to say, would not exterminate it judicially; but because they are evil from his youth up, because evil is innate in man, and for that reason he needs the forbearance of God; and also (and here lies the principal motive for the divine resolution) because in the offering of the righteous Noah, not only were thanks presented for past protection, and entreaty for further care, but the desire of man was expressed, to remain in fellowship with God, and to procure the divine favour. "All the days of the earth;" i.e., so long as the earth shall continue, the regular alternation of day and night and of the seasons of the year, so indispensable to the continuance of the human race, would never be interrupted again. </body></html>
