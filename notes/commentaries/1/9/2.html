On him we depend, to him we should be thankful. Let us not forget the advantage and pleasure we have from the labour of beasts, and which their flesh affords. Nor ought we to be less thankful for the security we enjoy from the savage and hurtful beasts, through the fear of man which God has fixed deep in them. We see the fulfilment of this promise every day, and on every side. This grant of the animals for food fully warrants the use of them, but not the abuse of them by gluttony, still less by cruelty. We ought not to pain them needlessly whilst they live, nor when we take away their lives.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/genesis/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div> - The Blessing of Noah<p>2. &#1502;&#1493;&#1512;&#1488;  mo&#770;ra&#772;', "fear, reverence, awful deed." &#1495;&#1514;  chat, "dread, breaking of the courage."<p>Noah is saved from the deluge. His life is twice given to him by God. He had found grace in the sight of the Lord, and now he and his family have been graciously accepted when they approached the Lord with burnt-offerings. In him, therefore, the race of man is to be begun anew. Accordingly, as at the beginning, the Lord proceeds to bless him. First. The grant of increase is the same as at first, but expressed in ampler terms. Second. Dominion over the other animals is renewed. But some reluctance on their part to yield obedience is intimated. "The fear and dread of you." These terms give token of a master whose power is dreaded, rather than of a superior whose friendly protection is sought. "Into your hand are they given." They are placed entirely at the disposal of man.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/genesis/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2.

This is a renewal, at least in part, of the grant of dominion to Adam over all the creatures; these obeyed him cheerfully, and from love, but sinning, he in a good measure lost his power over them, they rebelled against him; but now though the charter of power over them is renewed, they do not serve man freely, but are in dread of him, and flee from him; some are more easily brought into subjection to him, and even the fiercest and wildest of them may be tamed by him; and this power over them was the more easily retrieved in all probability by Noah and his sons, from the inhabitation of the creatures with them for so long a time in the ark: <p>and upon every fowl of the air, and upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; as appears by fowls flying away, by beasts and creeping things getting off as fast as they can, and by fishes swimming away at the sight of men: <p>into your hand are they delivered; as the lords and proprietors of them, for their use and service, and particularly for what follows, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/8-6.htm">Psalm 8:6</a> where there is an enumeration of the creatures subject to men. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/genesis/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And the <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth <i>upon</i> the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered.</span><p>(b) By the virtue of this commandment, beasts do not rage as much against man as they would, yea and many serve his purposes by it.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/genesis/9.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">2</span>. <span class="ital">the fear of you and the dread of you</span>] This is a new feature in God’s ordering of the world.

Now, however, a new stage is reached. Man hereafter is invested with the right to take the life of animals for food. The animals, therefore, are in a new measure placed at the mercy of man; and “the fear and the dread” of him are associated with man’s fresh prerogatives.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">teemeth</span>] R.V. marg. <span class="ital">creepeth</span>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/1-29.htm" title="And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is on the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat....">Genesis 1:29-30</a> (P).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">into your hand … delivered</span>] i.e. placed at the mercy of you who now have absolute power.

In the words by which the first blessing was transferred to Noah and his sons (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-2.htm">Genesis 9:2</a>), the supremacy granted to man over the animal world was expressed still more forcibly than in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-26.htm">Genesis 1:26</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>; because, inasmuch as sin with its consequences had loosened the bond of voluntary subjection on the part of the animals to the will of man-man, on the one hand, having lost the power of the spirit over nature, and nature, on the other hand, having become estranged from man, or rather having rebelled against him, through the curse pronounced upon the earth-henceforth it was only by force that he could rule over it, by that "fear and dread" which God instilled into the animal creation. Whilst the animals were thus placed in the hand (power) of man, permission was also given to him to slaughter them for food, the eating of the blood being the only thing forbidden. </body></html>
