This signified the shutting out of him, and all his guilty race, from that communion with God, which was the bliss and glory of paradise. But man was only sent to till the ground out of which he was taken. He was sent to a place of toil, not to a place of torment. Our first parents were shut out from the privileges of their state of innocency, yet they were not left to despair. The way to the tree of life was shut. It was henceforward in vain for him and his to expect righteousness, life, and happiness, by the covenant of works; for the command of that covenant being broken, the curse of it is in full force: we are all undone, if we are judged by that covenant. God revealed this to Adam, not to drive him to despair, but to quicken him to look for life and happiness in the promised Seed, by whom a new and living way into the holiest is laid open for us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/genesis/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In consequence of man's disobedience the tree of life is withdrawn from the reach of man as a forfeited boon, and the dissolution of the present life allowed to take place according to the laws of nature, still remaining in force in regard to other animated beings; aided, indeed, and accelerated in their operation, by the sinful abuse of human passions. And thus the expression, "in the day thou eatest thereof thou shalt die," receives its simple application. It is a conditional sentence, pronounced antecedently as a warning to the responsible party. On the very day of transgression it becomes legally valid against him, and the first step toward its regular execution in the ordinary course of things is taken. This step is his exclusion from the tree of life. This is effected by sending man out of the garden into the common, to until the soil whence he was taken.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/genesis/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22.

In the Apocalypse they are depicted as standing in the immediate neighborhood of the throne trey. 4:6; 5:6; 7:11), and as taking part in the acts of adoration and praise m which the heavenly hosts engage (<span class="accented">ibid</span>. 5:11), and that on the express ground of their redemption (<span class="accented">ibid</span>. 5:8, 9). Whence the opinion that most exactly answers all the facts of the case is, that these mysterious creatures were <span class="accented">symbolic</span> not of the fullness of the Deity (Bahr), nor of the sum of earthly life (Hengstenberg), nor of the angelic nature (Calvin), nor of the Divine manhood of Jesus Christ (Wordsworth), but <span class="accented">of redeemed and glorified humanity</span> (Jamieson, Fairbairn, Macdonald, Candlish). Combining with the intelligence of human nature the highest qualities of the animal world, as exhibited in the lion, the ox, and the eagle, they were emblematic of creature life in its most absolutely perfect form. As such they were caused to dwell at the gate of Eden to intimate that only when perfected and purified could fallen human nature return to paradise.

The words of Jehovah, "The man is become as one of Us, to know good and evil," contain no irony, as though man had exalted himself to a position of autonomy resembling that of God; for "irony at the expense of a wretched tempted soul might well befit Satan, but not the Lord." Likeness to God is predicated only with regard to the knowledge of good and evil, in which the man really had become like God. In order that, after the germ of death had penetrated into his nature along with sin, he might not "take also of the tree of life, and eat and live for ever (&#1495;&#1497; contracted from &#1495;&#1497;&#1497;  equals  &#1495;&#1497;&#1492;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/5-5.htm">Genesis 5:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-31.htm">1 Samuel 20:31</a>), God sent him forth from the garden of Eden." With &#1493;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1495;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; (sent him forth) the narrative passes over from the words to the actions of God. From the &#1490;&#1468;&#1501; (also) it follows that the man had not yet eaten of the tree of life. Had he continued in fellowship with God by obedience to the command of God, he might have eaten of it, for he was created for eternal life. But after he had fallen through sin into the power of death, the fruit which produced immortality could only do him harm. For immortality in a state of sin is not the &#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, which God designed for man, but endless misery, which the Scriptures call "the second death" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-11.htm">Revelation 2:11</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/20-6.htm">Revelation 20:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-14.htm">Revelation 20:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-8.htm">Revelation 21:8</a>). The expulsion from paradise, therefore, was a punishment inflicted for man's good, intended, while exposing him to temporal death, to preserve him from eternal death. To keep the approach to the tree of life, "God caused cherubim to dwell (to encamp) at the east (on the eastern side) of the garden, and the (i.e., with the) flame of the sword turning to and fro" (&#1502;&#1514;&#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1499;&#1514;, moving rapidly). The word &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489; cherub has no suitable etymology in the Semitic, but is unquestionably derived from the same root as the Greek &#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c8; or &#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c2;, and has been handed down from the forefathers of our race, though the primary meaning can no longer be discovered. The Cherubim, however, are creatures of a higher world, which are represented as surrounding the throne of God, both in the visions of Ezekiel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-22.htm">Ezekiel 1:22</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-1.htm">Genesis 10:1</a>) and the Revelation of John (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-6.htm">John 4:6</a>); not, however, as throne-bearers or throne-holders, or as forming the chariot of the throne, but as occupying the highest place as living beings (&#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;, &#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837;&#x3b1;) in the realm of spirits, standing by the side of God as the heavenly King when He comes to judgment, and proclaiming the majesty of the Judge of the world. In this character God stationed them on the eastern side of paradise, not "to inhabit the garden as the temporary representatives of man," but "to keep the way of the tree of life," i.e., to render it impossible for man to return to paradise, and eat of the tree of life. Hence there appeared by their side the flame of a sword, apparently in constant motion, cutting hither and thither, representing the devouring fire of the divine wrath, and showing the cherubim to be ministers of judgment. With the expulsion of man from the garden of Eden, paradise itself vanished from the earth. God did not withdraw from the tree of life its supernatural power, nor did He destroy the garden before their eyes, but simply prevented their return, to show that it should be preserved until the time of the end, when sin should be rooted out by the judgment, and death abolished by the Conqueror of the serpent (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-26.htm">1 Corinthians 15:26</a>), and when upon the new earth the tree of life should flourish again in the heavenly Jerusalem, and bear fruit for the redeemed (<a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/20-1.htm">Revelation 20:1-15</a> and 21). </body></html>
