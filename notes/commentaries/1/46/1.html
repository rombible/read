He would call up to mind the boding prophecy in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-13.htm" title="And he said to Abram, Know of a surety that your seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;">Genesis 15:13</a>, that the descendants of Abraham were to be reduced to slavery, and suffer affliction in a foreign land for four hundred years. It might even be a sin, involving the loss of the Abrahamic covenant, to quit the land of Canaan, which Abraham had expressly forbidden Isaac to abandon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-8.htm" title="And if the woman will not be willing to follow you, then you shall be clear from this my oath: only bring not my son thither again.">Genesis 24:8</a>). Isaac, too, when going into Egypt, had been commanded to remain in Palestine (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/26-2.htm" title="And the LORD appeared to him, and said, Go not down into Egypt; dwell in the land which I shall tell you of:">Genesis 26:2</a>). Jacob therefore determines solemnly to consult God before finally taking so important a step, and no place could be more suitable than Beersheba, as both Abraham and Isaac had built altars there for Jehovah’s worship (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/21-33.htm" title="And Abraham planted a grove in Beersheba, and called there on the name of the LORD, the everlasting God.">Genesis 21:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/26-25.htm" title="And he built an altar there, and called on the name of the LORD, and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac's servants dig a well.">Genesis 26:25</a>), and, moreover, it lay upon the route from Hebron to Egypt.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/genesis/46.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/46-1.htm" title="And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to Beersheba, and offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac.">Genesis 46:1</a></span>. <span class="ital">Israel came to Beer-sheba — </span>Which place he chose in remembrance of the communion which his father and grandfather had had with God in that place. <span class="ital">And offered sacrifices — </span>That is, extraordinary sacrifices, besides those he was wont to offer at stated times; and this he did, as well to express his gratitude for the preservation of Joseph’s life, and the many other blessings which he had received, as by way of supplication to God for his direction in this important affair, whether he might leave the promised land of Canaan, and remove into the idolatrous country of Egypt; and if so, for the divine protection and blessing to be vouchsafed toward himself and family, both in his journey and in Egypt.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Unto the God of his father Isaac — </span>Whom Isaac had honoured and served, and who had constantly provided for and confirmed his covenant with him.

Attending on his ordinances, and receiving the pledges of his covenant love, we expect his presence, and that peace which it confers. In all removals we should be reminded of our removal out of this world. Nothing can encourage us to fear no evil when passing through the valley of the shadow of death, but the presence of Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/genesis/46.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Jacob arriving at Beer-sheba is encouraged by a revelation from God. Beer-sheba may be regarded as the fourth scene of Abraham's abode in the land of promise. "Offered sacrifices." He had gathered from the words of the Lord to Abraham <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/15-13.htm">Genesis 15:13</a>, and the way in which the dreams of Joseph were realized in the events of Providence, that his family were to descend into Egypt. He felt therefore, that in taking this step he was obeying the will of Heaven. Hence, he approaches God in sacrifices at an old abode of Abraham and Isaac, before he crosses the border to pass into Egypt. On this solemn occasion God appears to him in the visions of the night. He designates himself EL the Mighty, and the God of his father. The former name cheers him with the thought of an all-sufficient Protector. The latter identifies the speaker with the God of his father, and therefore, with the God of eternity, of creation, and of covenant. "Fear not to go down into Mizraim." This implies both that it was the will of God that he should go down to Egypt, and that he would be protected there. "A great nation."<p>Jacob had now a numerous family, of whom no longer one was selected, but all were included in the chosen seed. He had received the special blessing and injunction to be fruitful and multiply <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-3.htm">Genesis 28:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-11.htm">Genesis 35:11</a>. The chosen family is to be the beginning of the chosen nation. "I will go down with thee." The "I" is here emphatic, as it is also in the assurance that he will bring him up in the fullness of time from Egypt. If Israel in the process of growth from a family to a nation had remained among the Kenaanites, he would have been amalgamated with the nation by intermarriage, and conformed to its vices. By his removal to Egypt he is kept apart from the demoralizing influence of a nation, whose iniquity became so great as to demand a judicial extirpation <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-16.htm">Genesis 15:16</a>. He is also kept from sinking into an Egyptian by the fact that a shepherd, as he was, is an abomination to Egypt; by his location in the comparatively high land of Goshen, which is a border land, not naturally, but only politically, belonging to Egypt; and by the reduction of his race to a body of serfs, with whom that nation would not condescend to intermingle. "Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes." His long-lost son shall be present to perform the last offices to him when deceased.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/genesis/46.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 46<p>Ge 46:1-4. Sacrifice at Beer-sheba.<p>1. Israel took his journey with all that he had&#8212;that is, his household; for in compliance with Pharaoh's recommendation, he left his heavy furniture behind. In contemplating a step so important as that of leaving Canaan, which at his time of life he might never revisit, so pious a patriarch would ask the guidance and counsel of God. With all his anxiety to see Joseph, he would rather have died in Canaan without that highest of earthly gratifications than leave it without the consciousness of carrying the divine blessing along with him.<p>came to Beer-sheba&#8212;That place, which was in his direct route to Egypt, had been a favorite encampment of Abraham (Ge 21:33) and Isaac (Ge 26:25), and was memorable for their experience of the divine goodness; and Jacob seems to have deferred his public devotions till he had reached a spot so consecrated by covenant to his own God and the God of his fathers.Jacob sets out towards Egypt with his family and substance; offers saerifices at Beer-sheba; God appears to him in a vision, renewing his promises and blessing, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/46-1.htm" title="And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to Beersheba, and offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac....">Genesis 46:1-4</a></span>.

This is said to be sixteen miles from Hebron (n), where Jacob dwelt, and according to Musculus was six German miles from it: <p>and offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac; which were attended with prayer and praise; with praise for hearing that his son Joseph was alive, and with prayer that he might have a good, safe, and prosperous journey. <p>(n) Bunting's Travels, p. 72. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/genesis/46.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to Beersheba, and <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> offered sacrifices unto the God of his father Isaac.</span><p>(a) By this he signified both that he worshipped the true God, and that he kept in his heart the possession of that land from which need drove him at that time.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/genesis/46.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div>1–5.

And Jacob swore by the fear of his father Isaac.">Genesis 31:53</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is natural that Jacob would not leave his home without sacrificing to his God. He offers sacrifices at Beer-sheba, with which sanctuary Isaac had been especially connected; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/26-23.htm" title="And he went up from there to Beersheba....">Genesis 26:23-25</a>. Either, therefore, according to E, Jacob resided at Beer-sheba, or he had left his home at Hebron (J) and was now on his way south, seeking at Beer-sheba to obtain Divine approval for the descent into Egypt. Isaac had been forbidden to go down into Egypt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/26-2.htm" title="And the LORD appeared to him, and said, Go not down into Egypt; dwell in the land which I shall tell you of:">Genesis 26:2</a>). Other reasons have been suggested, e.g. thanksgiving for the life of Joseph, and fear of Joseph’s anger against his brethren; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/50-15.htm" title="And when Joseph's brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, Joseph will peradventure hate us, and will certainly requite us all the evil which we did to him.">Genesis 50:15</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/46.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Israel</span> (as the head of the theocratic family) <span class="cmt_word">took his journey</span> - <span class="accented">literally, broke up</span>, sc. his encampment (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-9.htm">Genesis 12:9</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">with all that he had, and came</span> - from Hebron (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/37-14.htm">Genesis 37:14</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">to Beersheba,</span>  - where Abraham (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/21-33.htm">Genesis 21:33</a>) and Isaac (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/26-25.htm">Genesis 26:25</a>) had both sojourned for considerable periods, and erected altars to Jehovah - <span class="cmt_word">and offered sacrifices unto the God</span> (the Elohim) <span class="cmt_word">of his father Isaac</span>. Probably giving thanks to God for the tidings concerning Joseph (Ainsworth); consulting God' about his journey to Egypt (Rosenm&uuml;ller); it may be, pouring out before God his fear as well as gratitude and joy, more especially if he thought about the stern prophecy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-13.htm">Genesis 15:13</a>) which had been given to Abraham (Kalisch); perhaps commending himself and family to the care of his covenant God (Keil), and certainly praying that God would confirm to him and his the covenant which had been made with his fathers (Calvin). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/genesis/45.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The sons of Israel carried out the instructions of Joseph and the invitation of Pharaoh (<a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/45-25.htm">Genesis 45:25-27</a>). But Joseph not only sent carriages according to Pharaoh's directions, and food for the journey, he also gave them presents, changes of raiment, a suit for every one, and five suits for Benjamin, as well as 300 shekels of silver. &#1513;&#1474;&#1502;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514; &#1495;&#1500;&#1508;&#1493;&#1514;: change of clothes, clothes to change; i.e., dress clothes which were worn on special occasions and frequently changed (<a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/13-12.htm">Judges 13:12-13</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-19.htm">Judges 13:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/5-5.htm">2 Kings 5:5</a>). "And to his father he sent like these;" i.e., not changes of clothes, but presents also, viz., ten asses "carrying of the good of Egypt," and ten she-asses with corn and provisions for the journey; and sent them off with the injunction: &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1490;&#1468;&#1494;&#1493;&#1468; :noitcnu, &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#788;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5; (lxx), "do not get angry by the way."
