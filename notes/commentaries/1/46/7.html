We have here a particular account of the names of Jacob’s family; his sons’ sons, most of whom are afterward mentioned as heads of houses in the several tribes.

The whole number that went down into Egypt were sixty-six, to which add Joseph and his two sons, who were there before, and Jacob himself, the head of the family, and you have the number of seventy.

Though the fulfilling of promises is always sure, yet it is often slow. It was now 215 years since God had promised Abraham to make of him a great nation, ch. 12:2; yet that branch of his seed, to which the promise was made sure, had only increased to seventy, of whom this particular account is kept, to show the power of God in making these seventy become a vast multitude.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/genesis/46.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The descent into Egypt is now described. "His daughters, and his sons' daughters." In the following list only one daughter of Jacob is mentioned, Dinah, and only one son's daughter, Serah. It is possible, but not probable, that there were more daughters than these at the time in his family. But even if there were no others, the plural is adopted in order to correspond with the general form of classification, from which the one daughter and the one granddaughter are merely accidental deviations. The same principle applies to the sons of Dan Gen 46:23, and to other instances in Scripture <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-8.htm">1 Chronicles 2:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-42.htm">1 Chronicles 2:42</a>.<p>Verse 8-27<p>The list given here of the family of Jacob as it came down into Egypt is not to be identified with a list of their descendants two hundred and fifty years after, contained in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/26.htm">Numbers 26</a>, or with another list constructed after the captivity, and referring to certain of their descendants in and after the times of the monarchy. Nor is this the place to mark out or investigate the grounds of the diversities from the present which these later lists exhibit. Our proper business here is to examine into the nature and import of this ancient and original list of the family of Jacob. It purports to be a list of the names of the sons of Israel, "who went into Mizraim." This phrase implies that the sons of Israel actually went down into Egypt; and this is accordingly historically true of all his immediate sons, Joseph having gone thither about twenty-two years before the others. And the word "sons" is to be understood here in its strict sense, as we find it in the immediate context <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/46-7.htm">Genesis 46:7</a> distinguished from sons' sons and other descendants.<p>"Jacob and his sons." From this expression we perceive the progenitor is to be included with the sons among those who descended to Egypt. This also is historically exact. For the sake of clearness it is proper here to state the approximate ages of these heads of Israel at the time of the descent. Jacob himself was 130 years of age <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/47-9.htm">Genesis 47:9</a>. Joseph was in his thirtieth year when he stood before Pharaoh to interpret his dreams and receive his commission as governor-general of Egypt, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-46.htm">Genesis 41:46</a>. At the end of the second year of the famine nine full years were added to his life. He was therefore, we may suppose, 39 years old when Jacob arrived in Egypt, and born when his father was 91. As we conceive that he was born in the fifteenth year of Jacob's sojourn in Padan-aram, and Reuben in the eighth, we infer that Reuben was at the time of the descent into Egypt seven years older than Joseph, or 46, Simon 45, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/44.htm">Leviticus 44</a>, Judah 43, Dan about 43, Naphtali about 42, Gad about 42, Asher about 41, Issakar about 41, Zebulun about 40, Dinah about 39, Benjamin about 26. "Jacob's first-born Reuben." This refers to the order of nature, without implying that the rights of first-birth were to be secured to Reuben <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-1.htm">1 Chronicles 5:1-2</a>.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/genesis/46.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. daughters&#8212;As Dinah was his only daughter, this must mean daughters-in-law.<p>all his seed brought he with him&#8212;Though disabled by age from active superintendence, yet, as the venerable sheik of the tribe, he was looked upon as their common head and consulted in every step.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/genesis/46.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">His daughters; </span> either his daughter Dinah, the plural number for the singular, as <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/46-23.htm" title="And the sons of Dan; Hushim.">Genesis 46:23</a> 21:7 <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-8.htm" title="And the sons of Pallu; Eliab.">Numbers 26:8</a></span>, or Dinah and her daughters; for grandchildren are commonly called their grandfather’s children, or sons or daughters; or his daughters-in-law, his son’s wives. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/genesis/46.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>His sons, and his sons' sons with him,....

There, on the border of Canaan, where Abraham and Isaac had called upon the name of the Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/21-33.htm">Genesis 21:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/26-25.htm">Genesis 26:25</a>), he offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac, ut sibi firmum et ratum esse testetur faedus, quod Deus ipse cum Patribus pepigerat (Calvin). Even though Jacob might see the ways of God in the wonderful course of his son Joseph, and discern in the friendly invitation of Joseph and Pharaoh, combined with the famine prevailing in Canaan, a divine direction to go into Egypt; yet this departure from the land of promise, in which his fathers had lived as pilgrims, was a step which necessarily excited serious thoughts in his mind as to his own future and that of his family, and led him to commend himself and his followers to the care of the faithful covenant God, whether in so doing he thought of the revelation which Abram had received (<a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/15-13.htm">Genesis 15:13-16</a>), or not.</body></html>
