But “he held his peace,” chiefly from his usual cautiousness, as being no match for the Hivites, but partly because Leah’s sons had the right to be the upholders of their sister’s honour.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/genesis/34.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/34-5.htm" title="And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter: now his sons were with his cattle in the field: and Jacob held his peace until they were come.">Genesis 34:5</a></span>. <span class="ital">His </span>(Jacob’s) <span class="ital">sons were in the field — </span>Probably at a very considerable distance; for it was usual to drive their flocks many miles for pasture. <span class="ital">Jacob held his peace till they were come — </span>Oppressed with grief and shame, on account of his daughter’s disgrace, and being unable to determine himself what steps it would be best to take, he waits for their coming and advice.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/34.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>34:1-19 Young persons, especially females, are never so safe and well off as under the care of pious parents. Their own ignorance, and the flattery and artifices of designing, wicked people, who are ever laying snares for them, expose them to great danger. They are their own enemies if they desire to go abroad, especially alone, among strangers to true religion. Those parents are very wrong who do not hinder their children from needlessly exposing themselves to danger. Indulged children, like Dinah, often become a grief and shame to their families. Her pretence was, to see the daughters of the land, to see how they dressed, and how they danced, and what was fashionable among them; she went to see, yet that was not all, she went to be seen too. She went to get acquaintance with the Canaanites, and to learn their ways. See what came of Dinah's gadding. The beginning of sin is as the letting forth of water. How great a matter does a little fire kindle! We should carefully avoid all occasions of sin and approaches to it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/genesis/34.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Dinah went out to see the daughters of the land. The Jewish doctors of a later period fix the marriageable age of a female at twelve years and a day. It is probable that Dinah was in her thirteenth year when she went out to visit the daughters of the land. Six or seven years, therefore, must have been spent by Jacob between Sukkoth, where he abode some time, and the neighborhood of Shekerm, where he had purchased a piece of ground. If we suppose Dinah to have been born in the same year with Joseph, who was in his seventeenth year at the time of his being sold as a bondslave <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-2.htm">Genesis 37:2</a>, the events of this chapter must have occurred in the interval between the completion of her twelfth and that of her sixteenth year. "Shekem." This name is hereditary in the family, and had taken hold in the locality before the time of Abraham. The Hivite was a descendant of Kenaan. We find this tribe now occupying the district where the Kenaanite was in possession at a former period <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-6.htm">Genesis 12:6</a>. "Spake to the heart of the damsel." After having robbed her of her honor, he promises to recognize her as his wife, provided he can gain the consent of her relatives. "Shekem spake unto his father Hamor." He is in earnest about this matter. "Jacob held his peace." He was a stranger in the land, and surrounded by a flourishing tribe, who were evidently unscrupulous in their conduct.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/genesis/34.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. Jacob held his peace&#8212;Jacob, as a father and a good man, must have been deeply distressed. But he could do little. In the case of a family by different wives, it is not the father, but the full brothers, on whom the protection of the daughters devolves&#8212;they are the guardians of a sister's welfare and the avengers of her wrongs. It was for this reason that Simeon and Levi, the two brothers of Dinah by Leah [Ge 34:25], appear the chief actors in this episode; and though the two fathers would have probably brought about an amicable arrangement of the affair, the hasty arrival of these enraged brothers introduced a new element into the negotiations.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/genesis/34.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Being unable to punish the delinquent, and not knowing what to do, he waits for his sons’ coming and advice. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/genesis/34.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter,.... That is, that Shechem had defiled her; the report of this was brought him very probably by one of the maids which attended her to the city; for it was hardly to be thought that she should go thither alone, and which must be very distressing to Jacob to hear of: this was his first affliction in his own family, but it was not the only one, nor the last, others quickly followed: <p>now his sons were with his cattle in the field; he had bought, or in some other hired by him for his cattle, feeding and keeping them, being arrived to an age fit for such service; here they were when the above report was brought to Jacob: <p>and Jacob held his peace until they were come; neither murmuring at the providence, but patiently bearing the chastisement; nor reflecting upon Leah for letting Dinah go out, or not keeping a proper watch over her; nor saying anything of it to any in the family; nor expressing his displeasure at Shechem, nor vowing revenge on him for it, nor taking any step towards it until his sons were come home from the field; with whom he chose to advise, and whose assistance he would want, if it was judged necessary to use force to get Dinah out of the hands of Shechem, or to avenge the injury done her. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/genesis/34.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter: now his sons were with his cattle in the field: and Jacob held his peace until they were come.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/34.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jacob heard</span> - most likely from some of Dinah's companions (Patrick), since she herself was still detained in She-chore's house (ver. 26) - <span class="cmt_word">that he</span> (Hamor's son) <span class="cmt_word">had defiled</span> - the verb here employed conveys the idea of rendering unclean (cf. vers. 13, 27; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/19-13.htm">Numbers 19:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-10.htm">2 Kings 23:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/79-1.htm">Psalm 79:1</a>; that in ver. 2 expresses the notion of violence) - <span class="cmt_word">Dinah his daughter</span>.

Vers., Tr.) after the lxx, Vulg., etc.; but an adjective, safe, peaceful, equivalent to &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1501;, "in peace," in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/28-21.htm">Genesis 28:21</a>, to which there is an evident allusion. What Jacob had asked for in his vow at Bethel, before his departure from Canaan, was now fulfilled. He had returned in safety "to the land of Canaan;" Succoth, therefore, did not belong to the land of Canaan, but must have been on the eastern side of the Jordan. &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1501; &#1506;&#1497;&#1512;, lit., city of Shechem; so called from Shechem the son of the Hivite prince Hamor<p>(Note: Mamortha, which according to Plin. (h. n. v. 14) was the earlier name of Neapolis (Nablus), appears to have been a corruption of Chamor.)<p>(<a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/33-19.htm">Genesis 33:19</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/34-2.htm">Genesis 34:2</a>.), who founded it and called it by the name of his son, since it was not in existence in Abraham's time (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-6.htm">Genesis 12:6</a>). Jacob pitched his tent before the town, and then bought the piece of ground upon which he encamped from the sons of Hamor for 100 Kesita. &#1511;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1496;&#1492; is not a piece of silver of the value of a lamb (according to the ancient versions), but a quantity of silver weighed out, of considerable, though not exactly determinable value: cf. Ges. thes. s. v. This purchase showed that Jacob, in reliance upon the promise of God, regarded Canaan as his own home and the home of his seed. This piece of field, which fell to the lot of the sons of Joseph, and where Joseph's bones were buried (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/24-32.htm">Joshua 24:32</a>), was, according to tradition, the plain which stretches out at the south-eastern opening of the valley of Shechem, where Jacob's well is still pointed out (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-6.htm">John 4:6</a>), also Joseph's grave, a Mahometan wely (grave) two or three hundred paces to the north (Rob. Pal. iii. 95ff.). Jacob also erected an altar, as Abraham had previously done after his entrance into Canaan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>), and called it El-Elohe-Israel, "God (the mighty) is the God of Israel," to set forth in this name the spiritual acquisition of his previous life, and according to his vow (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-21.htm">Genesis 28:21</a>) to give glory to the "God of Israel" (as he called Jehovah, with reference to the name given to him at <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-29.htm">Genesis 32:29</a>), for having proved Himself to be El, a mighty God, during his long absence, and that it might serve as a memorial for his descendants. </body></html>
