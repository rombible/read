Their own ignorance, and the flattery and artifices of designing, wicked people, who are ever laying snares for them, expose them to great danger. They are their own enemies if they desire to go abroad, especially alone, among strangers to true religion. Those parents are very wrong who do not hinder their children from needlessly exposing themselves to danger. Indulged children, like Dinah, often become a grief and shame to their families. Her pretence was, to see the daughters of the land, to see how they dressed, and how they danced, and what was fashionable among them; she went to see, yet that was not all, she went to be seen too. She went to get acquaintance with the Canaanites, and to learn their ways. See what came of Dinah's gadding. The beginning of sin is as the letting forth of water. How great a matter does a little fire kindle! We should carefully avoid all occasions of sin and approaches to it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/genesis/34.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A conference takes place between the parties. Hamer and Jacob, the parents on both sides, are the principals in the negotiation. The sons of Jacob, being brothers of the injured damsel, are present, according to custom. "Wrought fully in Israel;" a standing phrase from this time forward for any deed that was contrary to the sanctity which ought to characterize God's holy people. Israel is used here to designate the descendants of Israel, the special people. Hamer makes his proposal. "Shekem, my son." These words are a nominative pendent, for which "his soul" is substituted. He proposes a political alliance or amalgamation of the two tribes, to be sealed and actually effected by intermarriage. He offers to make them joint-possessors of the soil, and of the rights of dwelling, trading, and acquiring property. Shekem now speaks with becoming deference and earnestness.<p>He offers any amount of dowry, or bridal presents, and of gift to the mother and brothers of the bride. It must be acknowledged that the father and the son were disposed to make whatever amends they could for the grievous offence that had been committed. The sons of Jacob answer with deceit. They are burning with resentment of the wrong that "ought not to have been done," and that cannot now be fully repaired. Yet they are in presence of a superior force, and therefore, resort to deceit. "And spake." This goes along with the previous verb "answered," and is meant to have the same qualification "with deceit." The last clause of the verse then assigns the cause of this deceitful dealing. Their speech, for the matter of it, is reasonable. They cannot intermarry with the uncircumcised. Only on condition that every male be circumcised will they consent. On these terms they promise to "become one people" with them. Otherwise they take their daughter, and depart. Our daughter. They here speak as a family or race, and therefore, call Dinah their daughter, though her brothers are the speakers.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/genesis/34.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12.

Or "multiply them exceedingly" (i), fix them at as high a rate as may be thought fit; the "dowry" was what a man gave to a woman at her marriage; for in those times and countries, instead of a man having a portion with his wife, as with us in our times, he gave one to his wife, or to her parents for her; and especially in after times this was used, and became a law in Israel, in the case of a vitiated virgin, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-16.htm">Exodus 22:16</a>; and "the gift" was either of jewels and clothes to the women, or of such like precious things to her brethren and friends, see <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-53.htm">Genesis 24:53</a>, <p>and I will give according as ye shall say unto me; determine among yourselves whatever shall be the dowry and gift, and it shall be punctually observed: <p>but give me the damsel to wife; only agree to that, and I care not what is required of me. <p>(i) "multiplicate super me admodum", Drusius, Schmidt. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/genesis/34.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give according as ye shall say unto me: but give me the damsel to wife.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/genesis/34.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">12</span>. <span class="ital">dowry and gift</span>] The “dowry,” or <span class="ital">mohar</span>, is the present made to the parents or relations, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-53.htm" title="And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah: he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things.">Genesis 24:53</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-16.htm" title="And if a man entice a maid that is not betrothed, and lie with her, he shall surely endow her to be his wife.">Exodus 22:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-25.htm" title="And Saul said, Thus shall you say to David, The king desires not any dowry, but an hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged of the king's enemies.

"Because he had wrought folly in Israel, by lying with Jacob's daughter." "To work folly" was a standing phrase for crimes against the honour and calling of Israel as the people of God, especially for shameful sins of the flesh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-21.htm">Deuteronomy 22:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-10.htm">Judges 20:10</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-2.htm">2 Samuel 13:2</a>, etc.); but it was also applied to other great sins (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/7-15.htm">Joshua 7:15</a>). As Jacob had become Israel, the seduction of his daughter was a crime against Israel, which is called folly, inasmuch as the relation of Israel to God was thereby ignored (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/14-1.htm">Psalm 14:1</a>). "And this ought not to be done:" &#1497;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; potentialis as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/20-9.htm">Genesis 20:9</a>. - Hamor went to Jacob to ask for his daughter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/34-6.htm">Genesis 34:6</a>); but Jacob's sons reached home at the same time (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/34-7.htm">Genesis 34:7</a>), so that Hamor spoke to them (Jacob and his sons). To attain his object Hamor proposed a further intermarriage, unrestricted movement on their part in the land, and that they should dwell there, trade (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;), and secure possessions (&#1504;&#1488;&#1495;&#1494; settle down securely, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/47-27.htm">Genesis 47:27</a>).
