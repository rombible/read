The territory of the tribe lay upon the inland sea of Gennesaret, but did not extend to the shore of the Mediterranean. We do not know of any literal fulfilment of the prediction, but Moses also speaks of Zebulun and Issachar as tribes that would “suck of the abundance of the seas.” It is very possible that, living in the neighbourhood of the Phœnicians, they took part in maritime pursuits; and thus the general meaning of the blessing may be that Zebulun would be a tribe, not of agriculturists, but of traders. It is also remarkable that Tyre, which was much nearer the tribe of Zebulun, and was the leading city in David’s time, is not mentioned, but only the more ancient town of Sidon.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/genesis/49.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-13.htm" title="Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; and he shall be for an haven of ships; and his border shall be to Zidon.">Genesis 49:13</a></span>. <span class="ital">Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea — </span>This was fulfilled, when, two or three hundred years after, the land of Canaan was divided by lot, and the “border of Zebulun went up toward the sea,” <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-11.htm" title="And their border went up toward the sea, and Maralah, and reached to Dabbasheth, and reached to the river that is before Jokneam;">Joshua 19:11</a>.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/49.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>49:13-18 Concerning Zebulun: if prophecy says, Zebulun shall be a haven of ships, be sure Providence will so plant him. God appoints the bounds of our habitation. It is our wisdom and duty to accommodate ourselves to our lot, and to improve it; if Zebulun dwell at the heaven of the sea, let him be for a haven of ships. Concerning Issachar: he saw that the land was pleasant, yielding not only pleasant prospects, but pleasant fruits to recompense his toils. Let us, with an eye of faith, see the heavenly rest to be good, and that land of promise to be pleasant; this will make our present services easy. Dan should, by art, and policy, and surprise, gain advantages against his enemies, like a serpent biting the heel of the traveller. Jacob, almost spent, and ready to faint, relieves himself with those words, I have waited for thy salvation, O Lord! The salvation he waited for was Christ, the promised Seed; now that he was going to be gathered to his people, he breathes after Him to whom the gathering of the people shall be. He declared plainly that he sought heaven, the better country, Heb 11:13,14. Now he is going to enjoy the salvation, he comforts himself that he had waited for the salvation. Christ, as our way to heaven, is to be waited on; and heaven, as our rest in Christ, is to be waited for. It is the comfort of a dying saint thus to have waited for the salvation of the Lord; for then he shall have what he has been waiting for.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/genesis/49.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Zebulun means "dwelling," to which there is an allusion in the first clause of the verse.

"Into their counsel come not, my soul; with their assembly let not my honour unite." &#1505;&#1493;&#1491;, a council, or deliberative consensus. &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1491;, imperf. of &#1497;&#1495;&#1491;; &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1491;&#1497;, like <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-6.htm">Psalm 7:6</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/16-9.htm">Psalm 16:9</a>, etc., of the soul as the noblest part of man, the centre of his personality as the image of God.

In <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/34-28.htm">Genesis 34:28</a> it is merely stated that the cattle of the Shechemites were carried off, not that they were lamed. But the one is so far from excluding the other, that it rather includes it in such a case as this, where the sons of Jacob were more concerned about revenge than booty. Jacob mentions the latter only, because it was this which most strikingly displayed their criminal wantonness. On this reckless revenge Jacob pronounces the curse, "Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for it was cruel: I shall divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel." They had joined together to commit this crime, and as a punishment they should be divided or scattered in the nation of Israel, should form no independent or compact tribes. This sentence of the patriarch was so fulfilled when Canaan was conquered, that on the second numbering under Moses, Simeon had become the weakest of all the tribes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-14.htm">Numbers 26:14</a>); in Moses' blessing (<a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33.htm">Deuteronomy 33</a>) it was entirely passed over; and it received no separate assignment of territory as an inheritance, but merely a number of cities within the limits of Judah (<a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/19-1.htm">Joshua 19:1-9</a>). Its possessions, therefore, became an insignificant appendage to those of Judah, into which they were eventually absorbed, as most of the families of Simeon increased but little (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-27.htm">1 Chronicles 4:27</a>); and those which increased the most emigrated in two detachments, and sought out settlements for themselves and pasture for their cattle outside the limits of the promised land (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-38.htm">1 Chronicles 4:38-43</a>). Levi also received no separate inheritance in the land, but merely a number of cities to dwell in, scattered throughout the possessions of his brethren (<a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/21-1.htm">Joshua 21:1-40</a>). But the scattering of Levi in Israel was changed into a blessing for the other tribes through its election to the priesthood. Of this transformation of the curse into a blessing, there is not the slightest intimation in Jacob's address; and in this we have a strong proof of its genuineness. After this honourable change had taken place under Moses, it would never have occurred to any one to cast such a reproach upon the forefather of the Levites. How different is the blessing pronounced by Moses upon Levi (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-8.htm">Deuteronomy 33:8</a>.)! But though Jacob withdrew the rights of primogeniture from Reuben, and pronounced a curse upon the crime of Simeon and Levi, he deprived none of them of their share in the promised inheritance. They were merely put into the background because of their sins, but they were not excluded from the fellowship and call of Israel, and did not lose the blessing of Abraham, so that their father's utterances with regard to them might still be regarded as the bestowal of a blessing (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-28.htm">Genesis 49:28</a>). </body></html>
