(See <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/16-12.htm" title="And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man, and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brothers.">Genesis 16:12</a>, where Ishmael is compared to the wild ass, which adds to these qualities the love of freedom.) His real character was slothful, inactive, and commonplace. Jacob therefore likens him to a “strong ass;” Heb., <span class= "ital">an ass of bone, </span>that is, one coarsely bred, as animals of high parentage have small bones. He is thus fit only to be a drudge, and with the laziness of a cart-horse lies down “between two burdens.” The word occurs again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-16.htm" title="Why stayed you among the sheepfolds, to hear the bleatings of the flocks? For the divisions of Reuben there were great searchings of heart.">Judges 5:16</a>, and is there more correctly rendered <span class= "ital">sheepfolds. </span>More exactly it means the pens in which the cattle were folded during the nights of summer; and it is in the dual form, because these pens were divided into two parts for the larger and smaller cattle. Thus Issachar, stretched at ease between his cattle-pens, gives us the idea of a tribe occupied with pastoral pursuits, and destitute of all higher aspirations.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/genesis/49.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-14.htm" title="Issachar is a strong ass couching down between two burdens:">Genesis 49:14</a></span>. <span class="ital">Issachar is a strong ass, couching down between two burdens — </span>The men of that tribe shall be strong and industrious, fit for and inclined to labour, particularly the toil of husbandry; like <span class="ital">the ass </span>that patiently carries his burden.

God appoints the bounds of our habitation. It is our wisdom and duty to accommodate ourselves to our lot, and to improve it; if Zebulun dwell at the heaven of the sea, let him be for a haven of ships. Concerning Issachar: he saw that the land was pleasant, yielding not only pleasant prospects, but pleasant fruits to recompense his toils. Let us, with an eye of faith, see the heavenly rest to be good, and that land of promise to be pleasant; this will make our present services easy. Dan should, by art, and policy, and surprise, gain advantages against his enemies, like a serpent biting the heel of the traveller. Jacob, almost spent, and ready to faint, relieves himself with those words, I have waited for thy salvation, O Lord! The salvation he waited for was Christ, the promised Seed; now that he was going to be gathered to his people, he breathes after Him to whom the gathering of the people shall be. He declared plainly that he sought heaven, the better country, Heb 11:13,14. Now he is going to enjoy the salvation, he comforts himself that he had waited for the salvation. Christ, as our way to heaven, is to be waited on; and heaven, as our rest in Christ, is to be waited for. It is the comfort of a dying saint thus to have waited for the salvation of the Lord; for then he shall have what he has been waiting for.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/genesis/49.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>"An ass of bone," and therefore, of strength.

Or as one, the note of similitude being wanting, as Ben Melech observes; "a bony" (e) one, as the word signifies; not one that is lean, and nothing but skin and bones, as some interpret it, but that is strong and robust, able to carry burdens; and this tribe is compared to an ass, not for stupidity and sluggishness, but for its strength, and its use in husbandry, in which this tribe was chiefly occupied: the Targums of Jonathan and Jarchi interpret this figuratively, of his being strong to bear the yoke of the law: and it is a notion of the Jews, that this tribe were skilful in the doctrines of the law, and the intercalation of years, &amp;c. from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-32.htm">1 Chronicles 12:32</a> couching down between two burdens: one hanging on one side, and another on the other; which Kimchi and Ben Melech interpret of bales of goods; and may as well be understood of sacks of corn, or anything else, carried by these creatures, which, when they come into a good pasture, and for the sake of that and ease, will lie down with their burdens on them, and rise up again with them: the Targums of Onkelos and Jerusalem paraphrase it, "between two borders" (f), or the borders of his brethren, as Jonathan, Zebulun and Dan, between which this tribe lay; and this is the reason Aben Ezra gives why Issachar, who was older than Zebulun, is mentioned after him, and between him and Dan, because his land lay between them; and so it may be observed, that in the division of the land in Joshua's time, Issachar's lot came up after Zebulun's, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-10.htm">Joshua 19:10</a> but Doctor Lightfoot thinks (g) it refers to the two kingdoms, between which it lay, that of Phoenicia on one side, and that of Samaria on the other. <p>(e)  "Asinus osseus", Montanus, Tigurine version, Munster, Vatablus, Drusius, Piscator, Cartwright.

Issachar is compared, not to the wild ass, high spirited and swift, but to the strong domestic beast of burden. The territory of Issachar included the southern part of Galilee and the Valley of Jezreel. Slightly different readings are represented by the Sam. <span class="ital">gêrim</span> (instead of <span class="ital">gerem</span>), i.e. “the ass of strangers,” “bearing the burdens imposed by foreigners,” “a tributary.” The LXX <span class="greekheb">τὸ καλὸν ἐπεθύμησεν</span> = “he desired the beautiful,” gives an entirely different turn to the sense.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">between the sheepfolds</span>] For this word, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-16.htm" title="Why stayed you among the sheepfolds, to hear the bleatings of the flocks?

Issachar is represented as lying contentedly among his flocks, regardless of his brethren. Instead of “sheepfolds,” the versions give “boundaries.” Thus LXX <span class="greekheb">ἀνὰ μέσον τῶν κλήρων</span> = “between the lots”; Lat. <span class="ital">inter terminos</span>. Another proposed rendering is “dung-heaps” or “ash-heaps.” Skinner conjectures “panniers,” which would be more appropriate to the metaphor.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/49.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 14, 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Issachar is a strong ass couching down between two burdens -</span> literally, <span class="accented">an ass of bone - hence</span> a strong, powerful animal, <span class="accented">asinus fortis</span> (Vulgate), <span class="accented">asinus walidi corporis</span> (Gesenius), <span class="accented">asinus robustus</span> (<span class="accented">Rosenmuller</span>) <span class="accented">- lying down between the folds</span>, or cattle-pens, which received and protected the flocks by night, the dual being used probably because such pens were divided into two parts for different kinds of cattle (Gesenius, Keil, Kalisch, Murphy, 'Speaker s Commentary,' &c.), though the word <span class="accented">mishpetaim has</span> been also rendered <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> (LXX.), <span class="accented">inter terminos</span> (Vulgate, Rosenm&uuml;ller), "within their own boundaries" (Onkelos, Targums of Jerusalem and Jonathan), "between two burdens" (A.

"Judah thou, thee will thy brethren praise! thy hand in the neck of thy foes! to thee will thy father's sons bow down!" &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;, thou, is placed first as an absolute noun, like &#1488;&#1504;&#1497; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-4.htm">Genesis 17:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-27.htm">Genesis 24:27</a>; &#1497;&#1493;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1498; is a play upon &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1492; like &#1488;&#1493;&#1491;&#1492; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/29-35.htm">Genesis 29:35</a>. Judah, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/29-35.htm">Genesis 29:35</a>, signifies: he for whom Jehovah is praised, not merely the praised one. "This nomen, the patriarch seized as an omen, and expounded it as a presage of the future history of Judah." Judah should be in truth all that his name implied (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/27-36.htm">Genesis 27:36</a>). Judah had already shown to a certain extent a strong and noble character, when he proposed to sell Joseph rather than shed his blood (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/37-26.htm">Genesis 37:26</a>.); but still more in the manner in which he offered himself to his father as a pledge for Benjamin, and pleaded with Joseph on his behalf (<a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/43-9.htm">Genesis 43:9-10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/44-16.htm">Genesis 44:16</a>.); and it was apparent even in his conduct towards Thamar. In this manliness and strength there slumbered the germs of the future development of strength in his tribe. Judah would put his enemies to flight, grasp them by the neck, and subdue them (<a href="http://biblehub.com/job/16-12.htm">Job 16:12</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-27.htm">Exodus 23:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-41.htm">Psalm 18:41</a>). Therefore his brethren would do homage to him: not merely the sons of his mother, who are mentioned in other places (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/27-29.htm">Genesis 27:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-19.htm">Judges 8:19</a>), i.e., the tribes descended from Leah, but the sons of his father-all the tribes of Israel therefore; and this was really the case under David (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-1.htm">2 Samuel 5:1-2</a>, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-6.htm">1 Samuel 18:6-7</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-16.htm">1 Samuel 18:16</a>).
