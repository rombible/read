Though the desolations of the deluge were before their eyes, though they sprang from the stock of righteous Noah, yet even during his life-time, wickedness increases exceedingly. Nothing but the sanctifying grace of the Holy Spirit can remove the sinful lusts of the human will, and the depravity of the human heart. God's purpose was, that mankind should form many nations, and people all lands. In contempt of the Divine will, and against the counsel of Noah, the bulk of mankind united to build a city and a tower to prevent their separating. Idolatry was begun, and Babel became one of its chief seats. They made one another more daring and resolute. Let us learn to provoke one another to love and to good works, as sinners stir up and encourage one another to wicked works.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/genesis/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div> - The Confusion of Tongues<p>1. &#1504;&#1505;&#1506;  na&#772;sa&#8219; "pluck out, break up, journey." &#1502;&#1511;&#1491;&#1501;  m&#305;&#770;qedem "eastward, or on the east side" as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-14.htm">Genesis 2:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/13-11.htm">Genesis 13:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-11.htm">Isaiah 9:11</a> (12).<p>6. &#1492;&#1495;&#1500;&#1501;  hach&#305;&#770;la&#772;m "their beginning", for &#1492;&#1495;&#1500;&#1501;  ha&#774;ch&#305;&#770;la&#772;m, the regular form of this infinitive with a suffix. &#1497;&#1494;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;  ya&#772;zmu&#770; as if from &#1497;&#1494;&#1501;  ya&#772;zam  equals  &#1494;&#1502;&#1501;  za&#772;mam.<p>7. &#1504;&#1489;&#1500;&#1492;  na&#772;bela&#770;h usually said to be for &#1504;&#1489;&#1500;&#1492;  na&#772;bola&#770;h from &#1489;&#1500;&#1500;  ba&#772;lal; but evidently designed by the punctuator to be the third singular feminine perfect of &#1504;&#1489;&#1500;  na&#772;bal "to be confounded," having for its subject &#1513;&#1474;&#1508;&#1492;  s&#769;a&#772;pa&#770;h, "and there let their lip be confounded."

The point to which he reverts is the birth of Peleg. The present singular passage explains the nature of that unprecedented change by which mankind passed from one family with a mutually intelligible speech, into many nations of diverse tongues and lands.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/11-1.htm">Genesis 11:1</a><p>The previous state of human language is here briefly described. "The whole land" evidently means the whole then known world with all its human inhabitants. The universality of application is clearly and constantly maintained throughout the whole passage. "Behold, the people is one." And the close is on this point in keeping with the commencement. "Therefore was the name of it called Babel, because the Lord had there confounded the lip of all the land."<p>Of one lip, and one stock: of words. - In the table of nations the term "tongue" was used to signify what is here expressed by two terms. This is not undesigned. The two terms are not synonymous or parallel, as they form the parts of one compound predicate. "One stock of words," then, we conceive, naturally indicates the matter, the substance, or material of language. This was one and the same to the whole race. The term "lip," which is properly one of the organs of articulation, is, on the other hand, used to denote the form, that is, the manner, of speaking; the mode of using and connecting the matter of speech; the system of laws by which the inflections and derivations of a language are conducted. This also was one throughout the human family. Thus, the sacred writer has expressed the unity of language among mankind, not by a single term as before, but, with a view to his present purpose, by a combination of terms expressing the two elements which go to constitute every organic reality.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/genesis/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 11<p>Ge 11:1-32.

This, however, was an assumption resting on no more satisfactory foundation than (1) the proper names of the early Genesis narratives, and (2) the supposition that the language of the Chosen People was sacred and therefore aboriginal.

Jegar-sahadutha, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-47.htm">Genesis 31:47</a>), and that the patriarch himself acquired Hebrew from the Canaanites, who may themselves have adopted it from the early Semites whom they displace& While regarding neither the Aramaic, Hebrew, nor Arabic as the original tongue of mankind, he thinks the Hebrew approaches nearest the primitive Semite language out of which all three were developed. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/genesis/11.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"And the whole earth (i.e., the population of the earth, vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-19.htm">Genesis 2:19</a>) was one lip and one kind of words:" unius labii eorundemque verborum.

But as the origin and formation of the races of mankind are beyond the limits of empirical research, so no philology will ever be able to prove or deduce the original unity of human speech from the languages which have been historically preserved, however far comparative grammar may proceed in establishing the genealogical relation of the languages of different nations. </body></html>
