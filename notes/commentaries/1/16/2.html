Until late times the tent was the habitation, while the house was the family (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/7-1.htm" title="And the LORD said to Noah, Come you and all your house into the ark; for you have I seen righteous before me in this generation.">Genesis 7:1</a>). Thus the phrase “to build a man <span class= "ital">a sure house</span>” meant, to give him lasting prosperity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-35.htm" title="And I will raise me up a faithful priest, that shall do according to that which is in my heart and in my mind: and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before my anointed for ever.">1Samuel 2:35</a>). Hence, too, the close connection between building and the bestowal of children in Psalms 127. As then the children of a woman bestowed by her mistress upon the husband were regarded as belonging to the wife (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/30-3.htm" title="And she said, Behold my maid Bilhah, go in to her; and she shall bear on my knees, that I may also have children by her.">Genesis 30:3</a>), Sarah, despairing of bearing a son herself, as she was now seventy-five, and had been ten years in Canaan, concluded that her heir was to be born of a substitute.<p>As regards the morality of the act, we find that marriage with one wife was the original law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-24.htm" title="Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall join to his wife: and they shall be one flesh.">Genesis 2:24</a>), and that when polygamy was introduced it was coupled by the inspired narrator with violence and licence (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-19.htm" title="And Lamech took to him two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.">Genesis 4:19</a>). Monogamy was the rule, as we see in the households of Noah, Terah, Isaac, and others; but many, like Esau and Jacob, allowed themselves a greater latitude. In so doing, their conduct falls below the level of Christian morality, but everyone’s actions are strongly influenced by the general views of the people among whom he lives; and in Abram’s case it must be said in his defence that, with so much depending on his having offspring, he took no steps to obtain another wife, but remained content with the barren Sarai. When he did take Hagar it was at his wife’s request, and for a reason which seemed to them adequate, and even religious. Rachel subsequently did the same for a much lower motive. The consent of the wife was in such cases all-important; and so in India, in ancient times, it was necessary to make a second marriage valid (see Wilson’s <span class= "ital">Hindu Theatre, </span>i. 179).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/16.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>16:1-3 Sarai, no longer expecting to have children herself, proposed to Abram to take another wife, whose children she might; her slave, whose children would be her property. This was done without asking counsel of the Lord. Unbelief worked, God's almighty power was forgotten. It was a bad example, and a source of manifold uneasiness. In every relation and situation in life there is some cross for us to bear: much of the exercise of faith consists in patiently submitting, in waiting the Lord's time, and using only those means which he appoints for the removal of the cross. Foul temptations may have very fair pretences, and be coloured with that which is very plausible. Fleshly wisdom puts us out of God's way. This would not be the case, if we would ask counsel of God by his word and by prayer, before we attempt that which is doubtful.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/genesis/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A Mizrite handmaid. - Hagar was probably obtained, ten years before, during their sojourn in Egypt. "The Lord hath restrained me." It was natural to the ancient mind to recognize the power and will of God in all things. "I shall be builded by her," &#1488;&#1489;&#1504;&#1492;  '&#305;&#770;ba&#772;neh, built as the foundation of a house, by the addition of sons or daughters (&#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;  ba&#772;n&#305;&#770;ym or &#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1514;  ba&#772;no&#770;t). She thought she had or wished to have a share in the promise, if not by herself personally, yet through her maid. The faith of Sarah had not yet come fully to the birth. Abram yields to the suggestion of his wife, and complies with the custom of the country. Ten years had elapsed since they had entered the land they were to inherit. Impatience at the long delay leads to an invention of their own for obtaining an heir. The contempt of her maid was unjustifiable. But it was the natural consequence of Sarai's own improper and imprudent step, in giving her to her husband as a concubine. Unwilling, however, to see in herself the occasion of her maid's insolence, she transfers the blame to her husband, who empowers or reminds her of her power still to deal with her as it pleased her. Hagar, unable to bear the yoke of humiliation, flees from her mistress.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/genesis/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 16<p>Ge 16:1-16.

The LORD make the woman that is come into your house like Rachel and like Leah, which two did build the house of Israel: and do you worthily in Ephratah, and be famous in Bethlehem:">Ruth 4:11</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/25-9.htm" title="Then shall his brother's wife come to him in the presence of the elders, and loose his shoe from off his foot, and spit in his face, and shall answer and say, So shall it be done to that man that will not build up his brother's house.">Deuteronomy 25:9</a>). The suggestion which Sarai here makes, may be illustrated from <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/30-3.htm" title="And she said, Behold my maid Bilhah, go in to her; and she shall bear on my knees, that I may also have children by her....">Genesis 30:3-4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/30-9.htm" title="When Leah saw that she had left bearing, she took Zilpah her maid, and gave her Jacob to wife.">Genesis 30:9</a>.

It was the custom also in Babylonia, as is shewn by the Code of Hammurabi, that “if a man’s wife was childless, he was allowed to take a concubine and bring her into his house, but he was not to place her upon an equal footing with the wife. Or, the wife might give her husband a maidservant (<span class="ital">amtu</span>), and, if she brought up children, he was forbidden to take in addition a concubine” (S. A.

It is so far satisfactory that the proposal to make a secondary wife of Hagar did not originate with Abram; though, as Sarai's guilt in making it cannot altogether. be excused, so neither can Abram be entirely freed from fault in yielding to her solicitations. <span class="cmt_word">It may be that I may obtain children by her</span>.

Calvin notes that Sarai s desire of offspring was not prompted by natural impulse, but by the zeal of faith which made her wish to secure the promised benediction. As yet it had not been clearly intimated that Sarai was to be the mother of Abram's child; and hence her recourse to what was a prevalent practice of the times, while unjustifiable in itself, was a signal proof of her humility, of her devotion to her husband, and perhaps also of her faith in God. <span class="cmt_word">And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai.</span> "The faith of both was defective; not indeed with regard to the substance of the premise, but with regard to the method in which they proceeded" (Calvin). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/genesis/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When the sun had gone down, and thick darkness had come on (&#1492;&#1497;&#1492; impersonal), "behold a smoking furnace, and (with) a fiery torch, which passed between those pieces," - a description of what Abram saw in his deep prophetic sleep, corresponding to the mysterious character of the whole proceeding. &#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, a stove, is a cylindrical fire-pot, such as is used in the dwelling-houses of the East. The phenomenon, which passed through the pieces as they lay opposite to one another, resembled such a smoking stove, from which a fiery torch, i.e., a brilliant flame, was streaming forth. In this symbol Jehovah manifested Himself to Abram, just as He afterwards did to the people of Israel in the pillar of cloud and fire. Passing through the pieces, He ratified the covenant which He made with Abram. His glory was enveloped in fire and smoke, the produce of the consuming fire, - both symbols of the wrath of God (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/18-9.htm">Psalm 18:9</a>, and Hengstenberg in loc.), whose fiery zeal consumes whatever opposes it (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-2.htm">Exodus 3:2</a>). - To establish and give reality to the covenant to be concluded with Abram, Jehovah would have to pass through the seed of Abram when oppressed by the Egyptians and threatened with destruction, and to execute judgment upon their oppressors (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-4.htm">Exodus 7:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-12.htm">Exodus 12:12</a>). In this symbol, the passing of the Lord between the pieces meant something altogether different from the oath of the Lord by Himself in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/22-16.htm">Genesis 22:16</a>, or by His life in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-40.htm">Deuteronomy 32:40</a>, or by His soul in <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-8.htm">Amos 6:8</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-14.htm">Jeremiah 51:14</a>. It set before Abram the condescension of the Lord to his seed, in the fearful glory of His majesty as the judge of their foes. Hence the pieces were not consumed by the fire; for the transaction had reference not to a sacrifice, which God accepted, and in which the soul of the offerer was to ascend in the smoke to God, but to a covenant in which God came down to man. From the nature of this covenant, it followed, however, that God alone went through the pieces in a symbolical representation of Himself, and not Abram also. For although a covenant always establishes a reciprocal relation between two individuals, yet in that covenant which God concluded with a man, the man did not stand on an equality with God, but God established the relation of fellowship by His promise and His gracious condescension to the man, who was at first purely a recipient, and was only qualified and bound to fulfil the obligations consequent upon the covenant by the reception of gifts of grace. </body></html>
