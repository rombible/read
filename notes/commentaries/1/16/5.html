We may thank ourselves for the guilt and grief that follow us, when we go out of the way of our duty. See it in this case, Passionate people often quarrel with others, for things of which they themselves must bear the blame. Sarai had given her maid to Abram, yet she cries out, My wrong be upon thee. That is never said wisely, which pride and anger put into our mouths. Those are not always in the right, who are most loud and forward in appealing to God: such rash and bold imprecations commonly speak guilt and a bad cause. Hagar forgot that she herself had first given the provocation, by despising her mistress. Those that suffer for their faults, ought to bear it patiently, 1Pe 2:20.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/genesis/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A Mizrite handmaid. - Hagar was probably obtained, ten years before, during their sojourn in Egypt. "The Lord hath restrained me." It was natural to the ancient mind to recognize the power and will of God in all things. "I shall be builded by her," &#1488;&#1489;&#1504;&#1492;  '&#305;&#770;ba&#772;neh, built as the foundation of a house, by the addition of sons or daughters (&#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;  ba&#772;n&#305;&#770;ym or &#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1514;  ba&#772;no&#770;t). She thought she had or wished to have a share in the promise, if not by herself personally, yet through her maid. The faith of Sarah had not yet come fully to the birth. Abram yields to the suggestion of his wife, and complies with the custom of the country. Ten years had elapsed since they had entered the land they were to inherit. Impatience at the long delay leads to an invention of their own for obtaining an heir. The contempt of her maid was unjustifiable. But it was the natural consequence of Sarai's own improper and imprudent step, in giving her to her husband as a concubine. Unwilling, however, to see in herself the occasion of her maid's insolence, she transfers the blame to her husband, who empowers or reminds her of her power still to deal with her as it pleased her. Hagar, unable to bear the yoke of humiliation, flees from her mistress.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/genesis/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. And Sarai said &#8230; My wrong be upon thee&#8212;Bursts of temper, or blows, as the original may bear, took place till at length Hagar, perceiving the hopelessness of maintaining the unequal strife, resolved to escape from what had become to her in reality, as well as in name, a house of bondage.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/genesis/16.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> i.e. The injury done to me by Hagar, who thus wickedly requites my kindness to her, be upon thee. i.e. is to be imputed to thee; thou art the cause of it, because thou dost not maintain my reputation, and repress her arrogancy. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The Lord</span> give forth a righteous sentence between us, and deal with each of us according to our guilt or innocency in this matter.

Being affronted with the behaviour of her maid to her, she applies to Abram for the redress of her grievance, judging it, perhaps, below her dignity to enter into an altercation with her maid: <p>my wrong be upon thee; in her passion imprecating evil on him, as a just punishment upon him for suffering wrong to be done her by her maid; or, "is upon thee" (i); pointing at his duty, and suggesting to him what he ought to do; that it was incumbent on him as her husband to right her wrongs, and do her justice, and vindicate her from the calumnies and reproaches of her servant; and tacitly complaining of him, and accusing him with indolence and unconcern at the injury done her, being silent when it became him to check her insolence and chide her for it: or, "is for thee" (k); for thy sake; it was for the sake of Abram chiefly, that he might have a son and heir, which he was very solicitous, that she gave him her maid to wife; the consequence of which was, that she was now insulted and abused by her, and so suffered wrong for his sake; and the rather she might be tempted to say it was on his account, as she might be jealous of a growing affection in him to Hagar, and that he showed greater respect to her, being likely to have a child by her, and so connived at her haughtiness and arrogance: <p>I have given my maid into thy bosom; to be his wife, <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/7-5.htm">Micah 7:5</a>; Sarai had no reason to upbraid Abram with this, since it was not at his solicitations she gave her to him, but it was her own motion: <p>and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes; when she found herself with child, and hoped to bring forth a son, that should be heir to Abram's large possessions, and inherit the land of Canaan, given to his seed, she began to think highly of herself, and looked with disdain upon her mistress, set lightly by her, made no account of her, showed her no respect, carried it haughtily to her, as if she was beneath her, and as if she had more authority in the house, and a better claim to the affection of Abram, and deserving of more honour and respect, as she was favoured of God with conception, a blessing Sarai never enjoyed: <p>the Lord judge between me and thee: which was very rashly and hastily said, as if Abram was not inclined and was unwilling to do her justice, and therefore she appeals to God against him, as an unrighteous man, and desires that he would interpose, and by his providence show who was in the right and who in the wrong: or "the Lord will judge" (l); expressing her confidence not only in the justness of her cause, but in the appearance of divine Providence in her favour; believing that the Lord would arise and help her, and defend her against the insults made upon her, and resent the injury done her. <p>(i)  "injuria mea super te est", Cocceius; so Ainsworth.

Sarai’s passionate and unjust complaint is the utterance of jealousy. Abram is not to blame for the step which she herself had recommended in accordance with the custom of the age. The possibility, that in these cases the position of the mistress might be compromised by the insolence of the handmaid, formed the subject of special provision in the Code of Hammurabi. “Branding was the punishment inflicted upon the owner’s handmaid who arrogantly set herself on an equality with her mistress” (§ 146: see S.

An irreverent use of the Divine name on the part of Sarai (Calvin), and a speech arguing great passion (Ainsworth). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/genesis/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a> this divine revelation is described as the making of a covenant (&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514;, from &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492; to cut, lit., the bond concluded by cutting up the sacrificial animals), and the substance of this covenant is embraced in the promise, that God would give that land to the seed of Abram, from the river of Egypt to the great river Euphrates. The river (&#1504;&#1492;&#1512;) of Egypt is the Nile, and not the brook (&#1504;&#1495;&#1500;) of Egypt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/34-5.htm">Numbers 34:5</a>), i.e., the boundary stream Rhinocorura, Wady el Arish. According to the oratorical character of the promise, the two large rivers, the Nile and the Euphrates, are mentioned as the boundaries within which the seed of Abram would possess the promised land, the exact limits of which are more minutely described in the list of the tribes who were then in possession. Ten tribes are mentioned between the southern border of the land and the extreme north, "to convey the impression of universality without exception, of unqualified completeness, the symbol of which is the number ten" (Delitzsch). In other passages we find sometimes seven tribes mentioned (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-1.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/3-10.htm">Joshua 3:10</a>), at other times six (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-17.htm">Exodus 3:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-23.htm">Exodus 23:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/20-17.htm">Deuteronomy 20:17</a>), at others five (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-5.htm">Exodus 13:5</a>), at others again only two (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/13-7.htm">Genesis 13:7</a>); whilst occasionally they are all included in the common name of Canaanites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-6.htm">Genesis 12:6</a>). The absence of the Hivites is striking here, since they are not omitted from any other list where as many as five or seven tribes are mentioned. Out of the eleven descendants of Canaan (<a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/10-15.htm">Genesis 10:15-18</a>) the names of four only are given here; the others are included in the common name of the Canaanites. On the other hand, four tribes are given, whose descent from Canaan is very improbable. The origin of the Kenites cannot be determined. According to <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-16.htm">Judges 1:16</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/4-11.htm">Judges 4:11</a>, Hobab, the brother-in-law of Moses, was a Kenite. His being called Midianite (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/10-29.htm">Numbers 10:29</a>) does not prove that he was descended from Midian (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-2.htm">Genesis 25:2</a>), but is to be accounted for from the fact that he dwelt in the land of Midian, or among the Midianites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/2-15.htm">Exodus 2:15</a>). This branch of the Kenites went with the Israelites to Canaan, into the wilderness of Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-16.htm">Judges 1:16</a>), and dwelt even in Saul's time among the Amalekites on the southern border of Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-6.htm">1 Samuel 15:6</a>), and in the same towns with members of the tribe of Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-29.htm">1 Samuel 30:29</a>). There is nothing either in this passage, or in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/24-21.htm">Numbers 24:21-22</a>, to compel us to distinguish these Midianitish Kenites from those of Canaan. The Philistines also were not Canaanites, and yet their territory was assigned to the Israelites. And just as the Philistines had forced their way into the land, so the Kenites may have taken possession of certain tracts of the country. All that can be inferred from the two passages is, that there were Kenites outside Midian, who were to be exterminated by the Israelites. On the Kenizzites, all that can be affirmed with certainty is, that the name is neither to be traced to the Edomitish Kenaz (<a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/36-15.htm">Genesis 36:15</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/36-42.htm">Genesis 36:42</a>), nor to be identified with the Kenezite Jephunneh, the father of Caleb of Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-12.htm">Numbers 32:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/14-6.htm">Joshua 14:6</a> : see my Comm. on Joshua, p. 356, Eng. tr.). - The Kadmonites are never mentioned again, and their origin cannot be determined. On the Perizzites see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/13-7.htm">Genesis 13:7</a>; on the Rephaims, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-5.htm">Genesis 14:5</a>; and on the other names, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/10-15.htm">Genesis 10:15-16</a>. </body></html>
