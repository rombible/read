She was to be Sarai’s representative, and though now she would hold the highest place in the household next to Sarai, because of this relation to Abram, yet she would continue to be Sarai’s maid.

Sarai falls upon Abram, and very unjustly charges him with the injury, suspecting that he countenanced Hagar’s insolence: and as one not willing to hear what Abram had to say, she rashly appeals to God.

We may thank ourselves for the guilt and grief that follow us, when we go out of the way of our duty. See it in this case, Passionate people often quarrel with others, for things of which they themselves must bear the blame. Sarai had given her maid to Abram, yet she cries out, My wrong be upon thee. That is never said wisely, which pride and anger put into our mouths. Those are not always in the right, who are most loud and forward in appealing to God: such rash and bold imprecations commonly speak guilt and a bad cause. Hagar forgot that she herself had first given the provocation, by despising her mistress.

"The Lord hath restrained me." It was natural to the ancient mind to recognize the power and will of God in all things. "I shall be builded by her," &#1488;&#1489;&#1504;&#1492;  '&#305;&#770;ba&#772;neh, built as the foundation of a house, by the addition of sons or daughters (&#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;  ba&#772;n&#305;&#770;ym or &#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1514;  ba&#772;no&#770;t). She thought she had or wished to have a share in the promise, if not by herself personally, yet through her maid. The faith of Sarah had not yet come fully to the birth. Abram yields to the suggestion of his wife, and complies with the custom of the country. Ten years had elapsed since they had entered the land they were to inherit. Impatience at the long delay leads to an invention of their own for obtaining an heir. The contempt of her maid was unjustifiable. But it was the natural consequence of Sarai's own improper and imprudent step, in giving her to her husband as a concubine. Unwilling, however, to see in herself the occasion of her maid's insolence, she transfers the blame to her husband, who empowers or reminds her of her power still to deal with her as it pleased her. Hagar, unable to bear the yoke of humiliation, flees from her mistress.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/genesis/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. Sarai &#8230; gave her to &#8230; Abram to be his wife&#8212;"Wife" is here used to describe an inferior, though not degrading, relation, in countries where polygamy prevails. In the case of these female slaves, who are the personal property of his lady, being purchased before her marriage or given as a special present to her, no one can become the husband's secondary wife without her mistress consent or permission. This usage seems to have prevailed in patriarchal times; and Hagar, Sarai's slave, of whom she had the entire right of disposing, was given by her mistress' spontaneous offer, to be the secondary wife of Abram, in the hope of obtaining the long-looked-for heir. It was a wrong step&#8212;indicating a want of simple reliance on God&#8212;and Sarai was the first to reap the bitter fruits of her device.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/genesis/16.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> For barrenness in itself was a reproach, and especially to Sarai, who seemed to be a person rejected by God, as one whom he would not honour with being the mother of that Seed; and Hagar being suddenly made Sarai’s partner in the privilege of Abram’s bed, and superior to her in respect of that great blessing of child-bearing, it is no wonder if she grew insolent upon it, especially being advanced so highly from so low a condition. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/genesis/16.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived,....

Whether Hagar imagined Sarai to be through her barrenness "tanquam <span class="accented">a Divino promisso repudiatam"</span> (Lyra), or anticipated Sarai's displacement from her position as Abram s wife (Inglis), she, immediately on perceiving her condition, became insolent (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-23.htm">Proverbs 30:23</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/genesis/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a> this divine revelation is described as the making of a covenant (&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514;, from &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492; to cut, lit., the bond concluded by cutting up the sacrificial animals), and the substance of this covenant is embraced in the promise, that God would give that land to the seed of Abram, from the river of Egypt to the great river Euphrates. The river (&#1504;&#1492;&#1512;) of Egypt is the Nile, and not the brook (&#1504;&#1495;&#1500;) of Egypt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/34-5.htm">Numbers 34:5</a>), i.e., the boundary stream Rhinocorura, Wady el Arish. According to the oratorical character of the promise, the two large rivers, the Nile and the Euphrates, are mentioned as the boundaries within which the seed of Abram would possess the promised land, the exact limits of which are more minutely described in the list of the tribes who were then in possession. Ten tribes are mentioned between the southern border of the land and the extreme north, "to convey the impression of universality without exception, of unqualified completeness, the symbol of which is the number ten" (Delitzsch). In other passages we find sometimes seven tribes mentioned (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-1.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/3-10.htm">Joshua 3:10</a>), at other times six (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-17.htm">Exodus 3:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-23.htm">Exodus 23:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/20-17.htm">Deuteronomy 20:17</a>), at others five (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-5.htm">Exodus 13:5</a>), at others again only two (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/13-7.htm">Genesis 13:7</a>); whilst occasionally they are all included in the common name of Canaanites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-6.htm">Genesis 12:6</a>). The absence of the Hivites is striking here, since they are not omitted from any other list where as many as five or seven tribes are mentioned. Out of the eleven descendants of Canaan (<a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/10-15.htm">Genesis 10:15-18</a>) the names of four only are given here; the others are included in the common name of the Canaanites. On the other hand, four tribes are given, whose descent from Canaan is very improbable. The origin of the Kenites cannot be determined. According to <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-16.htm">Judges 1:16</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/4-11.htm">Judges 4:11</a>, Hobab, the brother-in-law of Moses, was a Kenite. His being called Midianite (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/10-29.htm">Numbers 10:29</a>) does not prove that he was descended from Midian (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-2.htm">Genesis 25:2</a>), but is to be accounted for from the fact that he dwelt in the land of Midian, or among the Midianites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/2-15.htm">Exodus 2:15</a>). This branch of the Kenites went with the Israelites to Canaan, into the wilderness of Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-16.htm">Judges 1:16</a>), and dwelt even in Saul's time among the Amalekites on the southern border of Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-6.htm">1 Samuel 15:6</a>), and in the same towns with members of the tribe of Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-29.htm">1 Samuel 30:29</a>). There is nothing either in this passage, or in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/24-21.htm">Numbers 24:21-22</a>, to compel us to distinguish these Midianitish Kenites from those of Canaan. The Philistines also were not Canaanites, and yet their territory was assigned to the Israelites. And just as the Philistines had forced their way into the land, so the Kenites may have taken possession of certain tracts of the country. All that can be inferred from the two passages is, that there were Kenites outside Midian, who were to be exterminated by the Israelites. On the Kenizzites, all that can be affirmed with certainty is, that the name is neither to be traced to the Edomitish Kenaz (<a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/36-15.htm">Genesis 36:15</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/36-42.htm">Genesis 36:42</a>), nor to be identified with the Kenezite Jephunneh, the father of Caleb of Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-12.htm">Numbers 32:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/14-6.htm">Joshua 14:6</a> : see my Comm. on Joshua, p. 356, Eng. tr.). - The Kadmonites are never mentioned again, and their origin cannot be determined. On the Perizzites see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/13-7.htm">Genesis 13:7</a>; on the Rephaims, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-5.htm">Genesis 14:5</a>; and on the other names, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/10-15.htm">Genesis 10:15-16</a>. </body></html>
