Soc. Bibl. Arch., </span>i. 343, ii. 430), yet the absence of any convenient writing material for ordinary use would oblige men in those ancient days to content themselves with short inscriptions, like those tablets of clay brought from Ur, many of which now in the British. Museum are said to be considerably older than the time of Abram. The narrator would naturally make but few alterations in such precious-documents, and hence a certain amount of recapitulation, like that which we find in the Books of Samuel, where again we have not a narrative from one pen, but the arrangement of materials already ancient. As, however, the Divine object was the revealing to mankind of the way by which God would raise up man from the fall, the narrator would be guided by inspiration in his choice of materials, and in the omission of such things as did not fall in with this purpose; and the evident reverence with which he deals with these records is a warrant to us of their genuineness. Such additions as the remark that the “Valley of Shaveh” was many centuries later called “the King’s Dale” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-17.htm" title="And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which is the king's dale.">Genesis 14:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-18.htm" title="Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a pillar, which is in the king's dale: for he said, I have no son to keep my name in remembrance: and he called the pillar after his own name: and it is called to this day, Absalom's place.">2Samuel 18:18</a>) are generally acknowledged to have been the work of Ezra and the men of the Great Synagogue, after the return from the exile.<p><span class= "bld">Hagar.</span>—As this word apparently comes from the Arabic verb <span class= "ital">to flee, </span>it cannot have been her original name, unless we suppose that she really was an Arab fugitive who had taken refuge in Egypt.

This was done without asking counsel of the Lord. Unbelief worked, God's almighty power was forgotten. It was a bad example, and a source of manifold uneasiness. In every relation and situation in life there is some cross for us to bear: much of the exercise of faith consists in patiently submitting, in waiting the Lord's time, and using only those means which he appoints for the removal of the cross. Foul temptations may have very fair pretences, and be coloured with that which is very plausible. Fleshly wisdom puts us out of God's way. This would not be the case, if we would ask counsel of God by his word and by prayer, before we attempt that which is doubtful.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/genesis/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A Mizrite handmaid. - Hagar was probably obtained, ten years before, during their sojourn in Egypt. "The Lord hath restrained me." It was natural to the ancient mind to recognize the power and will of God in all things. "I shall be builded by her," &#1488;&#1489;&#1504;&#1492;  '&#305;&#770;ba&#772;neh, built as the foundation of a house, by the addition of sons or daughters (&#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;  ba&#772;n&#305;&#770;ym or &#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1514;  ba&#772;no&#770;t). She thought she had or wished to have a share in the promise, if not by herself personally, yet through her maid. The faith of Sarah had not yet come fully to the birth. Abram yields to the suggestion of his wife, and complies with the custom of the country. Ten years had elapsed since they had entered the land they were to inherit. Impatience at the long delay leads to an invention of their own for obtaining an heir. The contempt of her maid was unjustifiable. But it was the natural consequence of Sarai's own improper and imprudent step, in giving her to her husband as a concubine. Unwilling, however, to see in herself the occasion of her maid's insolence, she transfers the blame to her husband, who empowers or reminds her of her power still to deal with her as it pleased her. Hagar, unable to bear the yoke of humiliation, flees from her mistress.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/genesis/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 16<p>Ge 16:1-16.

She is before said to be barren, and he to be childless, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/11-30.htm">Genesis 11:30</a>; God had promised him a seed, but as yet he had none, which was a trial of his faith; he had been married many years to Sarai his wife, she was his wife when they came out of Ur of the Chaldees, and how long before cannot be said; they stayed and dwelt some time at Haran, the Jews (x) say five years, and they had been now ten years in the land of Canaan, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/16-3.htm">Genesis 16:3</a>; and were advanced in years, the one being seventy five, and the other eighty five, so that there was no great probability of having any children, wherefore the following step was taken: <p>and she had an handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar; no doubt but she had many, but this was a principal one, that might be over others, and was chiefly entrusted with the care and management of family affairs under her mistress; she might be the daughter of an Egyptian, born in Abram's house, as Eliezer was the son of a Syrian of Damascus, born there also; or she might be one of the maidservants Pharaoh, king of Egypt, gave to Abram, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-16.htm">Genesis 12:16</a>; the Jews (y) have a tradition, that she was a daughter of Pharaoh, who, when he saw the wonders done for Sarai, said, it is better that my daughter should be a handmaid in this house, than a mistress in another, and therefore gave her to Sarai; others say (z) she was a daughter of his by a concubine, but neither is probable: from her came the people called Hagarites, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-10.htm">1 Chronicles 5:10</a>, and Hagarenes, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/83-6.htm">Psalm 83:6</a>; and there were a people in Arabia called Agraei, both by Strabo (a) and Pliny (b); and the latter speaks of a royal city in that country called Agra, which seem to have their names from this person. Melo (c), an Heathen writer, speaking of Abram, says, that he had two wives, one of his own country, and akin to him, and the other an Egyptian, a servant; of the Egyptian he beget twelve sons, who, going into Arabia, divided the country among them, and were the first that reigned over the inhabitants of it; as to her twelve sons, he mistakes, for these were not Hagar's sons by Abram, but her grandsons, the sons of Ishmael, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-20.htm">Genesis 17:20</a>. <p>(x) Seder Olam Rabba, p. 2.((y) Targum Jon. &amp; Jarchi in loc.

His theory supposes that the <span class="ital">Muṣri</span> of N. Arabia was at an early time confounded by the Israelites with the more famous, but similarly sounding, <span class="ital">Miṣri</span>, “an inhabitant of Egypt.” But, in view of the continual intercourse between Palestine and Egypt, as shewn by the Tel-el-Amarna tablets, the theory is improbable, and uncalled for.

Cf. Hegirah, the flight of Mahomet. Not her original designation, but given to her afterwards, either because of her flight from Egypt (Ambrose, Wordsworth), or because of her escape from her mistress (Michaelis, Bush, 'Speaker's Commentary'). Though not the imaginary or mythical (Bohlen), it is doubtful if she was the real (Ainsworth, Bush), ancestor of the Hagarenes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-10.htm">1 Chronicles 5:10, 19, 20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/27-31.htm">1 Chronicles 27:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/83-6.htm">Psalm 83:6, 8</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/genesis/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"And when the sun was just about to go down (on the construction, see Ges. 132), and deep sleep (&#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492;, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/2-21.htm">Genesis 2:21</a>, a deep sleep produced by God) had fallen upon Abram, behold there fell upon him terror, great darkness." The vision here passes into a prophetic sleep produced by God. In this sleep there fell upon Abram dread and darkness; this is shown by the interchange of the perfect &#1504;&#1508;&#1500;&#1492; and the participle &#1504;&#1508;&#1500;&#1514;. The reference to the time is intended to show "the supernatural character of the darkness and sleep, and the distinction between the vision and a dream" (O. v. Gerlach). It also possesses a symbolical meaning. The setting of the sun prefigured to Abram the departure of the sun of grace, which shone upon Israel, and the commencement of a dark and dreadful period of suffering for his posterity, the very anticipation of which involved Abram in darkness. For the words which he heard in the darkness were these (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-13.htm">Genesis 15:13</a>.): "Know of a surety, that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them (the lords of the strange land), and they (the foreigners) shall oppress them 400 years." That these words had reference to the sojourn of the children of Israel in Egypt, is placed beyond all doubt by the fulfilment. The 400 years were, according to prophetic language, a round number for the 430 years that Israel spent in Egypt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-40.htm">Exodus 12:40</a>). "Also that nation whom they shall serve will I judge (see the fulfilment, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-11.htm">Exodus 6:11</a>); and afterward shall they come out with great substance (the actual fact according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-31.htm">Exodus 12:31-36</a>). And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace, and be buried in a good old age (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/25-7.htm">Genesis 25:7-8</a>); and in the fourth generation they shall come hither again." The calculations are made here on the basis of a hundred years to a generation: not too much for those times, when the average duration of life was above 150 years, and Isaac was born in the hundredth year of Abraham's life. "For the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full." Amorite, the name of the most powerful tribe of the Canaanites, is used here as the common name of all the inhabitants of Canaan, just as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/24-15.htm">Joshua 24:15</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-5.htm">Genesis 10:5</a>), <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/6-10.htm">Judges 6:10</a>, etc.).<p>By this revelation Abram had the future history of his seed pointed out to him in general outlines, and was informed at the same time why neither he nor his descendants could obtain immediate possession of the promised land, viz., because the Canaanites were not yet ripe for the sentence of extermination. </body></html>
