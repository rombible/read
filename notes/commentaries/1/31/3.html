It is there ascribed to Elohim, but here to Jehovah. The narrator’s purpose in this, probably, is to show that while Jacob regarded the providence that watched over him as the act of Elohim, it was really in His character of Jehovah, the covenant-God, that He thus guarded him. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/26-29.htm" title="That you will do us no hurt, as we have not touched you, and as we have done to you nothing but good, and have sent you away in peace: you are now the blessed of the LORD.">Genesis 26:29</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Thy kindred.</span>—Heb., <span class= "ital">thy birthplace, </span>as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-1.htm" title="Now the LORD had said to Abram, Get you out of your country, and from your kindred, and from your father's house, to a land that I will show you:">Genesis 12:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-4.htm" title="But you shall go to my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife to my son Isaac.">Genesis 24:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-7.htm" title="The LORD God of heaven, which took me from my father's house, and from the land of my kindred, and which spoke to me, and that swore to me, saying, To your seed will I give this land; he shall send his angel before you, and you shall take a wife to my son from there.">Genesis 24:7</a>, &c.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/genesis/31.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/31-3.htm" title="And the LORD said to Jacob, Return to the land of your fathers, and to your kindred; and I will be with you....">Genesis 31:3-4</a>. </span><span class="ital">The Lord said unto Jacob, Return — </span>God, who orders all things aright, having blessed Jacob with greater substance in the house of Laban than he could have obtained in his father’s house, without great inconveniences, perhaps irreconcilable, fatal hatred between him and his brother Esau, now orders him to return.

The Bible teaches people the common duties of life, how to serve God, how to enjoy the blessings he bestows, and to do good in the various stations and duties of life. Selfish men consider themselves robbed of all that goes past them, and covetousness will even swallow up natural affection. Men's overvaluing worldly wealth is that error which is the root of covetousness, envy, and all evil. The men of the world stand in each other's way, and every one seems to be taking away from the rest; hence discontent, envy, and discord. But there are possessions that will suffice for all; happy they who seek them in the first place. In all our removals we should have respect to the command and promise of God. If He be with us, we need not fear. The perils which surround us are so many, that nothing else can really encourage our hearts. To remember favoured seasons of communion with God, is very refreshing when in difficulties; and we should often recollect our vows, that we fail not to fulfil them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/genesis/31.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Circumstances at length induce Jacob to propose flight to his wives. His prosperity provokes the envy and slander of Laban's sons, and Laban himself becomes estranged. The Lord now commands Jacob to return, and promises him his presence to protect him. Jacob now opens his mind fully to Rachel and Leah. Rachel, we observe, is put first. Several new facts come out in his discourse to them. Ye know - Jacob appeals to his wives on this point - "that with all my might I served your father." He means, of course, to the extent of his engagement. During the last six years he was to provide for his own house, as the Lord permitted him, with the full knowledge and concurrence of Laban. Beyond this, which is a fair and acknowledged exception, he has been faithful in keeping the cattle of Laban. "Your father deceived me, and changed my wages ten times;" that is, as often as he could.<p>If, at the end of the first year, he found that Jacob had gained considerably, though he began with nothing, he might change his wages every following half-year, and so actually change them ten times in five years. In this case, the preceding chapter only records his original expedients, and then states the final result. "God suffered him not to hurt me." Jacob, we are to remember, left his hire to the providence of God. He thought himself bound at the same time to use all legitimate means for the attainment of the desired end. His expedients may have been perfectly legitimate in the circumstances, but they were evidently of no avail without the divine blessing. And they would become wholly ineffectual when his wages were changed. Hence, he says, God took the cattle and gave them to me. Jacob seems here to record two dreams, the former of which is dated at the rutting season. The dream indicates the result by a symbolic representation, which ascribes it rather to the God of nature than to the man of art. The second dream makes allusion to the former as a process still going on up to the present time. This appears to be an encouragement to Jacob now to commit himself to the Lord on his way home. The angel of the Lord, we observe, announces himself as the God of Bethel, and recalls to Jacob the pillar and the vow. The angel, then, is Yahweh manifesting himself to human apprehension.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/genesis/31.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. the Lord said &#8230; Return unto the land of thy fathers&#8212;Notwithstanding the ill usage he had received, Jacob might not have deemed himself at liberty to quit his present sphere, under the impulse of passionate fretfulness and discontent. Having been conducted to Haran by God (Ge 28:15) and having got a promise that the same heavenly Guardian would bring him again into the land of Canaan, he might have thought he ought not to leave it, without being clearly persuaded as to the path of duty. So ought we to set the Lord before us, and to acknowledge Him in all our ways, our journeys, our settlements, and plans in life.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/genesis/31.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/genesis/31.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the Lord said unto Jacob,....

He undertook that himself, probably to make more sure, and then gave those which were set apart as Jacob's wages to his own sons to tend, since it was Jacob's duty to take care of Laban's flock, and "set three days' journey betwixt himself and Jacob," i.e., between the flock to be tended by himself through his sons, and that to be tended by Jacob, for the purpose of preventing any copulation between the animals of the two flocks. Nevertheless he was overreached by Jacob, who adopted a double method of increasing the wages agreed upon. In the first place (<a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-37.htm">Genesis 30:37-39</a>), he took fresh rods of storax, maple, and walnut-trees, all of which have a dazzling white wood under their dark outside, and peeled white stripes upon them, &#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1489;&#1503; &#1502;&#1495;&#1513;&#1474;&#1507; (the verbal noun instead of the inf. abs. &#1495;&#1513;&#1474;&#1507;), "peeling the white naked in the rods." These partially peeled, and therefore mottled rods, he placed in the drinking-troughs (&#1512;&#1492;&#1496;&#1497;&#1501; lit., gutters, from &#1512;&#1492;&#1496;  equals  &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509; to run, is explained by &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; &#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1514;&#1493;&#1514; water-troughs), to which the flock came to drink, in front of the animals, in order that, if copulation took place at the drinking time, it might occur near the mottled sticks, and the young be speckled and spotted in consequence. &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1495;&#1502;&#1504;&#1492; a rare, antiquated form for &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1502;&#1504;&#1492; from &#1495;&#1502;&#1501;, and &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1495;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468; for &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1495;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468; imperf. Kal of &#1497;&#1495;&#1501;  equals  &#1495;&#1502;&#1501;. This artifice was founded upon a fact frequently noticed, particularly in the case of sheep, that whatever fixes their attention in copulation is marked upon the young (see the proofs in Bochart, Hieroz. 1, 618, and Friedreich zur Bibel 1, 37ff.). - Secondly (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/30-40.htm">Genesis 30:40</a>), Jacob separated the speckled animals thus obtained from those of a normal colour, and caused the latter to feed so that the others would be constantly in sight, in order that he might in this way obtain a constant accession of mottled sheep. As soon as these had multiplied sufficiently, he formed separate flocks (viz., of the speckled additions), "and put them not unto Laban's cattle;" i.e., he kept them apart in order that a still larger number of speckled ones might be procured, through Laban's one-coloured flock having this mottled group constantly in view. </body></html>
