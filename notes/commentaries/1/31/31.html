Though they have no love to God's people, they will pretend to it, and try to make a merit of necessity. Foolish Laban! to call those things his gods which could be stolen! Enemies may steal our goods, but not our God. Here Laban lays to Jacob's charge things that he knew not. Those who commit their cause to God, are not forbidden to plead it themselves with meekness and fear. When we read of Rachel's stealing her father's images, what a scene of iniquity opens! The family of Nahor, who left the idolatrous Chaldees; is this family itself become idolatrous? It is even so. The truth seems to be, that they were like some in after-times, who sware by the Lord and by Malcham, Zep 1:5; and like others in our times, who wish to serve both God and mammon. Great numbers will acknowledge the true God in words, but their hearts and houses are the abodes of spiritual idolatry. When a man gives himself up to covetousness, like Laban, the world is his god; and he has only to reside among gross idolaters in order to become one, or at least a favourer of their abominations.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/genesis/31.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Laban's expostulation and Jacob's reply. What hast thou done? Laban intimates that he would have dismissed him honorably and affectionately, and therefore, that his flight was needless and unkind; and finally charges him with stealing his gods. Jacob gives him to understand that he did not expect fair treatment at his hands, and gives him leave to search for his gods, not knowing that Rachel had taken them.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/genesis/31.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>31, 32. Jacob said, &#8230; With whomsoever thou findest thy gods let him not live&#8212;Conscious of his own innocence and little suspecting the misdeed of his favorite wife, Jacob boldly challenged a search and denounced the heaviest penalty on the culprit. A personal scrutiny was made by Laban, who examined every tent [Ge 31:33]; and having entered Rachel's last, he would have infallibly discovered the stolen images had not Rachel made an appeal to him which prevented further search [Ge 31:34, 35].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/genesis/31.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/genesis/31.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Jacob answered and said to Laban, because I was afraid,.... That he would have done all he could to have hindered him from going away himself; and not only so, but would have prevented his taking his daughters with him; and especially would have detained his cattle; but of this last Jacob makes no mention, only of the former: <p>for I said; either within himself, or to his wives: <p>peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy daughters from me; which of right belonged to him; for though they were Laban's daughters, they were Jacob's wives; and being given in marriage to him, he had a right unto them, and to take them with him; nor had Laban any right to detain them, which Jacob feared he would have attempted to have done, had he known his design; and this must have been done by force if done at all; for neither Jacob nor his wives would have agreed that they should stay with Laban upon his departure: what Laban charges Jacob with, in going away with his wives, he himself would have done, namely, using force to them. Laban's charge was false, but there was much reason for Jacob's suspicion. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/genesis/31.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid: for I said, Peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy daughters from me.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/genesis/31.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">31</span>. <span class="ital">I was afraid</span>] Jacob’s defence is brief: (1) he fled because he could not trust Laban, who, he thought, would keep his daughters by force; (2) as to the <span class="ital">teraphim</span>, he was innocent; if any of his party had stolen them, they should be punished by death.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/31.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 31, 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jacob answered</span> - "in an able and powerful speech" (Kalisch) - <span class="cmt_word">and said to Laban</span> (replying to his first interrogation as to why Jacob had stolen away unawares), <span class="cmt_word">Because I was afraid: for I said</span> (sc. to myself), <span class="cmt_word">Peradventure</span> (literally, lest, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>.

Accordingly, the import of his words has been mollified by regarding them simply as a prediction, "he will not live," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. he will die before his time (Jonathan), a prediction which, the Rabbins note, was fulfilled in Rachel (<span class="accented">vide</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-16.htm">Genesis 35:16, 18</a>); or by connecting them with clause following, "he will not live before our brethren," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. let him be henceforth cut off from the society of his kinsmen (LXX., Bush). Yet, even as thus explained, the language of Jacob was precipitats, since he ought first to have inquired at his wives and children before pronouncing so emphatically on a matter of which he was entirely ignorant (Calvin). <span class="cmt_word">Before our brethren</span> - not Jacob's sons, but Laban's kinsmen (ver. 23) - <span class="cmt_word">discern thou</span> - literally, <span class="accented">examine closely for thyself</span>, the hiph. of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span> (to be strange) meaning to press strongly into a thing, i.e. to perceive it by finding out its distinguishing characteristics (<span class="accented">vide</span> Furst, <span class="accented">sub voce</span>) - <span class="cmt_word">what is thine with me, and take it to thee.</span> <span class="cmt_word">For</span> (literally, and) <span class="cmt_word">Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them</span> - otherwise he would have spoken with less heat and more caution. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/genesis/31.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Laban's Pursuit, Reconciliation, and Covenant with Jacob. - As Laban was not told till the third day after the flight, though he pursued the fugitives with his brethren, i.e., his nearest relations, he did not overtake Jacob for seven days, by which time he had reached the mountains of Gilead (<a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/31-22.htm">Genesis 31:22-24</a>). The night before he overtook them, he was warned by God in a dream, "not to speak to Jacob from good to bad," i.e., not to say anything decisive and emphatic for the purpose of altering what had already occurred (vid., <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/31-29.htm">Genesis 31:29</a>, and the note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-50.htm">Genesis 24:50</a>). Hence he confined himself, when they met, "to bitter reproaches combining paternal feeling on the one hand with hypocrisy on the other;" in which he told them that he had the power to do them harm, if God had not forbidden him, and charged them with stealing his gods (the teraphim). </body></html>
