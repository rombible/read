This corrected him for the fraud on his father. The blessing shall be conferred on him, yet he shall smart for the indirect course taken to obtain it. Jacob is dismissed by his father with a solemn charge. He must not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan: those who profess religion, should not marry with those that care not for religion. Also with a solemn blessing. Isaac had before blessed him unwittingly; now he does it designedly. This blessing is more full than the former; it is a gospel blessing. This promise looks as high as heaven, of which Canaan was a type. That was the better country which Jacob and the other patriarchs had in view.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/genesis/28.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Isaac has now become alive to the real destiny of Jacob. He therefore calls for him to bless him, and give him a command. The command is to take a wife, not from Kenaan, but from the kindred of his parents. The blessing comes from "God Almighty" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-1.htm">Genesis 17:1</a>). It is that belonging to the chosen seed, "the blessing of Abraham." It embraces a numerous offspring, the land of promise, and all else that is included in the blessing of Abraham. "A congregation of peoples." This is the word "congregation" (&#1511;&#1492;&#1500;  qa&#770;ha&#772;l) which is afterward applied to the assembled people of God, and to which the Greek &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;  ekkle&#772;sia, "ecclesia," corresponds. Jacob complies with his mother's advice and his father's command, and, at the same time, reaps the bitter fruit of his fraud against his brother in the hardship and treachery of an exile of twenty years. The aged Isaac is not without his share in the unpleasant consequences of endeavoring to go against the will of God.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/genesis/28.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 28<p>Ge 28:1-19.

Isaac called Jacob and blessed him&#8212;He entered fully into Rebekah's feelings, and the burden of his parting counsel to his son was to avoid a marriage alliance with any but the Mesopotamian branch of the family. At the same time he gave him a solemn blessing&#8212;pronounced before unwittingly, now designedly, and with a cordial spirit. It is more explicitly and fully given, and Jacob was thus acknowledged "the heir of the promise."<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/genesis/28.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/genesis/28.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And give thee the blessing of Abraham, to thee, and to thy seed with thee,....

The same blessing as Abraham received is now pronounced by Isaac upon Jacob, recognizing him as the religious representative of the family, and ignoring Esau. This verse would be almost unintelligible, if we were not on literary grounds sure that this section is from the P tradition, and is independent of the J narrative (chap. 27), which describes Isaac’s age and Jacob’s deceit towards his father in obtaining the blessing of the firstborn. This is not the blessing of a dying man, but of a father parting with a son. It repeats, in a summary form, the national aspect of Abraham’s blessing. It lacks the poetical vigour and spiritual interest of the blessing in J (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/27-27.htm" title="And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell of his raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which the LORD has blessed:...">Genesis 27:27-29</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the land of thy sojournings</span>] A P phrase: see note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-8.htm" title="And I will give to you, and to your seed after you, the land wherein you are a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God.">Genesis 17:8</a>, and cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/36-7.htm" title="For their riches were more than that they might dwell together; and the land wherein they were strangers could not bear them because of their cattle.">Genesis 36:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/37-1.htm" title="And Jacob dwelled in the land wherein his father was a stranger, in the land of Canaan.">Genesis 37:1</a>.
