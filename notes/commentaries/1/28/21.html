In this observe, 1. Jacob's faith. He trusts that God will be with him, and will keep him; he depends upon it. 2. Jacob's moderation in his desires. He asks not for soft clothing and dainty meat. If God give us much, we are bound to be thankful, and to use it for him; if he gives us but little, we are bound to be content, and cheerfully to enjoy him in it. 3. Jacob's piety, and his regard to God, appear in what he desired, that God would be with him, and keep him. We need desire no more to make us easy and happy. Also his resolution is, to cleave to the Lord, as his God in covenant. When we receive more than common mercy from God, we should abound in gratitude to him. The tenth is a fit proportion to be devoted to God, and employed for him; though it may be more or less, as God prospers us, 1Co 16:2. Let us then remember our Bethels, how we stand engaged by solemn vows to yield ourselves to the Lord, to take him for our God, and to devote all we have and are to his glory!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/genesis/28.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Jacob's vow. A vow is a solemn engagement to perform a certain duty, the obligation of which is felt at the time to be especially binding. It partakes, therefore, of the nature of a promise or a covenant. It involves in its obligation, however, only one party, and is the spontaneous act of that party. Here, then, Jacob appears to take a step in advance of his predecessors. Hitherto, God had taken the initiative in every promise, and the everlasting covenant rests solely on his eternal purpose. Abraham had responded to the call of God, believed in the Lord, walked before him, entered into communion with him, made intercession with him, and given up his only son to him at his demand. In all this there is an acceptance on the part of the creature of the supremacy of the merciful Creator. But now the spirit of adoption prompts Jacob to a spontaneous movement toward God. This is no ordinary vow, referring to some special or occasional resolve.<p>It is the grand and solemn expression of the soul's free, full, and perpetual acceptance of the Lord to be its own God. This is the most frank and open utterance of newborn spiritual liberty from the heart of man that has yet appeared in the divine record. "If God will be with me." This is not the condition on which Jacob will accept God in a mercenary spirit. It is merely the echo and the thankful acknowledgment of the divine assurance, "I am with thee," which was given immediately before. It is the response of the son to the assurance of the father: "Wilt thou indeed be with me? Thou shalt be my God." "This stone shall be God's house," a monument of the presence of God among his people, and a symbol of the indwelling of his Spirit in their hearts. As it comes in here it signalizes the grateful and loving welcome and entertainment which God receives from his saints. "A tenth will I surely give unto thee." The honored guest is treated as one of the family. Ten is the whole: a tenth is a share of the whole. The Lord of all receives one share as an acknowledgment of his sovereign right to all. Here it is represented as the full share given to the king who condescends to dwell with his subjects. Thus, Jacob opens his heart, his home, and his treasure to God. These are the simple elements of a theocracy, a national establishment of the true religion. The spirit of power, and of love, and of a sound mind, has begun to reign in Jacob. As the Father is prominently manifested in regenerate Abraham, and the Son in Isaac, so also the Spirit in Jacob. <p> - Jacob's Marriage<p>6. &#1512;&#1495;&#1500;  ra&#772;che&#772;l, Rachel, "a ewe."<p>16. &#1500;&#1488;&#1492;  le&#770;'a&#770;h, Leah, "wearied."<p>24. &#1494;&#1500;&#1508;&#1492;  z&#305;&#770;lpa&#770;h, Zilpah, "drop?"<p>29. &#1489;&#1500;&#1492;&#1492;  b&#305;&#770;lha&#770;h, Bilhah, "timidity."<p>32. &#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1503;  re'uvbe&#772;n, Reuben, "behold a son."

Jacob's Vow.<p>20. Jacob vowed a vow&#8212;His words are not to be considered as implying a doubt, far less as stating the condition or terms on which he would dedicate himself to God. Let "if" be changed into "since," and the language will appear a proper expression of Jacob's faith&#8212;an evidence of his having truly embraced the promise. How edifying often to meditate on Jacob at Beth-el.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/genesis/28.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> I will publicly own him for my God and the Saviour of men, and will establish his solemn worship, as it follows. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/genesis/28.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>So that I come again to my father's house in peace,.... In safety from Esau, and all other enemies, as God promised him he should: <p>then the Lord shall be my God; not as if he should not be his God if he did not do all this for him; which would savour not only of a mercenary spirit, but of great impiety; neither of which were to be found in Jacob: but the meaning is, that he should not only continue to own him as his God, and to worship him, but having fresh obligations upon him, should be stirred up more eagerly and devoutly to serve him in a very singular way and manner, and particularly by doing what is expressed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-22.htm">Genesis 28:22</a>. Some think he has respect to the Messiah, owning him to be the true God with the Father and the blessed Spirit, who had appeared to Abraham, and was the fear of Isaac, and whom Jacob now owned as his God: this receives some confirmation from the Targum of Jonathan, which begins the paragraph thus,"if the Word of the Lord will be my help, &amp;c. then the Lord shall be my God.'' <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/genesis/28.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">So that I come again to my father's house in peace; then shall the LORD be my God:</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/genesis/28.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">21</span>. <span class="ital">to my father’s house in peace</span>] It does not appear that this was literally fulfilled. Jacob, on his return, did not dwell at his father’s house. But, perhaps, “father’s house” means “the land of his fathers.” “In peace,” a common Heb. phrase, noticeable here for the rendering of LXX <span class="greekheb">μετὰ σωτηρίας</span>, “with safety.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">then shall the Lord be my God</span>] The rendering of the margin, <span class="ital">and the Lord will be my God, then this stone</span>, &c., is that of the ancient versions, LXX, Lat. and Syr.: that of the text is on the whole preferable. The crowning thought is that in days to come, Jehovah, who has been the God of Abraham and Isaac, shall also be the God of Jacob. This forms the substance of Jacob’s vow; to which is added, that Bethel, as well as Beer-sheba and Hebron, shall be a place of Jehovah’s worship. Jacob’s vow, with the conditions attached to it, reflects his calculating character. But it acknowledges that Jehovah is the God who has revealed Himself to his fathers, and is distinct from mere nature-gods.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/genesis/28.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Jacob's Dream at Bethel. - As he was travelling from Beersheba, where Isaac was then staying (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/26-25.htm">Genesis 26:25</a>), to Haran, Jacob came to a place where he was obliged to stop all night, because the sun had set. The words "he hit (lighted) upon the place," indicate the apparently accidental, yet really divinely appointed choice of this place for his night-quarters; and the definite article points it out as having become well known through the revelation of God that ensued. After making a pillow with the stones (&#1502;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;, head-place, pillow), he fell asleep and had a dream, in which he saw a ladder resting upon the earth, with the top reaching to heaven; and upon it angels of God going up and down, and Jehovah Himself standing above it. The ladder was a visible symbol of the real and uninterrupted fellowship between God in heaven and His people upon earth. The angels upon it carry up the wants of men to God, and bring down the assistance and protection of God to men. The ladder stood there upon the earth, just where Jacob was lying in solitude, poor, helpless, and forsaken by men. Above in heaven stood Jehovah, and explained in words the symbol which he saw. Proclaiming Himself to Jacob as the God of his fathers, He not only confirmed to him all the promises of the fathers in their fullest extent, but promised him protection on his journey and a safe return to his home (<a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/28-13.htm">Genesis 28:13-15</a>). But as the fulfilment of this promise to Jacob was still far off, God added the firm assurance, "I will not leave thee till I have done (carried out) what I have told thee." </body></html>
