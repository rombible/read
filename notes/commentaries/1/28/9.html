"Went unto Ishmael;" that is, to the family or tribe of Ishmael, as Ishmael himself was now thirteen years dead.

But he only made bad worse, and though he did not marry a "wife of the daughters of Canaan," he married into a family which God had rejected. It showed a partial reformation, but no repentance, for he gave no proofs of abating his vindictive purposes against his brother, nor cherishing that pious spirit that would have gratified his father&#8212;he was like Micah (see Jud 17:13).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/genesis/28.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="ital">1760</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Esau went unto Ishmael; </span> either to his person, or rather to his family, called Ishmael by their father’s name, as David is sometimes put for David’s posterity; for Ishmael seems to have been dead before this, from <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-17.htm" title="And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered to his people.">Genesis 25:17</a></span>, though that may possibly be a prolepsis, and then this may be Ishmael himself. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Mahalath, </span> called also <span class="ital">Bashemath, </span><span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/36-3.htm" title="And Bashemath Ishmael's daughter, sister of Nebajoth.">Genesis 36:3</a></span>.

This Esau seems to have done in order to curry favour with his father, who was displeased with his other wives, and therefore takes one of his father's brother's daughters; but in this he acted an unwise part, on more accounts than one; partly as it was taking to wife the daughter of one that was cast out of his grandfather's house, and had been a persecutor of his father, and therefore not likely to be agreeable to him; and partly as being a daughter of the bondmaid's son: children born of her could not inherit the land promised to Abraham and Isaac. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/genesis/28.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Then went Esau unto Ishmael, and took unto the wives which he had Mahalath the daughter of <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> Ishmael Abraham's son, the sister of Nebajoth, to be his wife.</span><p>(c) Thinking by this to have reconciled himself to his father, but all in vain: for he does not take away the cause of the evil.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/genesis/28.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">9</span>. <span class="ital">unto the wives</span>] i.e. in addition to Judith and Basemath (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/26-34.htm" title="And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite:">Genesis 26:34</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Mahalath … the sister of Nebaioth</span>] Nebaioth was the firstborn son of Ishmael (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-13.htm" title="And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,">Genesis 25:13</a>).
