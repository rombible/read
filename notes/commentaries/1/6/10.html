Let this be our chief desire, let us labour that we may be accepted of him. When the rest of the world was wicked, Noah kept his integrity. God's good-will towards Noah produced this good work in him. He was a just man, that is, justified before God, by faith in the promised Seed. As such he was made holy, and had right principles; and was righteous in his conversation. He was not only honest, but devout; it was his constant care to do the will of God. God looks down upon those with an eye of favour, who sincerely look up to him with an eye of faith. It is easy to be religious when religion is in fashion; but it shows strong faith and resolution, to swim against the stream, and to appear for God when no one else appears for him; Noah did so. All kinds of sin were found among men. They corrupted God's worship. Sin fills the earth with violence, and this fully justified God's resolution to destroy the world. The contagion spread. When wickedness is become general, ruin is not far off; while there is a remnant of praying people in a nation, to empty the measure as it fills, judgments may be long kept off; but when all hands are at work to pull down the fences, by sin, and none stand in the gap to make up the breach, what can be expected but a flood of wrath?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/genesis/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div> - Section VI - The Deluge<p> - XXIII.

The same rule applies to all that have gone before. The generations of the skies and the land <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-4.htm">Genesis 2:4</a> are introduced by the finishing of the skies and the land <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-1.htm">Genesis 2:1</a>; the generations of man in the line of Sheth <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/5-1.htm">Genesis 5:1</a>, by the birth of Sheth <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-25.htm">Genesis 4:25</a>; and now the generations of Noah, by the notice that Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord. The narrative here also, as usual, reverts to a point of time before the stage of affairs described in the close of the preceding passage. Yet there is nothing here that seems to indicate a new author. The previous paragraph is historical, and closely connected with the end of the fourth chapter; and it suitably prepares for the proceedings of Noah, under the divine direction, on the eye of the deluge. We have now a recapitulation of the agent and the occasion, and then the divine commission and its execution.<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/6-9.htm">Genesis 6:9-12</a><p>Here are the man and the occasion.<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/6-9.htm">Genesis 6:9-10</a><p>The generations of Noah. - In the third document we had the generations of man; now we are limited to Noah, because he is himself at peace with God, and is now the head and representative of those who are in the same blessed relation. The narrative, therefore, for the first time, formally confines itself to the portion of the human family in communion with God, Noah is here characterized by two new and important epithets - "just" and "perfect." It is to be remembered that he had already found grace in the eyes of the Lord. Adam was created good; but by disobedience he became guilty, and all his race, Noah among the rest, became involved in that guilt. To be just is to be right in point of law, and thereby entitled to all the blessings of the acquitted and justified. When applied to the guilty, this epithet implies pardon of sin among other benefits of grace. It also presupposes that spiritual change by which the soul returns from estrangement to reconciliation with God. Hence, Noah is not only just, but perfect. This attribute of character imports not only the turning from darkness to light, from error to truth, from wrong to right, but the stability of moral determination which arises from the struggle, the trial, the victory of good over evil, therein involved. The just is the right in law; the perfect is the tested in holiness. "In his ages;" among the men of his age. This phrase indicates the contrast between Noah and the men of his day. It is probable, moreover, that he was of pure descent, and in that respect also distinguished from his contemporaries who were the offspring of promiscuous intermarriage between the godly and the ungodly. "Noah walked with God," like Henok. This is the native consequence of his victory over sin, and his acceptance with God. His sons are mentioned, as they are essentially connected with the following events.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/genesis/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. Noah &#8230; just &#8230; and perfect&#8212;not absolutely; for since the fall of Adam no man has been free from sin except Jesus Christ.

Here (in the story of the Flood) if anywhere, observes Rosenm&uuml;ller, can traces be detected of two distinct documents (<span class="accented">duorum monumentorum</span>), in the alternate use of the names of the Deity, the frequent repetitions of the same things, and the use of peculiar forms of expression; and in vers. 9-13, compared with <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-5.htm">Genesis 6:5-8</a>, Bleek, Tuch, Colenso, and others find' the first instance of needless repetition, on the supposition of the unity of the narrative, but a sure index of the Elohistic pen, on the hypothesis of different authors; but the so-called "repetition" is explained by remembering that <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-5.htm">Genesis 6:5-8</a> forms the close of a section "bringing down the history to the point at which the degeneracy of mankind causes God to resolve on the destruction of the world," while the new section, which otherwise would begin too abruptly, introduces the account of the Deluge by a brief description of its cause (cf. Quarry, p. 367). The structure of the narrative here is not different from what it appears elsewhere (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-4.htm">Genesis 2:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/5-1.htm">Genesis 5:1</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/genesis/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/6-10.htm">Genesis 6:10-12</a>, the account of the birth of his three sons, and of the corruption of all flesh, is repeated. This corruption is represented as corrupting the whole earth and filling it with wickedness; and thus the judgment of the flood is for the first time fully accounted for. "The earth was corrupt before God (Elohim points back to the previous Elohim in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-9.htm">Genesis 6:9</a>)," it became so conspicuous to God, that He could not refrain from punishment. The corruption proceeded from the fact, that "all flesh" - i.e., the whole human race which had resisted the influence of the Spirit of God and become flesh (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-3.htm">Genesis 6:3</a>) - "had corrupted its way." The term "flesh" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-12.htm">Genesis 6:12</a> cannot include the animal world, since the expression, "corrupted its way," is applicable to man alone. The fact that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-13.htm">Genesis 6:13</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-17.htm">Genesis 6:17</a> this term embraces both men and animals is no proof to the contrary, for the simple reason, that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-19.htm">Genesis 6:19</a> "all flesh" denotes the animal world only, an evident proof that the precise meaning of the word must always be determined from the context.</body></html>
