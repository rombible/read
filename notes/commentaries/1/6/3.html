In the first case, the struggle spoken of is that between the elements of life and death in the body; in the second, it refers to the moral probation to which man is subject. The versions generally take the former meaning, and translate “shall not dwell,” or “abide “; but there is much in favour of the rendering “shall strive,” though the verb more exactly means <span class= "ital">to rule, preside over, sit as judge. </span>Literally, then, it signifies that the Divine gift of life shall not rule in man “for ever;” that is, for a period so protracted as was antediluvian life.

Man, then, is “also” flesh, that is, his body is of the same nature as those of the animals, and in spite of his noble gifts and precedence, he must submit to a life of the same moderate duration as that allotted them.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/genesis/6.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-3.htm" title="And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.">Genesis 6:3</a></span>. <span class="ital">My spirit shall not always strive with man — </span>The Spirit then strove by Noah’s preaching, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-19.htm" title="By which also he went and preached to the spirits in prison;">1 Peter 3:19</a>, and by inward checks, but it was in vain with the most of men; therefore, saith God, he shall <span class="ital">not always strive, for that he </span>(man) <span class="ital">also is flesh </span>— Incurably corrupt and sensual, so that it is labour lost to strive with him. <span class="ital">He also; </span>that is, <span class="ital">all, </span>one as well as another; they are all sunk into the mire of flesh. <span class="ital">Yet his days shall be a hundred and twenty years — </span>So long will I defer the judgment they deserve, and give them space to prevent it by their repentance and reformation.

We are told of the abounding iniquity of that wicked world: God's just wrath, and his holy resolution to punish it. In all ages there has been a peculiar curse of God upon marriages between professors of true religion and its avowed enemies. The evil example of the ungodly party corrupts or greatly hurts the other. Family religion is put an end to, and the children are trained up according to the worldly maxims of that parent who is without the fear of God. If we profess to be the sons and daughters of the Lord Almighty, we must not marry without his consent. He will never give his blessing, if we prefer beauty, wit, wealth, or worldly honours, to faith and holiness. The Spirit of God strove with men, by sending Enoch, Noah, and perhaps others, to preach to them; by waiting to be gracious, notwithstanding their rebellions; and by exciting alarm and convictions in their consciences. But the Lord declared that his Spirit should not thus strive with men always; he would leave them to be hardened in sin, and ripened for destruction. This he determined on, because man was flesh: not only frail and feeble, but carnal and depraved; having misused the noble powers of his soul to gratify his corrupt inclinations. God sees all the wickedness that is among the children of men; it cannot be hid from him now; and if it be not repented of, it shall be made known by him shortly. The wickedness of a people is great indeed, when noted sinners are men renowned among them. Very much sin was committed in all places, by all sorts of people. Any one might see that the wickedness of man was great: but God saw that every imagination, or purpose, of the thoughts of man's heart, was only evil continually. This was the bitter root, the corrupt spring. The heart was deceitful and desperately wicked; the principles were corrupt; the habits and dispositions evil. Their designs and devices were wicked. They did evil deliberately, contriving how to do mischief. There was no good among them. God saw man's wickedness as one injured and wronged by it. He saw it as a tender father sees the folly and stubbornness of a rebellious and disobedient child, which grieves him, and makes him wish he had been childless. The words here used are remarkable; they are used after the manner of men, and do not mean that God can change, or be unhappy. Does God thus hate our sin? And shall not we be grieved to the heart for it? Oh that we may look on Him whom we have grieved, and mourn! God repented that he had made man; but we never find him repent that he redeemed man. God resolves to destroy man: the original word is very striking, 'I will wipe off man from the earth,' as dirt or filth is wiped off from a place which should be clean, and is thrown to the dunghill, the proper place for it. God speaks of man as his own creature, when he resolves upon his punishment. Those forfeit their lives who do not answer the end of their living. God speaks of resolution concerning men, after his Spirit had been long striving with them in vain. None are punished by the justice of God, but those who hate to be reformed by the grace of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/genesis/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>My Spirit - , in contradistinction to the spirit of disobedience which, by the fall, obtained entrance into the soul of man. "Shall not strive with man forever." To strive &#1491;&#1493;&#1503;  d&#305;&#770;yn is to keep down, rule, judge, or strive with a man by moral force. From this passage we learn that the Lord by his Spirit strives with man up to a certain point. In this little negative sentence streams out the bright light of God's free and tender mercy to the apostate race of man. He sends his Spirit to irradiate the darkened mind, to expostulate with the conscience, to prompt and strengthen holy resolve, and to bring back the heart, the confidence, the affection to God. He effects the blessed result of repentance toward God in some, who are thus proved to be born of God. But it is a solemn thought that with others he will not strive perpetually. There is a certain point beyond which he will not go, for sufficient reasons known fully to himself, partly to us. Two of these we are to notice for our instruction: First, he will not touch the free agency of his rational creatures. He can put no force on the volitions of men. An involuntary or compulsory faith, hope, love, obedience, is a contradiction in terms; and anything that could bear the name can have no moral validity whatsoever. Secondly, after giving ample warning, instruction, and invitation, he will, as a just judgment on the unbelieving and the impenitent, withdraw his Spirit and let them alone. The antediluvian world was fast approaching to this point of final perversity and abandonment.<p>Inasmuch as he is also flesh - , in contradistinction to spirit, the breath of life which the Almighty breathed Into his nostrils. These two parts of man's complex being were originally in true and happy adjustment, the corporeal being the fit organ and complement of the spiritual as it is in him. But now by the fall the flesh has gained the upper hand, and the spirit is in the bondage of corruption. The fact that he is flesh also as well as spirit, has therefore come out into sad prominence. The doctrine of the carnal mind in the Epistle to the Romans Rom. 8 is merely the outgrowth of the thought expressed in this passage.<p>His days shall be an hundred and twenty years. - "His days" are the days of man, not the individual, but the race, with whom the Lord still strives. Hence, they refer to the duration, not of the life of an individual, but of the existence of the race. From this we learn that the narrative here reverts to a point of time before the birth of Shem, Ham, and Japheth, recorded in the close of the preceding passage as there were only a hundred years from their birth to the deluge. This is according to the now well-known method of Scripture, when it has two lines of events to carry on. The former narrative refers to the godly portion of mankind; this to the ungodly remnant.<p>Not forever will the Lord strive with man; but his longsuffering will still continue for one hundred and twenty years. Meanwhile he does not leave himself or his clemency without a witness. He sent Noah with the message of warning, who preached by his voice, by his walking with God, and also by his long labor and perseverance in the building of the ark. The doomed race, however, filled up the measure of their iniquity, and when the set number of years was accomplished, the overwhelming flood came.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/genesis/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. flesh&#8212;utterly, hopelessly debased.<p>And the Lord said, My spirit shall not always strive&#8212;Christ, as God, had by His Spirit inspiring Enoch, Noah, and perhaps other prophets (1Pe 3:20; 2Pe 2:5; Jude 14), preached repentance to the antediluvians; but they were incorrigible.<p>yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years&#8212;It is probable that the corruption of the world, which had now reached its height, had been long and gradually increasing, and this idea receives support from the long respite granted.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/genesis/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The Lord said; </span> either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

In the two preceding verses, it is not man, but “the sons of God,” whose depravity has been described. Perhaps, however, the object of the words is, in view of the mixed marriages, to impose a more restricted limit upon the duration of human life. Man is warned, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-22.htm" title="And Zillah, she also bore Tubalcain, an instructor of every artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubalcain was Naamah.">Genesis 4:22</a>, that on earth he has no immortality. The warning is administered to the progeny of the sons of God and the daughters of men no less than to the children of men generally.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Following this line of interpretation, we obtain some clue to the meaning of a most obscure verse. Its obscurities, indeed, are such that it may well be the case, that the original text has suffered corruption in the early stages of its transmission.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. The R.V. text may be paraphrased: “My spirit shall not for ever be contending with man; seeing that he also is carnally minded. His days are numbered: but I will not at once consume him. There shall yet be an interval of 120 years, before I bring upon mankind the catastrophe of the Deluge.” The objections to this are numerous: (<span class="ital">a</span>) the rendering “strive” is exceedingly doubtful; (<span class="ital">b</span>) the idea of the spirit of Jehovah striving with men is unsuitable; (<span class="ital">c</span>) the rendering, “for that he also, &c.” represents a Hebrew idiom found nowhere else in the Pentateuch, while the word “also” has no logical connexion; (<span class="ital">d</span>) the mention of “his days” being 120 years despite the Flood is, to say the least, strange—Noah is expressly stated in P to be 500 years old at the birth of his sons (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-22.htm" title="Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did he.">Genesis 6:22</a></span>), and 600 years old when he entered the ark (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/7-6.htm" title="And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was on the earth.">Genesis 7:6</a>); (<span class="ital">e</span>) “flesh” is used in its metaphorical, not in its literal, sense.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. R.V. marg. <span class="ital">rule in</span>. Better, according to many ancient versions, <span class="ital">abide in … in their going astray they are flesh</span>. The following paraphrase may be given: “the Spirit which I have implanted in man is not to abide in him for ever. (Still he shall not be judged too severely.) In their continual going astray men shew that they are frail flesh. Mortal life, therefore, shall be limited to 120 years (no admixture of the heavenly strain shall avail for the greater prolongation of life).”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is objected that the lives of the patriarchs in P exceed this limit. But the passage is evidently an independent fragment from J. And it is a more serious objection that the words of the verse, taken literally, make no clear allusion to the illicit marriages, and are applicable to mankind generally.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord</span> - Jehovah; not because due to the Jehovist (Tuch, Bleek, Colenso), but because the sin above specified was a direct violation of the footing of grace on which the Sethites stood  -  <span class="cmt_word">said</span>,  -  to himself, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> purposed, - <span class="cmt_word">My spirit</span> - neither "ira, seu rigida Dei justitia" (Venema), nor "the Divine spirit of life bestowed upon man, the principle of physical and ethical, natural and spiritual life" (Keil); but the Holy Ghost, the Ruach Elohim of <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a>  - <span class="cmt_word">shall not always strive</span>. <span class="accented">London</span>: <span class="accented">-</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> Shall not dwell (LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">non permanebit</span>; Syriac, Onkelos). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> Shall not be humbled, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> by dwelling in men (Gesenius, Tuch). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> More probably, shall not rule (De Wette, Delitzsch, Kalisch, Furst), or shall not judge (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>), as the consequence of ruling (Symmachus, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Keil), or shall not contend in judgment (<span class="accented">arguere, reprehendere</span>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/6-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:10</a>), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> strive with a man by moral force (Calvin, Michaelis, Dathe, 'Speaker's Commentary,' Murphy, Bush). <span class="cmt_word">With man, for that he also</span> <span class="accented">- beshaggam</span>.

Though an Aramaic particle, "<span class="accented">it</span> must never be forgotten that Aramaisms are to be expected either in the most modern or <span class="accented">in the most ancient portions of Scripture"</span> ('Speaker's Commentary) - is flesh, not "transitory beings" (Gesenius, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Tuch), or corporeal beings (Kalisch), but sinful beings; <span class="accented">bashar</span> being already employed in its ethical signification, like <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3be;</span> in the New Testament, to denote "man's materiality as rendered ungodly by sin" (Keil). "The doctrine of the carnal mind (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8.htm">Romans 8</a>.) is merely the outgrowth, of the thought expressed in this passage ' (Murphy). <span class="cmt_word">Yet his days</span> - not the individual's (Kalisch), which were not immediately curtailed to the limit mentioned, and, even after the Flood, extended far beyond it (<span class="accented">vide Genesis</span> 11.); but the races, which were only to be prolonged in gracious respite (Calvin) - <span class="cmt_word">shall be an hundred and twenty years</span>. Tuch, Colenso, and others, supposing this to have been said by God in Noah's 500th year, find a respite only of 100 years, instead of 120; but the historian does not assert that it was then God either formed or announced this determination. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/genesis/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The sentence of God upon the "sons of God" is also appropriate to men only. "Jehovah said: My spirit shall not rule in men for ever; in their wandering they are flesh." "The verb &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;  equals  &#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503; signifies to rule (hence &#1488;&#1491;&#1493;&#1503; the ruler), and to judge, as the consequence of ruling. &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492; is the divine spirit of life bestowed upon man, the principle of physical and ethical, natural and spiritual life. This His spirit God will withdraw from man, and thereby put an end to their life and conduct. &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1490;&#1468;&#1501; is regarded by many as a particle, compounded of &#1489;&#1468;, &#1513;&#1473; a contraction of &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, and &#1490;&#1468;&#1501; (also), used in the sense of quoniam, because, (&#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;  equals  &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, as &#1513;&#1473; or &#1513;&#1473;  equals  &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-7.htm">Judges 5:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-17.htm">Judges 6:17</a>; Sol 1:7). But the objection to this explanation is, that the &#1490;&#1468;&#1501;, "because he also is flesh," introduces an incongruous emphasis into the clause. We therefore prefer to regard &#1513;&#1473;&#1490;&#1468;&#1501; as the inf. of &#1513;&#1473;&#1490;&#1490;  equals  &#1513;&#1473;&#1490;&#1492; with the suffix: "in their erring (that of men) he (man as a genus) is flesh;" an explanation to which, to our mind, the extremely harsh change of number (they, he), is no objection, since many examples might be adduced of a similar change (vid., Hupfeld on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/5-10.htm">Psalm 5:10</a>). Men, says God, have proved themselves by their erring and straying to be flesh, i.e., given up to the flesh, and incapable of being ruled by the Spirit of God and led back to the divine goal of their life. &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512; is used already in its ethical signification, like &#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3be; in the New Testament, denoting not merely the natural corporeality of man, but his materiality as rendered ungodly by sin. "Therefore his days shall be 120 years:" this means, not that human life should in future never attain a greater age than 120 years, but that a respite of 120 years should still be granted to the human race. This sentence, as we may gather from the context, was made known to Noah in his 480th year, to be published by him as "preacher of righteousness" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-5.htm">2 Peter 2:5</a>) to the degenerate race. The reason why men had gone so far astray, that God determined to withdraw His spirit and give them up to destruction, was that the sons of God had taken wives of such of the daughters of men as they chose. Can this mean, because angels had formed marriages with the daughters of men? Even granting that such marriages, as being unnatural connections, would have led to the complete corruption of human nature; the men would in that case have been the tempted, and the real authors of the corruption would have been the angels. Why then should judgment fall upon the tempted alone? The judgments of God in the world are not executed with such partiality as this. And the supposition that nothing is said about the punishment of the angels, because the narrative has to do with the history of man, and the spiritual world is intentionally veiled as much as possible, does not meet the difficulty. If the sons of God were angels, the narrative is concerned not only with men, but with angels also; and it is not the custom of the Scriptures merely to relate the judgments which fall upon the tempted, and say nothing at all about the tempters. For the contrary, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-14.htm">Genesis 3:14</a>. If the "sons of God" were not men, so as to be included in the term &#1488;&#1491;&#1501;, the punishment would need to be specially pointed out in their case, and no deep revelations of the spiritual world would be required, since these celestial tempters would be living with men upon the earth, when they had taken wives from among their daughters. The judgments of God are not only free from all unrighteousness, but avoid every kind of partiality.</body></html>
