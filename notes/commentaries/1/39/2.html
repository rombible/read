They may separate us from friends, relatives, and country; but they cannot take from us the presence of the Lord. They may shut us from outward blessings, rob us of liberty, and confine us in dungeons; but they cannot shut us out from communion with God, from the throne of grace, or take from us the blessings of salvation. Joseph was blessed, wonderfully blessed, even in the house where he was a slave. God's presence with us, makes all we do prosperous. Good men are the blessings of the place where they live; good servants may be so, though mean and lightly esteemed. The prosperity of the wicked is, one way or other, for the sake of the godly. Here was a wicked family blessed for the sake of one good servant in it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/genesis/39.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Joseph fares well with his first master.

He immediately ordered, by virtue of his authority as head of the tribe, that she should be brought out and burned. Thamar was regarded as the affianced bride of Shelah, and was to be punished as a bride convicted of a breach of chastity. But the Mosaic law enjoined stoning in the case of those who were affianced and broke their promise, or of newly married women who were found to have been dishonoured (<a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-20.htm">Deuteronomy 22:20-21</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-23.htm">Deuteronomy 22:23-24</a>); and it was only in the case of the whoredom of a priest's daughter, or of carnal intercourse with a mother or a daughter, that the punishment of burning was enjoined (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/21-9.htm">Leviticus 21:9</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-14.htm">Leviticus 20:14</a>). Judah's sentence, therefore, was more harsh than the subsequent law; whether according to patriarchal custom, or on other grounds, cannot be determined. When Thamar was brought out, she sent to Judah the things which she had kept as a pledge, with this message: "By a man to whom these belong am I with child: look carefully therefore to whom this signet-ring, and band, and stick belong." Judah recognised the things as his own, and was obliged to confess, "She is more in the right than I; for therefore (sc., that this might happen to me, or that it might turn out so; on &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1470;&#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1499;&#1468;&#1503; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-5.htm">Genesis 18:5</a>) have I not given her to my son Shelah." In passing sentence upon Thamar, Judah had condemned himself. His son, however, did not consist merely in his having given way to his lusts so afar as to lie with a supposed public prostitute of Canaan, but still more in the fact, that by breaking his promise to give her his son Shelah as her husband, he had caused his daughter-in-law to practise this deception upon him, just because in his heart he blamed her for the early and sudden deaths of his elder sons, whereas the real cause of the deaths which had so grieved his paternal heart was the wickedness of the sons themselves, the mainspring of which was to be found in his own marriage with a Canaanite in violation of the patriarchal call. And even if the sons of Jacob were not unconditionally prohibited from marrying the daughters of Canaanites, Judah's marriage at any rate had borne such fruit in his sons Ger and Onan, as Jehovah the covenant God was compelled to reject. But if Judah, instead of recognising the hand of the Lord in the sudden death of his sons, traced the cause to Thamar, and determined to keep her as a childless widow all her life long, not only in opposition to the traditional custom, but also in opposition to the will of God as expressed in His promises of a numerous increase of the seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; Thamar had by no means acted rightly in the stratagem by which she frustrated his plan, and sought to procure from Judah himself the seed of which he was unjustly depriving her, though her act might be less criminal than Judah's. For it is evident from the whole account, that she was not driven to her sin by lust, but by the innate desire for children (&#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#836;&#769;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787; &#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3bf; &#x3bf;&#788; &#x398;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;, - Theodoret); and for that reason she was more in the right than Judah. Judah himself, however, not only saw his guilt, but he confessed it also; and showed both by this confession, and also by the fact that he had no further conjugal intercourse with Thamar, an earnest endeavour to conquer the lusts of the flesh, and to guard against the sin into which he had fallen. And because he thus humbled himself, God gave him grace, and not only exalted him to be the chief of the house of Israel, but blessed the children that were begotten in sin.</body></html>
