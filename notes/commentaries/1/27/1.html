Just as in Abraham’s life the decision had to be made which of the two sons, Ishmael and Isaac, was to be the heir of the promise, so, here again, there is the same Divine election (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/9-10.htm" title="And not only this; but when Rebecca also had conceived by one, even by our father Isaac;">Romans 9:10-13</a>): but while Abraham obeyed, though with heavy heart (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/21-11.htm" title="And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight because of his son.">Genesis 21:11</a>), Isaac even struggled against God’s will, and his assent was obtained by human craft working tortuously to effect that which God would have wrought in His own better way. In this case, however, the sons are more closely allied, being twins, born of the same mother, but the younger following so closely upon the very heels of the elder as to seem, even at his birth, as if in eager pursuit. They grow up strangely unlike—the one brave, active, vigorous, but indifferent to everything save earthly things. In his skill and love of hunting, Esau is the very counterpart of Ishmael. The other is calm, sedentary, keenly alive to business, devoted to domestic pursuits, but chiefly valuing the spiritual privileges for which Abraham had left his distant home, and become a wanderer in the highlands of Canaan. Thoroughly as all honest men must disapprove of the mean way in which Jacob bought the birthright, yet, at least, he valued that which Esau so despised as to sell it for the gratification of a hungry appetite. And now again the transfer is ratified by means of another unworthy artifice, but Esau this time is grieved and distressed; for at least he loved his father, and gave proof of the possession of the same warm heart that made him afterwards fall so lovingly upon his brother’s neck, and kiss him with tears of hearty affection (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/33-4.htm" title="And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him: and they wept.">Genesis 33:4</a>).<p>For Jacob, it must be said that he sought no earthly good. It was not the elder brother’s share of the father’s wealth that he wanted. All that was Isaac’s he resigned to Esau, and went away to push his fortunes elsewhere. Even when he returned with the substance he had gotten in Padan-aram, he was no match for Esau (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/33-1.htm" title="And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau came, and with him four hundred men. And he divided the children to Leah, and to Rachel, and to the two handmaids.">Genesis 33:1</a>), though Isaac was still living. While, too, Esau violated the family law laid down by Abraham, Jacob conformed to it. By marrying Canaanitish women, Esau forfeited by his own act the birthright which previously he had sold; for his children, being illegitimate (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-16.htm" title="Lest there be any fornicator, or profane person, as Esau, who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright.">Hebrews 12:16</a>), could not inherit the promise. What was utterly wrong in Rebekah’s and Jacob’s conduct was that they used miserable artifices to do that which should have been left to God; and Isaac was equally wrong in trying to make void and annul the clear intimation of prophecy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-23.htm" title="And the LORD said to her, Two nations are in your womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from your bowels; and the one people shall be stronger than the other people; and the elder shall serve the younger.">Genesis 25:23</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Isaac was old.</span>—Isaac was now 117 years of age. but he lived to be 180 (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-28.htm" title="And the days of Isaac were an hundred and fourscore years.">Genesis 35:28</a>). (See Excursus on Chronology of Jacob’s Life at end of this book.) He had thus sixty-three more years to live, but not only himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/27-2.htm" title="And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my death:">Genesis 27:2</a>), but Esau also expected his speedy decease (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/27-41.htm" title="And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing with which his father blessed him: and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father are at hand; then will I slay my brother Jacob.">Genesis 27:41</a>). Probably, therefore, his failing eyesight was the result of some acute disorder, which so enfeebled his general health that he had grown despondent, and thought his death near. But evidently he recovered, and attained to a good old age. It seems, however, that though the lives of the patriarchs were so long extended, yet that their bodily vigour slowly decayed through the latter portion of their days. Jacob when but 130 speaks of himself as a grey-haired old man, already upon the brink of the grave (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/42-38.htm" title="And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he is left alone: if mischief befall him by the way in the which you go, then shall you bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.">Genesis 42:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/47-9.htm" title="And Jacob said to Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage are an hundred and thirty years: few and evil have the days of the years of my life been, and have not attained to the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage.">Genesis 47:9</a>). Moreover, the term <span class= "ital">old </span>is used in a very general sense in the Old Testament, and thus Samuel is described as old in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/8-1.htm" title="And it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he made his sons judges over Israel.">1Samuel 8:1</a>, when we should have spoken of him as at most middle-aged.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/genesis/27.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/27-1.htm" title="And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his oldest son, and said to him, My son: and he said to him, Behold, here am I.">Genesis 27:1</a></span>. <span class="ital">When Isaac was old — </span>A hundred and thirty-seven years old; but he lived forty years after this. <span class="ital">And his eyes were dim — </span>Whereby God brought about his own purpose of bestowing the blessing on Jacob. <span class="ital">He called Esau, his eldest son — </span>With a view to declare him his heir. The promise of the Messiah, and the land of Canaan, was a great trust, first committed to Abraham, inclusive and typical of spiritual and eternal blessings; this, by divine direction, he transmitted to Isaac. Isaac, either not knowing, or not duly considering the divine oracle concerning his two sons, that <span class="ital">the elder should serve the younger, </span>resolves to entail all the honour and power that was wrapped up in the promise upon Esau his eldest son. Esau had greatly grieved his parents by his marriage, yet they had not expelled him, but it seems were pretty well reconciled to him.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/27.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>27:1-5 The promises of the Messiah, and of the land of Canaan, had come down to Isaac. Isaac being now about 135 years of age, and his sons about 75, and not duly considering the Divine word concerning his two sons, that the elder should serve the younger, resolved to put all the honour and power that were in the promise, upon Esau his eldest son. We are very apt to take measures rather from our own reason than from Divine revelation, and thereby often miss our way.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/genesis/27.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Isaac was old. - Joseph was in his thirtieth year when he stood before Pharaoh, and therefore thirty-nine when Jacob came down to Egypt at the age of one hundred and thirty. When Joseph was born, therefore, Jacob was ninety-one, and he had sojourned fourteen years in Padan-aram. Hence, Jacob's flight to Laban took place when he was seventy-seven, and therefore in the one hundred and thirty-sixth year of Isaac. "His eyes were dim." Weakness and even loss of sight is more frequent in Palestine than with us. "His older son." Isaac had not yet come to the conclusion that Jacob was heir of the promise. The communication from the Lord to Rebekah concerning her yet unborn sons in the form in which it is handed down to us merely determines that the older shall serve the younger. This fact Isaac seems to have thought might not imply the transferrence of the birthright; and if he was aware of the transaction between Esau and Jacob, he may not have regarded it as valid. Hence, he makes arrangements for bestowing the paternal benediction on Esau, his older son, whom he also loves. "I am old." At the age of one hundred and thirty-six, and with failing sight, he felt that life was uncertain. In the calmness of determination he directs Esau to prepare savory meat, such as he loved, that he may have his vigor renewed and his spirits revived for the solemn business of bestowing that blessing, which he held to be fraught with more than ordinary benefits.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/genesis/27.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 27<p>Ge 27:1-27.

Joseph, having been introduced to Pharaoh in his thirtieth year (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-46.htm">Genesis 41:46</a>), and having been thirty-nine years of age (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/45-6.htm">Genesis 45:6</a>) when his father, aged one hundred and thirty (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/47-9.htm">Genesis 47:9</a>), came down to Egypt, must have been born before Jacob was ninety-one; consequently, as his birth occurred in the fourteenth year of Jacob's sojourn in Mesopotamia (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/30-25.htm">Genesis 30:25</a> with Genesis 29:18, 21, 27), Jacob's flight must have taken place when he was seventy-seven. But Jacob was born in Isaac's sixtieth year (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-26.htm">Genesis 25:26</a>); hence Isaac was now one hundred and thirty-seven. There are, however, difficulties connected with this reckoning which lay it open to suspicion. For one thing, it postpones Jacob s marriage to an extremely late period. Then it takes for granted that the term of Jacob's service in Padan-aram was only twenty years (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-41.htm">Genesis 31:41</a>), whereas it is not certain whether it was not forty, made up, according to the computation of Kennicott, of fourteen years' service, twenty years' assistance as a neighbor, and six years of work for wages. And, lastly, it necessitates the birth of Jacob's eleven children in the short space of six years, a thing which appears to some, it not impossible, at least highly improbable. Adopting the larger number as the term of Jacob s sojourn in Mesopotamia, Isaac would at this time be only one hundred and seventeen (<span class="accented">vide</span> 'Chronologer of Jacob's Life,' 31:41) - <span class="cmt_word">and his eyes were dim,</span> - literally, <span class="accented">were failing in strength</span>, hence becoming dim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-2.htm">1 Samuel 3:2</a>).

Abimelech not only brought his chief captain Phicol (supposed to be the same as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/21-22.htm">Genesis 21:22</a>, if Phicol is not also an official name), but his &#1502;&#1512;&#1506; "friend," i.e., his privy councillor, Ahuzzath. Isaac referred to the hostility they had shown; to which Abimelech replied, that they (he and his people) did not smite him (&#1504;&#1490;&#1506;), i.e., drive him away by force, but let him depart in peace, and expressed a wish that there might be an oath between them. &#1488;&#1500;&#1492; the oath, as an act of self-imprecation, was to form the basis of the covenant to be made. From this &#1488;&#1500;&#1492; came also to be used for a covenant sanctioned by an oath (<a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-11.htm">Deuteronomy 29:11</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-13.htm">Deuteronomy 29:13</a>). &#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1488;&#1501; "that thou do not:" &#1488;&#1501; a particle of negation used in an oath (<a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/14-23.htm">Genesis 14:23</a>, etc.). (On the verb with zere, see Ges. 75, Anm. 17; Ewald, 224.) - The same day Isaac's servants informed him of the well which they had dug; and Isaac gave it the name Shebah (&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1506;&#1492;, oath), in commemoration of the treaty made on oath. "Therefore the city was called Beersheba." This derivation of the name does not shut the other (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/21-31.htm">Genesis 21:31</a>) out, but seems to confirm it. As the treaty made on oath between Abimelech and Isaac was only a renewal of his covenant concluded before with Abraham, so the name Beersheba was also renewed by the well Shebah. The reality of the occurrence is supported by the fact that the two wells are in existence still (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/21-31.htm">Genesis 21:31</a>). </body></html>
