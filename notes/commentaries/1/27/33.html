What Isaac felt was that he had been resisting God. In spite of the prophecy given to the mother, and Esau’s own irreligious character and heathen marriages, he had determined to bestow on him the birthright by an act of his own will; and he had failed. But he persists no longer in his sin. Acknowledging the Divine purpose, he has no word of blame for Rebekah and Jacob, but confirms to him the possession of the birthright, and declares, “Yea, he shall be blessed.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/genesis/27.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/27-33.htm" title="And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who? where is he that has taken venison, and brought it me, and I have eaten of all before you came, and have blessed him? yes, and he shall be blessed.">Genesis 27:33</a></span>. <span class="ital">Isaac trembled very exceedingly — </span>Being perplexed and astonished to consider herein God’s overruling providences, and how strangely his purpose of giving the blessing to Esau had been disappointed.

The day is coming, when those that now make light of the blessings of the covenant, and sell their title to spiritual blessings for that which is of no value, will, in vain, ask urgently for them. Isaac, when made sensible of the deceit practised on him, trembled exceedingly. Those who follow the choice of their own affections, rather than the Divine will, get themselves into perplexity. But he soon recovers, and confirms the blessing he had given to Jacob, saying, I have blessed him, and he shall be blessed. Those who part with their wisdom and grace, their faith and a good conscience, for the honours, wealth, or pleasures of this world, however they feign a zeal for the blessing, have judged themselves unworthy of it, and their doom shall be accordingly. A common blessing was bestowed upon Esau. This he desired. Faint desires of happiness, without right choice of the end, and right use of the means, deceive many unto their own ruin. Multitudes go to hell with their mouths full of good wishes. The great difference is, that there is nothing in Esau's blessing which points at Christ; and without that, the fatness of the earth, and the plunder of the field, will stand in little stead. Thus Isaac, by faith, blessed both his sons, according as their lot should be.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/genesis/27.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Esau's blessing. Esau comes in, but it is too late. "Who then?" The whole illusion is dispelled from the mind of Isaac. "Yea, blessed he shall be." Jacob had no doubt perpetrated a fraud, at the instigation of his mother; and if Esau had been worthy in other respects, and above all if the blessing had been designed for him, its bestowment on another would have been either prevented or regarded as null and void. But Isaac now felt that, whatever was the misconduct of Jacob in interfering, and especially in employing unworthy means to accomplish his end, he himself was culpable in allowing carnal considerations to draw his preference to Esau, who was otherwise unworthy. He knew too that the paternal benediction flowed not from the bias of the parent, but from the Spirit of God guiding his will, and therefore when so pronounced could not be revoked. Hence, he was now convinced that it was the design of Providence that the spiritual blessing should fall on the line of Jacob. The grief of Esau is distressing to witness, especially as he had been comparatively blameless in this particular instance. But still it is to be remembered that his heart had not been open to the paramount importance of spiritual things. Isaac now perceives that Jacob has gained the blessing by deceit. Esau marks the propriety of his name, the wrestler who trips up the heel, and pleads pathetically for at least some blessing. His father enumerates what he has done for Jacob, and asks what more he can do for Esau; who then exclaims, "Hast thou but one blessing?"<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/genesis/27.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>30-35. Esau came in from his hunting&#8212;Scarcely had the former scene been concluded, when the fraud was discovered. The emotions of Isaac, as well as Esau, may easily be imagined&#8212;the astonishment, alarm, and sorrow of the one; the disappointment and indignation of the other. But a moment's reflection convinced the aged patriarch that the transfer of the blessing was "of the Lord," and now irrevocable. The importunities of Esau, however, overpowered him; and as the prophetic afflatus was upon the patriarch, he added what was probably as pleasing to a man of Esau's character as the other would have been.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/genesis/27.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Isaac</span> was filled with astonishment and horror in consideration of Jacob’s fraud, and the sad disappointment and great misery of his beloved Esau, and his own rashness and folly in suffering his fond affection towards him to carry him headlong into an opposition to the Divine oracle, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-23.htm" title="And the LORD said to her, Two nations are in your womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from your bowels; and the one people shall be stronger than the other people; and the elder shall serve the younger.">Genesis 25:23</a></span>, which now came to his remembrance, as appears by his ratification of Jacob’s blessing. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Who? where is he?</span> A short speech, proceeding from a discomposed mind. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Yea, and he shall be blessed.</span> This blessing, though otherwise intended by me, and pronounced upon a mistake of the person, shall and must rest upon the head of Jacob; and I neither can nor dare undertake to revoke and contradict God’s appointment, which now I more fully discern, and in which both thou and I and all men must fully acquiesce.

Or "trembled with a great trembling exceedingly" (b); he was amazed, and astonished, and seized with a trembling all over his body, and with terror and confusion of mind; at the craft of Jacob in getting the blessing; at the disappointment of Esau in losing it; at his own act in blessing Jacob instead of Esau, contrary to his inclination and intention; and at the overruling providence of God in bringing this about in so strange a manner, agreeably to the oracle he had given Rebekah; which now perhaps came fresh into the mind of Isaac, if he had heard it before; and all together threw him into this amazement: <p>and he said, who? where is he; which words spoken in haste, and without order, show the hurry and consternation of mind he was in: <p>that hath taken venison, and brought it me, and I have eaten of all before thou camest; he was here but just now; he was scarce gone out before thou camest in; who, and where is he, that has done this? He knew it must be Jacob that had prepared and brought him food he called venison, which he had eaten sufficiently of, though in the confusion of his mind he puts these questions: and <p>have blessed him? yea, and he shall be blessed; for he now saw clearly that it was according to the divine will that Jacob should be blessed, though his natural affection led him to bless Esau; and no doubt, while he was pronouncing the blessing on Jacob, he felt an uncommon impulse upon his mind, by which he was assured that he was right in blessing him, that it was according to the will of God, was by his direction, and with his approbation; and therefore he here, even after Jacob's deceit was detected, confirms and ratifies it; and this is added, lest any question should be made of the validity of the blessing of Jacob, when it was given through mistake, and got by deceit; but this Isaac did and said knowingly, and by faith, as the apostle says, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-20.htm">Hebrews 11:20</a>. <p>(b)    "contremuit tremore magno usque valde", Montanus; Pagninus, Schmidt. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/genesis/27.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And Isaac <span class="cverse3">{f}</span> trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who? where <i>is</i> he that hath taken venison, and brought <i>it</i> me, and I have eaten of all before thou camest, and have blessed him? yea, <i>and</i> he shall be blessed.</span><p>(f) In perceiving his error, by appointing his heir against God's sentence pronounced before.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/genesis/27.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">33</span>. <span class="ital">trembled very exceedingly</span>] Isaac’s agitation is expressed in the original with an emphasis which our version can hardly reproduce.

After eating, he kissed his son as a sing of his paternal affection, and in doing so he smelt the odour of his clothes, i.e., the clothes of Esau, which were thoroughly scented with the odour of the fields, and then imparted his blessing (<a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-27.htm">Genesis 27:27-29</a>). The blessing itself is thrown, as the sign of an elevated state of mind, into the poetic style of parallel clauses, and contains the peculiar forms of poetry, such as &#1512;&#1488;&#1492; for &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;, &#1492;&#1493;&#1492; for &#1492;&#1497;&#1492;, etc. The smell of the clothes with the scent of the field suggested to the patriarch's mind the image of his son's future prosperity, so that he saw him in possession of the promised land and the full enjoyment of its valuable blessings, having the smell of the field which Jehovah blessed, i.e., the garden of paradise, and broke out into the wish, "God (Ha-Elohim, the personal God, not Jehovah, the covenant God) give thee from the dew of heaven, and the fat fields of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine," i.e., a land blessed with the dew of heaven and a fruitful soil.<p>In Eastern countries, where there is so little rain, the dew is the most important prerequisite for the growth of the fruits of the earth, and is often mentioned therefore as a source of blessing (<a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-13.htm">Deuteronomy 33:13</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-28.htm">Deuteronomy 33:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/14-6.htm">Hosea 14:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/8-12.htm">Zechariah 8:12</a>). In &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;, notwithstanding the absence of the Dagesh from the &#1513;&#1473;, the &#1502; is the prep. &#1502;&#1503;, as the parallel &#1502;&#1496;&#1468;&#1500; proves; and &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; both here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/27-39.htm">Genesis 27:39</a> are the fat (fertile) districts of a country. The rest of the blessing had reference to the future pre-eminence of his son. He was to be lord not only over his brethren (i.e., over kindred tribes), but over (foreign) peoples and nations also. The blessing rises here to the idea of universal dominion, which was to be realized in the fact that, according to the attitude assumed by the people towards him as their lord, it would secure to them either a blessing or a curse. If we compare this blessing with the promises which Abraham received, there are two elements of the latter which are very apparent; viz., the possession of the land, in the promise of the rich enjoyment of its produce, and the numerous increase of posterity, in the promised dominion over the nations. The third element, however, the blessing of the nations in and through the seed of Abraham, is so generalized in the expression, which is moulded according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>, "Cursed be every one that curseth thee, and blessed be he that blesseth thee," that the person blessed is not thereby declared to be the medium of salvation to the nations. Since the intention to give the blessing to Esau the first-born did not spring from proper feelings towards Jehovah and His promises, the blessing itself, as the use of the word Elohim instead of Jehovah or El Shaddai (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-3.htm">Genesis 28:3</a>) clearly shows, could not rise to the full height of the divine blessings of salvation, but referred chiefly to the relation in which the two brothers and their descendants would stand to one another, the theme with which Isaac's soul was entirely filled. It was only the painful discovery that, in blessing against his will, he had been compelled to follow the saving counsel of God, which awakened in him the consciousness of his patriarchal vocation, and gave him the spiritual power to impart the "blessing of Abraham" to the son whom he had kept back, but whom Jehovah had chosen, when he was about to send him away to Haran (<a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/28-3.htm">Genesis 28:3-4</a>). </body></html>
