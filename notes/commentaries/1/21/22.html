And Isaac went to Abimelech king of the Philistines to Gerar.">Genesis 26:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/21-10.htm" title="And David arose and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath.">1Samuel 21:10</a>, marg.; Psalms 34, tit.). In like manner Phichol, <span class= "ital">mouth of all, </span>seems to have been the official designation of the prime minister, and commander-in-chief. This visit of the king and his vizier appears to have taken place some considerable time after the beginning of the sojourn of Abraham at Gerar; for the friendly feelings which then existed had evidently given way to a coolness, occasioned by the quarrels between their herdsmen. In this narrative, Abraham appears as a chieftain powerful enough for a king to wish to make an alliance with him; and thus his abandonment of Sarah, and his receiving of presents in compensation for the wrong done her, seems the more unworthy of him. Abimelech, on the other hand, acts generously as of old, and shows <span class= "ital">no </span>signs of ill-will at the growing power of one whose expectation was that his race would possess the whole land.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/21.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>21:22-34 Abimelech felt sure that the promises of God would be fulfilled to Abraham. It is wise to connect ourselves with those who are blessed of God; and we ought to requite kindness to those who have been kind to us. Wells of water are scarce and valuable in eastern countries. Abraham took care to have his title to the well allowed, to prevent disputes in future. No more can be expected from an honest man than that he be ready to do right, as soon as he knows he has done wrong. Abraham, being now in a good neighbourhood, stayed a great while there. There he made, not only a constant practice, but an open profession of his religion. There he called on the name of the Lord, as the everlasting God; probably in the grove he planted, which was his place of prayer. Abraham kept up public worship, in which his neighbours might join. Good men should do all they can to make others so. Wherever we sojourn, we must neither neglect nor be ashamed of the worship of Jehovah.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/genesis/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>According to the common law of Hebrew narrative, this event took place before some of the circumstances recorded in the previous passage; probably not long after the birth of Isaac. Abimelek, accompanied by Phikol, his commander-in-chief, proposes to form a league with Abraham. The reason assigned for this is that God was with him in all that he did. Various circumstances concurred to produce this conviction in Abimelek. The never-to-be-forgotten appearance of God to himself in a dream interposing on behalf of Abraham, the birth of Isaac, and the consequent certainty of his having an heir, and the growing retinue and affluence of one who, some ten years before, could lead out a trained band of three hundred and eighteen men-at-arms, were amply sufficient to prove that God was the source of his strength. Such a man is formidable as a foe, but serviceable as an ally. It is the part of sound policy, therefore, to approach him and endeavor to prevail upon him to swear by God not to deal falsely with him or his. "Kin and kith." We have adopted these words to represent the conversational alliterative phrase of the original. They correspond tolerably well with the &#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;  sperma and &#x3bf;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;  onoma, "seed" and "name," of the Septuagint. Abraham frankly consents to this oath. This is evidently a personal covenant, referring to existing circumstances. A similar confederacy had been already formed with Aner, Eshkol, and Mamre. Abraham was disposed to such alliances, as they contributed to peaceful neighborhood. He was not in a condition to make a national covenant, though it is a fact that the Philistines were scarcely ever wholly subjugated by his descendants.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/genesis/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Ge 21:22-34.

The words, "he took bread and a bottle of water and gave it to Hagar, putting it (&#1513;&#1474;&#1501; participle, not perfect) upon her shoulder, and the boy, and sent her away," do not state the Abraham gave her Ishmael also to carry. For &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1500;&#1491; does not depend upon &#1513;&#1474;&#1501; and &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1503; because of the copula &#1493;, but upon &#1497;&#1511;&#1468;&#1495;, the leading verb of the sentence, although it is separated from it by the parenthesis "putting it upon her shoulder." It does not follow from these words, therefore, that Ishmael is represented as a little child. Nor is this implied in the statement which follows, that Hagar, when wandering about in the desert, "cast the boy under one of the shrubs," because the water in the bottle was gone. For &#1497;&#1500;&#1491; like &#1504;&#1506;&#1512; does not mean an infant, but a boy, and also a young man (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-23.htm">Genesis 4:23</a>); - Ishmael must have been 15 or 16 years old, as he was 14 before Isaac was born (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/21-5.htm">Genesis 21:5</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/16-16.htm">Genesis 16:16</a>); - and &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1497;&#1498;, "to throw," signifies that she suddenly left hold of the boy, when he fell exhausted from thirst, just as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-30.htm">Matthew 15:30</a> &#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; is used for laying hastily down. Though despairing of his life, the mother took care that at least he should breathe out his life in the shade, and she sat over against him weeping, "in the distance as archers," i.e., according to a concise simile very common in Hebrew, as far off as archers are accustomed to place the target. Her maternal love could not bear to see him die, and yet she would not lose sight of him.</body></html>
