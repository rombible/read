As Jerome remarks, the boy thus going hand in hand with his mother must have been her companion in her journey, and not a burden upon her shoulder. We must add that the words do not refer to what she was to do immediately, but to the future. She was not simply to lead him to the water, but to be his brave and faithful protector, such as we learn that she really became.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/21.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>21:14-21 If Hagar and Ishmael had behaved well in Abraham's family, they might have continued there; but they were justly punished. By abusing privileges, we forfeit them. Those who know not when they are well off, will be made to know the worth of mercies by the want of them. They were brought to distress in the wilderness. It is not said that the provisions were spent, or that Abraham sent them away without money. But the water was spent; and having lost their way, in that hot climate Ishmael was soon overcome with fatigue and thirst. God's readiness to help us when we are in trouble, must not slacken, but quicken our endeavours to help ourselves. The promise concerning her son is repeated, as a reason why Hagar should bestir herself to help him. It should engage our care and pains about children and young people, to consider that we know not what great use God has designed them for, and may make of them. The angel directs her to a present supply. Many who have reason to be comforted, go mourning from day to day, because they do not see the reason they have for comfort. There is a well of water near them in the covenant of grace, but they are not aware of it, till the same God that opened their eyes to see their wound, opens them to see their remedy. Paran was a wild place, fit for a wild man; such as Ishmael. Those who are born after the flesh, take up with the wilderness of this world, while the children of the promise aim at the heavenly Canaan, and cannot be at rest till they are there. Yet God was with the lad; his outward welfare was owing to this.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/genesis/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The fortunes of Ishmael. God cares for the wanderers. He hears the voice of the lad, whose sufferings from thirst are greater than those of the mother. An angel is sent, who addresses Hagar in the simple words of encouragement and direction. "Hold thy hand upon him." Lay thy hand firmly upon him. The former promise <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/16-10.htm">Genesis 16:10</a> is renewed to her. God also opened her eyes that she saw a well of water, from which the bottle is replenished, and she and the lad are recruited for their further journey. It is unnecessary to determine how far this opening of the eyes was miraculous. It may refer to the cheering of her mind and the sharpening of her attention. In Scripture the natural and supernatural are not always set over against each other as with us. All events are alike ascribed to an ever-watchful Providence, whether they flow from the ordinary laws of nature or some higher law of the divine will. "God was with the lad." Ishmael may have been cured of his childish spleen. It is possible also his father did not forget him, but sent him a stock of cattle with which to begin the pastoral life on his account. "He became an archer." He grew an archer, or multiplied into a tribe of archers. Paran <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-6.htm">Genesis 14:6</a> lay south of Palestine, and therefore on the way to Egypt, out of which his mother took him a wife. The Ishmaelites, therefore, both root and branch, were descended on the mother's side from the Egyptians.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/genesis/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15. the water was spent, &c.&#8212;Ishmael sank exhausted from fatigue and thirst&#8212;his mother laid his head under one of the bushes to smell the damp while she herself, unable to witness his distress, sat down at a little distance in hopeless sorrow.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/genesis/21.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> i.e. Support or sustain thy languishing child with thy hand; for I will bless him, and thy care shall not be in vain. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/genesis/21.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Arise, lift up the lad,....

The demand, which apparently proceeded from maternal jealousy, displeased Abraham greatly "because of his son," - partly because in Ishmael he loved his own flesh and blood, and partly on account of the promise received for him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-18.htm">Genesis 17:18</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-20.htm">Genesis 17:20</a>). But God (Elohim, since there is no appearance mentioned, but the divine will was made known to him inwardly) commanded him to comply with Sarah's demand: "for in Isaac shall seed (posterity) be called to thee." This expression cannot mean "thy descendants will call themselves after Isaac," for in that case, at all events, &#1494;&#1512;&#1506;&#1498; would be used; for "in (through) Isaac shall seed be called into existence to thee," for &#1511;&#1512;&#1488; does not mean to call into existence; but, "in the person of Isaac shall there be posterity to thee, which shall pass as such," for &#1504;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488; includes existence and the recognition of existence. Though the noun is not defined by any article, the seed intended must be that to which all the promises of God referred, and with which God would establish His covenant (<a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/17-21.htm">Genesis 17:21</a>, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/9-7.htm">Romans 9:7-8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-18.htm">Hebrews 11:18</a>). To make the dismissal of Ishmael easier to the paternal heart, God repeated to Abraham (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/21-13.htm">Genesis 21:13</a>) the promise already given him with regard to this son (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-20.htm">Genesis 17:20</a>).</body></html>
