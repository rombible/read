He considers Simeon as already dead, being in the power of so rough a man as they described the lord of the country to be: he reflects on his former loss of Joseph, and he looks on Benjamin, the only remaining pledge of his beloved Rachel, as already taken from him. And what makes it the more moving is, that by his expressions it seems as if he thought his sons did not sympathize with him, and were little affected with these calamities.

It troubled the good man. Even the bundles of money Joseph returned, in kindness, to his father, frightened him. He laid the fault upon his sons; knowing them, he feared they had provoked the Egyptians, and wrongfully brought home their money. Jacob plainly distrusted his sons, remembering that he never saw Joseph since he had been with them. It is bad with a family, when children behave so ill that their parents know not how to trust them. Jacob gives up Joseph for gone, and Simeon and Benjamin as in danger; and concludes, All these things are against me. It proved otherwise, that all these things were for him, were working together for his good, and the good of his family. We often think that to be against us, which is really for us. We are afflicted in body, estate, name, and in our relations; and think all these things are against us, whereas they are really working for us a weight of glory. Thus does the Lord Jesus conceal himself and his favour, thus he rebukes and chastens those for whom he has purposes of love. By sharp corrections and humbling convictions he will break the stoutness and mar the pride of the heart, and bring to true repentance. Yet before sinners fully know him, or taste that he is gracious, he consults their good, and sustains their souls, to wait for him. May we do thus, never yielding to discouragement, determining to seek no other refuge, and humbling ourselves more and more under his mighty hand. In due time he will answer our petitions, and do for us more than we can expect.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/genesis/42.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Upon emptying the other sacks all the silver turns up, to their great amazement and consternation. Jacob laments the loss of his son. Reuben offers two of his sons to Jacob as pledges for Benjamin, to be slain if he did not bring him back in safety. The sorrowing parent cannot yet bring himself to consent to Benjamin's departure on this hazardous journey. "And ye shall bring down." Jacob either speaks here in the querulous tone of afflicted old age, or he had come to know or suspect that his brothers had some hand in the disappearance of Joseph. <p> - Joseph and His Eleven Brethren<p>11. &#1491;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473;  debash, "honey," from the bee, or sirup from the juice of the grape. &#1489;&#1496;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;  bo&#770;t&#803;en, "pistachio nuts." &#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1491;  sha&#770;qe&#770;d, "almond tree;" related: "awake."

The language does not imply that his missing sons had got foul play from the hands of the rest, but he looks upon Simeon as lost, as well as Joseph, and he insinuates it was by some imprudent statements of theirs that he was exposed to the risk of losing Benjamin also.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/genesis/42.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Simeon is not; </span> he gave him up for lost, as being, as he thought, in the power of a cruel enemy. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">All these things are against me; </span> I am the great sufferer in all these things: you carry yourselves as if you were neither concerned nor affected with them. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/genesis/42.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Jacob their father said unto them, me have ye bereaved of my children,....
