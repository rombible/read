The first is <span class= "ital">zebed; </span>and here there is no difficulty. It means such presents as a father gives his daughter on her marriage, over and above those enumerated in the marriage contract. Of the second, <span class= "ital">zabal, </span>there is no trace. Nor do the Syro-Arabic lexicons acknowledge in the word “Zebulun” such a sense as that of <span class= "ital">dwelling, </span>given it in our margin. Bar-Ali explains it as meaning “salvation of the night, or a good dowry,” and Bar- Bahlul, “a dowry of the night,” both deriving it from <span class= "ital">zebed, </span>a dowry, and <span class= "ital">lun, </span>to pass the night. The derivation is wrong as far as concerns <span class= "ital">lun; </span>for the word Zebulun is formed simply from <span class= "ital">zebed, </span>the final <span class= "ital">d </span>of which is changed into I for mere reasons of euphony. The Versions take the word <span class= "ital">zabal </span>as mean ing, “to be with,” Vulg.; “to choose,” LXX.; “to cleave to,” Syriac. It occurs nowhere else, but the substantive <span class= "ital">zebul </span>is not uncommon, and means <span class= "ital">dwelling, station.</span><p>As a woman’s value in the East rises with each son, Leah now hoped for more love from her husband.

"Mandrakes" - the fruit of the "mandragora vernaIis," which is to this day supposed to promote fruitfulness of the womb. Rachel therefore desires to partake of them, and obtains them by a compact with Leah. Leah betakes herself to prayer, and bears a fifth son. She calls him "Issakar," with a double allusion. She had hired her husband with the mandrakes, and had received this son as her hire for giving her maid to her husband; which she regards as an act of generosity or self-denial. "Zebulun." Here Leah confesses, "God hath endowed me with a good dowry." She speaks now like Rachel of the God of nature. The cherished thought that her husband will dwell with her who is the mother of six sons takes form in the name. "Dinah" is the only daughter of Jacob mentioned <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/46-7.htm">Genesis 46:7</a>, and that on account of her subsequent connection with the history of Jacob <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/34.htm">Genesis 34</a>.

And Leah said, God hath endued me with a good dowry&#8212;The birth of a son is hailed with demonstrations of joy, and the possession of several sons confers upon the mother an honor and respectability proportioned to their number. The husband attaches a similar importance to the possession, and it forms a bond of union which renders it impossible for him ever to forsake or to be cold to a wife who has borne him sons. This explains the happy anticipations Leah founded on the possession of her six sons.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/genesis/30.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="ital">cir. 1746</span> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/genesis/30.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Leah said, God hath endued me with a good dowry,....

In the second clause the derivation is taken from the word <span class="ital">zabal</span>, “he dwelt.” Presumably both popular etymologies were current. The interchange of <span class="ital">d</span> and <span class="ital">l</span> sounds is well known; cf. <span class="greekheb">δάκρυον</span> = Lat. <span class="ital">lachryma</span>. Assyriologists suggest a derivation from the Assyrian <span class="ital">zabalu</span>, “lift up,” “exalt,” “honour.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The two tribes of Issachar and Zebulun occupied adjoining territories.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/genesis/30.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Other Children of Leah. - How thoroughly henceforth the two wives were carried away by constant jealousy of the love and attachment of their husband, is evident from the affair of the love-apples, which Leah's son Reuben, who was then four years old, found in the field and brought to his mother. &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501;, &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3bb;&#x3b1; &#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; (lxx), the yellow apples of the alraun (Mandragora vernalis), a mandrake very common in Palestine. They are about the size of a nutmeg, with a strong and agreeable odour, and were used by the ancients, as they still are by the Arabs, as a means of promoting child-bearing. To Rachel's request that she would give her some, Leah replied (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/30-15.htm">Genesis 30:15</a>): "Is it too little, that thou hast taken (drawn away from me) my husband, to take also" (&#1500;&#1511;&#1495;&#1514; infin.), i.e., that thou wouldst also take, "my son's mandrakes?" At length she parted with them, on condition that Rachel would let Jacob sleep with her the next night. After relating how Leah conceived again, and Rachel continued barren in spite of the mandrakes, the writer justly observes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/30-17.htm">Genesis 30:17</a>), "Elohim hearkened unto Leah," to show that it was not from such natural means as love-apples, but from God the author of life, that she had received such fruitfulness. Leah saw in the birth of her fifth son a divine reward for having given her maid to her husband - a recompense, that is, for her self-denial; and she named him on that account Issaschar, &#1497;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1512;, a strange form, to be understood either according to the Chethib &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1512; &#1497;&#1513;&#1473; "there is reward," or according to the Keri &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1512; &#1497;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1488; "he bears (brings) reward." At length she bore her sixth son, and named him Zebulun, i.e., "dwelling;" for she hoped that now, after God had endowed her with a good portion, her husband, to whom she had born six sons, would dwell with her, i.e., become more warmly attached to her. The name is from &#1494;&#1489;&#1500; to dwell, with acc. constr. "to inhabit," formed with a play upon the alliteration in the word &#1494;&#1489;&#1491; to present - two &#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be; &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;. In connection with these two births, Leah mentions Elohim alone, the supernatural giver, and not Jehovah, the covenant God, whose grace had been forced out of her heart by jealousy. She afterwards bore a daughter, Dinah, who is mentioned simply because of the account in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/34.htm">Genesis 34</a>; for, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/37-35.htm">Genesis 37:35</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/46-7.htm">Genesis 46:7</a>, Jacob had several daughters, though they were nowhere mentioned by name. </body></html>
