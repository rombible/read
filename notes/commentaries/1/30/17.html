"Mandrakes" - the fruit of the "mandragora vernaIis," which is to this day supposed to promote fruitfulness of the womb. Rachel therefore desires to partake of them, and obtains them by a compact with Leah. Leah betakes herself to prayer, and bears a fifth son. She calls him "Issakar," with a double allusion. She had hired her husband with the mandrakes, and had received this son as her hire for giving her maid to her husband; which she regards as an act of generosity or self-denial. "Zebulun." Here Leah confesses, "God hath endowed me with a good dowry." She speaks now like Rachel of the God of nature. The cherished thought that her husband will dwell with her who is the mother of six sons takes form in the name. "Dinah" is the only daughter of Jacob mentioned <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/46-7.htm">Genesis 46:7</a>, and that on account of her subsequent connection with the history of Jacob <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/34.htm">Genesis 34</a>.

Bilhah &#8230; Zilpah&#8212;Following the example of Sarah with regard to Hagar, an example which is not seldom imitated still, she adopted the children of her maid. Leah took the same course. A bitter and intense rivalry existed between them, all the more from their close relationship as sisters; and although they occupied separate apartments, with their families, as is the uniform custom where a plurality of wives obtains, and the husband and father spends a day with each in regular succession, that did not allay their mutual jealousies.

To the prayer of Leah, as the Targum of Jonathan, for more children: the desire of these good women for the company of their husband was not from lust, or an amorous desire in them, but for the sake of having many children, as appears by giving their maids to him; and the reason of this was, as Bishop Patrick well observes, that the promise made to Abraham of the multiplication of his seed, and of the Messiah springing from thence, might be fulfilled; and is the true reason of Moses's taking such particular notice of those things, which might seem below the dignity of such a sacred history: <p>and she conceived, and bare Jacob the fifth son; the fifth he had by her, but the ninth in all, that were born unto him. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/genesis/30.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And God hearkened unto Leah, and she conceived, and bare Jacob the fifth son.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/30.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And God hearkened unto Leah</span>, - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> unto Leah's prayers (Onkelos, Jerome, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Murphy), which Calvin thinks <span class="accented">doubtful - quis enim putaret</span>, <span class="accented">dum odiose sorori suae negat Lea fructus a puero collectos</span>, <span class="accented">et hoc pretio noctem mariti mercatur</span>, <span class="accented">ullum esse precibus locum</span>.

The means employed by Rachel to retain the favour of her husband made her jealous; and jealousy drove her to the employment of the same means. Jacob begat two sons by Zilpah her maid. The one Leah named Gad, i.e., "good fortune," saying, &#1489;&#1468;&#1490;&#1491;, "with good fortune," according to the Chethib, for which the Masoretic reading is &#1490;&#1468;&#1491; &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;, "good fortune has come," - not, however, from any ancient tradition, for the Sept. reads &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#837;, but simply from a subjective and really unnecessary conjecture, since &#1489;&#1468;&#1490;&#1491;  equals  "to my good fortune," sc., a son is born, gives a very suitable meaning. The second she named Asher, i.e., the happy one, or bringer of happiness; for she said, &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;, "to my happiness, for daughters call me happy," i.e., as a mother with children. The perfect &#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1512;&#1504;&#1497; relates to "what she had now certainly reached" (Del.). Leah did not think of God in connection with these two births. They were nothing more than the successful and welcome result of the means she had employed. </body></html>
