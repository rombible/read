The authors of the Authorised Version evidently thought that Laban himself removed all speckled sheep and goats, and kept them; but the Hebrew is by no means so much in favour of this view as their own translation. Thus, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/30-32.htm" title="I will pass through all your flock to day, removing from there all the speckled and spotted cattle, and all the brown cattle among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats: and of such shall be my hire.">Genesis 30:32</a> they insert “of such” in italics; the Hebrew distinctly says, <span class= "ital">And it shall be my hire: </span>that is, every one speckled or spotted shall be <span class= "ital">mine, </span>the singular number being used throughout. Next, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/30-33.htm" title="So shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come, when it shall come for my hire before your face: every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and brown among the sheep, that shall be counted stolen with me.">Genesis 30:33</a> they translate, <span class= "ital">in time to come: </span>according to this, if the particoloured sheep and goats at any time produced white or black lambs, as they generally would, such would revert to Laban; the Hebrew says, <span class= "ital">My righteousness shall answer for me to-morrow. </span>Jacob was to make the selection at once, but the next day Laban was to look over all those put aside, and if he found among them any white sheep, or black or brown goats, he was to regard them as stolen—that is, not merely might he take them back, but require the usual fine or compensation.<p><span class= "bld">And gave them into the hand of his sons.</span>—It has been assumed that these were Laban’s sons, on the ground that Jacob’s sons were not old enough to undertake the charge; but as Reuben was twenty-six, this was not the case. Jacob’s flocks would have fared but badly if they had been entrusted to Laban’s sons, nor could he, six years later, have escaped, had his property been in their keeping, without Laban being immediately aware of it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/genesis/30.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/30-35.htm" title="And he removed that day the he goats that were ringstraked and spotted, and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted, and every one that had some white in it, and all the brown among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons....">Genesis 30:35-36</a>. </span><span class="ital">He gave them into the hands of his sons — </span>To be fed apart by themselves, lest Jacob should get any of them to mix with those of one colour. <span class="ital">He set three days’ journey betwixt himself and Jacob — </span>Such journeys as flocks are able to make, that they might not so much as see one another. Between this and the 37th verse, the Samaritan copy inserts a paragraph about the angel’s appearing to Jacob in a dream, which is not found in any other version; but is related by Jacob himself in the following chapter, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/30-11.htm" title="And Leah said, A troop comes: and she called his name Gad.">Genesis 30:11</a>, as a thing which had happened to him, and which justifies the policy which the subsequent verses represent him as using.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/30.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>30:25-43 The fourteen years being gone, Jacob was willing to depart without any provision, except God's promise. But he had in many ways a just claim on Laban's substance, and it was the will of God that he should be provided for from it. He referred his cause to God, rather than agree for stated wages with Laban, whose selfishness was very great. And it would appear that he acted honestly, when none but those of the colours fixed upon should be found among his cattle. Laban selfishly thought that his cattle would produce few different in colour from their own. Jacob's course after this agreement has been considered an instance of his policy and management. But it was done by intimation from God, and as a token of his power. The Lord will one way or another plead the cause of the oppressed, and honour those who simply trust his providence. Neither could Laban complain of Jacob, for he had nothing more than was freely agreed that he should have; nor was he injured, but greatly benefitted by Jacob's services. May all our mercies be received with thanksgiving and prayer, that coming from his bounty, they may lead to his praise.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/genesis/30.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Jacob enters into a new contract of service with Laban. "When Rachel had borne Joseph." Jacob cannot ask his dismissal until the twice seven years of service were completed. Hence, the birth of Joseph, which is the date of his request, took place at the earliest in the fifteenth year of his sojourn with Laban. Jacob now wishes to return home, from which he had been detained so long by serving for Rachel. He no doubt expects of Laban the means at least of accomplishing his journey. Laban is loath to part with him. "I have divined" - I have been an attentive observer. The result of his observation is expressed in the following words. "Appoint." Laban offers to leave the fixing of the hire to Jacob. "Thy hire upon me," which I will take upon me as binding. Jacob touches upon the value of his services, perhaps with the tacit feeling that Laban in equity owed him at least the means of returning to his home. "Brake forth" - increased. "At my foot" - under my guidance and tending of thy flocks.<p>"Do" - provide. "Thou shalt not give me anything." This shows that Jacob had no stock from Laban to begin with. "I will pass through all thy flock today" with thee. "Remove thou thence every speckled and spotted sheep, and every brown sheep among the lambs, and the spotted and speckled among the goats." These were the rare colors, as in the East the sheep are usually white, and the goats black or dark brown. "And such shall be my hire." Such as these uncommon party-colored cattle, when they shall appear among the flock already cleared of them; and not those of this description that are now removed. For in this case Laban would have given Jacob something; whereas Jacob was resolved to be entirely dependent on the divine providence for his hire. "And my righteousness will answer for me." The color will determine at once whose the animal is. Laban willingly consents to so favorable a proposal, removes the party-colored animals from the flock, gives them into the hands of his sons, and puts an interval of three days' journey between them and the pure stock which remains in Jacob's hands. Jacob is now to begin with nothing, and have for his hire any party-colored lambs or kids that appear in those flocks, from which every specimen of this rare class has been carefully removed.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/genesis/30.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>32. I will pass through all thy flock to-day&#8212;Eastern sheep being generally white, the goats black, and spotted or speckled ones comparatively few and rare, Jacob proposed to remove all existing ones of that description from the flock, and to be content with what might appear at the next lambing time. The proposal seemed so much in favor of Laban, that he at once agreed to it. But Jacob has been accused of taking advantage of his uncle, and though it is difficult to exculpate him from practising some degree of dissimulation, he was only availing himself of the results of his great skill and experience in the breeding of cattle. But it is evident from the next chapter (Ge 31:5-13) that there was something miraculous and that the means he had employed had been suggested by a divine intimation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/genesis/30.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The he-goats that were ring-straked, </span> which had lines or strakes like bands about them of diverse colours from the rest of their body. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Every one that had some white:</span> this word <span class="ital">some</span> is oft understood in other texts of Scripture, and here it is so necessarily; as appears both from the thing itself, as it is related, and from the phrase; for he saith not <span class="ital">that was white, </span> but <span class="ital">that had white in it, </span> to wit, mixed with other colours. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/genesis/30.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he removed that day the he goats that were ringstraked and spotted,....

Laban, however, entreated him to remain, for he had perceived that Jehovah, Jacob's God, had blessed him for his sake; and told him to fix his wages for further service. The words, "if I have found favour in thine eyes" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/30-27.htm">Genesis 30:27</a>), contain an aposiopesis, sc., then remain. &#1504;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; "a heathen expression, like augurando cognovi" (Delitzsch). &#1506;&#1500;&#1497; &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1512;&#1498; thy wages, which it will be binding upon me to give. Jacob reminded him, on the other hand, what service he had rendered him, how Jehovah's blessing had followed "at his foot," and asked when he should begin to provide for his own house. But when Laban repeated the question, what should he give him, Jacob offered to feed and keep his flock still, upon one condition, which was founded upon the fact, that in the East the goats, as a rule, are black or dark-brown, rarely white or spotted with white, and that the sheep for the most part are white, very seldom black or speckled. Jacob required as wages, namely, all the speckled, spotted, and black among the sheep, and all the speckled, spotted, and white among the goats; and offered "even to-day" to commence separating them, so that "to-morrow" Laban might convince himself of the uprightness of his proceedings. &#1492;&#1505;&#1512; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/30-32.htm">Genesis 30:32</a>) cannot be imperative, because of the preceding &#1488;&#1506;&#1489;&#1512;, but must be infinitive: "I will go through the whole flock to-day to remove from thence all...;" and &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1512;&#1497; &#1492;&#1497;&#1492; signifies "what is removed shall be my wages," but not everything of an abnormal colour that shall hereafter be found in the flock. This was no doubt intended by Jacob, as the further course of the narrative shows, but it is not involved in the words of <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/30-32.htm">Genesis 30:32</a>. Either the writer has restricted himself to the main fact, and omitted to mention that it was also agreed at the same time that the separation should be repeated at certain regular periods, and that all the sheep of an abnormal colour in Laban's flock should also be set aside as part of Jacob's wages; or this point was probably not mentioned at first, but taken for granted by both parties, since Jacob took measures with that idea to his own advantage, and even Laban, notwithstanding the frequent alteration of the contract with which Jacob charged him (<a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/31-7.htm">Genesis 31:7-8</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-41.htm">Genesis 31:41</a>), does not appear to have disputed this right. </body></html>
