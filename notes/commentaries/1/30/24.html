The truth appears to be, that they were influenced by the promises of God to Abraham; whose posterity were promised the richest blessings, and from whom the Messiah was to descend.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/genesis/30.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>"God remembered Rachel," in the best time for her, after he had taught her the lessons of dependence and patience. "Joseph." There is a remote allusion to her gratitude for the reproach of barrenness taken away. But there is also hope in the name. The selfish feeling also has died away, and the thankful Rachel rises from Elohim, the invisible Eternal, to Yahweh, the manifest Self-existent. The birth of Joseph was after the fourteen years of service were completed.

They are about the size of a nutmeg, with a strong and agreeable odour, and were used by the ancients, as they still are by the Arabs, as a means of promoting child-bearing. To Rachel's request that she would give her some, Leah replied (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/30-15.htm">Genesis 30:15</a>): "Is it too little, that thou hast taken (drawn away from me) my husband, to take also" (&#1500;&#1511;&#1495;&#1514; infin.), i.e., that thou wouldst also take, "my son's mandrakes?" At length she parted with them, on condition that Rachel would let Jacob sleep with her the next night. After relating how Leah conceived again, and Rachel continued barren in spite of the mandrakes, the writer justly observes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/30-17.htm">Genesis 30:17</a>), "Elohim hearkened unto Leah," to show that it was not from such natural means as love-apples, but from God the author of life, that she had received such fruitfulness. Leah saw in the birth of her fifth son a divine reward for having given her maid to her husband - a recompense, that is, for her self-denial; and she named him on that account Issaschar, &#1497;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1512;, a strange form, to be understood either according to the Chethib &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1512; &#1497;&#1513;&#1473; "there is reward," or according to the Keri &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1512; &#1497;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1488; "he bears (brings) reward." At length she bore her sixth son, and named him Zebulun, i.e., "dwelling;" for she hoped that now, after God had endowed her with a good portion, her husband, to whom she had born six sons, would dwell with her, i.e., become more warmly attached to her. The name is from &#1494;&#1489;&#1500; to dwell, with acc. constr. "to inhabit," formed with a play upon the alliteration in the word &#1494;&#1489;&#1491; to present - two &#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be; &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;. In connection with these two births, Leah mentions Elohim alone, the supernatural giver, and not Jehovah, the covenant God, whose grace had been forced out of her heart by jealousy. She afterwards bore a daughter, Dinah, who is mentioned simply because of the account in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/34.htm">Genesis 34</a>; for, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/37-35.htm">Genesis 37:35</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/46-7.htm">Genesis 46:7</a>, Jacob had several daughters, though they were nowhere mentioned by name. </body></html>
