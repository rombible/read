The utter degradation of Lot and his family is the most painful part of his story, which thus ends in his intense shame.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/genesis/19.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-32.htm" title="Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.">Genesis 19:32</a></span>. <span class="ital">Come, let us make our father drink wine — </span>Although, upon the whole, Lot was a righteous man, and possessed of many amiable qualities, yet it evidently appears that his principles also, as well as those of his daughters, had suffered some degree of contamination by the society of evil-doers, otherwise surely he would have withstood every temptation to excess of drinking. Here the history of Lot ends; after this we hear no more of him or of his daughters. We cannot but be sorry to leave them under so dark a cloud. He, indeed, we have reason to believe, lived to repent of his sin, otherwise St. Peter would not have spoken so honourably of him; but we have no proof that his daughters repented of theirs. And certainly the children thus desired, and in this unlawful way obtained, were monuments of their own and their father’s reproach, and the names they thought fit to give them, which descended to their posterity, perpetuated the memory of their sin and shame to all generations: <span class="ital">Moab </span>signifying, <span class="ital">of my father, </span>and <span class="ital">Ben-Ammi, the son of my people.</span><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/19.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>19:30-38 See the peril of security. Lot, who kept chaste in Sodom, and was a mourner for the wickedness of the place, and a witness against it, when in the mountain, alone, and, as he thought, out of the way of temptation, is shamefully overtaken. Let him that thinks he stands high, and stands firm, take heed lest he fall. See the peril of drunkenness; it is not only a great sin itself, but lets in many sins, which bring a lasting wound and dishonour. Many a man does that, when he is drunk, which, when he is sober, he could not think of without horror. See also the peril of temptation, even from relations and friends, whom we love and esteem, and expect kindness from. We must dread a snare, wherever we are, and be always upon our guard. No excuse can be made for the daughters, nor for Lot. Scarcely any account can be given of the affair but this, The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked: who can know it? From the silence of the Scripture concerning Lot henceforward, learn that drunkenness, as it makes men forgetful, so it makes them to be forgotten.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/genesis/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The descendants of Lot. Bewildered by the narrowness of his escape, and the awful death of his wife, Lot seems to have left Zoar, and taken to the mountain west of the Salt Sea, in terror of impending ruin. It is not improbable that all the inhabitants of Zoar, panic-struck, may have fled from the region of danger, and dispersed themselves for a time through the adjacent mountains. He was now far from the habitations of people, with his two daughters as his only companions. The manners of Sodom here obtrude themselves upon our view. Lot's daughters might seem to have been led to this unnatural project, first, because they thought the human race extinct with the exception of themselves, in which case their conduct may have seemed a work of justifiable necessity; and next, because the degrees of kindred within which it was unlawful to marry had not been determined by an express law. But they must have seen some of the inhabitants of Zoar after the destruction of the cities; and carnal intercourse between parent and offspring must have been always repugnant to nature. "Unto this day." This phrase indicates a variable period, from a few years to a few centuries: a few years; not more than seven, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/22-3.htm">Joshua 22:3</a>; part of a lifetime, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/22-30.htm">Numbers 22:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/6-25.htm">Joshua 6:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/48-15.htm">Genesis 48:15</a>; and some centuries, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-6.htm">Exodus 10:6</a>. This passage may therefore have been written by one much earlier than Moses. Moab afterward occupied the district south of the Arnon, and east of the Salt Sea. Ammon dwelt to the northeast of Moab, where they had a capital called Rabbah. They both ultimately merged into the more general class of the Arabs, as a second Palgite element. <p> - Abraham in Gerar<p>2. &#1488;&#1489;&#1497;&#1502;&#1500;&#1498; .2  'a&#780;b&#305;&#770;ymelek, Abimelekh, "father of the king."<p>7. &#1504;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488;  na&#772;b&#305;&#770;y' "prophet," he who speaks by God, of God, and to God, who declares to people not merely things future, but also things past and present, that are not obvious to the sense or the reason; related: "flow, go forth."<p>13. &#1492;&#1514;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;  h&#305;&#770;t&#8219;u&#770; is plural in punctuation, agreeing grammatically with &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501;  'e&#774;loh&#305;&#770;ym. &#1493;(w), however, may be regarded as the third radical, and the verb may thus really be singular.<p>16. &#1504;&#1499;&#1492;&#1514;  nokachat an unusual form, either for &#1504;&#1499;&#1495;&#1514;  nokah&#803;at the second person singular feminine perfect or &#1504;&#1499;&#1495;&#1492;  nokeh&#803;a&#770;h the third person singular feminine perfect, from a verb signifying in hiphil, "make straight, right."<p>17. &#1488;&#1502;&#1492;  'a&#772;ma&#770;h "hand-maid," free or bond. &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1495;&#1492;  sh&#305;&#770;pcha&#770;h "bond-maid" <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-41.htm">1 Samuel 25:41</a>.<p>The concealment of his relation to Sarah calls to our mind a similar act of Abraham recorded not many pages back. We are to remember, however, that an interval of twenty-four years has elapsed since that event. From the present passage we learn that this was an old agreement between him and his wife, while they were wandering among strangers. It appears that Abraham was not yet conscious of anything wrong or even imprudent in this piece of policy. He therefore practises it without any hesitation. On this occasion he appears for the first time as a prophet. He is the first of this order introduced to our notice in the Old Testament, though Henok had prophesied at an earlier period Jde 1:14, and Noah's benediction was, at the same time, a prediction.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/genesis/19.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>29. when God destroyed the cities, &c.&#8212;This is most welcome and instructive after so painful a narrative. It shows if God is a "consuming fire" to the wicked [De 4:24; Heb 12:29], He is the friend of the righteous. He "remembered" the intercessions of Abraham, and what confidence should not this give us that He will remember the intercessions of a greater than Abraham in our behalf.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/genesis/19.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Wine</span> they carried with them, amongst other necessary provisions, either from Sodom or Zoar. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This, though an incestuous and abominable action, yet they thought was made lawful by the supposed necessity, as in the beginning of the world the marriage of brethren and sisters was lawful because necessary; and when it ceased to be necessary, because of the increase of mankind, it became incestuous. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/genesis/19.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Come, let us make our father drink wine,....

Their proposal was revolting and unnatural in the extreme. By subsequent Mosaic legislation a transgression of such enormity was rendered punishable by death. Even in the present instance the perpetrators were not wholly unconscious of the wickedness of their conduct. The fact that they required a stratagem for the attainment of their purpose shows that at least they could not calculate on their father's approbation. The entire story has been regarded as the invention of later Jewish hatred to the Moabites and Ammonites (De Wette), a conjecture believed by some to be " not improbable (Rosenm&uuml;ller); but if so, how should the same writer exhibit Abraham (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-23.htm">Genesis 18:23</a>) as filled with compassionate tenderness towards the cities of the plain?

We are not to suppose that she was actually turned into one, but having been killed by the fiery and sulphureous vapour with which the air was filled, and afterwards encrusted with salt, she resembled an actual statue of salt; just as even now, from the saline exhalation of the Dead Sea, objects near it are quickly covered with a crust of salt, so that the fact, to which Christ refers in <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/17-32.htm">Luke 17:32</a>, may be understood without supposing a miracle.<p>(Note: But when this pillar of salt is mentioned in Wis. 11:7 and Clemens ad Cor. xi. as still in existence, and Josephus professes to have seen it, this legend is probably based upon the pillar-like lumps of salt, which are still to be seen at Mount Usdum (Sodom), on the south-western side of the Dead Sea.)<p> - In <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/19-27.htm">Genesis 19:27</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/19-28.htm">Genesis 19:28</a>, the account closes with a remark which points back to <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-17.htm">Genesis 18:17</a>., viz., that Abraham went in the morning to the place where he had stood the day before, interceding with the Lord for Sodom, and saw how the judgment had fallen upon the entire plain, since the smoke of the country went up like the smoke of a furnace. Yet his intercession had not been in vain. </body></html>
