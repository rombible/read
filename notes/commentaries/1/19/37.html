Ben-ammi.</span>—Both these names suggest an incestuous origin, but the latter in a less repulsive way. “Son of my people” means one born of intercourse with her own kin and family. It is a striking proof of the vigour of the race of Terah, that from this lone cavern, and after the loss of all the wealth possessed by Lot, these two children were able to reduce to obedience the aborigines dwelling on the eastern shore of the Dead Sea, and establish petty kingdoms there. Both Moabites and Ammonites have finally merged in the Arabs.<p><span class= "bld"><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/19.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>19:30-38 See the peril of security. Lot, who kept chaste in Sodom, and was a mourner for the wickedness of the place, and a witness against it, when in the mountain, alone, and, as he thought, out of the way of temptation, is shamefully overtaken. Let him that thinks he stands high, and stands firm, take heed lest he fall. See the peril of drunkenness; it is not only a great sin itself, but lets in many sins, which bring a lasting wound and dishonour. Many a man does that, when he is drunk, which, when he is sober, he could not think of without horror. See also the peril of temptation, even from relations and friends, whom we love and esteem, and expect kindness from. We must dread a snare, wherever we are, and be always upon our guard. No excuse can be made for the daughters, nor for Lot. Scarcely any account can be given of the affair but this, The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked: who can know it? From the silence of the Scripture concerning Lot henceforward, learn that drunkenness, as it makes men forgetful, so it makes them to be forgotten.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/genesis/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The descendants of Lot. Bewildered by the narrowness of his escape, and the awful death of his wife, Lot seems to have left Zoar, and taken to the mountain west of the Salt Sea, in terror of impending ruin. It is not improbable that all the inhabitants of Zoar, panic-struck, may have fled from the region of danger, and dispersed themselves for a time through the adjacent mountains. He was now far from the habitations of people, with his two daughters as his only companions. The manners of Sodom here obtrude themselves upon our view. Lot's daughters might seem to have been led to this unnatural project, first, because they thought the human race extinct with the exception of themselves, in which case their conduct may have seemed a work of justifiable necessity; and next, because the degrees of kindred within which it was unlawful to marry had not been determined by an express law. But they must have seen some of the inhabitants of Zoar after the destruction of the cities; and carnal intercourse between parent and offspring must have been always repugnant to nature. "Unto this day." This phrase indicates a variable period, from a few years to a few centuries: a few years; not more than seven, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/22-3.htm">Joshua 22:3</a>; part of a lifetime, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/22-30.htm">Numbers 22:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/6-25.htm">Joshua 6:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/48-15.htm">Genesis 48:15</a>; and some centuries, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-6.htm">Exodus 10:6</a>. This passage may therefore have been written by one much earlier than Moses. Moab afterward occupied the district south of the Arnon, and east of the Salt Sea. Ammon dwelt to the northeast of Moab, where they had a capital called Rabbah. They both ultimately merged into the more general class of the Arabs, as a second Palgite element. <p> - Abraham in Gerar<p>2. &#1488;&#1489;&#1497;&#1502;&#1500;&#1498; .2  'a&#780;b&#305;&#770;ymelek, Abimelekh, "father of the king."<p>7. &#1504;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488;  na&#772;b&#305;&#770;y' "prophet," he who speaks by God, of God, and to God, who declares to people not merely things future, but also things past and present, that are not obvious to the sense or the reason; related: "flow, go forth."<p>13. &#1492;&#1514;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;  h&#305;&#770;t&#8219;u&#770; is plural in punctuation, agreeing grammatically with &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501;  'e&#774;loh&#305;&#770;ym. &#1493;(w), however, may be regarded as the third radical, and the verb may thus really be singular.<p>16. &#1504;&#1499;&#1492;&#1514;  nokachat an unusual form, either for &#1504;&#1499;&#1495;&#1514;  nokah&#803;at the second person singular feminine perfect or &#1504;&#1499;&#1495;&#1492;  nokeh&#803;a&#770;h the third person singular feminine perfect, from a verb signifying in hiphil, "make straight, right."<p>17. &#1488;&#1502;&#1492;  'a&#772;ma&#770;h "hand-maid," free or bond. &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1495;&#1492;  sh&#305;&#770;pcha&#770;h "bond-maid" <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-41.htm">1 Samuel 25:41</a>.<p>The concealment of his relation to Sarah calls to our mind a similar act of Abraham recorded not many pages back. We are to remember, however, that an interval of twenty-four years has elapsed since that event. From the present passage we learn that this was an old agreement between him and his wife, while they were wandering among strangers. It appears that Abraham was not yet conscious of anything wrong or even imprudent in this piece of policy. He therefore practises it without any hesitation. On this occasion he appears for the first time as a prophet. He is the first of this order introduced to our notice in the Old Testament, though Henok had prophesied at an earlier period Jde 1:14, and Noah's benediction was, at the same time, a prediction.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/genesis/19.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>29. when God destroyed the cities, &c.&#8212;This is most welcome and instructive after so painful a narrative. It shows if God is a "consuming fire" to the wicked [De 4:24; Heb 12:29], He is the friend of the righteous. He "remembered" the intercessions of Abraham, and what confidence should not this give us that He will remember the intercessions of a greater than Abraham in our behalf.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/genesis/19.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="ital">1807</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Called his name Moab, </span> i.e. <span class="ital">of my father, </span> begotten upon me by my father.

While there, his daughters resolved to procure children through their father; and to that end on two successive evenings they made him intoxicated with wine, and then lay with him in the might, one after the other, that they might conceive seed. To this accursed crime they were impelled by the desire to preserve their family, because they thought there was no man on the earth to come in unto them, i.e., to marry them, "after the manner of all the earth." Not that they imagined the whole human race to have perished in the destruction of the valley of Siddim, but because they were afraid that no man would link himself with them, the only survivors of a country smitten by the curse of God. If it was not lust, therefore, which impelled them to this shameful deed, their conduct was worthy of Sodom, and shows quite as much as their previous betrothal to men of Sodom, that they were deeply imbued with the sinful character of that city.

They merely mean, that in his intoxicated state, though not entirely unconscious, yet he lay with his daughters without clearly knowing what he was doing.</body></html>
