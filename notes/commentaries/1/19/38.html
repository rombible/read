Lot, who kept chaste in Sodom, and was a mourner for the wickedness of the place, and a witness against it, when in the mountain, alone, and, as he thought, out of the way of temptation, is shamefully overtaken. Let him that thinks he stands high, and stands firm, take heed lest he fall. See the peril of drunkenness; it is not only a great sin itself, but lets in many sins, which bring a lasting wound and dishonour. Many a man does that, when he is drunk, which, when he is sober, he could not think of without horror. See also the peril of temptation, even from relations and friends, whom we love and esteem, and expect kindness from. We must dread a snare, wherever we are, and be always upon our guard. No excuse can be made for the daughters, nor for Lot. Scarcely any account can be given of the affair but this, The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked: who can know it? From the silence of the Scripture concerning Lot henceforward, learn that drunkenness, as it makes men forgetful, so it makes them to be forgotten.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/genesis/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The descendants of Lot. Bewildered by the narrowness of his escape, and the awful death of his wife, Lot seems to have left Zoar, and taken to the mountain west of the Salt Sea, in terror of impending ruin. It is not improbable that all the inhabitants of Zoar, panic-struck, may have fled from the region of danger, and dispersed themselves for a time through the adjacent mountains. He was now far from the habitations of people, with his two daughters as his only companions. The manners of Sodom here obtrude themselves upon our view. Lot's daughters might seem to have been led to this unnatural project, first, because they thought the human race extinct with the exception of themselves, in which case their conduct may have seemed a work of justifiable necessity; and next, because the degrees of kindred within which it was unlawful to marry had not been determined by an express law. But they must have seen some of the inhabitants of Zoar after the destruction of the cities; and carnal intercourse between parent and offspring must have been always repugnant to nature. "Unto this day." This phrase indicates a variable period, from a few years to a few centuries: a few years; not more than seven, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/22-3.htm">Joshua 22:3</a>; part of a lifetime, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/22-30.htm">Numbers 22:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/6-25.htm">Joshua 6:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/48-15.htm">Genesis 48:15</a>; and some centuries, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-6.htm">Exodus 10:6</a>. This passage may therefore have been written by one much earlier than Moses. Moab afterward occupied the district south of the Arnon, and east of the Salt Sea. Ammon dwelt to the northeast of Moab, where they had a capital called Rabbah. They both ultimately merged into the more general class of the Arabs, as a second Palgite element. <p> - Abraham in Gerar<p>2. &#1488;&#1489;&#1497;&#1502;&#1500;&#1498; .2  'a&#780;b&#305;&#770;ymelek, Abimelekh, "father of the king."<p>7. &#1504;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488;  na&#772;b&#305;&#770;y' "prophet," he who speaks by God, of God, and to God, who declares to people not merely things future, but also things past and present, that are not obvious to the sense or the reason; related: "flow, go forth."<p>13. &#1492;&#1514;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;  h&#305;&#770;t&#8219;u&#770; is plural in punctuation, agreeing grammatically with &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501;  'e&#774;loh&#305;&#770;ym. &#1493;(w), however, may be regarded as the third radical, and the verb may thus really be singular.<p>16. &#1504;&#1499;&#1492;&#1514;  nokachat an unusual form, either for &#1504;&#1499;&#1495;&#1514;  nokah&#803;at the second person singular feminine perfect or &#1504;&#1499;&#1495;&#1492;  nokeh&#803;a&#770;h the third person singular feminine perfect, from a verb signifying in hiphil, "make straight, right."<p>17. &#1488;&#1502;&#1492;  'a&#772;ma&#770;h "hand-maid," free or bond. &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1495;&#1492;  sh&#305;&#770;pcha&#770;h "bond-maid" <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-41.htm">1 Samuel 25:41</a>.<p>The concealment of his relation to Sarah calls to our mind a similar act of Abraham recorded not many pages back. We are to remember, however, that an interval of twenty-four years has elapsed since that event. From the present passage we learn that this was an old agreement between him and his wife, while they were wandering among strangers. It appears that Abraham was not yet conscious of anything wrong or even imprudent in this piece of policy. He therefore practises it without any hesitation. On this occasion he appears for the first time as a prophet. He is the first of this order introduced to our notice in the Old Testament, though Henok had prophesied at an earlier period Jde 1:14, and Noah's benediction was, at the same time, a prediction.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/genesis/19.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>29. when God destroyed the cities, &c.&#8212;This is most welcome and instructive after so painful a narrative. It shows if God is a "consuming fire" to the wicked [De 4:24; Heb 12:29], He is the friend of the righteous. He "remembered" the intercessions of Abraham, and what confidence should not this give us that He will remember the intercessions of a greater than Abraham in our behalf.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/genesis/19.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Called his name Ben-ammi, </span> i.e. <span class="ital">the son of my people, </span> or kindred, not of the cursed race of the Sodomites, where I was to be married.

That is, "the son of my people", being the son of her father; which though it does not so manifestly appear in this name, as in the other, yet there is some trace of it; and she would have it be known by this, that he was not the son of a stranger, but of a relation of her own: some attribute this to her being more modest than her elder sister; but it looks as if neither of them were sensible of any crime they had been guilty of, but rather thought it a commendable action, at least that it was excusable: <p>the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day; a people that lived near their brethren the Moabites, and were both enemies to the people of God; they quickly falling into idolatry, and whose names we often meet with in the sacred writings; and of these two sons, Josephus says (x), the one begat the Moabites, being still a great nation, and the other the Ammonites, and both inhabit Coelesyria; they are both called the children of Lot, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/83-8.htm">Psalm 83:8</a>. After this we hear no more of Lot in this history; and it is remarkable, that there never was, as we know of, any town or city that had in it any, trace of his name; but we are not from hence to conclude that he was a wicked man, whose memory perished with him; for mention is made of him in the New Testament, where he has a very honourable character, and is called "just Lot", <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-7.htm">2 Peter 2:7</a>. <p>(x) Antiqu. l. 1. c. 11. sect. 5. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/genesis/19.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name <span class="cverse3">{t}</span> Benammi: the same <i>is</i> the father of the children of Ammon unto this day.</span><p>(t) That is, son of my people: signifying that they rejoiced in their sin, rather than repenting of it.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/genesis/19.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">38</span>. <span class="ital">Ben-ammi</span>] “The son of my people”; or “the son of my father’s kin”; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-14.htm" title="And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he has broken my covenant.">Genesis 17:14</a>. “Unto this day,” cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/26-33.htm" title="And he called it Shebah: therefore the name of the city is Beersheba to this day.">Genesis 26:33</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-32.htm" title="Therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew which shrank, which is on the hollow of the thigh, to this day: because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew that shrank.">Genesis 32:32</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-20.htm" title="And Jacob set a pillar on her grave: that is the pillar of Rachel's grave to this day.">Genesis 35:20</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/47-26.htm" title="And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt to this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth part, except the land of the priests only, which became not Pharaoh's.">Genesis 47:26</a> (J).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>There is no need for us to regard this repulsive story as literal history. It should be included among the popular narratives which grew up round the traditional origin of proper names. It has been held that the tradition may have had a local Moabite origin connected with some famous cavern, and that the people of Moab and Ammon may have had an old belief that their races arose in prehistoric times from the same ancestor, in accordance with this tale. Undoubtedly, there were ancient Eastern peoples to whom the incest here described would have seemed in no way atrocious.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is, of course, also possible, that the story, as we have it in Gen., reflects the feelings of bitterness and hatred which were felt among the Israelites towards their neighbours on the east side of the Jordan. The antipathy expressed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-3.htm" title="An Ammonite or Moabite shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD; even to their tenth generation shall they not enter into the congregation of the LORD for ever:">Deuteronomy 23:3</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/nehemiah/13-1.htm" title="On that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of the people; and therein was found written, that the Ammonite and the Moabite should not come into the congregation of God for ever;...">Nehemiah 13:1-2</a> may well account for the circulation of traditions concerning the parentage of these two peoples, combining a popular explanation of their names with contumely and reproach as to their origin.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Again, it is conceivable that this story may contain a fragment of a tradition, Moabite and Ammonite in its derivation, which recorded some stupendous catastrophe, from which, through the favour of the Deity, only Lot and his daughters, out of all the inhabitants of the world, were saved. The story may then have been regarded as reflecting not ignominy, but honour, upon those who were the means of preserving the whole human race from the peril of extinction. There is plausibility in this theory of Gunkel’s. The words of the elder daughter, “there is not a man,” seem to imply that all the inhabitants of the earth had been annihilated. Our ignorance of Moabite early traditions forbids us to go further than to admit the possibility of some such explanation.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 38.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Ben-ammi.</span> <span class="accented">I.e.</span> son of my people (LXX., Jerome, Augustine), meaning that her child was the offspring of her own kind and blood (Rosenm&uuml;ller), or the son of her relative (Kalisch), or of an unmixed race ('Speaker's Commentary'). <span class="cmt_word">The same is the father of the children of Ammon</span> - an unsettled people who occupied the territory between the Yabbok and the Arnon, from which they had ejected the Rephaims or Zamzummims (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-22.htm">Deuteronomy 2:22</a>), and in which they possessed a strong city, Rabbah (2 Samuel 40:1); in their habits more migratory and marauding than the Moabites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/15.htm">Isaiah 15, 16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48.htm">Jeremiah 48</a>.), and in their religion worshippers of Molech, "the abomination of the Ammonites" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-7.htm">1 Kings 11:7</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">unto this day.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/genesis/19.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>From Zoar Lot removed with his two daughters to the (Moabitish) mountains, for fear that Zoar might after all be destroyed, and dwelt in one of the caves (&#1502;&#1506;&#1512;&#1492; with the generic article), in which the limestone rocks abound (vid., Lynch), and so became a dweller in a cave. While there, his daughters resolved to procure children through their father; and to that end on two successive evenings they made him intoxicated with wine, and then lay with him in the might, one after the other, that they might conceive seed. To this accursed crime they were impelled by the desire to preserve their family, because they thought there was no man on the earth to come in unto them, i.e., to marry them, "after the manner of all the earth." Not that they imagined the whole human race to have perished in the destruction of the valley of Siddim, but because they were afraid that no man would link himself with them, the only survivors of a country smitten by the curse of God. If it was not lust, therefore, which impelled them to this shameful deed, their conduct was worthy of Sodom, and shows quite as much as their previous betrothal to men of Sodom, that they were deeply imbued with the sinful character of that city. The words of <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-33.htm">Genesis 19:33</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/19-35.htm">Genesis 19:35</a>, "And he knew not of her lying down and of her rising up," do not affirm that he was in an unconscious state, as the Rabbins are said by Jerome to have indicated by the point over &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492;: "quasi incredibile et quod natura rerum non capiat, coire quempiam nescientem." They merely mean, that in his intoxicated state, though not entirely unconscious, yet he lay with his daughters without clearly knowing what he was doing.</body></html>
