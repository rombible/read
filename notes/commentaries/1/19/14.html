All the people of Sodom were very wicked and vile. Care was therefore taken for saving Lot and his family. Lot lingered; he trifled. Thus many who are under convictions about their spiritual state, and the necessity of a change, defer that needful work. The salvation of the most righteous men is of God's mercy, not by their own merit. We are saved by grace. God's power also must be acknowledged in bringing souls out of a sinful state If God had not been merciful to us, our lingering had been our ruin. Lot must flee for his life. He must not hanker after Sodom. Such commands as these are given to those who, through grace, are delivered out of a sinful state and condition. Return not to sin and Satan. Rest not in self and the world. Reach toward Christ and heaven, for that is escaping to the mountain, short of which we must not stop. Concerning this destruction, observe that it is a revelation of the wrath of God against sin and sinners of all ages. Let us learn from hence the evil of sin, and its hurtful nature; it leads to ruin.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/genesis/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The visitors now take steps for the deliverance of Lot and his kindred before the destruction of the cities. All that are related to him are included in the offer of deliverance. There is a blessing in being connected with the righteous, if men will but avail themselves of it. Lot seems bewildered by the contemptuous refusal of his connections to leave the place. His early choice and his growing habits have attached him to the place, notwithstanding its temptations. His married daughters, or at least the intended husbands of the two who were at home ("who are here"), are to be left behind. But though these thoughts make him linger, the mercy of the Lord prevails. The angels use a little violence to hasten their escape. The mountain was preserved by its elevation from the flood of rain, sulphur, and fire which descended on the low ground on which the cities were built. Lot begs for a small town to which he may retreat, as he shrinks from the perils of a mountain dwelling, and his request is mercifully granted.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/genesis/19.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12, 13. Hast thou here any besides? &#8230; we will destroy this place&#8212;Apostolic authority has declared Lot was "a righteous man" (2Pe 2:8), at bottom good, though he contented himself with lamenting the sins that he saw, instead of acting on his own convictions, and withdrawing himself and family from such a sink of corruption. But favor was shown him: and even his bad relatives had, for his sake, an offer of deliverance, which was ridiculed and spurned (2Pe 3:4).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/genesis/19.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Which married his daughters; </span> Heb. <span class="ital">took, </span> or were <span class="ital">taking, </span> or about to take, to wit, either to espouse, or to marry.

From his house, after the men of Sodom were gone from it, and before the morning, very probably about midnight: <p>and spake unto his sons in law, which married his daughters: according to Aben Ezra, he had two other daughters that perished in Sodom, which he gathers from <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/19-15.htm">Genesis 19:15</a>, "which are here", as if he had some elsewhere; and so Jarchi says, he had two daughters married in the city. And the Jewish writers (q) speak of one of them, whose name was Pelothith, married to one of the grandees of Sodom: but it seems rather, that these were the daughters Lot had at home with him; who, according to Josephus (r) were espoused to men in the city, but not yet married; and on account of such espousals, as were usual in the eastern countries, Lot calls them his sons-in-law, as they were intended, and so the words may be rendered, "that were about to take his daughters" (s); to take them for wives, and to their own houses, neither of which they had as yet done; for if these had been daughters of his married, and taken home, he would not only have spoke unto their husbands, but to them also; and would have been still more pressing upon them to arise and make their escape; of which nothing is said, nor of any answer of theirs to him, only of his sons-in-law, as they are called on the above account: <p>and said, up, get ye out of this place; that is, get up from your beds, anne immediately, and make your escape out of the city: <p>for the Lord will destroy this city; now, directly, immediately; therefore there is no time to be lost, but at once prepare for your safety: <p>but he seemed as one that mocked to his sons in law; as one that was in jest, and had a mind to have a little sport with them, to get them out of their beds, and put them into a flight, and then laugh at them. <p>(q) Pirke Eliezer, c. 25.

"Only to these men (&#1492;&#1488;&#1500;, an archaism for &#1492;&#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; rof, occurs also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-25.htm">Genesis 19:25</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/26-3.htm">Genesis 26:3-4</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-27.htm">Leviticus 18:27</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-42.htm">Deuteronomy 4:42</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-22.htm">Deuteronomy 7:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-11.htm">Deuteronomy 19:11</a>; and &#1488;&#1500; for &#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/20-8.htm">1 Chronicles 20:8</a>) do nothing, for therefore (viz., to be protected from injury) have they come under the shadow of my roof." In his anxiety, Lot was willing to sacrifice to the sanctity of hospitality his duty as a father, which ought to have been still more sacred, "and committed the sin of seeking to avert sin by sin." Even if he expected that his daughters would suffer no harm, as they were betrothed to Sodomites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-14.htm">Genesis 19:14</a>), the offer was a grievous violation of his paternal duty. But this offer only heightened the brutality of the mob. "Stand back" (make way, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-20.htm">Isaiah 49:20</a>), they said; "the man, who came as a foreigner, is always wanting to play the judge" (probably because Lot had frequently reproved them for their licentious conduct, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-7.htm">2 Peter 2:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-8.htm">2 Peter 2:8</a>): "not will we deal worse with thee than with them." With these words they pressed upon him, and approached the door to break it in. The men inside, that is to say, the angels, then pulled Lot into the house, shut the door, and by miraculous power smote the people without with blindness (&#1505;&#1504;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; here and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-18.htm">2 Kings 6:18</a> for mental blindness, in which the eye sees, but does not see the right object), as a punishment for their utter moral blindness, and an omen of the coming judgment. </body></html>
