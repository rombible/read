In the life of Joseph they form the turning point in his history, and it is to be noticed that while revelations were frequently made to Jacob, we have henceforward no record of any such direct communication from God to man until the time of Moses. The utmost granted to Joseph was to dream dreams; and after this the children of Israel in Egypt were left entirely to natural laws and influences. (Comp. Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/26-2.htm" title="And the LORD appeared to him, and said, Go not down into Egypt; dwell in the land which I shall tell you of:">Genesis 26:2</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/genesis/37.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/37-5.htm" title="And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it his brothers: and they hated him yet the more.">Genesis 37:5</a></span>. <span class="ital">Joseph dreamed a dream — </span>Which it is probable he did not understand at first, and therefore, in great simplicity, told it to his brethren; for, had he understood it, he certainly would not have mentioned it to them, for he could not but know they were likely to make an evil construction and use of it. But God’s special providence was seen both in giving him these dreams, and in causing him to reveal them, because hereby it was made manifest, when the things which they signified came to pass, that these events had not happened by chance, but were of God’s ordering. It must be observed, that though Joseph was so young, as is here stated, yet his piety and devotion were such, that he was fitted thereby for God’s gracious discoveries to him: and as he had a great deal of trouble before him, God, in his great goodness, was pleased betimes to give him this prospect of his advancement, to support and comfort him.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/37.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>37:5-11 God gave Joseph betimes the prospect of his advancement, to support and comfort him under his long and grievous troubles. Observe, Joseph dreamed of his preferment, but he did not dream of his imprisonment. Thus many young people, when setting out in the world, think of nothing but prosperity and pleasure, and never dream of trouble. His brethren rightly interpreted the dream, though they abhorred the interpretation of it. While they committed crimes in order to defeat it, they were themselves the instruments of accomplishing it. Thus the Jews understood what Christ said of his kingdom. Determined that he should not reign over them, they consulted to put him to death; and by his crucifixion, made way for the exaltation they designed to prevent.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/genesis/37.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Joseph's dreams excite the jealousy of his brothers. His frankness in reciting his dream to his brothers marks a spirit devoid of guile, and only dimly conscious of the import of his nightly visions. The first dream represents by a figure the humble submission of all his brothers to him, as they rightly interpret it. "For his dreams and for his words." The meaning of this dream was offensive enough, and his telling of it rendered it even more disagreeable. A second dream is given to express the certainty of the event <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-32.htm">Genesis 41:32</a>. The former serves to interpret the latter. There the sheaves are connected with the brothers who bound them, and thereby indicate the parties. The eleven stars are not so connected with them. But here Joseph is introduced directly without a figure, and the number eleven, taken along with the eleven sheaves of the former dream, makes the application to the brothers plain. The sun and moon clearly point out the father and mother. The mother is to be taken, we conceive, in the abstract, without nicely inquiring whether it means the departed Rachel, or the probably still living Leah. Not even the latter seems to have lived to see the fulfillment of this prophetic dream <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-31.htm">Genesis 49:31</a>. The second dream only aggravated the hatred of his brothers; but his father, while rebuking him for his speeches, yet marked the saying. The rebuke seems to imply that the dream, or the telling of it, appears to his father to indicate the lurking of a self-sufficient or ambitious spirit within the breast of the youthful Joseph. The twofold intimation, however, came from a higher source.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/genesis/37.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Ge 37:5-36. The Dreams of Joseph.<p>5. Joseph dreamed a dream&#8212;Dreams in ancient times were much attended to, and hence the dream of Joseph, though but a mere boy, engaged the serious consideration of his family. But this dream was evidently symbolical. The meaning was easily discerned, and, from its being repeated under different emblems, the fulfilment was considered certain (compare Ge 41:32), whence it was that "his brethren envied him, but his father observed the saying" [Ge 37:11].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/genesis/37.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">dream</span> it is probable he did not understand, for then he would never have told it to them, who, as he knew very well, were likely to make an evil construction and use of it. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/genesis/37.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it his brethren,....

Dreams were regarded by the Oriental as intimations from another world, and were invested with the sanctity of a divine oracle. The dream and its significance entered deeply into the religious conceptions of the ancient races.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/37.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Joseph dreamed a dream</span> (in which, though, as the sequel shows, intended as a Divine communication, there was nothing to distinguish it from an ordinary product of the mind), <span class="cmt_word">and he told it to his brethren</span>: - not in pride, since there is no reason to suppose that Joseph as yet understood the celestial origin of his dream but in the simplicity of his heart (Kalisch, Murphy), though in doing so he was also guided, unconsciously it may be, but still really, by an overruling providence, who made use of this very telling of the dream as a step towards its fulfillment (Lawson) - <span class="cmt_word">and they hated him yet the more</span> - literally, and <span class="accented">they added again to hate him</span>. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/genesis/36.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(Parallel, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/1-51.htm">1 Chronicles 1:51-54</a>). Seats of the Tribe-Princes of Esau According to Their Families. - That the names which follow are not a second list of Edomitish tribe-princes (viz., of those who continued the ancient constitution, with its hereditary aristocracy, after Hadar's death), but merely relate to the capital cities of the old phylarchs, is evident from the expression in the heading, "After their places, by their names," as compared with <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/36-43.htm">Genesis 36:43</a>, "According to their habitations in the land of their possession." This being the substance and intention of the list, there is nothing surprising in the fact, that out of the eleven names only two correspond to those given in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/36-15.htm">Genesis 36:15-19</a>. This proves nothing more than that only two of the capitals received their names from the princes who captured or founded them, viz., Timnah and Kenaz. Neither of these has been discovered yet. The name Aholibamah is derived from the Horite princess (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/36-25.htm">Genesis 36:25</a>); its site is unknown. Elah is the port Aila (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-6.htm">Genesis 14:6</a>). Pinon is the same as Phunon, an encampment of the Israelites (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/33-42.htm">Numbers 33:42-43</a>), celebrated for its mines, in which many Christians were condemned to labour under Diocletian, between Petra and Zoar, to the northeast of Wady Musa. Teman is the capital of the land of the Temanites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/36-34.htm">Genesis 36:34</a>). Mibzar is supposed by Knobel to be Petra; but this is called Selah elsewhere (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-7.htm">2 Kings 14:7</a>). Magdiel and Iram cannot be identified. The concluding sentence, "This is Esau, the father (founder) of Edom" (i.e., from his sprang the great nation of the Edomites, with its princes and kings, upon the mountains of Seir), not only terminates this section, but prepared the way for the history of Jacob, which commences with the following chapter. </body></html>
