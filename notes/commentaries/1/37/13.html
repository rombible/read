Those children who are best beloved by their parents, should be the most ready to obey them. See how deliberate Joseph's brethren were against him. They thought to slay him from malice aforethought, and in cold blood. Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer, 1Jo 3:15. The sons of Jacob hated their brother because their father loved him. New occasions, as his dreams and the like, drew them on further; but this laid rankling in their hearts, till they resolved on his death. God has all hearts in his hands. Reuben had most reason to be jealous of Joseph, for he was the first-born; yet he proves his best friend. God overruled all to serve his own purpose, of making Joseph an instrument to save much people alive. Joseph was a type of Christ; for though he was the beloved Son of his Father, and hated by a wicked world, yet the Father sent him out of his bosom to visit us in great humility and love. He came from heaven to earth to seek and save us; yet then malicious plots were laid against him. His own not only received him not, but crucified him. This he submitted to, as a part of his design to redeem and save us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/genesis/37.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Joseph is sent to Dothan.

These dreams pointed in an unmistakeable way to the supremacy of Joseph; the first to supremacy over his brethren, the second over the whole house of Israel. The repetition seemed to establish the thing as certain (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-32.htm">Genesis 41:32</a>); so that not only did his brethren hate him still more "on account of his dreams and words" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/37-8.htm">Genesis 37:8</a>), i.e., the substance of the dreams and the open interpretation of them, and become jealous and envious, but his father gave him a sharp reproof for the second, though he preserved the matter, i.e., retained it in his memory (&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512; lxx &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;, cf. &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-19.htm">Luke 2:19</a>). The brothers with their ill-will could not see anything in the creams but the suggestions of his own ambition and pride of heart; and even the father, notwithstanding his partiality, was grieved by the second dream. The dreams are not represented as divine revelations; yet they are not to be regarded as pure flights of fancy from an ambitious heart, but as the presentiments of deep inward feelings, which were not produced without some divine influence being exerted upon Joseph's mind, and therefore were of prophetic significance, though they were not inspired directly by God, inasmuch as the purposes of God were still to remain hidden from the eyes of men for the saving good of all concerned. </body></html>
