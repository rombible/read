One was a little to the west of Bethlehem, the other upon the Philistine border, beyond Bethshemesh. As it lay, however, only about seven miles beyond Adullam, and as the flocks there were Judah’s private property (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/38-13.htm" title="And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold your father in law goes up to Timnath to shear his sheep.">Genesis 38:13</a>), and under the charge of Hirah, this remoter place, now called Tibneh, is probably the Timnath meant, as at Bethlehem the pastures were occupied by his father. (See also <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/38-14.htm" title="And she put her widow's garments off from her, and covered her with a veil, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place, which is by the way to Timnath; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not given to him to wife.">Genesis 38:14</a>.) For the sheep-shearing, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-19.htm" title="And Laban went to shear his sheep: and Rachel had stolen the images that were her father's.">Genesis 31:19</a>. Instead of “his friend Hirah,” the LXX. and Vulg. render <span class= "ital">his shepherd Hirah. </span>This would require no change in the consonants, but only in the vowels. Most of the other authorities agree with the Authorised Version; but even so, there was most probably some partnership between Judah and Hirah in these flocks, and they would be under Hirah’s charge whenever Judah was absent, tending the flocks of his father.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/38.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>38:1-30 The profligate conduct of Judah and his family. - This chapter gives an account of Judah and his family, and such an account it is, that it seems a wonder that of all Jacob's sons, our Lord should spring out of Judah, Heb 7:14. But God will show that his choice is of grace and not of merit, and that Christ came into the world to save sinners, even the chief. Also, that the worthiness of Christ is of himself, and not from his ancestors. How little reason had the Jews, who were so called from this Judah, to boast as they did, Joh 8:41. What awful examples the Lord proclaims in his punishments, of his utter displeasure at sin! Let us seek grace from God to avoid every appearance of sin. And let that state of humbleness to which Jesus submitted, when he came to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself, in appointing such characters as those here recorded, to be his ancestors, endear the Redeemer to our hearts.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/genesis/38.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Judah now comes into criminal, and, though unknown to him, incestuous sexual intercourse with Tamar.

But Ger was soon put to death by Jehovah on account of his wickedness. Judah then wished Onan, as the brother-in-law, to marry the childless widow of his deceased brother, and raise up seed, i.e., a family, for him. But as he knew that the first-born son would not be the founder of his own family, but would perpetuate the family of the deceased and receive his inheritance, he prevented conception when consummating the marriage by spilling the semen. &#1488;&#1512;&#1510;&#1492; &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1514;, "destroyed to the ground (i.e., let it fall upon the ground), so as not to give seed to his brother" (&#1504;&#1514;&#1503; for &#1514;&#1468;&#1514; only here and <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-21.htm">Numbers 20:21</a>). This act not only betrayed a want of affection to his brother, combined with a despicable covetousness for his possession and inheritance, but was also a sin against the divine institution of marriage and its object, and was therefore punished by Jehovah with sudden death. The custom of levirate marriage, which is first mentioned here, and is found in different forms among Indians, Persians, and other nations of Asia and Africa, was not founded upon a divine command, but upon an ancient tradition, originating probably in Chaldea. It was not abolished, however, by the Mosaic law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/25-5.htm">Deuteronomy 25:5</a>.), but only so far restricted as not to allow it to interfere with the sanctity of marriage; and with this limitation it was enjoined as a duty of affection to build up the brother's house, and to preserve his family and name (see my Bibl. Archologie, 108).</body></html>
