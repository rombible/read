Although this chapter may appear to some unprofitable, it is indeed of great use. 1st, It gives us a true, and the only true account of the origin of the several nations of the world. 2d, It discovers and distinguishes from all other nations, the people in which God’s church was to be preserved, and from which Christ was to come. 3d, It explains and confirms Noah’s prophecy concerning his three sons, and makes the accomplishment of it evident. 4th, It enables us to understand many other parts of Scripture, as well prophetical and poetical, as historical and doctrinal. It is therefore well worth our attention. <span class="ital">These are the sons of Noah, Shem, </span>&c. — Although Shem is always named first, when the sons of Noah are enumerated, because he was the progenitor of Abraham and of Christ, and because the church of God was continued in his line, yet it is generally thought he was the youngest of the three, and that Japheth, though always mentioned last, was the eldest.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/10.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>10:1-7 This chapter shows concerning the three sons of Noah, that of them was the whole earth overspread. No nation but that of the Jews can be sure from which of these seventy it has come. The lists of names of fathers and sons were preserved of the Jews alone, for the sake of the Messiah. Many learned men, however, have, with some probability, shown which of the nations of the earth descended from each of the sons of Noah To the posterity of Japheth were allotted the isles of the gentiles; probably, the island of Britain among the rest. All places beyond the sea from Judea are called isles, Jer 25:22. That promise, Isa 42:4, The isles shall wait for his law, speaks of the conversion of the gentiles to the faith of Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/genesis/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div> - Section VIII - The Nations<p> - Japheth<p>2. &#1490;&#1502;&#1512;  gomer, "Gomer, completion; related: complete;" &#x39a;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;  Kimmerioi. &#1502;&#1490;&#1493;&#1490;  ma&#772;go&#770;g, "Magog, Caucasian, Skyth." &#1502;&#1491;&#1497;  ma&#772;day, "Madai, middle: Mede." &#1497;&#1493;&#1503;  ya&#772;va&#772;n, "Javan"; &#x399;&#787;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;  Iao&#772;n; "Sanskrit, Javana; Old Persian, Juna." &#1514;&#1489;&#1500;  tuba&#772;l, "Tubal"; &#x3a4;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#768;  Tibareenoi. &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498;  meshek, "Meshek, drawing possession, valor"; &#x39c;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;  Moschoi, &#1514;&#1497;&#1512;&#1505;  t&#305;&#770;yra&#772;s, "Tiras;" &#x398;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#837;&#834;&#x3be;  Thrax.<p>3. &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1504;&#1493;  'ashkenaz, "Ashkenaz," &#x391;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  Askanios. &#1512;&#1497;&#1508;&#1514;  r&#305;&#770;ypat, "Riphath," &#x3bf;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b7; &#x3a1;&#788;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;  oree Ripaia, &#1514;&#1490;&#1512;&#1502;&#1492;  togarma&#770;h "Togarmah, Thorgom, ancestor of the Armenians."<p>4. &#1488;&#1500;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;  'el&#305;&#770;ysha&#770;h, "Elishah;"  &#x397;&#788;&#834;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;  Eelis, &#x395;&#788;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3c2;  Hellas, &#x391;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2;  Aioleis. &#1514;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;  tarsh&#305;&#770;ysh, "Tarshish, breaking, fastness: Tartessus, Tarsus, Tyrseni." &#1499;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501;  k&#305;&#770;t&#305;&#770;ym, "Kittim, smiters; Citienses;" &#x39a;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;  Kares; &#1491;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;  doda&#772;n&#305;&#770;ym, "Dodanim, Dodona, Dardani."<p>5. &#1488;&#1497;  '&#305;&#770;y, "meadow, land reached by water, island; related: be marked off or bounded (by a water line)." &#1490;&#1493;&#1497;  go&#770;y, "nation; related: be born;" &#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;  gegaasi.<p>The fifth document relates to the generations of the sons of Noah. It presents first a genealogy of the nations, and then an account of the distribution of mankind into nations, and their dispersion over the earth. This is the last section which treats historically of the whole human race. Only in incidental, didactic, or prophetic passages do we again meet with mankind as a whole in the Old Testament.<p>The present chapter signalizes a new step in the development of the human race. They pass from the one family to the seventy nations. This great process covers the space of time from Noah to Abraham. During this period the race was rapidly increasing under the covenant made with Noah. From Shem to Abraham were ten generations inclusive; and, therefore, if we suppose the same rate of increase after as we have supposed before, there would be about fifteen million inhabitants when Abraham was thirty years of age. If, however, we take eight as the average of a family, and suppose eleven generations after Shem at the one hundredth year of Abraham's life, we have about thirty million people on the earth. The average of the three sons of Noah is higher than this; for they had sixteen sons, and we may suppose as many daughters, making in all thirty-two, and, therefore, giving ten children to each household. The present chapter does not touch on the religious aspect of human affairs: it merely presents a table of the primary nations, from which all subsequent nationalities have been derived.<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/10-1.htm">Genesis 10:1-2</a><p>The sons of Japheth. - Japheth is placed first, because he was, most probably, the oldest brother <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-24.htm">Genesis 9:24</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/10-21.htm">Genesis 10:21</a>, and his descendants were the most numerous and most widely spread from the birthplace of mankind. The general description of their territory is "the isles of the nations." These were evidently maritime countries, or such as were reached by sea. These coastlands were pre-eminently, but not exclusively, the countries bordering on the north side of the Mediterranean and its connected waters. They are said to belong to the nations, because the national form of association was more early and fully developed among them than among the other branches of the race. There is, probably, a relic of Japheth in the, &#x399;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2;  Iapetos, Japetus of the Greeks, said to be the son of Uranus (heaven), and Gaea (earth), and father of Prometheus, and thus in some way connected with the origin or preservation of the human race.<p>Fourteen of the primitive nations spring from Japheth. Seven of these are of immediate descent.<p>(1) Gomer is mentioned again, in Ezekiel E<a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/38-6.htm">Zechariah 38:6</a>, as the ally of Gog, by which the known existence of the nation at that period is indicated. Traces of this name are perhaps found in the &#x39a;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;  Kimmerioi, (Homer, Odyssey <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-14.htm">Ezekiel 11:14</a>; Herodotus <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-15.htm">Ezekiel 1:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-12.htm">Ezekiel 4:12</a>), who lay in the dark north, in the Krimea, the Kimbri who dwelt in north Germany, the Kymry, Cambri, and Cumbri who occupied Britain. These all belong to the race now called Keltic, the first wave of population that reached the Atlantic. Thus, the &#x393;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2;  Gomareis, of Josephus (Ant. 1:6.1) may even be identified with the Galatae. This nation seems to have lain to the north of the Euxine, and to have spread out along the southern coasts of the Baltic into France, Spain, and the British Isles.<p>(2) Magog is mentioned, by Ezekiel E<a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/38-6.htm">Zechariah 38:6</a>, as the people of which Gog was the prince. It is introduced in the Apocalypse Rev 20:8, as a designation of the remote nations who had penetrated to the ends or corners of the earth. This indicates a continually progressing people, occupying the north of Europe and Asia, and crossing, it may be, over into America. They seem to have been settled north of the Caspian, and to have wandered north and east from that point. They are accordingly identified by Josephus (Ant. 1:6.1) with the Skyths, and include the Mongols among other Skythic tribes.<p>(3) Madai has given name to the Medes, who occupied the southern shore of the Caspian. From this region they penetrated southward to Hindostan.<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/genesis/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 10<p>Ge 10:1-32.

And consider these three things. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. In the search of these genealogies we must avoid both carelessness, for the reasons now mentioned, and excessive curiosity about every particular person here named, and the people sprung from him; which is neither necessary nor profitable, nor indeed possible now to find out, by reason of the great changes of names, through length of time, loss of ancient records, differences of languages, extinction of families, conquest and destruction of nations, and other causes. It may suffice that divers of them, and those the most eminent, are evident and discernible at this day, as will appear in the progress, by which we may and ought to presume the truth of the rest, whose names are lost in the public confusions of the world in former ages, of whom I shall therefore be silent, and only speak of the principal persons, and that briefly. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. The same people which were originally seated in one place did ofttimes shift their places, or at least sent forth colonies; and that sometimes into places far distant from their brethren, as appears from the ancient and famous expeditions mentioned in sacred and profane story. So you must not wonder if you meet with the same people in divers countries. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. In general, the world was divided into three parts, whereof the more eastern parts were allotted to Shem and his issue, the more southern parts to Ham, and the more northern parts of it to Japheth. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/genesis/10.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah,....

In <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-2.htm">Genesis 10:2</a> seven sons of Japhet are given. The names, indeed, afterwards occur as those of tribes; but here undoubtedly they are intended to denote the tribe-fathers, and may without hesitation be so regarded. For even if in later times many nations received their names from the lands of which they took possession, this cannot be regarded as a universal rule, since unquestionably the natural rule in the derivation of the names would be for the tribe to be called after its ancestor, and for the countries to receive their names from their earliest inhabitants. Gomer is most probably the tribe of the Cimmerians, who dwelt, according to Herodotus, on the Maeotis, in the Taurian Chersonesus, and from whom are descended the Cumri or Cymry in Wales and Brittany, whose relation to the Germanic Cimbri is still in obscurity. Magog is connected by Josephus with the Scythians on the Sea of Asof and in the Caucasus; but Kiepert associates the name with Macija or Maka, and applies it to Scythian nomad tribes which forced themselves in between the Arian or Arianized Medes, Kurds, and Armenians. Madai are the Medes, called Mada on the arrow-headed inscriptions. Javan corresponds to the Greek &#x399;&#787;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;, from whom the Ionians (&#x399;&#787;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;) are derived, the parent tribe of the Greeks (in Sanskrit Javana, old Persian Juna&#770;). Tubal and Meshech are undoubtedly the Tibareni and Moschi, the former of whom are placed by Herodotus upon the east of the Thermodon, the latter between the sources of the Phasis and Cyrus. Tiras: according to Josephus, the Thracians, whom Herodotus calls the most numerous tribe next to the Indian. As they are here placed by the side of Meshech, so we also find on the old Egyptian monuments Mashuash and Tuirash, and upon the Assyrian Tubal and Misek (Rawlinson).</body></html>
