In designating Shem as “the father of all the children of Eber,” attention is called to the fact that the descendants of Peleg, his elder son, are omitted from this table, and reserved for the <span class= "ital">Tôldôth Shem. </span>(See <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/11-10.htm" title="These are the generations of Shem: Shem was an hundred years old, and begat Arphaxad two years after the flood:">Genesis 11:10</a>.)<p>The nations descended from Shem were:—<p><span class= "bld">1. Elam.</span>—According to Mr. Sayce (<span class= "ital">Chald. Gen., </span>p. 196), “the primitive inhabitants of Elam were a race closely allied to the Accadians, and spread over the whole range of country which stretched from the southern shores of the Caspian to the Persian Gulf.” But just as the Semitic Asshur expelled a Hamite race from Assyria, so another branch of this conquering family occupied Elymais. It is now called Chuzistan, and was the most easternly of the countries occupied by the Semites. But see Excursus to Genesis 14 on the conquests of the Elamite Chedorlaomer.<p><span class= "bld">2. Asshur.</span>—This Semitic stock seems to have been the first to settle on the Tigris, as the Hamites were the first to settle on the Euphrates. Finally, as we have seen (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-11.htm" title="Out of that land went forth Asshur, and built Nineveh, and the city Rehoboth, and Calah,">Genesis 10:11</a>), they conquered the whole country.<p><span class= "bld">3. Arphaxad.</span>—Heb., <span class= "ital">Arpachshad. </span>We may dismiss the idea that he was connected with the region called Arrapachitis, for this correctly is Aryapakshata, “the land next the Aryans.” Really he appears as the ancestor of Eber and the Joktanite Arabs.<p><span class= "bld">4. Lud.</span>—Probably the Lydians, who, after various wanderings, settled in Asia Minor.<p><span class= "bld">5. Aram.</span>—As Asshur means <span class= "ital">plain, </span>so Aram means <span class= "ital">highland. </span>It was originally the name of the Lebanon ranges, and thus Damascus is called Aram in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-5.htm" title="And when the Syrians of Damascus came to succor Hadadezer king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.">2Samuel 8:5</a>. Subsequently the race so extended itself as to possess Mesopotamia, a lowland country, but called, as early as <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-10.htm" title="And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master, and departed; for all the goods of his master were in his hand: and he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, to the city of Nahor.">Genesis 24:10</a>, “Aram of the two rivers.” The greatness of Aram will be best seen by examining those places in our version where <span class= "ital">Syria and Syrian </span>are spoken of, and which, in the Hebrew, are really Aram.<p>To the Aramæan stock belonged also four outlying dependencies—(1) Uz, the land of Job, a district in the northern part of Arabia Deserta; (2) Hul and (3) Gether, regions of which nothing is known; and (4) Mash, a desert region on the western side of the Euphrates (<span class= "ital">Chald.

Probably because Abraham and his seed, from Eber, were called Hebrews. Eber himself, we may suppose, was a man eminent for religion in a time of general apostacy; and the holy tongue being commonly called from him the Hebrew, was retained in his family in the confusion of Babel, as a special token of God’s favour to him. 2d, He is styled <span class="ital">the brother of Japheth, </span>perhaps to signify the union of the Gentiles and Jews in the church.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/10.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>10:15-32 The posterity of Canaan were numerous, rich, and pleasantly seated; yet Canaan was under a Divine curse, and not a curse causeless. Those that are under the curse of God, may, perhaps, thrive and prosper in this world; for we cannot know love or hatred, the blessing or the curse, by what is before us, but by what is within us. The curse of God always works really, and always terribly. Perhaps it is a secret curse, a curse to the soul, and does not work so that others can see it; or a slow curse, and does not work soon; but sinners are reserved by it for a day of wrath Canaan here has a better land than either Shem or Japheth, and yet they have a better lot, for they inherit the blessing. Abram and his seed, God's covenant people, descended from Eber, and from him were called Hebrews. How much better it is to be like Eber, the father of a family of saints and honest men, than the father of a family of hunters after power, worldly wealth, or vanities.

He is "the father of all the sons of Heber." It is evident from this that the sons of Heber cast luster on the family of Shem, and therefore on the whole human race. It is unnecessary to anticipate the narrative, except so far as to note that the sons of Heber include most of the Arabians, a portion of those who mingled with the race and inhabited the land of Aram, and, most probably, the original element of the population in the land of Kenaan. This characteristic of Shem shows that the table in which it is found was composed after the Hebrews had become conspicuous among the descendants of Shem.<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/genesis/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21.

And for the sake of those Shem is particularly said to be the father of, is this genealogy given, and indeed the whole book of Genesis wrote: Eber was the great-grandson of Shem, and is here spoken of by anticipation, and Shem is called not the father of either of his immediate sons, but of the posterity of this man; because the Hebrews sprung from him in his line, among whom the church of God and the true religion were preserved, and from whom the Messiah was to come, as he did: the word Eber, Jarchi interprets, "beyond the river, Euphrates" or "Tigris", or both, as describing the seat of the posterity of Shem; but as this too much straitens them, since they inhabited on both sides, Dr. Hyde (d) has shown that the word used may refer to both, to those beyond these rivers, and to those on this side; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-24.htm">Numbers 24:24</a>. <p>the brother of Japheth the elder; he was the brother of Ham too, but he is not mentioned because of the behaviour towards his father, and because of the curse that was upon him and his; but Shem's relation to Japheth is expressed to show that they were alike in their disposition; and it may be to signify, that in times to come their posterity would unite in spiritual things, which has been fulfilled already in part, and will be more fully by the coalition of the Jews, the posterity of Shem, and of the Gentiles, the posterity of Japheth, in the Christian church state: and from hence we learn that Japheth was the eldest of Noah's sons, though some render the words, "the elder brother of Japheth" (e); and so make Shem to be the eldest; but as this is contrary to the accents, so to the history: for Noah was five hundred years old when he began to beget sons, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/5-32.htm">Genesis 5:32</a> he was six hundred when he went into the ark, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/7-11.htm">Genesis 7:11</a> two years after the flood Shem begat Arphaxad, when he was one hundred years old, and Noah six hundred and two, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/11-10.htm">Genesis 11:10</a> so that Shem must be born when Noah was five hundred and two years old; and since he begot children, there must be one two years older than Shem, which can be no other than Japheth, since Ham is called his younger son, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-24.htm">Genesis 9:24</a>. <p>even to him were children born, who are reckoned as follow. <p>(d) Hist.

The names “Eber” and “Hebrew” are almost identical in the Hebrew language. “Eber” was accepted as the ancestor of the Hebrew-speaking peoples. In the widest sense of the word, “Hebrews” are a group of Semitic peoples who issued from the Arabian Peninsula. They are included among the descendants of Joktan and Peleg, as well as of Terah. For the ordinary derivation of the word “Hebrew,” as = “the man from the further side” of the river, see <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-24.htm" title="And Arphaxad begat Salah; and Salah begat Eber.">Genesis 10:24</a></span> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-13.htm" title="And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for he dwelled in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these were confederate with Abram.">Genesis 14:13</a>. The term “Hebrew” is racial, “Israelite” national; though ultimately used as synonyms.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the elder brother of Japheth</span>] These words seem to be inserted, in order to remind the reader that Shem, though here mentioned last, was the eldest of Noah’s sons. The rendering of R.V. marg., <span class="ital">the brother of Japheth the elder</span>, is very improbable.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Unto Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber</span>, - as Ham of Canaan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-22.htm">Genesis 9:22</a>; <span class="accented">vide</span> ver. 24) - <span class="cmt_word">the brother of Japheth the elder.</span> Either the eldest brother of Japheth (Syriac, Arabic, Vulgate, Gesenius, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Kalisch); or the brother of Japheth who was older (LXX., Symmachus, Onkelos, Raschi, Aben Ezra, Luther, Clerieus, Michaelis, Dathe); or the elder of Japheth's brothers, as distinguished from Ham the younger, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the son who was older than Ham, But younger than Japheth (Murphy, Quarry; vide <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/5-32.htm">Genesis 5:32</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Even to him were children born.</span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/genesis/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Descendants of Shem. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-21.htm">Genesis 10:21</a>. For the construction, vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-26.htm">Genesis 4:26</a>. Shem is called the father of all the sons of Eber, because two tribes sprang from Eber through Peleg and Joktan, viz., the Abrahamides, and also the Arabian tribe of the Joktanides (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-26.htm">Genesis 4:26</a>.). - On the expression, "the brother of Japhet &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1493;&#1500;," see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-24.htm">Genesis 9:24</a>. The names of the five sons of Shem occur elsewhere as the names of the tribes and countries; at the same time, as there is no proof that in any single instance the name was transferred from the country to its earliest inhabitants, no well-grounded objection can be offered to the assumption, which the analogy of the other descendants of Shem renders probable, that they were originally the names of individuals. As the name of a people, Elam denotes the Elymaeans, who stretched from the Persian Gulf to the Caspian Sea, but who are first met with as Persians no longer speaking a Semitic language. Asshur: the Assyrians who settled in the country of Assyria, &#x391;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;, to the east of the Tigris, but who afterwards spread in the direction of Asia Minor.

The explanation given of the name, viz., "fortress of the Chaldeans" (Ewald), "highland of the Chaldeans" (Knobel), "territory of the Chaldeans" (Dietrich), are very questionable. Lud: the Lydians of Asia Minor, whose connection with the Assyrians is confirmed by the names of the ancestors of their kings. Aram: the ancestor of the Aramaeans of Syria and Mesopotamia. </body></html>
