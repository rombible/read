Japheth they connect with a word signifying <span class= "ital">to be fair; </span>and so Ham is the progenitor of dark races, Japheth of those of a fair complexion, while the olive- coloured spring from Shem. More probably it is <span class= "ital">Chemi, </span>the old name of Egypt, “the land of Ham” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-51.htm" title="And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of their strength in the tabernacles of Ham:">Psalm 78:51</a>), called by Plutarch Chemia, and was taken from the <span class= "ital">black </span>colour of the soil.<p>The Hamites are grouped in four principal divisions:—<p><span class= "bld">1. Cush. </span>Aethiopia, but not that of Africa, but of Asia. The home of the Cushites was on the Tigris and Euphrates, where Nimrod raised them to great power. Thence they spread into the southern peninsula of Arabia, and crossing the Red Sea at a later date, colonised Nubia and Abyssinia. In the Bible Cush is watered by the Gihon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-13.htm" title="And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that compasses the whole land of Ethiopia.">Genesis 2:13</a>); and Zipporah, the wife of Moses, and daughter of a priest of Midian, is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/12-1.htm" title="And Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Ethiopian woman whom he had married: for he had married an Ethiopian woman.">Numbers 12:1</a> called a Cushite. Their high rank in old time is marked by the place held by them in the <span class= "ital">Iliad </span>of Homer.<span class= "bld"><p>2. Mizraim. </span>Egypt. In form the word is a dual, and may point to the division of the country into Upper and Lower Egypt. If we choose to interpret a Hamite word by a Hebrew root, it may signify the <span class= "ital">narrowed land, </span>but it is safer to leave these words till increased knowledge shall enable us to decide with some security upon their meaning. For the ancient name of Mizraim see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-6.htm" title="And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan.">Genesis 10:6</a>, and for its extent see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-14.htm" title="And Pathrusim, and Casluhim, (out of whom came Philistim,) and Caphtorim.">Genesis 10:14</a>. From the study of the skulls and bodies of a large number of mummies Brugsch-Bey in his recent history has come to the conclusion that the ancient Egyptians did not belong to any African race, but to the great Caucasian family, “but not of the Pelasgic or Semitic branches, but of a third, Cushite.” He adds that the cradle of the Egyptian nation must be sought in Central Asia.<p><span class= "bld">3.

Next to the sons of Japheth, the sons of Ham are reckoned; these, Josephus (z) says, possessed the land from Syria, and the mountains of Amanus and Lebanon; laying hold on whatever was towards the sea, claiming to themselves the countries unto the ocean, whose names, some of them, are entirely lost, and others so greatly changed and deflected into other tongues, that they can scarcely be known, and few whose names are preserved entire; and the same observation will hold good of others. Four of the sons of Ham are mentioned: <p>Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan; the first of these, Cush, Josephus (a) says, has suffered no loss by time; for the Ethiopians, whose prince he was, are to this day by themselves, and all in Asia, called Chusaeans: but though this word Cush, as used in Scripture, is generally rendered by us Ethiopia, this must not be understood of Ethiopia in Africa, but in Arabia; and indeed is always to be understood of one part of Arabia, and which was near to the land of Judea; so Moses's wife is called an Ethiopian, when she was an Arabian, or of Midian, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/12-1.htm">Numbers 12:1</a> and Chusan and Midian are mentioned together, <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-7.htm">Habakkuk 3:7</a> see <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-9.htm">2 Kings 19:9</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/14-9.htm">2 Chronicles 14:9</a> and Bochart (b) has shown, by various arguments, that the land of Cush was Arabia; and so the Targum of Jonathan interprets it here Arabia. There was a city called Cutha in Erac, a province in the country of Babylon (c), where Nimrod the son of Cush settled, which probably was called so from his father's name. Here the eastern writers say (d) Abraham was born, and is the same place mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-24.htm">2 Kings 17:24</a>. The second son of Ham was Mizraim, the same with the Misor of Sanchoniatho (e), and the Menes of Herodotus (f), the first king of Egypt, and the builder of the city of Memphis in Egypt, called by the Turks to this day Mitzir (g). Mitzraim is a name by which Egypt is frequently called in Scripture, and this man was the father of the Egyptians; and because Egypt was inhabited by a son of Ham, it is sometimes called the land of Ham, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-23.htm">Psalm 105:23</a>. The word is of the dual number, and serves to express Egypt by, which was divided into two parts, lower and upper Egypt. Josephus says (h), we call Egypt, Mestres, and all the Egyptians that inhabit it, Mestraeans; so the country is called by Cedrenus (i), Mestre; and Kairo, a principal city in it, is to this day by the Arabians called Al-messer, as Dr. Shaw (k) relates. The third son of Ham is Phut; of whom Josephus (l) says, that he founded Libya, calling the inhabitants of it after his name, Phuteans; and observes, that there is a river in the country of the Moors of his name; and that many of the Greek historians, who make mention of this river, also make mention of a country adjacent to it, called Phute: mention is made of this river as in Mauritania, both by Pliny (m) and Ptolemy (n) and by the latter of a city called Putea: this Phut is the Apollo Pythius of the Heathens, as some think. The last son of Ham is Canaan, the father of the Canaanites, a people well known in Scripture. Concerning these sons of Ham, there is a famous fragment of Eupolemus preserved in Eusebius (o); and is this;"the Babylonians say, that the first was Belus, called Cronus or Saturn (that is, Noah), and of him was begotten another Belus and Chanaan (it should be read Cham), and he (i.e. Ham) begat Chanaan, the father of the Phoenicians; and of him another son, Chus, was begotten, whom the Greeks call Asbolos, the father of the Ethiopians, and the brother of Mestraim, the father of the Egyptians.'' <p>(z) Ut supra.

The Sons of Ham<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">6</span>. The races described as “the sons of Ham” are first traced in the most southerly regions. If the name has any connexion with <span class="ital">Kamt</span>, the native name of Egypt, it is noticeable that it is here applied to the parent stock of peoples, not only in Egypt, but also in South Arabia, Phoenicia, and Syria. “Ham” is used as a synonym for Egypt in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-51.htm" title="And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of their strength in the tabernacles of Ham:">Psalm 78:51</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-23.htm" title="Israel also came into Egypt; and Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.">Psalm 105:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-27.htm" title="They showed his signs among them, and wonders in the land of Ham.">Psalm 105:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-22.htm" title="Wondrous works in the land of Ham, and terrible things by the Red sea.">Psalm 106:22</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Cush</span>] A name of frequent occurrence in the O.T. for Ethiopia and the Ethiopians, i.e. the country and the people between Egypt and Abyssinia; the “Kas,” or “Kes,” of the Egyptian inscriptions. Cf. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-13.htm" title="And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that compasses the whole land of Ethiopia.">Genesis 2:13</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Mizraim</span>] The regular Hebrew name for Egypt. Cf. the Assyrian <span class="ital">Muṣur</span>. The termination “<span class="ital">-aim</span>” denotes the dual number; and hence it has been supposed that “Mizraim” means the two “Mizrs,” i.e. Upper and Lower Egypt. But we cannot rely on this for certain. “Mizraim” is the Hebrew name for Egypt without necessarily containing an allusion to this geographical division. It is best not to press the grammatical meaning that may be claimed to underlie the popular pronunciation of a geographical name; cf. Ephraim, Naharaim, Jerusalaim (= Jerusalem).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Put</span>] Mentioned also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-10.htm" title="They of Persia and of Lud and of Phut were in your army, your men of war: they hanged the shield and helmet in you; they set forth your comeliness.">Ezekiel 27:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-5.htm" title="Persia, Ethiopia, and Libya with them; all of them with shield and helmet:">Ezekiel 38:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-9.htm" title="Come up, you horses; and rage, you chariots; and let the mighty men come forth; the Ethiopians and the Libyans, that handle the shield; and the Lydians, that handle and bend the bow.">Jeremiah 46:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/3-9.htm" title="Ethiopia and Egypt were her strength, and it was infinite; Put and Lubim were your helpers.">Nahum 3:9</a>. In these passages “Put” is mentioned together with the composite materials of an Egyptian mercenary army. It is generally identified with the Libyans. Pliny mentions a river “Fut” in Libya. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/3-9.htm" title="Ethiopia and Egypt were her strength, and it was infinite; Put and Lubim were your helpers.">Nahum 3:9</a> Put is associated with the “Lubim,” and with Ethiopia and Egypt. <span class="ital">Punt</span> occurs in Egyptian inscriptions for the African “littoral” of the Red Sea.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Canaan</span>] This is the land of Phoenicia, probably in its widest sense, like <span class="ital">Kinaḥi</span> in the Tel-el-Amarna tablets (1400 b.c.). The Canaanites were Semites, and spoke a language which closely resembled Hebrew, and was more akin to Aramaean and Assyrian than Egyptian. Canaan was possibly associated by Israelite tradition with Egypt on account of the general similarity of its culture. Perhaps the Israelites, who regarded the Egyptians and the Canaanites as their two racial foes, and as the two corrupters of their faith, classed them together for that reason among “the sons of Ham.”<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the sons of Ham</span>.

The original settlement of Cush, however, is believed to have been on the Upper Nile, whence he afterwards spread to Arabia, Babylonia, India (Knobel, Kalisch, Lange, Rawlinson). Murphy thinks he may have started from the Caucasus, the Caspian, and. the Cossaei of Khusistan, and. migrated south (to Egypt) and east (to India). Josephus mentions that in his day Ethiopia was called Cush; the Syriac translates <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c8;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-27.htm">Acts 8:27</a>) by Cuschaeos; the ancient Egyptian name of Ethiopia was <span class="accented">Keesh</span>, Kish, or Kush ('Records of the Past, 4:7). The Cushites are described as of a black color (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-23.htm">Jeremiah 13:23</a>) and of great stature (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-14.htm">Isaiah 45:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And Mizraim</span>. A dual form probably designed to represent the two Egypts, upper and lower (Gesenius, Keil, Kalisch), though it has been discovered in ancient Egyptian as the name of a Hittite chief (<span class="accented">circa</span>  <span class="date">B.C. 1300</span>, contemporary with Rameses II.), written in hieroglyphics <span class="accented">M'azrima</span>, Ma being the sign for the dual. The old Egyptian name is <span class="accented">Kemi, Chemi</span>, with obvious reference to Ham; the name Egypt being probably derived from <span class="accented">Kaphtah</span>, the land of Ptah. The singular form Mazor is found in later books (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-24.htm">2 Kings 19:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-6.htm">Isaiah 19:6</a>; 35:25), and usually denotes Lower Egypt. <span class="cmt_word">And Phut</span>. <span class="accented">Phet</span> (Old Egyptian), <span class="accented">Phaiat</span> (Coptic); the Libyans in the north of Africa (Josephus, LXX., Gesenins, Bochart). Kalisch suggests <span class="accented">Buto</span> or <span class="accented">Butos</span>, the capital of the delta of the Nile. And Canaan. Hebrew, <span class="accented">Kenaan</span> (<span class="accented">vide</span> on Genesis 9:25). The extent of the territory occupied by the fourth son of Ham is defined in vers. 15-19. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/genesis/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Descendants of Ham. - Cush: the Ethiopians of the ancients, who not only dwelt in Africa, but were scattered over the whole of Southern Asia, and originally, in all probability, settled in Arabia, where the tribes that still remained, mingled with Shemites, and adopted a Shemitic language. Mizraim is Egypt: the dual form was probably transferred from the land to the people, referring, however, not to the double strip, i.e., the two strips of land into which the country is divided by the Nile, but to the two Egypts, Upper and Lower, two portions of the country which differ considerably in their climate and general condition. The name is obscure, and not traceable to any Semitic derivation; for the term &#1502;&#1510;&#1493;&#1512; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-6.htm">Isaiah 19:6</a>, etc., is not to be regarded as an etymological interpretation, but as a significant play upon the word. The old Egyptian name is Kemi (Copt. Chmi, Kme), which, Plutarch says, is derived from the dark ash-grey colour of the soil covered by the slime of the Nile, but which it is much more correct to trace to Ham, and to regard as indicative of the Hamitic descent of its first inhabitants. Put denotes the Libyans in the wider sense of the term (old Egypt. Phet; Copt. Phaiat), who were spread over Northern Africa as far as Mauritania, where even in the time of Jerome a river with the neighbouring district still bore the name of Phut; cf. Bochart, Phal. iv. 33.
