Those that are under the curse of God, may, perhaps, thrive and prosper in this world; for we cannot know love or hatred, the blessing or the curse, by what is before us, but by what is within us. The curse of God always works really, and always terribly. Perhaps it is a secret curse, a curse to the soul, and does not work so that others can see it; or a slow curse, and does not work soon; but sinners are reserved by it for a day of wrath Canaan here has a better land than either Shem or Japheth, and yet they have a better lot, for they inherit the blessing. Abram and his seed, God's covenant people, descended from Eber, and from him were called Hebrews. How much better it is to be like Eber, the father of a family of saints and honest men, than the father of a family of hunters after power, worldly wealth, or vanities. Goodness is true greatness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/genesis/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>From Kenaan are descended eleven nations:<p>(34) Zidon is styled his first-born. The name is retained in the well-known town on the coast of Phoenicia, which is accordingly of the highest antiquity among the cities of that region.

Its ruins are still extant at Tel Arka.<p>(41) the Sinite is supposed to have dwelt in Sinna, a town mentioned by Strabo, called Sine by Jerome, and Syn in the fifteenth century (Strab. xvi. 2, 18; Hieron. Quaest. in Gen., Breitenbach, Travels, p. 47), not far from Arke.<p>(42) the Arvadite dwelt in Arvad, Aradus, now Ruad, a Phoenician town on an island of the same name.<p>(43) the Zemarite has been traced in the town &#x3a3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;  Simura, the ruins of which were found by Shaw at the western foot of Lebanon, under the name of Sumra.<p>(44) the Hamathite was the inhabitant of Hamath, called Hamath Rabbah (the great), by the Greeks Epiphaneia, and at present Hamah. It is situated on the Orontes, and held an important place in the history of Israel. The land of Hamath was of great extent, including the town of Riblab <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-21.htm">2 Kings 25:21</a> and reaching even to Antioch. The entrance of Hamath &#1495;&#1502;&#1514; &#1489;&#1493;&#1488;   bo&#770;' chama&#772;t, the northern part of the valley between Lebanon and Antilibanus, formed the utmost boundary of Palestine to the north <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-21.htm">Numbers 13:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-5.htm">Joshua 13:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-65.htm">1 Kings 8:65</a>. Its king was in alliance with David <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-10.htm">2 Samuel 8:10</a>.<p>And afterward were the families of the Kenaanites spread abroad. - After the confusion of tongues were these nations formed; and after the formation of these Kenaanic tribes occurred the dispersion spoken of in the text. We do not know what was the original seat of the Kenaanites; or whether the dispersion here mentioned was violent or not. Its primary result, however, seems to have been their settlement in the country of which the boundaries are next described. It is not improbable that this land was allotted to a portion of the Shemites, and occupied by them when the Kenaanites entered and established themselves among them <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/40-15.htm">Genesis 40:15</a>. The Kenaanites probably had the same grasping tendency which displayed itself in Nimrod, their kinsman; and therefore seized upon the country with a high hand, and called it after their name. Their expulsion, on the conquest of the land by the Israelites, and their commercial activity, led to a still further dispersion; as colonies were sent out by them to the distant shores of the Mediterranean, to Asia Minor, Greece, Africa, Spain, and even the British Isles. But it can scarcely be supposed that reference is here made to these subsequent events in their history.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/genesis/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11. Out of that land went forth Asshur&#8212;or, as the Margin has it, "He [Nimrod] at the head of his army went forth into Assyria," that is, he pushed his conquests into that country.<p>and builded Nineveh&#8212;opposite the town of Mosul, on the Tigris, and the other towns near it. This raid into Assyria was an invasion of the territories of Shem, and hence the name "Nimrod," signifying "rebel," is supposed to have been conferred on him from his daring revolt against the divine distribution.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/genesis/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/genesis/10.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the Hivite,....

Although Zidon occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-19.htm">Genesis 10:19</a> and throughout the Old Testament as the name of the oldest capital of the Phoenicians, here it must be regarded as the name of a person, not only because of the apposition "his first-born," and the verb &#1497;&#1500;&#1491;, "begat," but also because the name of a city does not harmonize with the names of the other descendants of Canaan, the analogy of which would lead us to expect the nomen gentile "Sidonian" (<a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/3-3.htm">Judges 3:3</a>, etc.); and lastly, because the word Zidon, from &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491; to hunt, to catch, is not directly applicable to a sea-port and commercial town, and there are serious objections upon philological grounds to Justin's derivation, "quam a piscium ubertate Sidona appellaverunt, nam piscem Phoenices Sidon vocant" (var. hist. 18, 3). Heth is also the name of a person, from which the term Hittite (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-9.htm">Genesis 25:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-29.htm">Numbers 13:29</a>), equivalent to "sons of Heth" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/23-5.htm">Genesis 23:5</a>), is derived. "The Jebusite:" inhabitants of Jebus, afterwards called Jerusalem. "The Amorite:" not the inhabitants of the mountain or heights, for the derivation from &#1488;&#1502;&#1497;&#1512;, "summit," is not established, but a branch of the Canaanites, descended from Emor (Amor), which was spread far and wide over the mountains of Judah and beyond the Jordan in the time of Moses, so that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-16.htm">Genesis 15:16</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/48-22.htm">Genesis 48:22</a>, all the Canaanites are comprehended by the name. "The Girgashites," &#x393;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; (lxx), are also mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-21.htm">Genesis 15:21</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-1.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/24-11.htm">Joshua 24:11</a>; but their dwelling-place is unknown, as the reading &#x393;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-28.htm">Matthew 8:28</a> is critically suspicious. "The Hivites" dwelt in Sichem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/34-2.htm">Genesis 34:2</a>), at Gibeon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/9-7.htm">Joshua 9:7</a>), and at the foot of Hermon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/11-3.htm">Joshua 11:3</a>); the meaning of the word is uncertain. "The Arkites:" inhabitants of &#x391;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#769;, to the north of Tripolis at the foot of Lebanon, the ruins of which still exist (vid., Robinson). "The Sinite:" the inhabitants of Sin or Sinna, a place in Lebanon not yet discovered. "The Arvadite," or Aradians, occupied from the eighth century before Christ, the small rocky island of Arados to the north of Tripolis. "The Zemarite:" the inhabitants of Simyra in Eleutherus. "The Hamathite:" the inhabitants or rather founders of Hamath on the most northerly border of Palestine (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-21.htm">Numbers 13:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/34-8.htm">Numbers 34:8</a>), afterwards called Epiphania, on the river Orontes, the present Hamh, with 100,000 inhabitants. The words in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/10-18.htm">Genesis 10:18</a>, "and afterward were the families of the Canaanites spread abroad," mean that they all proceeded from one local centre as branches of the same tribe, and spread themselves over the country, the limits of which are given in two directions, with evident reference to the fact that it was afterwards promised to the seed of Abraham for its inheritance, viz., from north to south, - "from Sidon, in the direction (lit., as thou comest) towards Gerar (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/20-1.htm">Genesis 20:1</a>), unto Gaza," the primitive Avvite city of the Philistines (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-23.htm">Deuteronomy 2:23</a>), now called Guzzeh, at the S.W. corner of Palestine, - and thence from west to east, in the direction towards Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboim (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-24.htm">Genesis 19:24</a>) to Lesha," i.e., Calirrhoe, a place with sulphur baths, on the eastern side of the Dead Sea, in Wady Serka Maein (Seetzen and Ritter). </body></html>
