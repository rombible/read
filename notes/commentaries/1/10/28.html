Those that are under the curse of God, may, perhaps, thrive and prosper in this world; for we cannot know love or hatred, the blessing or the curse, by what is before us, but by what is within us. The curse of God always works really, and always terribly. Perhaps it is a secret curse, a curse to the soul, and does not work so that others can see it; or a slow curse, and does not work soon; but sinners are reserved by it for a day of wrath Canaan here has a better land than either Shem or Japheth, and yet they have a better lot, for they inherit the blessing. Abram and his seed, God's covenant people, descended from Eber, and from him were called Hebrews. How much better it is to be like Eber, the father of a family of saints and honest men, than the father of a family of hunters after power, worldly wealth, or vanities. Goodness is true greatness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/genesis/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The thirteen tribes of the Joctanites or primitive Arabs are enumerated here in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/10-26.htm">Genesis 10:26-29</a>.<p>(58) Almodad is usually referred to Yemen. The first syllable may be the Arabic article. Mudad is the name of one celebrated in Arab story as the stepfather of Ishmael and chief of the Jurhum tribe of Joctanites. The &#x391;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;  Alloumaio&#772;tai of Ptolemy belonged to the interior of Arabia Felix.<p>(59) Sheleph is traced in the &#x3a3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#768;  Salapeenoi of Ptolemy (vi. 7), belonging to the interior.<p>(60) Hazarmaveth gives name to a district on the Indian Ocean, abounding in spices, now called Hadramaut. This tribe is the Chatramitae of Greek writers.<p>(61) Jerah occupied a district where are the coast and mountain of the moon, near Hadramaut.<p>(62) Hadoram is preserved in the tribe called &#x391;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;  Adamitai Atramitae, placed by Pliny (vi. 28) between the Homerites and the Sachalites on the south coast of Arabia.<p>(63) Uzal perhaps gave the ancient name of Azal to Sana, the capital of Yemen, a place still celebrated for the manufacture of beautiful stuffs.<p>(64) Diclah settled possibly in the palm-bearing region of the Minaei in Hejaz.<p>(65) Obal is otherwise unknown.<p>(66) Abimael is equally obscure. Bochart supposes there is a trace of the name in &#x39c;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;  Mali, a place in Arabia Aromatifera.<p>(67) Sheba is the progenitor of the Sabaei in Arabia Felix, celebrated for spices, gold, and precious stones, and noted for the prosperity arising from traffic in these commodities. A queen of Sheba visited Solomon. The dominant family among the Sabaeans was that of Himjar, from whom the Himjarites (Homeritae) of a later period descended.<p>(68) Ophir gave name to a country celebrated for gold, precious stones, and almug wood, which seems to have lain on the south side of Arabia, where these products may be found. What kind of tree the almug is has not been clearly ascertained. Some suppose it to be the sandal wood which grows in Persia and India; others, a species of pine. If this wood was not native, it may have been imported from more distant countries to Ophir, which was evidently a great emporium. Others, however, have supposed Ophir to be in India, or Eastern Africa. The chief argument for a more distant locality arises from the supposed three years' voyage to it from Ezion-geber, and the products obtained in the country so reached. But the three years' voyage <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-22.htm">1 Kings 10:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-21.htm">2 Chronicles 9:21</a> seems to be in reality to Tarshish, a very different region.<p>(69) Havilah here is the founder of a Joctanite tribe of Arabs, and therefore his territory must be sought somewhere in the extensive country which was occupied by these wandering tribes. A trace of the name is probably preserved in Khawlan, a district lying in the northwest of Yemen, between Sana and Mecca, though the tribe may have originally settled or extended further north.<p>(70) Jobab has been compared with the &#x399;&#787;&#x3c9;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;  Io&#772;baritai of Ptolemy (vi. 7). Bochart finds the name in the Arabic: yobab, a desert.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/genesis/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>25. Peleg; for in his days was the earth divided&#8212;After the flood (Ge 11:10-16) the descendants of Noah settled at pleasure and enjoyed the produce of the undivided soil. But according to divine instruction, made probably through Eber, who seems to have been distinguished for piety or a prophetic character, the earth was divided and his son's name, "Peleg," was given in memory of that event (see De 32:8; Ac 17:26).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/genesis/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> A different person from him <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-7.htm" title="And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabtechah: and the sons of Raamah; Sheba, and Dedan.">Genesis 10:7</a></span>, and the father of another people, having only the same name with him. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/genesis/10.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba. The first of these, Obal, or Aubal, as the Arabs pronounce, Bochart (t) is obliged to make his posterity pass over the straits of the Arabian Gulf out of Arabia Felix into Arabia Troglodytice; where he finds a bay, called by Pliny (u) the Abalite bay, which carries in it some trace of this man's name, and by Ptolemy (v) the Avalite bay; and where was not only an emporium of this name, but a people called Avalites and also Adulites, which Bishop Patrick believes should be read "Abulites", more agreeably to the name of this man, but Pliny (w) speaks of a town of the Adulites also: Abimael is supposed by Bochart (x) to be the father of Mali, or the Malitae, as his name may be thought to signify, Theophrastus (y) making mention of a place called Mali along with Saba, Adramyta, and Citibaena, in spicy Arabia, which is the only foundation there is for this conjecture: Sheba gave name to the Sabaeans, a numerous people in Arabia; their country was famous for frankincense; the nations of them, according to Pliny (z), reached both seas, that is, extended from the Arabian to the Persian Gulf; one part of them, as he says (a), was called Atramitae, and the capital of their kingdom Sabota, on a high mountain, eight mansions from which was their frankincense country, called Saba; elsewhere he says (b), their capital was called Sobotale, including sixty temples within its walls; but the royal seat was Mariabe; and so Eratosthenes in Strabo (c) says, the metropolis of the Sabaeans was Mariaba, or, as others call it, Merab, and which, it seems, is the same with Saba; for Diodorus Siculus (d) and Philostorgius (e) say, the metropolis of the Sabaeans is Saba; and which the former represents as built on a mountain, as the Sabota of Pliny is said to be, <p>(t) Ut supra, (Phaleg. l. 2.) c. 23.

His brother Joktan is called Kachtan by the Arabians, and is regarded as the father of all the primitive tribes of Arabia. The names of his sons are given in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/10-26.htm">Genesis 10:26-29</a>. There are thirteen of them, some of which are still retained in places and districts of Arabia, whilst others are not yet discovered, or are entirely extinct. Nothing certain has been ascertained about Almodad, Jerah, Diklah, Obal, Abimael, and Jobab. Of the rest, Sheleph is identical with Salif or Sulaf (in Ptl. 6, 7, &#x3a3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;), an old Arabian tribe, also a district of Yemen. Hazarmaveth (i.e., forecourt of death) is the Arabian Hadhramaut in South-eastern Arabia on the Indian Ocean, whose name Jauhari is derived from the unhealthiness of the climate. Hadoram: the &#x391;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; of Ptol. 6, 7, Atramitae of Plin. 6, 28, on the southern coast of Arabia. Uzal: one of the most important towns of Yemen, south-west of Mareb. Sheba: the Sabaeans, with the capital Saba or Mareb, Mariaba regia (Plin.), whose connection with the Cushite (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-7.htm">Genesis 10:7</a>) and Abrahamite Sabaeans (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-3.htm">Genesis 25:3</a>) is quite in obscurity. Ophir has not yet been discovered in Arabia; it is probably to be sought on the Persian Gulf, even if the Ophir of Solomon was not situated there. Havilah appears to answer to Chaulaw of Edrisi, a district between Sanaa and Mecca. But this district, which lies in the heart of Yemen, does not fit the account in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-7.htm">1 Samuel 15:7</a>, nor the statement in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/25-18.htm">Genesis 25:18</a>, that Havilah formed the boundary of the territory of the Ishmaelites. These two passages point rather to &#x3a7;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;, a place on the border of Arabia Petraea towards Yemen, between the Nabataeans and Hagrites, which Strabo describes as habitable. </body></html>
