He now wanted even more, and for the actual appropriation of any portion of the soil a public compact and purchase was required, which must be ratified not merely by the seller but by the consent of all the tribe, convened in full assembly at the gate of the city. Thus, in spite of his power and wealth, Abraham, as regards his legal position towards the inhabitants, was but a stranger and sojourner (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-9.htm" title="By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise:">Hebrews 11:9</a>), and could secure a resting- place for his dead only by their consent.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/genesis/23.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/23-4.htm" title="I am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a burial plot with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.">Genesis 23:4</a></span>. <span class="ital">I am a stranger and a sojourner with you </span>— Therefore I am unprovided, and must become a suiter to you for a burying-place.

Blessed be God that there is a world where sin, death, vanity, and vexation cannot enter. Blessed be his name, that even death cannot part believers from union with Christ. Those whom we most love, yea, even our own bodies, which we so care for, must soon become loathsome lumps of clays, and be buried out of sight. How loose then should we be to all earthly attachments and adornments! Let us seek rather that our souls be adorned with heavenly graces. Abraham rendered honour and respect to the princes of Heth, although of the ungodly Canaanites. The religion of the Bible enjoins to pay due respect to all in authority, without flattering their persons, or countenancing their crimes if they are unworthy characters. And the noble generosity of these Canaanites shames and condemns the closeness, selfishness, and ill-humour of many that call themselves Israelites. It was not in pride that Abraham refused the gift, because he scorned to be beholden to Ephron; but in justice and in prudence. Abraham was able to pay for the field, and therefore would not take advantage of Ephron's generosity. Honesty, as well as honour, forbids us to take advantage of our neighbour's liberality, and to impose, upon those who give freely.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/genesis/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Abraham purchases a burying-ground in the land. "The sons of Heth." These are the lords of the soil. "A stranger and a sojourner." He is a stranger, not a Hittite; a sojourner, a dweller in the land, not a mere visitor or traveller. The former explains why he has no burial-ground; the latter, why he asks to purchase one. "Bury my dead out of my sight." The bodies of those most dear to us decay, and must be removed from our sight. Abraham makes his request in the most general terms. In the somewhat exaggerated style of Eastern courtesy, the sons of Heth reply, "Hear us, my lord." One speaks for all; hence, the change of number. "My lord" is simply equivalent to our "Sir," or the German "mein Herr." "A prince of God" in those times of simple faith was a chief notably favored of God, as Abraham had been in his call, his deliverance in Egypt, his victory over the kings, his intercession for the cities of the vale, and his protection the court of Abimelek. Some of these events were well known to the Hittites, as they had occurred while he was residing among them.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/genesis/23.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Ge 23:3-20.

Abraham's desire for a grave m which to deposit Sarah's lifeless remains was dictated by that Divinely planted and, among civilized nations, universally prevailing reverence for the body which prompts men to decently dispose of their dead by rites of honorable sepulture. The burning of corpses was a practice common to the nations of antiquity; but Tacitus notes it as characteristic of the Jews that they preferred interment to cremation ('Hist.,' 5:5). The wish to make Sarah's burying-place his own possession has been traced to the instinctive desire that most nations have evinced to lie in ground belonging to themselves (Rosenm&uuml;ller), to an intention on the part of the patriarch to give a sign of his right and title to the land of Canaan by purchasing a grave in its soil - cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-16.htm">Isaiah 22:16</a> (Bush), or simply to anxiety that his dead might not lie unburied (Calvin); but it was more probably due to his strong faith that the land would yet belong to his descendants, which naturally led him to crave a resting-place in the soil with which the hopes of both himself and people were identified (Ainsworth, Bush, Kalisch). <span class="cmt_word">That I may bury my dead out of my sight</span> - decay not suffering the lifeless corpse to remain a fit spectacle for grief or love to gaze on. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/genesis/22.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Descendants of Nahor. - With the sacrifice of Isaac the test of Abraham's faith was now complete, and the purpose of his divine calling answered: the history of his life, therefore, now hastens to its termination. But first of all there is introduced quite appropriately an account of the family of his brother Nahor, which is so far in place immediately after the story of the sacrifice of Isaac, that it prepares the way for the history of the marriage of the heir of the promise. The connection is pointed out in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/22-20.htm">Genesis 22:20</a>, as compared with <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/11-29.htm">Genesis 11:29</a>, in the expression, "she also." Nahor, like Ishmael and Jacob, had twelve sons, eight by his wife Milcah and four by his concubine; whereas Jacob had his by two wives and two maids, and Ishmael apparently all by one wife. This difference with regard to the mothers proves that the agreement as to the number twelve rests upon a good historical tradition, and is no product of a later myth, which traced to Nahor the same number of tribes as to Ishmael and Jacob. For it is a perfectly groundless assertion or assumption, that Nahor's twelve sons were the fathers of as many tribes. There are only a few names, of which it is probable that their bearers were the founders of tribes of the same name. On Uz, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-23.htm">Genesis 10:23</a>. Buz is mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-23.htm">Jeremiah 25:23</a> along with Dedan and Tema as an Arabian tribe; and Elihu was a Buzite of the family of Ram (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/32-2.htm">Job 32:2</a>). Kemuel, the father of Aram, was not the founder of the Aramaeans, but the forefather of the family of Ram, to which the Buzite Elihu belonged, - Aram being written for Ram, like Arammim in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-29.htm">2 Kings 8:29</a> for Rammim in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/22-5.htm">2 Chronicles 22:5</a>. Chesed again was not the father of the Chasdim (Chaldeans), for they were older than Chesed; at the most he was only the founder of one branch of the Chasdim, possibly those who stole Job's camels (Knobel; vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-17.htm">Job 1:17</a>). Of the remaining names, Bethuel was not the founder of a tribe, but the father of Laban and Rebekah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-20.htm">Genesis 25:20</a>). The others are never met with again, with the exception of Maachach, from whom probably the Maachites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-14.htm">Deuteronomy 3:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/12-5.htm">Joshua 12:5</a>) in the land of Maacah, a small Arabian kingdom in the time of David (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-6.htm">2 Samuel 10:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-8.htm">2 Samuel 10:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/19-6.htm">1 Chronicles 19:6</a>), derived their origin and name; though Maachah frequently occurs as the name of a person (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-39.htm">1 Kings 2:39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-43.htm">1 Chronicles 11:43</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/27-16.htm">1 Chronicles 27:16</a>). </body></html>
