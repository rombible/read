It now appears that it was the property of the Hittites, a race who, while the Israelites sojourned in Egypt, became so powerful as to contend for empire with the Egyptians themselves. Their capital was Emesa in Northern Syria, and their history is now being made known to us not only by means of Egyptian records, but also of inscriptions in their own language (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-15.htm" title="And Canaan begat Sidon his first born, and Heth,">Genesis 10:15</a>).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/23.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>23:1-13 The longest life must shortly come to a close. Blessed be God that there is a world where sin, death, vanity, and vexation cannot enter. Blessed be his name, that even death cannot part believers from union with Christ. Those whom we most love, yea, even our own bodies, which we so care for, must soon become loathsome lumps of clays, and be buried out of sight. How loose then should we be to all earthly attachments and adornments! Let us seek rather that our souls be adorned with heavenly graces. Abraham rendered honour and respect to the princes of Heth, although of the ungodly Canaanites. The religion of the Bible enjoins to pay due respect to all in authority, without flattering their persons, or countenancing their crimes if they are unworthy characters. And the noble generosity of these Canaanites shames and condemns the closeness, selfishness, and ill-humour of many that call themselves Israelites. It was not in pride that Abraham refused the gift, because he scorned to be beholden to Ephron; but in justice and in prudence. Abraham was able to pay for the field, and therefore would not take advantage of Ephron's generosity. Honesty, as well as honour, forbids us to take advantage of our neighbour's liberality, and to impose, upon those who give freely.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/genesis/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Abraham purchases a burying-ground in the land. "The sons of Heth." These are the lords of the soil. "A stranger and a sojourner." He is a stranger, not a Hittite; a sojourner, a dweller in the land, not a mere visitor or traveller. The former explains why he has no burial-ground; the latter, why he asks to purchase one. "Bury my dead out of my sight." The bodies of those most dear to us decay, and must be removed from our sight. Abraham makes his request in the most general terms. In the somewhat exaggerated style of Eastern courtesy, the sons of Heth reply, "Hear us, my lord." One speaks for all; hence, the change of number. "My lord" is simply equivalent to our "Sir," or the German "mein Herr." "A prince of God" in those times of simple faith was a chief notably favored of God, as Abraham had been in his call, his deliverance in Egypt, his victory over the kings, his intercession for the cities of the vale, and his protection the court of Abimelek. Some of these events were well known to the Hittites, as they had occurred while he was residing among them.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/genesis/23.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Ge 23:3-20.

The settlements of Hittites in the N. of Palestine may have extended in groups and families southwards. But “the children of Heth” are here spoken of as the native inhabitants of Hebron. Ezekiel regards “Amorites” and “Hittites” as original dwellers in Palestine (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/16-3.htm" title="And Sarai Abram's wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian, after Abram had dwelled ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife.">Genesis 16:3</a>; Genesis 45).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Abraham stood up</span> - during the days of mourning he had been sitting on the ground; and now, his grief having moderated (Calvin), he goes out to the city gate - <span class="cmt_word">from before</span> (literally, <span class="accented">from over the face</span> of) <span class="cmt_word">his dead</span>, - "Sarah, though dead, was still his" (Wordsworth) - <span class="cmt_word">and spake unto the sons of Heth</span>. - the Hittites were descendants of Heth, the son of Canaan (<span class="accented">vide</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-15.htm">Genesis 10:15</a>).

But first of all there is introduced quite appropriately an account of the family of his brother Nahor, which is so far in place immediately after the story of the sacrifice of Isaac, that it prepares the way for the history of the marriage of the heir of the promise. The connection is pointed out in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/22-20.htm">Genesis 22:20</a>, as compared with <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/11-29.htm">Genesis 11:29</a>, in the expression, "she also." Nahor, like Ishmael and Jacob, had twelve sons, eight by his wife Milcah and four by his concubine; whereas Jacob had his by two wives and two maids, and Ishmael apparently all by one wife. This difference with regard to the mothers proves that the agreement as to the number twelve rests upon a good historical tradition, and is no product of a later myth, which traced to Nahor the same number of tribes as to Ishmael and Jacob. For it is a perfectly groundless assertion or assumption, that Nahor's twelve sons were the fathers of as many tribes. There are only a few names, of which it is probable that their bearers were the founders of tribes of the same name. On Uz, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-23.htm">Genesis 10:23</a>. Buz is mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-23.htm">Jeremiah 25:23</a> along with Dedan and Tema as an Arabian tribe; and Elihu was a Buzite of the family of Ram (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/32-2.htm">Job 32:2</a>). Kemuel, the father of Aram, was not the founder of the Aramaeans, but the forefather of the family of Ram, to which the Buzite Elihu belonged, - Aram being written for Ram, like Arammim in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-29.htm">2 Kings 8:29</a> for Rammim in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/22-5.htm">2 Chronicles 22:5</a>. Chesed again was not the father of the Chasdim (Chaldeans), for they were older than Chesed; at the most he was only the founder of one branch of the Chasdim, possibly those who stole Job's camels (Knobel; vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-17.htm">Job 1:17</a>). Of the remaining names, Bethuel was not the founder of a tribe, but the father of Laban and Rebekah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-20.htm">Genesis 25:20</a>). The others are never met with again, with the exception of Maachach, from whom probably the Maachites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-14.htm">Deuteronomy 3:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/12-5.htm">Joshua 12:5</a>) in the land of Maacah, a small Arabian kingdom in the time of David (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-6.htm">2 Samuel 10:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-8.htm">2 Samuel 10:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/19-6.htm">1 Chronicles 19:6</a>), derived their origin and name; though Maachah frequently occurs as the name of a person (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-39.htm">1 Kings 2:39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-43.htm">1 Chronicles 11:43</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/27-16.htm">1 Chronicles 27:16</a>). </body></html>
