Blessed be God that there is a world where sin, death, vanity, and vexation cannot enter. Blessed be his name, that even death cannot part believers from union with Christ. Those whom we most love, yea, even our own bodies, which we so care for, must soon become loathsome lumps of clays, and be buried out of sight. How loose then should we be to all earthly attachments and adornments! Let us seek rather that our souls be adorned with heavenly graces. Abraham rendered honour and respect to the princes of Heth, although of the ungodly Canaanites. The religion of the Bible enjoins to pay due respect to all in authority, without flattering their persons, or countenancing their crimes if they are unworthy characters. And the noble generosity of these Canaanites shames and condemns the closeness, selfishness, and ill-humour of many that call themselves Israelites. It was not in pride that Abraham refused the gift, because he scorned to be beholden to Ephron; but in justice and in prudence. Abraham was able to pay for the field, and therefore would not take advantage of Ephron's generosity. Honesty, as well as honour, forbids us to take advantage of our neighbour's liberality, and to impose, upon those who give freely.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/genesis/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Abraham now makes a specific offer to purchase the field of Makpelah from Ephron the son of Zohar. "Treat for me" - deal, use your influence with him. Abraham approaches in the most cautious manner to the individual with whom he wishes to treat. "The cave of Makpelah." The burial of the dead in caves, natural and artificial, was customary in this Eastern land. The field seems to have been called Makpelah (doubled) from the double form of the cave, or the two caves perhaps communicating with each other, which it contained. "For the full silver." Silver seems to have been the current medium of commerce at this time. God was known, and mentioned at an earlier period <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-11.htm">Genesis 2:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/13-2.htm">Genesis 13:2</a>. "A possession of a burying-ground." We learn from this passage that property in land had been established at this time. Much of the country, however, must have been a common, or unappropriated pasture ground.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/genesis/23.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Ge 23:3-20.

"There is scarcely anything in the habits of Orientals more annoying to us Occidentals than this universal custom of employing mediators to pass between you and-those with whom you wish to do business. Nothing can be done without them. A merchant cannot sell a piece of print, nor a farmer a yoke of oxen, nor any one rent a house, buy a horse, or <span class="accented">get a wife</span>, without a succession of go-betweens. Of course Abraham knew that this matter of the field could not be brought about without the intervention of the neighbors of Ephron, and therefore he applies to them first" ('Land and Book,' p. 579). <span class="cmt_word">That he may give me the cave of Machpelah</span>, - Machpelah is regarded as a proper noun (Gesenius, Keil, Kalisch, Rosenm&uuml;ller), as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-30.htm">Genesis 49:30</a>, though by others it is considered as an appellative, signifying that the cave was double (LXX., Vulgate), either as consisting of a cave within a cave (Hamerus), or of one cave exterior and another interior (Abort Ezra), or as having room for two bodies (Calvin), or as possessing two entrances (Jewish interpreters). It is probable the cave received its name from its peculiar form, - <span class="cmt_word">which he hath</span> (Ephron s ownership of the cave is expressly recognized, and its situation is next described), <span class="cmt_word">which is in the end of his field</span> - "so that the cession of it will not injure his property" (Wordsworth). At the same time Abraham  makes it clear that an honest purchase is  what he contemplates. <span class="cmt_word">For as much money  as it is worth</span> - literally, <span class="accented">for full silver</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-22.htm">1 Chronicles 21:22</a>). Cf. <span class="accented">siller</span> (Scotch) for money.  This is the first mention of the use of the  precious metals as a medium of exchange,  though they must have been so employed at  a very early period (<span class="accented">vide</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/13-2.htm">Genesis 13:2</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">he  shall give it me for a possession of a burying-place amongst you.</span> The early Chaldaeans  were accustomed to bury their dead in  strongly-constructed brick vaults. Those found at Mughheir are seven feet long, three feet seven inches broad, and five feet high,  are composed of sun-dried bricks embedded  in mud, and exhibit a remarkable form and  construction of arch, resembling that occur ring in Egyptian buildings and Scythian  tombs, in which the successive layers of  brick are made to overlap until they come so close that the aperture may be covered by a single brick (Rawlinson's 'Ancient Monarchies,' Vol. 1. p. 86). In the absence of such artificial receptacles for the dead, the nearest substitute the patriarch could obtain was one of those natural grottoes which the limestone hills of Canaan so readily afforded. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/genesis/23.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Sarah is the only woman whose age is mentioned in the Scriptures, because as the mother of the promised seed she became the mother of all believers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-6.htm">1 Peter 3:6</a>). She died at the age of 127, thirty-seven years after the birth of Isaac, at Hebron, or rather in the grove of Mamre near that city (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/13-18.htm">Genesis 13:18</a>), whither Abraham had once more returned after a lengthened stay at Beersheba (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-19.htm">Genesis 22:19</a>). The name Kirjath Arba, i.e., the city of Arba, which Hebron bears here and also in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/35-27.htm">Genesis 35:27</a>, and other passages, and which it still bore at the time of the conquest of Canaan by the Israelites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/14-15.htm">Joshua 14:15</a>), was not the original name of the city, but was first given to it by Arba the Anakite and his family, who had not yet arrived there in the time of the patriarchs. It was probably given by them when they took possession of the city, and remained until the Israelites captured it and restored the original name. The place still exists, as a small town on the road from Jerusalem to Beersheba, in a valley surrounded by several mountains, and is called by the Arabs, with allusion to Abraham's stay there, el Khalil, i.e., the friend (of God), which is the title given to Abraham by the Mohammedans. The clause "in the land of Canaan" denotes, that not only did Sarah die in the land of promise, but Abraham as a foreigner acquired a burial-place by purchase there. "And Abraham came" (not from Beersheba, but from the field where he may have been with the flocks), "to mourn for Sarah and to weep for her," i.e., to arrange for the customary mourning ceremony. </body></html>
