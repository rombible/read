The better we take up with plain things, and the less we seek things to gratify pride and luxury, the nearer we approach to innocency. Nature is content with a little, and that which is most natural; grace with less; but lust craves every thing, and is content with nothing. No delights can be satisfying to the soul, but those which God himself has provided and appointed for it. Eden signifies delight and pleasure. Wherever it was, it had all desirable conveniences, without any inconvenience, though no other house or garden on earth ever was so. It was adorned with every tree pleasant to the sight, and enriched with every tree that yielded fruit grateful to the taste and good for food. God, as a tender Father, desired not only Adam's profit, but his pleasure; for there is pleasure with innocency, nay there is true pleasure only in innocency. When Providence puts us in a place of plenty and pleasure, we ought to serve God with gladness of heart in the good things he gives us. Eden had two trees peculiar to itself. 1. There was the tree of life in the midst of the garden. Of this man might eat and live. Christ is now to us the Tree of life, Re 2:7; 22:2; and the Bread of life, Joh 6:48,51. 2. There was the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, so called because there was a positive revelation of the will of God about this tree, so that by it man might know moral good and evil. What is good? It is good not to eat of this tree. What is evil? It is evil to eat of this tree. In these two trees God set before Adam good and evil, the blessing and the curse.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/genesis/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Pishon waters in its subsequent course the land of Havilah. This country is noted for the best gold, and for two other products, concerning which interpreters differ. Bedolach is, according to the Septuagint, the carbuncle or crystal; according to others, the pearl, or a particular kind of gum. The last is the more probable, if we regard the various Greek and Latin forms of the word: &#x392;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;  bdella, &#x392;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;  bdellion, Josephus Ant. iii. 1, 6; &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#788; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;  hoi de madelkon, &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#788; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x392;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;  hoi de bolchon kalousi, Dioscor. i. 71; alii brochon appellant, alii malacham, alii maldacon, Pliny H.

Pliny describes it as black, while the manna, which is compared with it <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/11-7.htm">Numbers 11:7</a>, is white; but &#1506;&#1497;&#1503;  &#8219;ay&#305;&#770;n the point of resemblance may refer not to color, but to transparence or some other visible quality. This transparent, aromatic gum is found in Arabia, Babylonia, Bactriana, Media, and India. Shoham is variously conjectured to be the beryl, onyx, sardonyx, or emerald. The first, according to Pliny, is found in India and about Pontus. As the name Pishon means the gushing or spouting current, it may have been applied to many a stream by the migratory tribes. The Halys perhaps contains the same root with Havilah; namely, &#1492;&#1493;&#1500;  hvl (Rawlinson's Her. i., p. 126); and it rises in Armenia (Herod. i. 72). The Chalybes in Pontus, perhaps, contain the same root. The Pishon may have been the Halys or some other stream flowing into the Black Sea.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/genesis/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. tree of life&#8212;so called from its symbolic character as a sign and seal of immortal life.

Arabia was famous for gold: Diodorus Siculus (x) speaks of gold in Arabia, called "apyrus", which is not melted by fire out of small filings, as other; but as soon as dug is said to be pure gold, and that in the size of chestnuts, and of such a flaming colour, that the most precious stones are set in it by artificers for ornament: and in Colchis and Scythia, as Strabo (y) relates, there are rivers which produce gold; and from whence came the fable of the golden fleece, the Argonauts went to Colchis for: <p>there is the bdellium, and the onyx stone; the first of these is either an aromatic gum; the tree, according to Pliny (z), is black, and is of the size of an olive tree, has the leaf of an oak, and its fruit is like capers; it is found in Arabia, India, Media, and Babylon; but the best, according to him, is in Bactriana, and, next to that, the bdellium of Arabia: or else it is a precious stone, and which the Jewish writers (a) commonly take to be crystal; and, according to Solinus (b), the best crystal is in Scythia. Bochart (c) would have it that the pearl is meant, because of its whiteness and roundness, for which the manna is compared to it, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-7.htm">Numbers 11:7</a> and the rather because of the pearl fishery at Catipha, taking Havilah to be that part of Arabia which lies upon the Persian gulf. The latter, the onyx, is a precious stone, which has its name from its being of the colour of a man's nail; and, according to Pliny (d), the onyx marble is found in the mountains of Arabia, and the ancients thought it was nowhere else; and he speaks elsewhere of the Arabian onyx precious stone, and of the sardonyx, as in the same country (e); and some think that is here meant; though the word is sometimes by the Septuagint rendered the emerald; and the best of these, according to Solinus (f) and Pliny (g), were in Scythia.

For this meaning of &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-25.htm">Ezekiel 16:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-19.htm">Lamentations 2:19</a>. Of the four rivers whose names are given to show the geographical situation of paradise, the last two are unquestionably Tigris and Euphrates. Hiddekel occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-4.htm">Daniel 10:4</a> as the Hebrew name for Tigris; in the inscriptions of Darius it is called Tigra&#770; (or the arrow, according to Strabo, Pliny, and Curtius), from the Zendic tighra, pointed, sharp, from which probably the meaning stormy (rapidus Tigris, Hor. Carm. 4, 14, 46) was derived. It flows before (&#1511;&#1491;&#1502;&#1514;), in front of, Assyria, not to the east of Assyria; for the province of Assyria, which must be intended here, was on the eastern side of the Tigris: moreover, neither the meaning, "to the east of," nor the identity of &#1511;&#1491;&#1502;&#1514; and &#1502;&#1511;&#1491;&#1501; has been, or can be, established from <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-16.htm">Genesis 4:16</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-5.htm">1 Samuel 13:5</a>, or <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/39-11.htm">Ezekiel 39:11</a>, which are the only other passages in which the word occurs, as Ewald himself acknowledges. P'rath, which was not more minutely described because it was so generally known, is the Euphrates; in old Persian, Ufra&#770;tu, according to Delitzsch, or the good and fertile stream; Ufra&#770;tu, according to Spiegler, or the well-progressing stream. According to the present condition of the soil, the sources of the Euphrates and Tigris are not so closely connected that they could be regarded as the commencements of a common stream which has ceased to exist. The main sources of the Tigris, it is true, are only 2000 paces from the Euphrates, but they are to the north of Diarbekr, in a range of mountains which is skirted on three sides by the upper course of the Euphrates, and separates them from this river. We must also look in the same country, the highlands of Armenia, for the other two rivers, if the description of paradise actually rests upon an ancient tradition, and is to be regarded as something more than a mythical invention of the fancy. The name Phishon sounds like the Phasis of the ancients, with which Reland supposed it to be identical; and Chavilah like Cholchis, the well-known gold country of the ancients. But the &#x3a6;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#788; &#x39a;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; (Herod. 4, 37, 45) takes its rise in the Caucasus, and not in Armenia. A more probable conjecture, therefore, points to the Cyrus of the ancients, which rises in Armenia, flows northwards to a point not far from the eastern border of Colchis, and then turns eastward in Iberia, from which it flows in a south-easterly direction to the Caspian Sea. The expression, "which compasseth the whole land of Chavilah," would apply very well to the course of this river from the eastern border of Colchis; for &#1505;&#1489;&#1489; does not necessarily signify to surround, but to pass through with different turns, or to skirt in a semi-circular form, and Chavilah may have been larger than modern Colchis. It is not a valid objection to this explanation, that in every other place Chavilah is a district of Southern Arabia. The identity of this Chavilah with the Chavilah of the Joktanites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-29.htm">Genesis 10:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-18.htm">Genesis 25:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-7.htm">1 Samuel 15:7</a>) or of the Cushites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-7.htm">Genesis 10:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/1-9.htm">1 Chronicles 1:9</a>) is disproved not only by the article used here, which distinguishes it from the other, but also by the description of it as land where gold, bdolach, and the shohamstone are found; a description neither requisite nor suitable in the case of the Arabian Chavilah, since there productions are not to be met with there. This characteristic evidently shows that the Chavilah mentioned here was entirely distinct from the other, and a land altogether unknown to the Iraelites.<p>What we are to understand by &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1500;&#1495; is uncertain. There is no certain ground for the meaning "pearls," given in Saad. and the later Rabbins, and adopted by Bochart and others. The rendering &#x3b2;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1; or &#x3b2;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, bdellium, a vegetable gum, of which Cioscorus says, &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#788; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#788; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd;, and Pliny, "alii brochon appellant, alii malacham, alii maldacon," is favoured by the similarity in the name; but, on the other side, there is the fact that Pliny describes this gum as nigrum and hadrobolon, and Dioscorus as &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; (blackish), which does not agree with <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/11-7.htm">Numbers 11:7</a>, where the appearance of the white grains of the manna is compared to that of bdolach. - The stone shoham, according to most of the early versions, is probably the beryl, which is most likely the stone intended by the lxx (&#x3bf;&#788; &#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, the leek-green stone), as Pliny, when speaking of beryls, describes those as probatissimi, qui viriditatem puri maris imitantur; but according to others it is the onyx or sardonyx (vid., Ges. s.v.).<p>(Note: The two productions furnish no proof that the Phishon is to be sought for in India. The assertion that the name bdolach is Indian, is quite unfounded, for it cannot be proved that mada&#770;laka in Sanscrit is a vegetable gum; nor has this been proved of mada&#770;ra, which is possibly related to it (cf. Lassen's indische Althk. 1, 290 note). Moreover, Pliny speaks of Bactriana as the land "in qua Bdellium est nominatissimum," although he adds, "nascitur et in Arabia Indiaque, et Media ac Babylone;" and Isidorus says of the Bdella which comes from India, "Sordida est et nigra et majori gleba," which, again, does not agree with <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-7.htm">Numbers 11:7</a>. - The Shoham-stone also is not necessarily associated with India; for although Pliny says of the beryls, "India eos gignit, raro alibi repertos," he also observes, "in nostro orbe aliquando circa Pontum inveniri putantur.")<p>The Gihon (from &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; to break forth) is the Araxes, which rises in the neighbourhood of the Euphrates, flows from west to east, joins the Cyrus, and falls with it into the Caspian Sea. The name corresponds to the Arabic Jaihun, a name given by the Arabians and Persians to several large rivers. The land of Cush cannot, of course, be the later Cush, or Ethiopia, but must be connected with the Asiatic &#x39a;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;, which reached to the Caucasus, and to which the Jews (of Shirwan) still give this name. But even though these four streams do not now spring from one source, but on the contrary their sources are separated by mountain ranges, this fact does not prove that the narrative before us is a myth. Along with or since the disappearance of paradise, that part of the earth may have undergone such changes that the precise locality can no longer be determined with certainty.<p>(Note: That the continents of our globe have undergone great changes since the creation of the human race, is a truth sustained by the facts of natural history and the earliest national traditions, and admitted by the most celebrated naturalists. (See the collection of proofs made by Keerl.) These changes must not be all attributed to the flood; many may have occurred before and many after, like the catastrophe in which the Dead Sea originated, without being recorded in history as this has been. Still less must we interpret <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/11-1.htm">Genesis 11:1</a> (compared with <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-25.htm">Genesis 10:25</a>), as Fabri and Keerl have done, as indicating a complete revolution of the globe, or a geogonic process, by which the continents of the old world were divided, and assumed their present physignomy.) </body></html>
