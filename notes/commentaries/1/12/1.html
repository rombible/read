The rendering “had said” was doubtless adopted because of St. Stephen’s words (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-2.htm" title="And he said, Men, brothers, and fathers, listen; The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelled in Charran,">Acts 7:2</a>); but it is the manner of the Biblical narrative to revert to the original starting point.<p><span class= "bld">Thy country.</span>—A proof that Abram and his father were no new settlers at Ur, but that the race of Shem had at this time long held sway there, as is now known to have been the case.<p><span class= "bld">Thy kindred.</span>—This rendering is supported by <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/43-7.htm" title="And they said, The man asked us straightly of our state, and of our kindred, saying, Is your father yet alive? have you another brother? and we told him according to the tenor of these words: could we certainly know that he would say, Bring your brother down?">Genesis 43:7</a>; but it more probably means <span class= "ital">thy birthplace. </span>It is the word translated “nativity” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/11-28.htm" title="And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.">Genesis 11:28</a>. where its meaning is settled by the prefixed “land;” and the sense is probably the same here. If so, the command certainly came to Abram at Ur, though most of the versions suppose that it happened at Haran.<p><span class= "bld">A land that I will shew thee.</span>—In <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/11-31.htm" title="And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came to Haran, and dwelled there.">Genesis 11:31</a> it is expressly said that the land was Canaan, but possibly this knowledge was concealed from the patriarch himself for a time, and neither he nor Terah knew on leaving Ur what their final destination would be.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/maclaren/genesis/12.htm">MacLaren's Expositions</a></div>Genesis<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">AN EXAMPLE OF FAITH<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-1.htm" title="Now the LORD had said to Abram, Get you out of your country, and from your kindred, and from your father's house, to a land that I will show you:">Genesis 12:1</a> - <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-9.htm" title="And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south.">Genesis 12:9</a></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>We stand here at the well-head of a great river-a narrow channel, across which a child can step, but which is to open out a broad bosom that will reflect the sky and refresh continents. The call of Abram is the most important event in the Old Testament, but it is also an eminent example of individual faith. For both reasons he is called ‘the Father of the Faithful.’ We look at the incident here mainly from the latter point of view. It falls into three parts.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> 1. The divine voice of command and promise.-God’s servants have to be separated from home and kindred, and all surroundings. The command to Abram was no mere arbitrary test of obedience. God could not have done what He meant with him, unless He had got him by himself. So <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-2.htm" title="Look to Abraham your father, and to Sarah that bore you: for I called him alone, and blessed him, and increased him.">Isaiah 51:2</a> put his finger on the essential when he says, ‘I called him alone.’ God’s communications are made to solitary souls, and His voice to us always summons us to forsake friends and companions, and to go apart with God. No man gets speech of God in a crowd. If you desired to fill a person with electricity, you used to put him on a stool with glass legs, to keep him from earthly contact. If the quickening impulse from the great magnet is to charge the soul, that soul must be isolated. ‘He that loveth father or mother more than Me is not worthy of Me.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The vagueness of the command is significant. Abram did not know ‘whither he went.’ He is not told that Canaan is the land, till he has reached Canaan. A true obedience is content to have orders enough for present duty. Ships are sometimes sent out with sealed instructions, to be opened when they reach latitude and longitude so-and-so. That is how we are all sent out. Our knowledge goes no farther ahead than is needful to guide our next step. If we ‘go out’ as He bids us, He will show us what to do next.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">‘I do not ask to see<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The distant scene; one step enough for me.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>Observe the promise. We may notice that it needed a soul raised above the merely temporal to care much for such promises. They would have been but thin diet for earthly appetites. ‘A great nation’; a divine blessing; to be a source of blessing to the whole world, and a touchstone by their conduct to which men would be blessed or cursed;-what was there in these to fascinate a man, unless he had faith to teach him the relative importance of the earthly and the heavenly, the present and the future? Notice that the whole promise appeals to unselfish desires. It is always, in some measure, elevating to live for a future, rather than a present, good; but if it be only the same kind of good as the present would yield, it is a poor affair. The only really ennobling faith is one which sets before itself a future full of divine blessing, and of diffusion of that blessing through us, and which therefore scorns delights, and for such gifts is content to be solitary and a wanderer.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> 2. The obedience of faith.-We have here a wonderful example of prompt, unquestioning obedience to a bare word. We do not know how the divine command was conveyed to Abram. We simply read, ‘The Lord said’; and if we contrast this with <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-7.htm" title="And the LORD appeared to Abram, and said, To your seed will I give this land: and there built he an altar to the LORD, who appeared to him.">Genesis 12:7</a>, ‘The Lord appeared . . .and said,’ it will seem probable that there was no outward sign of the divine will. The patriarch knew that he was following a divine command, and not his own purpose; but there seems to have been no appeal to sense to authenticate the inward voice. He stands, then, on a high level, setting the example of faith as unconditional acceptance of, and obedience to, God’s bare word.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Observe that faith, which is the reliance on a person, and therefore trust in his word, passes into both forms of confidence in that word as promise, and obedience to that word as command. We cannot cut faith in halves, and exercise the one aspect without the other. Some people’s faith says that it delights in God’s promises, but it does not delight in His commandments. That is no faith at all. Whoever takes God at His word, will take all His words. There is no faith without obedience; there is no obedience without faith.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> We have already said enough about the separation which was effected by Abram’s journey; but we may just notice that the departure from his father’s house was but the necessary result of the gulf between them and him, which had been opened by his faith. They were idolaters; he worshipped one God. That drove them farther apart than the distance between Sichem and Haran. When sympathy in religion was at an end, the breach of all other ties was best. So to-day, whether there be outward separation or no, depends on circumstances; but every true Christian is parted from the dearest who is not a Christian, by an abyss wider than any outward distance can make. The law for us is Abram’s law, ‘Get thee out.’ Either our faith will separate us from the world, or the world will separate us from our faith and our God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The companionship of Lot, who attaches himself to Abram, teaches that religion, in its true possessors, exercises an attractive influence over even common natures, and may win them to a loftier life. Some weak eyes may discern more glory in the sunshine tinting a poor bit of mist into ruddy light than in the beam which is too bright to look at. A faithful Abram will draw Lot after him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> ‘They went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.’ Compare this singular expression with <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/11-31.htm" title="And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came to Haran, and dwelled there.">Genesis 11:31</a>, where we have Terah’s emigration from Ur described in the same terms, with the all-important difference in the end, ‘They came’ not into Canaan, but ‘unto Haran, and dwelt there.’ Many begin the course; one finishes it. Terah’s journeying was only in search of pasture and an abode. So he dropped his wider scheme when the narrower served his purpose. It was an easy matter to go from Ur to Haran. Both were on the same bank of the Euphrates. But to cross the broad, deep, rapid river was a different thing, and meant an irrevocable cutting loose from the past life. Only the man of faith did that. There are plenty of half-and-half Christians, who go along merrily from Ur to Haran; but when they see the wide stream in front, and realise how completely the other side is separated from all that is familiar, they take another thought, and conclude they have come far enough, and Haran will serve their turn.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Again, the phrase teaches us the certain issue of patient pilgrimage and persistent purpose. There is no mystery in getting to the journey’s end. ‘One foot up, and the other foot down,’ continued long enough, will bring to the goal of the longest march. It looks a weary journey, and we wonder if we shall ever get thither. But the magic of ‘one step at a time’ does it. The guide is also the upholder of our way. ‘Every one of them appeareth before God in Zion.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> 3. The life in the land.-The first characteristic of it is its continual wandering. This is the feature which the Epistle to the Hebrews marks as significant. There was no reason but his own choice why Abram should continue to journey, and prefer to pitch his tent now under the terebinth tree of Moreh, now by Hebron, rather than to enter some of the cities of the land. He dwelt in tents because he looked for the city. The clear vision of the future detached him, as it will always detach men, from close participation in the present. It is not because we are mortal, and death is near at the furthest, that the Christian is to sit loose to this world, but because he lives by the hope of the inheritance. He must choose to be a pilgrim, and keep himself apart in feeling and aims from this present. The great lesson from the wandering life of Abram is, ‘Set your affection on things above.’ Cultivate the sense of belonging to another polity than that in the midst of which you dwell. The Canaanites christened Abram ‘The Hebrew’ {<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-13.htm" title="And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for he dwelled in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these were confederate with Abram.">Genesis 14:13</a>}, which may be translated ‘The man from the other side.’ That is the name which all true Christians should deserve. They should bear their foreign extraction in their faces, and never be naturalised subjects here. Life is wholesomer in the tent under the spreading tree, with the fresh air blowing about us and clear sky above, than in the Canaanite city.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Observe, too, that Abram’s life was permeated with worship. Wherever he pitches his tent, he builds an altar. So he fed his faith, and kept up his communion with God. The only condition on which the pilgrim life is possible, and the temptations of the world cease to draw our hearts, is that all life shall be filled with the consciousness of the divine presence, our homes altars, and ourselves joyful thankofferings. Then every abode is blessed. The undefended tent is a safe fortress, in which dwelling we need not envy those who dwell in palaces. Common tasks will then be fresh, full of interest, because we see God in them, and offer them up to Him. The wandering life will be a life of walking with God, and progressive knowledge of Him; and over all the roughnesses and the sorrows and the trivialities of it will be spread ‘the light that never was on sea or land, the consecration’ of God’s presence, and the peacefulness of communion with Him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Again, we may notice that the life of obedience was followed by fuller manifestations of God, and of His will. God ‘appeared’ when Abram was in the land. Is it not always true that obedience is blessed by closer vision and more knowledge? To him that hath shall be given; and he who has followed the unseen Guide through dimly discerned paths to an invisible goal, will be gladdened when he reaches the true Canaan, by the sight of Him whom, having not seen, he loved. Even here on earth obedience is the path to fuller knowledge; and when the pilgrims who have left all and followed the Captain of salvation through a deeper, darker stream than Abram crossed, have touched the other side, God will appear to them, and say, as the enraptured eye gazes amazed on the goodly land, ‘Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it; for I will give it unto thee.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Continue to Part II - ABRAM AND THE LIFE OF FAITH<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/genesis/12.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-1.htm" title="Now the LORD had said to Abram, Get you out of your country, and from your kindred, and from your father's house, to a land that I will show you:">Genesis 12:1</a></span>. We have here the call whereby Abram was removed from, the land of his nativity into the land of promise. This call was designed both to try his faith and obedience, and also to set him and his family apart for God, in order that the universal prevalence of idolatry might be prevented, and a remnant reserved for God, among whom his true worship might be maintained, his oracles preserved, and his ordinances established till the coming of the Messiah. God seems also, by sending him into Canaan, a country given up to the most gross, cruel, and barbarous idolatry, even the sacrificing of their own children to their idols, to have intended that he, and the other patriarchs descended from him, should be witnesses for God to these nations before their destruction; which is the plan God has generally, if not always, pursued; seldom, if ever, destroying a people for their wickedness, till he has sent his truth, in one form or another, and his witnesses among them.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Concerning the circumstances of this call, we may receive further information from Stephen’s speech, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-2.htm" title="And he said, Men, brothers, and fathers, listen; The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelled in Charran,">Acts 7:2</a>, where we are told, 1st, That the God of glory appeared to him, to give him this call, and that in such displays of his glory as left Abram no room to doubt. 2d, That this call was given him in Mesopotamia; and that, in obedience to this call, he came out of the land of the Chaldeans, and dwelt in Charran or Haran about five years: and from thence, when his father was dead, by a fresh command, he removed him into the land of Canaan. <span class="ital">Get thee out of thy country — </span>Now, by this precept, he was tried whether he <span class="ital">loved God better </span>than he loved his <span class="ital">native soil, </span>and <span class="ital">dearest friends: </span>and whether he could willingly leave all to go along with God. His country was become idolatrous, his kindred and his father’s house were a constant temptation to him, and he could not continue with them without danger of being infected by them; therefore God said, <span class="ital">Get thee out. </span>Hereby also he was tried whether he could <span class="ital">trust God </span>farther than he saw him; for he must leave his own country to go to a <span class="ital">land that God would show him; </span>he doth not say, it is a land that I will <span class="ital">give </span>thee: nor doth he tell him what land it was, or what kind of land; but he must follow God with an implicit faith, and take God’s word for it in general, that he should be no loser by leaving his country to follow God.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/12.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>12:1-3 God made choice of Abram, and singled him out from among his fellow-idolaters, that he might reserve a people for himself, among whom his true worship might be maintained till the coming of Christ. From henceforward Abram and his seed are almost the only subject of the history in the Bible. Abram was tried whether he loved God better than all, and whether he could willingly leave all to go with God. His kindred and his father's house were a constant temptation to him, he could not continue among them without danger of being infected by them. Those who leave their sins, and turn to God, will be unspeakable gainers by the change. The command God gave to Abram, is much the same with the gospel call, for natural affection must give way to Divine grace. Sin, and all the occasions of it, must be forsaken; particularly bad company. Here are many great and precious promises. All God's precepts are attended with promises to the obedient. 1. I will make of thee a great nation. When God took Abram from his own people, he promised to make him the head of another people. 2. I will bless thee. Obedient believers shall be sure to inherit the blessing. 3. I will make thy name great. The name of obedient believers shall certainly be made great. 4. Thou shalt be a blessing. Good men are the blessings of their country. 5. I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee. God will take care that none are losers, by any service done for his people. 6. In thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed. Jesus Christ is the great blessing of the world, the greatest that ever the world possessed. All the true blessedness the world is now, or ever shall be possessed of, is owing to Abram and his posterity. Through them we have a Bible, a Saviour, and a gospel. They are the stock on which the Christian church is grafted.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/genesis/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div> - The Call of Abram<p>6. &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1501;  shekem Shekem, "the upper part of the back."

It is no part of the design of Scripture to trace the development of worldliness. It marks its source, and indicates the law of its downward tendency; but then it turns away from the dark detail, to devote its attention to the way by which light from heaven may again pierce the gloom of the fallen heart. Here, then, we have the starting of a new spring of spiritual life in the human race.<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/12-1.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a><p>Having brought the affairs of Terah's family to a fit resting point, the sacred writer now reverts to the call of Abram. This, we have seen, took place when he was seventy years of age, and therefore five years before the death of Terah. "The Lord said unto Abram." Four hundred and twenty-two years on the lowest calculation after the last recorded communication with Noah, the Lord again opens his mouth, to Abram. Noah, Shem, or Heber, must have been in communication with heaven, indeed, at the time of the confusion of tongues, and hence, we have an account of that miraculous interposition. The call of Abram consists of a command and a promise. The command is to leave the place of all his old and fond associations, for a land which he had not yet seen, and therefore did not know. Three ties are to be severed in complying with this command - his country, in the widest range of his affections; his place of birth and kindred comes closer to his heart; his father's house is the inmost circle of all his tender emotions. All these are to be resigned; not, however, without reason. The reason may not be entirely obvious to the mind of Abram. But he has entire faith in the reasonableness of what God proposes. So with reason and faith he is willing to go to the unknown land. It is enough that God will show him the land to which he is now sent.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/genesis/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 12<p>Ge 12:1-20.

In Ur of the Chaldees, before he came and dwelt in Charran, as seems from <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-2.htm">Acts 7:2</a> and so Aben Ezra interprets it; but Jarchi and others think, that what follows was said to him in Haran, and so the words may be more literally rendered (u), "and the Lord said unto Abram"; after the death of Terah, who died in Haran; and indeed it is highly probable there were two appearances of God to Abram, and that the same words, or very near the same, were spoken to him at two several times, first in Ur of the Chaldees, and then in Haran: <p>get thee out of thy country; the land of Chaldea, and the city of Ur, which was in it, or out of Mesopotamia, in which, when taken in a large sense, were both Ur and Haran; and this country was now become idolatrous, for though it was first inhabited and peopled by the posterity of Shem in the time of Arphaxad, yet these, in process of time, degenerated from the true religion, and fell into idolatry. The same Maimonides (w) calls Zabaeans, in whose faith and religion, he says, Abram was brought up, and who asserted there was no other God but the sun, moon, and stars; and these Zabaeans, as he relates from their books and annals, say of Abram themselves, that he was educated in Cuthia, and dissented from the common people; and asserted, that besides the sun, there was another Creator; to whom they objected, and so disputes arose among them on this subject: now Abram being convinced of idolatry, is called out from those people, and to have no fellowship with them; it is literally in the Hebrew text (x), "go to thee out of thy country"; for thy profit and good, as Jarchi interprets it; as it must be to quit all society with such an idolatrous and superstitious people: <p>and from thy kindred; as Nahor his brother, and his family, who are not mentioned, and seem to be left behind when Terah, Abram, Lot, and Sarai, came out of Ur of the Chaldees; though it looks as if afterwards Nahor did follow them to Haran or Padanaram, which are the same, and where he continued, and therefore is called his city; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-10.htm">Genesis 24:10</a> so with great propriety Abram might be called a second time to leave his kindred as well as his country; and certain it is, Haran, or Padanaram, as well as Ur of the Chaldees, is called by himself his country, and Nahor and his family his kindred, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-4.htm">Genesis 24:4</a>. <p>and from thy father's house; or household, his family, which better agrees with the second call at Haran, than with the first at Ur; for, upon the first call, Terah and his family came along with Abram, and therefore this phrase is omitted by Stephen, who speaks of that call, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-3.htm">Acts 7:3</a> but Terah dying at Haran, his house or family went no further, but continued there with Nahor; only Abram and Lot, upon this second call, went from thence, as the following history makes it appear; and so Abram left, as he was bid, his father's house and family to go, as it follows: <p>unto a land that I will show thee; meaning the land of Canaan, though not mentioned, and seems to be omitted for the trial of Abram's faith; hence the author of the epistle to the Hebrews, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-8.htm">Hebrews 11:8</a> observes, that "he obeyed and went out, not knowing whither he went"; and yet it is said, that, when he and Terah came out of Ur of the Chaldees, "they went forth to go into the land of Canaan", <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/11-31.htm">Genesis 11:31</a> and, when he and Lot went first from Haran, the same is said of them, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-5.htm">Genesis 12:5</a> it is probable the case was this; there was no mention made at first what land he was to go to, and when he prepared for his journey he knew not where he was to go, but afterwards it was revealed to him that Canaan was the land, and therefore set out in order to go thither; and still, though he might know the place by name where he was to go, he might neither know the way to it, nor what sort of country it was for quality or quantity; and therefore God promises to show him the way, and direct his course right unto it, and give him a view of it, that he might see what sort of a country, and how large it was, that he would give to his posterity. This call of Abram is an emblem of the call of men by the grace of God out of the world, and from among the men of it, and to renounce the things of it, and not be conformed unto it, and to forget their own people and their father's house, and to cleave to the Lord, and follow him whithersoever he directs them. <p>(u) "et dixit", Pagninus, Montanus, Cocceius.

The threefold tie of land, people, and home, is to be severed. Abram is to lay the foundations of the Chosen People independently of any obligation or favour due to local environment or personal association. He is to rely only on his God.

Distinguished as a man of undoubted superiority both of character and mind, the head of at least two powerful and important races, and standing, as one might say, on the threshold of the historical era, it is yet chiefly as his life and fortunes connect with the Divine purpose of salvation that they find a place in the inspired record. The progress of infidelity during the four centuries that had elapsed since the Flood, the almost universal corruption of even the Shemits portion of the human family, had conclusively demonstrated the necessity of a second Divine interposition, if the knowledge of salvation were not to be completely banished from the earth. Accordingly, the son of Terah was selected to be the founder of a new nation, in which the light of gospel truth might be deposited for preservation until the fullness of the times, and through which the promise of the gospel might he conducted forward to its ultimate realization in the manifestation of the woman's seed. Partly to prepare him for the high destiny of being the progenitor of the chosen nation, and partly to illustrate the character of that gospel with which he was to be entrusted, he was summoned to renounce his native country and kinsmen in Chaldaea, and venture forth upon an untried journey in obedience to the call of Heaven, to a land which he should afterward receive for an inheritance. In a series of successive theophanies or Divine manifestations, around which the various incidents of his life are grouped - in Ur of the Chaldees (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-2.htm">Acts 7:2</a>), at Moreh in Canaan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>), near Bethel (<span class="accented">ibid</span>. 13.), at Mature (ibid. 15, 17.), and on Moriah (ibid. 22.) - he is distinctly promised three things - a land, a seed, and a blessing  - as the reward of his compliance with the heavenly invitation; and the confident persuasion both of the reality of these gracious promises and of the Divine ability and willingness to fulfill them forms the animating spirit and guiding principle of his being in every situation of life, whether of trial or of difficulty, in which he is subsequently placed. The miraculous character of these theophanies indeed has been made a ground on which to assail the entire patriarchal history as unhistorical. By certain writers they have been represented as nothing more than natural occurrences embellished by the genius of the author of Genesis (Eichhorn, Bauer, Winer), as belonging to the domain of poetical fiction (De Wette), and therefore as undeserving of anything like serious consideration. But unless the supernatural is <span class="accented">to be in toto</span> eliminated from the record, a concession which cannot possibly be granted by an enlightened theism, the Divine appearances to Abraham cannot be regarded as in any degree militating against the historical veracity of the story of his life, which, it may be said, is amply vouched for by the harmony of its details with the characteristics of the period to which it belongs (cf. Havernick's 'Introduction,' &sect; 18). Nor does the employment of the name Jehovah in connection with these theophanies warrant the conclusion that the passages containing them are interpolations of a post Mosaic or Jehovistic editor (Tuch, Bleek, Colenso, Davidson). "Such a hypothesis," says Keil, "can only be maintained by those who' misunderstand the distinctive meaning of the two names, Elohim and Jehovah (q.v. on Genesis 2:4), and arbitrarily set aside the Jehovah in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-1.htm">Genesis 17:1</a>, on account of an erroneous determination of the relation in which El Shaddai stands to Jehovah." Indications of the literary unity of the patriarchal history will be noted, and replies to objections given, in the progress of the Exposition. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now the Lord.</span> Jehovah   =   the God of salvation, an indication that the narrative is now to specially concern itself with the chosen seed, and the Deity to discover himself as the God of redemption. The hypothesis that vers. 1-4 were inserted in the fundamental document by the Jehovist editor is not required for a satisfactory explanation of the change of the Divine name at this particular stage of the narrative. <span class="cmt_word">Had said</span>. Literally, said. In Ur of the Chaldees, according to Stephen (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-2.htm">Acts 7:2</a>), reverting, after the usual manner of the writer, to the original point of departure in the Abrahamic history (Aben Ezra, Mede, Piscator, Pererius, Calvin, Willet, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Dathins, Alford, Murphy, 'Speaker's Commentary'); or in Haran, after Terah's death, as the first call given to the patriarch (LXX., Chaldee, Syriac, Raschi, Lyra, Keil, Kalisch, Dykes), or as a repetition of the call addressed to him in Ur (Clarke, Wordsworth, Inglis). Luther conjectures that the call in Ur was given "<span class="accented">fortasse per patti</span>. <span class="accented">archam Shem</span>;" but if the authority of Stephen be recognized, this was the occasion of the first theophany vouchsafed to Abram. <span class="cmt_word">Get thee out.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">go for thyself</span>, a frequent Hebraism, expressive of the way in which the action of the verb returns upon itself, is terminated and completed (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/21-16.htm">Genesis 21:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-2.htm">Genesis 22:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/31-8.htm">Isaiah 31:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/2-11.htm">Song of Solomon 2:11</a>; <span class="accented">vide</span> Ewald's 'Hebrew Syntax,' &sect; 314); hence, though not necessarily emphatic, it may be equivalent to "Go thou," whoever else remains behind (Jarchi, Ainsworth, Bush). <span class="cmt_word">Of thy country</span>. A proof that the date of the call was while Abram was in Ur (Calvin), though if Ur was at Edessa (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>) the patriarch could scarcely have been said to be from home. <span class="cmt_word">And from thy kindred.</span> At Ur in all probability Nahor and Milcah were left behind; at Haran, Nahor and his family, if they had already arrived thither, and according to some (Kalisch, Dykes) Terah also. <span class="cmt_word">And from thy father's house.</span> <span class="accented">I.e.</span> if they will not accompany thee.

The land itself is left unnamed for the trial of the patriarch's faith, which, if it sustained the proof, was to be rewarded by the exceeding great and precious promises which follow:  - according to one arrangement, seven in number, one for each clause of the next two verses (Cajetan, Willet); according to another, four, corresponding to the clauses of the second verse, the last of which is expanded in the third (Keil); according to a third, six, forming three pairs of parallels (Alford); according to a fourth, and perhaps the best, two, a lower or personal blessing, comprising the first three particulars, and a higher or public blessing, embracing the last three (Murphy). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/genesis/11.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The genealogical data in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/11-27.htm">Genesis 11:27-32</a> prepare the way for the history of the patriarchs. The heading, "These are the generations of Terah," belongs not merely to <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/11-27.htm">Genesis 11:27-32</a>, but to the whole of the following account of Abram, since it corresponds to "the generations" of Ishmael and of Isaac in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-12.htm">Genesis 25:12</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-19.htm">Genesis 25:19</a>. Of the three sons of Terah, who are mentioned again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/11-27.htm">Genesis 11:27</a> to complete the plan of the different Toledoth, such genealogical notices are given as are of importance to the history of Abram and his family. According to the regular plan of Genesis, the fact that Haran the youngest son of Terah begat Lot, is mentioned first of all, because the latter went with Abram to Canaan; and then the fact that he died before his father Terah, because the link which would have connected Lot with his native land was broken in consequence. "Before his father," &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1506;&#1500; lit., upon the face of his father, so that he saw and survived his death. Ur of the Chaldees is to be sought either in the "Ur nomine persicum castellum" of Ammian (25, 8), between Hatra and Nisibis, near Arrapachitis, or in Orhoi, Armenian Urrhai, the old name for Edessa, the modern Urfa. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/11-29.htm">Genesis 11:29</a>. Abram and Nahor took wives from their kindred. Abram married Sarai, his half-sister (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/20-12.htm">Genesis 20:12</a>), of whom it is already related, in anticipation of what follows, that she was barren. Nahor married Milcah, the daughter of his brother Haran, who bore to him Bethuel, the father of Rebekah (<a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/22-22.htm">Genesis 22:22-23</a>). The reason why Iscah is mentioned is doubtful. For the rabbinical notion, that Iscah is another name for Sarai, is irreconcilable with <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/20-12.htm">Genesis 20:12</a>, where Abram calls Sarai his sister, daughter of his father, though not of his mother; on the other hand, the circumstance that Sarai is introduced in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/11-31.htm">Genesis 11:31</a> merely as the daughter-in-law of Terah, may be explained on the ground that she left Ur, not as his daughter, but as the wife of his son Abram. A better hypothesis is that of Ewald, that Iscah is mentioned because she was the wife of Lot; but this is pure conjecture. According to <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/11-31.htm">Genesis 11:31</a>, Terah already prepared to leave Ur of the Chaldees with Abram and Lot, and to remove to Canaan. In the phrase "they went forth with them," the subject cannot be the unmentioned members of the family, such as Nahor and his children; though Nahor must also have gone to Haran, since it is called in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-10.htm">Genesis 24:10</a> the city of Nahor. For if he accompanied them at this time, there is no perceptible reason why he should not have been mentioned along with the rest. The nominative to the verb must be Lot and Sarai, who went with Terah and Abram; so that although Terah is placed at the head, Abram must have taken an active part in the removal, or the resolution to remove. This does not, however, necessitate the conclusion, that he had already been called by God in Ur. Nor does <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-7.htm">Genesis 15:7</a> require any such assumption. For it is not stated there that God called Abram in Ur, but only that He brought him out. But the simple fact of removing from Ur might also be called a leading out, as a work of divine superintendence and guidance, without a special call from God. It was in Haran that Abram first received the divine call to go to Canaan (<a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/12-1.htm">Genesis 12:1-4</a>), when he left not only his country and kindred, but also his father's house. Terah did not carry out his intention to proceed to Canaan, but remained in Haran, in his native country Mesopotamia, probably because he found there what he was going to look for in the land of Canaan. Haran, more properly Charan, &#1495;&#1512;&#1503;, is a place in north-western Mesopotamia, the ruins of which may still be seen, a full day's journey to the south of Edessa (Gr. &#x39a;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, Lat. Carrae), where Crassus fell when defeated by the Parthians. It was a leading settlement of the Ssabians, who had a temple there dedicated to the moon, which they traced back to Abraham. There Terah died at the age of 205, or sixty years after the departure of Abram for Canaan; for, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/11-26.htm">Genesis 11:26</a>, Terah was seventy years old when Abram was born, and Abram was seventy-five years old when he arrived in Canaan. When Stephen, therefore, placed the removal of Abram from Haran to Canaan after the death of his father, he merely inferred this from the fact, that the call of Abram (<a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12</a>) was not mentioned till after the death of Terah had been noticed, taking the order of the narrative as the order of events; whereas, according to the plan of Genesis, the death of Terah is introduced here, because Abram never met with his father again after leaving Haran, and there was consequently nothing more to be related concerning him.<p>Character of the Patriarchal History<p>The dispersion of the descendants of the sons of Noah, who had now grown into numerous families, was necessarily followed on the one hand by the rise of a variety of nations, differing in language, manners, and customs, and more and more estranged from one another; and on the other by the expansion of the germs of idolatry, contained in the different attitudes of these nations towards God, into the polytheistic religions of heathenism, in which the glory of the immortal God was changed into an image made like to mortal man, and to birds, and four-footed beasts, and creeping things (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-23.htm">Romans 1:23</a> cf. Wis. 13-15). If God therefore would fulfil His promise, no more to smite the earth with the curse of the destruction of every living thing because of the sin of man (<a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/8-21.htm">Genesis 8:21-22</a>), and yet would prevent the moral corruption which worketh death from sweeping all before it; it was necessary that by the side of these self-formed nations He should form a nation for Himself, to be the recipient and preserver of His salvation, and that in opposition to the rising kingdoms of the world He should establish a kingdom for the living, saving fellowship of man with Himself. The foundation for this was laid by God in the call and separation of Abram from his people and his country, to make him, by special guidance, the father of a nation from which the salvation of the world should come. With the choice of Abram and revelation of God to man assumed a select character, inasmuch as God manifested Himself henceforth to Abram and his posterity alone as the author of salvation and the guide to true life; whilst other nations were left to follow their own course according to the powers conferred upon them, in order that they might learn that in their way, and without fellowship with the living God, it was impossible to find peace to the soul, and the true blessedness of life (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-27.htm">Acts 17:27</a>). But this exclusiveness contained from the very first the germ of universalism. Abram was called, that through him all the families of the earth might be blessed (<a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/12-1.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a>). Hence the new form which the divine guidance of the human race assumed in the call of Abram was connected with the general development of the world, - in the one hand, by the fact that Abram belonged to the family of Shem, which Jehovah had blessed, and on the other, by his not being called alone, but as a married man with his wife. But whilst, regarded in this light, the continuity of the divine revelation was guaranteed, as well as the plan of human development established in the creation itself, the call of Abram introduced so far the commencement of a new period, that to carry out the designs of God their very foundations required to be renewed. Although, for example, the knowledge and worship of the true God had been preserved in the families of Shem in a purer form than among the remaining descendants of Noah, even in the house of Terah and worship of God was corrupted by idolatry (<a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/24-2.htm">Joshua 24:2-3</a>); and although Abram was to become the father of the nation which God was about to form, yet his wife was barren, and therefore, in the way of nature, a new family could not be expected to spring from him.<p>As a perfectly new beginning, therefore, the patriarchal history assumed the form of a family history, in which the grace of God prepared the ground for the coming Israel. For the nation was to grow out of the family, and in the lives of the patriarchs its character was to be determined and its development foreshadowed. The early history consists of three stages, which are indicated by the three patriarchs, peculiarly so called, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; and in the sons of Jacob the unity of the chosen family was expanded into the twelve immediate fathers of the nation. In the triple number of the patriarchs, the divine election of the nation on the one hand, and the entire formation of the character and guidance of the life of Israel on the other, were to attain to their fullest typical manifestation. These two were the pivots, upon which all the divine revelations made to the patriarchs, and all the guidance they received, were made to turn. The revelations consisted almost exclusively of promises; and so far as these promises were fulfilled in the lives of the patriarchs, the fulfilments themselves were predictions and pledges of the ultimate and complete fulfilment, reserved for a distant, or for the most remote futurity. And the guidance vouchsafed had for its object the calling forth of faith in response to the promise, which should maintain itself amidst all the changes of this earthly life. "A faith, which laid hold of the word of promise, and on the strength of that word gave up the visible and present for the invisible and future, was the fundamental characteristic of the patriarchs" (Delitzsch). This faith Abram manifested and sustained by great sacrifices, by enduring patience, and by self-denying by great sacrifices, by enduring patience, and by self-denying obedience of such a kind, that he thereby became the father of believers (&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3c1; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-11.htm">Romans 4:11</a>). Isaac also was strong in patience and hope; and Jacob wrestled in faith amidst painful circumstances of various kinds, until he had secured the blessing of the promise. "Abraham was a man of faith that works; Isaac, of faith that endures; Jacob, of faith that wrestles" (Baumgarten). - Thus, walking in faith, the patriarchs were types of faith for all the families that should spring from them, and be blessed through them, and ancestors of a nation which God had resolved to form according to the election of His grace. For the election of God was not restricted to the separation of Abram from the family of Shem, to be the father of the nation which was destined to be the vehicle of salvation; it was also manifest in the exclusion of Ishmael, whom Abram had begotten by the will of man, through Hagar the handmaid of his wife, for the purpose of securing the promised seed, and in the new life imparted to the womb of the barren Sarai, and her consequent conception and birth of Isaac, the son of promise. And lastly, it appeared still more manifestly in the twin sons born by Rebekah to Isaac, of whom the first-born, Esau, was rejected, and the younger, Jacob, chosen to be the heir of the promise; and this choice, which was announced before their birth, was maintained in spite of Isaac's plans, or that Jacob, and not Esau, received the blessing of the promise. - All this occurred as a type for the future, that Israel might know and lay to heart the fact, that bodily descent from Abraham did not make a man a child of God, but that they alone were children of God who laid hold of the divine promise in faith, and walked in the steps of their forefather's faith (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/9-6.htm">Romans 9:6-13</a>).<p>If we fix our eyes upon the method of the divine revelation, we find a new beginning in this respect, that as soon as Abram is called, we read of the appearing of God. It is true that from the very beginning God had manifested Himself visibly to men; but in the olden time we read nothing of appearances, because before the flood God had not withdrawn His presence from the earth. Even to Noah He revealed Himself before the flood as one who was present on the earth. But when He had established a covenant with him after the flood, and thereby had assured the continuance of the earth and of the human race, the direct manifestations ceased, for God withdrew His visible presence from the world; so that it was from heaven that the judgment fell upon the tower of Babel, and even the call to Abram in his home in Haran was issued through His word, that is to say, no doubt, through an inward monition. But as soon as Abram had gone to Canaan, in obedience to the call of God, Jehovah appeared to him there (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>). These appearances, which were constantly repeated from that time forward, must have taken place from heaven; for we read that Jehovah, after speaking with Abram and the other patriarchs, "went away" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-33.htm">Genesis 18:33</a>), or "went up" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-22.htm">Genesis 17:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-13.htm">Genesis 35:13</a>); and the patriarchs saw them, sometimes while in a waking condition, in a form discernible to the bodily senses, sometimes in visions, in a state of mental ecstasy, and at other times in the form of a dream (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-12.htm">Genesis 28:12</a>.). On the form in which God appeared, in most instances, nothing is related. But in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-1.htm">Genesis 18:1</a>. it is stated that three men came to Abram, one of whom is introduced as Jehovah, whilst the other two are called angels (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-1.htm">Genesis 19:1</a>). Beside this, we frequently read of appearances of the "angel of Jehovah" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/16-7.htm">Genesis 16:7</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/22-11.htm">Genesis 22:11</a>, etc.), or of "Elohim," and the "angel of Elohim" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/21-17.htm">Genesis 21:17</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/31-11.htm">Genesis 31:11</a>, etc.), which were repeated throughout the whole of the Old Testament, and even occurred, though only in vision, in the case of the prophet Zechariah. The appearances of the angel of Jehovah (or Elohim) cannot have been essentially different from those of Jehovah (or Elohim) Himself; for Jacob describes the appearances of Jehovah at Bethel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-13.htm">Genesis 28:13</a>.) as an appearance of "the angel of Elohim," and of "the God of Bethel" (<a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/31-11.htm">Genesis 31:11</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-13.htm">Genesis 31:13</a>); and in his blessing on the sons of Joseph (<a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/48-15.htm">Genesis 48:15-16</a>), "The God (Elohim) before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God (Elohim) which fed me all my life long unto this day, the angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads," he places the angel of God on a perfect equality with God, not only regarding Him as the Being to whom he has been indebted for protection all his life long, but entreating from Him a blessing upon his descendants.<p>The question arises, therefore, whether the angel of Jehovah, or of God, was God Himself in one particular phase of His self-manifestation, or a created angel of whom God made use as the organ of His self-revelation.<p>(Note: In the old Jewish synagogue the Angel of Jehovah was regarded as the Shechinah, the indwelling of God in the world, i.e., the only Mediator between God and the world, who bears in the Jewish theology the name Metatron. The early Church regarded Him as the Logos, the second person of the Deity; and only a few of the fathers, such as Augustine and Jerome, thought of a created angel (vid., Hengstenberg, Christol. vol. 3, app.). This view was adopted by many Romish theologians, by the Socinians, Arminians, and others, and has been defended recently by Hoffmann, whom Delitzsch, Kurtz, and others follow. But the opinion of the early Church has been vindicated most thoroughly by Hengstenberg in his Christology.)<p>The former appears to us to be the only scriptural view. For the essential unity of the Angel of Jehovah with Jehovah Himself follows indisputably from the following facts. In the first place, the Angel of God identifies Himself with Jehovah and Elohim, by attributing to Himself divine attributes and performing divine works: e.g., <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/22-12.htm">Genesis 22:12</a>, "Now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son, from me" (i.e., hast been willing to offer him up as a burnt sacrifice to God); again (to Hagar) <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/16-10.htm">Genesis 16:10</a>, "I will multiply thy seed exceedingly, that it shall not be numbered for multitude;" <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/21.htm">Genesis 21</a>, "I will make him a great nation,"-the very words used by Elohim in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-20.htm">Genesis 17:20</a> with reference to Ishmael, and by Jehovah in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/13-16.htm">Genesis 13:16</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/15-4.htm">Genesis 15:4-5</a>, with regard to Isaac; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-6.htm">Exodus 3:6</a>., "I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob: I have surely seen the affliction of My people which are in Egypt, and have heard their cry, and I am come down to deliver them" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-1.htm">Judges 2:1</a>). In addition to this, He performs miracles, consuming with fire the offering placed before Him by Gideon, and the sacrifice prepared by Manoah, and ascending to haven in the flame of the burnt-offering (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-21.htm">Judges 6:21</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/13-19.htm">Judges 13:19-20</a>).<p>Secondly, the Angel of God was recognised as God by those to whom He appeared, on the one hand by their addressing Him as Adonai (i.e., the Lord God; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-15.htm">Judges 6:15</a>), declaring that they had seen God, and fearing that they should die (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/16-13.htm">Genesis 16:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-6.htm">Exodus 3:6</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/6-22.htm">Judges 6:22-23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-22.htm">Judges 13:22</a>), and on the other hand by their paying Him divine honour, offering sacrifices which He accepted, and worshipping Him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-20.htm">Judges 6:20</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/13-19.htm">Judges 13:19-20</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-5.htm">Genesis 2:5</a>). The force of these facts has been met by the assertion, that the ambassador perfectly represents the person of the sender; and evidence of this is adduced not only from Grecian literature, but from the Old Testament also, where the addresses of the prophets often glide imperceptibly into the words of Jehovah, whose instrument they are. But even if the address in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/22-16.htm">Genesis 22:16</a>, where the oath of the Angel of Jehovah is accompanied by the words, "saith the Lord," and the words and deeds of the Angel of God in certain other cases, might be explained in this way, a created angel sent by God could never say, "I am the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob," or by the acceptance of sacrifices and adoration, encourage the presentation of divine honours to himself. How utterly irreconcilable this fact is with the opinion that the Angel of Jehovah was a created angel, is conclusively proved by <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/22-9.htm">Revelation 22:9</a>, which is generally regarded as perfectly corresponding to the account of the "Angel of Jehovah" of the Old Testament. The angel of God, who shows the sacred seer the heavenly Jerusalem, and who is supposed to say, "Behold, I come quickly" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-7.htm">Revelation 22:7</a>), and "I am Alpha and Omega" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-13.htm">Revelation 22:13</a>), refuses in the most decided way the worship which John is about to present, and exclaims, "See I am thy fellow-servant: worship God."<p>Thirdly, the Angel of Jehovah is also identified with Jehovah by the sacred writers themselves, who call the Angel Jehovah without the least reserve (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-2.htm">Exodus 3:2</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/3-4.htm">Exodus 3:4</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-12.htm">Judges 6:12</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/6-14.htm">Judges 6:14-16</a>, but especially <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/14-19.htm">Exodus 14:19</a>, where the Angel of Jehovah goes before the host of the Israelites, just as Jehovah is said to do in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21</a>). - On the other hand, the objection is raised, that &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; in the New Testament, which is confessedly the Greek rendering of &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; &#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1498;, is always a created angel, and for that reason cannot be the uncreated Logos or Son of God, since the latter could not possibly have announced His own birth to the shepherds at Bethlehem. But this important difference has been overlooked, that according to Greek usage, &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; denotes an (any) angel of the Lord, whereas according to the rules of the Hebrew language &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; &#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1498; means the angel of the Lord; that in the New Testament the angel who appears is always described as &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; without the article, and the definite article is only introduced in the further course of the narrative to denote the angel whose appearance has been already mentioned, whereas in the Old Testament it is always "the Angel of Jehovah" who appears, and whenever the appearance of a created angel is referred to, he is introduced first of all as "an angel" (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-5.htm">1 Kings 19:5</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-7.htm">1 Kings 19:7</a>).<p>(Note: The force of this difference cannot be set aside by the objection that the New Testament writers follow the usage of the Septuagint, where &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; &#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1498; is rendered &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;. For neither in the New Testament nor in the Alex. version of the Old is &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; used as a proper name; it is a simple appellative, as is apparent from the fact that in every instance, in which further reference is made to an angel who has appeared, he is called &#x3bf;&#787; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, with or without &#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;. All that the Septuagint rendering proves, is that the translators supposed "the angel of the Lord" to be a created angel; but it by no means follows that their supposition is correct.)<p>At the same time, it does not follow from this use of the expression Maleach Jehovah, that the (particular) angel of Jehovah was essentially one with God, or that Maleach Jehovah always has the same signification; for in <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/2-7.htm">Malachi 2:7</a> the priest is called Maleach Jehovah, i.e., the messenger of the Lord. Who the messenger or angel of Jehovah was, must be determined in each particular instance from the connection of the passage; and where the context furnishes no criterion, it must remain undecided. Consequently such passages as <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-7.htm">Psalm 34:7</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/35-5.htm">Psalm 35:5-6</a>, etc., where the angel of Jehovah is not more particularly described, or <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/20-16.htm">Numbers 20:16</a>, where the general term angel is intentionally employed, or <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-30.htm">Acts 7:30</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/3-19.htm">Galatians 3:19</a>, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-2.htm">Hebrews 2:2</a>, where the words are general and indefinite, furnish no evidence that the Angel of Jehovah, who proclaimed Himself in His appearances as one with God, was not in reality equal with God, unless we are to adopt as the rule for interpreting Scripture the inverted principle, that clear and definite statements are to be explained by those that are indefinite and obscure.<p>In attempting now to determine the connection between the appearance of the Angel of Jehovah (or Elohim) and the appearance of Jehovah or Elohim Himself, and to fix the precise meaning of the expression Maleach Jehovah, we cannot make use, as recent opponents of the old Church view have done, of the manifestation of God in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/18.htm">Genesis 18</a> and 19, and the allusion to the great prince Michael in <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/10-13.htm">Daniel 10:13</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-21.htm">Daniel 10:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/12-1.htm">Daniel 12:1</a>; just because neither the appearance of Jehovah in the former instance, nor that of the archangel Michael in the latter, is represented as an appearance of the Angel of Jehovah. We must confine ourselves to the passages in which "the Angel of Jehovah" is actually referred to. We will examine these, first of all, for the purpose of obtaining a clear conception of the form in which the Angel of Jehovah appeared. <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/16.htm">Genesis 16</a>, where He is mentioned for the first time, contains no distinct statement as to His shape, but produces on the whole the impression that He appeared to Hagar in a human form, or one resembling that of man; since it was not till after His departure that she drew the inference from His words, that Jehovah had spoken with her. He came in the same form to Gideon, and sat under the terebinth at Ophrah with a staff in His hand (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-11.htm">Judges 6:11</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-21.htm">Judges 6:21</a>); also to Manoah's wife, for she took Him to be a man of God, i.e., a prophet, whose appearance was like that of the Angel of Jehovah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-6.htm">Judges 13:6</a>); and lastly, to Manoah himself, who did not recognise Him at first, but discovered afterwards, from the miracle which He wrought before his eyes, and from His miraculous ascent in the flame of the altar, that He was the Angel of Jehovah (<a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/13-9.htm">Judges 13:9-20</a>). In other cases He revealed Himself merely by calling and speaking from heaven, without those who heard His voice perceiving any form at all; e.g., to Hagar, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/21-17.htm">Genesis 21:17</a>., and to Abraham, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-11.htm">Genesis 22:11</a>. On the other hand, He appeared to Moses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-2.htm">Exodus 3:2</a>) in a flame of fire, speaking to him from the burning bush, and to the people of Israel in a pillar of cloud and fire (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/14-19.htm">Exodus 14:19</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21</a>.), without any angelic form being visible in either case. Balaam He met in a human or angelic form, with a drawn sword in His hand (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/22-22.htm">Numbers 22:22-23</a>). David saw Him by the threshing-floor of Araunah, standing between heaven and earth, with the sword drawn in His hand and stretched out over Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-16.htm">1 Chronicles 21:16</a>); and He appeared to Zechariah in a vision as a rider upon a red horse (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-9.htm">Zechariah 1:9</a>.). - From these varying forms of appearance it is evident that the opinion that the Angel of the Lord was a real angel, a divine manifestation, "not in the disguise of angel, but through the actual appearance of an angel," is not in harmony with all the statements of the Bible. The form of the Angel of Jehovah, which was discernible by the senses, varied according to the purpose of the appearance; and, apart from <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/21-17.htm">Genesis 21:17</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/22-11.htm">Genesis 22:11</a>, we have a sufficient proof that it was not a real angelic appearance, or the appearance of a created angel, in the fact that in two instances it was not really an angel at all, but a flame of fire and a shining cloud which formed the earthly substratum of the revelation of God in the Angel of Jehovah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-2.htm">Exodus 3:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-19.htm">Exodus 14:19</a>), unless indeed we are to regard natural phenomena as angels, without any scriptural warrant for doing so.<p>(Note: The only passage that could be adduced in support of this, viz., <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/104-4.htm">Psalm 104:4</a>, does not prove that God makes natural objects, winds and flaming fire, into forms in which heavenly spirits appear, or that He creates spirits out of them. Even if we render this passage, with Delitzsch, "making His messengers of winds, His servants of flaming fire," the allusion, as Delitzsch himself observes, is not to the creation of angels; nor can the meaning be, that God gives wind and fire to His angels as the material of their appearance, and as it were of their self-incorporation. For &#1506;&#1492;, constructed with two accusatives, the second of which expresses the materia ex qua, is never met with in this sense, not even in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/4-18.htm">2 Chronicles 4:18-22</a>. For the greater part of the temple furniture summed up in this passage, of which it is stated that Solomon made them of gold, was composed of pure gold; and if some of the things were merely covered with gold, the writer might easily apply the same expression to this, because he had already given a more minute account of their construction (e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-7.htm">Genesis 3:7</a>). But we neither regard this rendering of the psalm as in harmony with the context, nor assent to the assertion that &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; with a double accusative, in the sense of making into anything, is ungrammatical.)<</body></html>
