As the name is thus taken from the natural conformation of the ground, it may be very ancient. The modern name of the place is Nablous, a contraction of Flavia Neapolis, a title given it in honour of Vespasian. Mr. Conder ( <span class= "ital">Tent Work in Palestine, </span>1:61) describes the valley as an oasis of remarkable beauty and luxuriance, but set, like Damascus, in a desert, and girt around by strong and barren mountains.<p><span class= "bld">The plain of Moreh.</span>—Heb., <span class= "ital">the oak of Moreh, </span>It was here that Jacob buried the strange gods brought by his household from Haran (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-4.htm" title="And they gave to Jacob all the strange gods which were in their hand, and all their earrings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem.">Genesis 35:4</a>)<span class= "ital">, </span>and here, too, Joshua set up the stone of testimony (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/24-26.htm" title="And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God, and took a great stone, and set it up there under an oak, that was by the sanctuary of the LORD.">Joshua 24:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-6.htm" title="And all the men of Shechem gathered together, and all the house of Millo, and went, and made Abimelech king, by the plain of the pillar that was in Shechem.">Judges 9:6</a>); but as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-30.htm" title="Are they not on the other side Jordan, by the way where the sun goes down, in the land of the Canaanites, which dwell in the desert over against Gilgal, beside the plains of Moreh?">Deuteronomy 11:30</a> the oaks (wrongly translated in most places in our version “plains”) are described in the plural, it is probable that the word is to be taken as a collective for an oak grove. Such shady spots were favourite places for the tents of the wandering patriarchs. A famous terebinth, called after Abram’s name, long existed at Mamre, and under it, in the time of Vespasian, the captive Jews were sold for slaves. It disappeared about A.D. 330, and no tree now marks the site of Abram’s grove. The Hebrew word, however, for terebinth is <span class= "ital">elâh, </span>while that used here is <span class= "ital">êlôn. </span>It was probably the <span class= "ital">quercus pseudococcifera </span>(see Tristram, <span class= "ital">Nat.

Probably in this cool grove some religious personage had given instruction to the people. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/7-1.htm" title="Then Jerubbaal, who is Gideon, and all the people that were with him, rose up early, and pitched beside the well of Harod: so that the host of the Midianites were on the north side of them, by the hill of Moreh, in the valley.">Judges 7:1</a> we find a place called the “teacher’s hill,” and it is thus possible that among a people so religious as the race of Shem, men from time to time arose revered by the people as teachers of holiness. Such an one was Melchisedech.<p><span class= "bld">The Canaanite was then in the land.</span>—This is no sign of post-Mosaic authorship, nor a later interpolation, as if the meaning were that the Canaanite was there at that time, but is so no longer. What really is meant is that Abram on his arrival found the country no longer in the hands of the old Semitic stock, but occupied by the Canaanites, who seem to have gained the ascendancy, not so much by conquest as by gradual and peaceful means. We gather from the Egyptian records that this had taken place not very long before Abram’s time. In the early inscriptions we read only of the Sati and Aamu, both apparently Semitic races, the latter name being derived from the Heb. <span class= "ital">am, </span>“people.” Subsequently we find frequent mention of the Amaor and the Kheta—that is, the Amorites and Hittites, evidently in Abram’s time the two most powerful races of Canaan.

He journeyed, going on still. Sometimes it is the lot of good men to be unsettled, and often to remove into various states. Believers must look on themselves as strangers and sojourners in this world, Heb 11:8,13,14. But observe how much comfort Abram had in God. When he could have little satisfaction in converse with the Canaanites whom he found there, he had abundance of pleasure in communion with that God, who brought him thither, and did not leave him. Communion with God is kept up by the word and by prayer. God reveals himself and his favours to his people by degrees; before, he had promised to show Abram this land, now, to give it to him: as grace is growing, so is comfort. It should seem, Abram understood it also as a grant of a better land, of which this was a type; for he looked for a heavenly country, Heb 11:16. As soon as Abram was got to Canaan, though he was but a stranger and sojourner there, yet he set up, and kept up, the worship of God in his family. He not only minded the ceremonial part of religion, the offering of sacrifice; but he made conscience of seeking his God, and calling on his name; that spiritual sacrifice with which God is well pleased. He preached concerning the name of the Lord; he taught his family and neighbours the knowledge of the true God, and his holy religion. The way of family worship is a good old way, no new thing, but the ancient usage of the saints. Abram was rich, and had a numerous family, was now unsettled, and in the midst of enemies; yet, wherever he pitched his tent, he built an altar: wherever we go, let us not fail to take our religion along with us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/genesis/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Abram does not enter into immediate possession, but only travels through the land which the Lord had promised to show him <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-1.htm">Genesis 12:1</a>. He arrives at "the place of Shekem." The town was probably not yet in existence. It lay between Mount Gerizzim and Mount Ebal. It possesses a special interest as the spot where the Lord first appeared to Abram in the land of promise. It was afterward dedicated to the Lord by being made a Levitical town, and a city of refuge. At this place Joshua convened an assembly of all Israel to hear his farewell address. "So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and set them a statute and an ordinance in Shekem" <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/24-1.htm">Joshua 24:1-25</a>. The particular point in the place of Shekem where Abram halted is the oak of Moreh; so called, probably, from its planter or owner. The oak attains to great antiquity, and a single tree, well grown, becomes conspicuous for its grandeur and beauty, and was often chosen in ancient times as a meeting-place for religious rites.<p>And the Kenaanite was then in the land. - This simply implies that the land was not open for Abram to enter upon immediate possession of it without challenge. Another was in possession. The sons of Kenaan had already arrived and preoccupied the country. It also intimates, or admits, of the supposition that there had been previous inhabitants who may have been subjugated by the invading Kenaanites. Thus, &#1488;&#1503;  'a&#772;z then alludes to the past, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-26.htm">Genesis 4:26</a>. Some of these former inhabitants will meet us in the course of the narrative. It admits also of the supposition that the Kenaanites afterward ceased to be its inhabitants. Hence, some have inferred that this could not have been penned by Moses, as they were expelled after his death. If this supposition were the necessary or the only one implied in the form of expression, we should acquiesce in the conclusion that this sentence came from one of the prophets to whom the conservation, revision, and continuation of the living oracles were committed. But we have seen that two other presuppositions may be made that satisfy the import of the passage. Moreover, the first of the three accounts for the fact that Abram does not instantly enter on possession, as there was an occupying tenant. And, finally, the third supposition may fairly be, not that the Kenaanites afterward ceased, but that they should afterward cease to be in the land. This, then, as well as the others, admits of Moses being the writer of this interesting sentence.<p>We are inclined to think, however, that the term "Kenaanite" here means, not the whole race of Kenaan, but the special tribe so called. If the former were meant, the statement would be in a manner superfluous, after calling the country the land of Kenaan. If the proper tribe be intended, then we have evidence here that they once possessed this part of the land which was afterward occupied by the Hivite and the Amorite <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/34-2.htm">Genesis 34:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/11-3.htm">Joshua 11:3</a>; for, at the time of the conquest by Abram's descendants, the mountainous land in the center, including the place of Shekem, was occupied by the Amorites and other tribes, while the coast of the Mediterranean and the west bank of the Jordan was held by the Kenaanites proper (Josephus v. 1; xi. 3). This change of occupants had taken place before the time of Moses.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/genesis/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. the place of Sichem&#8212;or Shechem, a pastoral valley then unoccupied (compare Ge 33:18).<p>plain of Moreh&#8212;rather, the "terebinth tree" of Moreh, very common in Palestine, remarkable for its wide-spreading branches and its dark green foliage.

The terebinth, or turpentine tree, is said at a distance to resemble the oak, but botanically it is of a different species; it does not grow in clumps. It is found in the S. and E. of Palestine in warm and sheltered spots; it often attains very considerable dimensions.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Moreh</span>] Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-30.htm" title="Are they not on the other side Jordan, by the way where the sun goes down, in the land of the Canaanites, which dwell in the desert over against Gilgal, beside the plains of Moreh?">Deuteronomy 11:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/7-1.htm" title="Then Jerubbaal, who is Gideon, and all the people that were with him, rose up early, and pitched beside the well of Harod: so that the host of the Midianites were on the north side of them, by the hill of Moreh, in the valley.">Jdg 7:1</a>. In all probability Moreh is not a proper name, but the participle of the verb meaning to “teach” or “instruct,” whence comes also the substantive Torah, “law” or “instruction.” Probably we have here an example of one of the sacred trees under which, in primitive times, a priest, or seer, gave oracles and returned answers to devout questioners. If so, this terebinth may have been the famous tree mentioned elsewhere in connexion with Shechem: cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-4.htm" title="And they gave to Jacob all the strange gods which were in their hand, and all their earrings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem.">Genesis 35:4</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/24-26.htm" title="And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God, and took a great stone, and set it up there under an oak, that was by the sanctuary of the LORD.">Joshua 24:26</a>, and perhaps <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-37.htm" title="And Gaal spoke again, and said, See there come people down by the middle of the land, and another company come along by the plain of Meonenim.">Jdg 9:37</a>. “The terebinth of Moreh” will then mean “The terebinth of the oracle, or of the soothsayer.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">And the Canaanite was then in the land</span>] i.e. long before the conquest of Palestine. This clause reminds the reader, that the land promised to the seed of Abram was “then” in the possession of the Canaanites. It was not to be taken by merely encamping in it. Perhaps, also, the clause refers to the sacred tree. Abram recognized the sanctity of the spot in the old religious customs of the Canaanites; and here Jehovah manifested Himself. As the Canaanite was to yield to Israel, so the Canaanite religion was to make way for a higher Revelation. The reverence and awe of the unseen Deity were not to be banished, but to be purified and elevated for a higher worship.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Abram passed through</span> - literally, <span class="accented">passed over</span>, or traveled about as a pilgrim (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-9.htm">Hebrews 11:9</a>) in - <span class="cmt_word">the land unto</span> (or as far as) <span class="cmt_word">the place of Sichem</span>.

Knobel renders "the oak of the teacher," comparing it with "the oak of the witches" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-37.htm">Judges 9:37</a>). The LXX. translate by <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c8;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>, lofty, and the Vulgate by <span class="accented">illustrem</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>And the Canaanite was then in the land.</span> A sign of post-Mosaic authorship (Tuch, Bleek, Colenso); an interpolation Eben Ezra; rather <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> a proclamation of the miserable exile in which the patriarch lived (Luther); or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> a reminder to Abram of his heavenly country, seeing he was a stranger in his earthly one (Calvin); or, better, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> an intimation of the fact that <span class="accented">already</span> the Canaanites were in possession of the land which bore their name (Kalisch), or perhaps simply <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> a declaration that the land was not a stretch of unoccupied territory, but a populated region (Hengstenberg), thus making the fulfillment of the ensuing promise all the more difficult, and all the greater a trial to the faith of the patriarch (Keil, Murphy, Wordsworth, Alford); or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span>, but not so good, an explanation of the previous selection of the oak of Moreh as his habitation (Lange, Havernick, <span class="accented">vide</span> Introduction, &sect; 18). </body></html>
