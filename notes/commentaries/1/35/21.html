No more is said, but that is enough. Reuben thought that his father would never hear of it; but those that promise themselves secrecy in sin, are generally disappointed. The age and death of Isaac are recorded, though he died not till after Joseph was sold into Egypt. Isaac lived about forty years after he had made his will, chap. 27:2. We shall not die an hour the sooner, but much the better, for timely setting our hearts and houses in order. Particular notice is taken of the agreement of Esau and Jacob at their father's funeral, to show how God had wonderfully changed Esau's mind.

The Compiler abbreviates what must have been a repulsive tradition. But, as in ch. 34, the tradition may possibly contain, in figurative language, some reminiscence of early tribal relations.

The gloom of that day of fear had now brightened into the clear daylight of salvation. This appearance was the answer, which God gave to Jacob on his acknowledgement of Him; and its reality is thereby established, in opposition to the conjecture that it is merely a legendary repetition of the previous vision.<p>(Note: This conjecture derives no support from the fact that the manifestations of God are ascribed to Elohim in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-1.htm">Genesis 35:1</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-9.htm">Genesis 35:9</a>., although the whole chapter treats of the display of mercy by the covenant God, i.e., Jehovah. For the occurrence of Elohim instead of Jehovah in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-1.htm">Genesis 35:1</a> may be explained, partly from the antithesis of God and man (because Jacob, the man, had neglected to redeem his vow, it was necessary that he should be reminded of it by God), and partly from the fact that there is no allusion to any appearance of God, but the words "God said" are to be understood, no doubt, as relating to an inward communication. The use of Elohim in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-9.htm">Genesis 35:9</a>. follows naturally from the injunction of Elohim in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-1.htm">Genesis 35:1</a>; and there was the less necessity for an express designation of the God appearing as Jehovah, because, on the one hand, the object of this appearance was simply to renew and confirm the former appearance of Jehovah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-12.htm">Genesis 28:12</a>.), and on the other hand, the title assumed in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/35-11.htm">Genesis 35:11</a>, El Shaddai, refers to <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-1.htm">Genesis 27:1</a>, where Jehovah announces Himself to Abram as El Shaddai.)<p>The former theophany had promised to Jacob divine protection in a foreign land and restoration to his home, on the ground of his call to be the bearer of the blessings of salvation. This promise God had fulfilled, and Jacob therefore performed his vow. On the strength of this, God now confirmed to him the name of Israel, which He had already given him in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-28.htm">Genesis 32:28</a>, and with it the promised of a numerous seed and the possession of Canaan, which, so far as the form and substance are concerned, points back rather to <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-6.htm">Genesis 17:6</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-8.htm">Genesis 17:8</a> than to <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/28-13.htm">Genesis 28:13-14</a>, and for the fulfilment of which, commencing with the birth of his sons and his return to Canaan, and stretching forward to the most remote future, the name of Israel was to furnish him with a pledge. - Jacob alluded to this second manifestation of God at Bethel towards the close of his life (<a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/48-3.htm">Genesis 48:3-4</a>); and Hosea (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/12-4.htm">Hosea 12:4</a>) represents it as the result of his wrestling with God. The remembrance of this appearance Jacob transmitted to his descendants by erecting a memorial stone, which he not only anointed with oil like the former one in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/28-17.htm">Genesis 28:17</a>, but consecrated by a drink-offering and by the renewal of the name Bethel. </body></html>
