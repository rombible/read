But having in previous expeditions learnt the physical advantages of the land of Seir, and the powerlessness of the Horites to resist him, he gives up Hebron to his brother, and migrates with his large wealth to that country.<p><span class= "bld"><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/35.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>35:21-29 What a sore affliction Reuben's sin was, is shown,  and Israel heard it. No more is said, but that is enough. Reuben thought that his father would never hear of it; but those that promise themselves secrecy in sin, are generally disappointed. The age and death of Isaac are recorded, though he died not till after Joseph was sold into Egypt. Isaac lived about forty years after he had made his will, chap. 27:2. We shall not die an hour the sooner, but much the better, for timely setting our hearts and houses in order. Particular notice is taken of the agreement of Esau and Jacob at their father's funeral, to show how God had wonderfully changed Esau's mind. It is awful to behold relations, sometimes for a little of this world's goods, disputing over the graves of their friends, while they are near going to the grave themselves.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/genesis/35.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Jacob's return and his father's death. The family of Jacob is now enumerated, because it has been completed by the birth of Benjamin. "In Padan-aram." This applies to all of them but Benjamin; an exception which the reader of the context can make for himself. Jacob at length arrives with his whole establishment at Hebron, the third notable station occupied by Abraham in the land <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/13-1.htm">Genesis 13:1</a>. Here also his father sojourns. The life of Isaac is now closed. Joseph must have been, at the time of Jacob's return, in his thirteenth year, and therefore, his father in his hundred and fourth. Isaac was consequently in his hundred and sixty-third year. He survived the return of Jacob to Hebron about seventeen years, and the sale of Joseph his grandson about thirteen. "Esau and Jacob his sons buried him." Hence, we learn that Esau and Jacob continued to be on brotherly terms from the day of their meeting at the ford of Jabbok.<p>This chapter closes the ninth of the pieces or documents marked off by the phrase "these are the generations." Its opening event was the birth of Isaac <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/25-19.htm">Genesis 25:19</a>, which took place in the hundreth year of Abraham, and therefore, seventy-five years before his death recorded in the seventh document. As the seventh purports to be the generations of Terah <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/11-27.htm">Genesis 11:27</a> and relates to Abraham who was his offspring, so the present document, containing the generations of Isaac, refers chiefly to the sons of Isaac, and especially to Jacob, as the heir of promise. Isaac as a son learned obedience to his father in that great typical event of his life, in which he was laid on the altar, and figuratively sacrificed in the ram which was his substitute. This was the great significant passage in his life, after which he retires into comparative tranquillity. <p> - Section XII - Jacob<p> - The History of Esau<p>2. &lt;&#1488;&#1492;&#1500;&#1489;&#1502;&#1492;  'oho&#774;l&#305;&#770;yba&#770;ma&#770;h, Oholibamah, "tent of the high place." &#1506;&#1504;&#1492;  &#8219;a&#780;na&#770;h, 'Anah, "answering." &#1510;&#1489;&#1506;&#1493;&#1503;  ts&#305;&#770;b&#8219;o&#770;n, Tsib'on, "dyer, colored."<p>4. &#1488;&#1500;&#1497;&#1508;&#1494;  'e&#780;l&#305;&#770;yphaz, Eliphaz, "God of strength." &#1512;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1500;  re&#8219;u&#770;'e&#770;l Re'uel, "friend of God."<p>5. &#1497;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;  ye&#8219;u&#770;sh, Je'ush, "haste." &#1497;&#1506;&#1500;&#1501;  ya&#8219;la&#770;m, Ja'lam, "hiding." &#1511;&#1512;&#1495;  qo&#770;rach Qorach, "ice."<p>11. &#1514;&#1497;&#1502;&#1503;  te&#770;yma&#770;n, Teman, "right-hand man." &#1488;&#1493;&#1502;&#1512;  'o&#770;ma&#772;r, Omar, "eloquent." &#1510;&#1508;&#1493;  tsepho&#770;, Tsepho, "watch." &#1490;&#1506;&#1514;&#1501;  ga&#8219;ta&#770;m Ga'tam, "touch." &#1511;&#1504;&#1494;  qenaz Qenaz, "hunting."<p>12. &#1514;&#1502;&#1504;&#1506;  t&#305;&#770;mna&#770;( Timna', "restraint." &#1506;&#1502;&#1500;&#1511;  &#8219;a&#780;ma&#770;le&#770;q, 'Amaleq, "licking up, laboring."<p>13. &#1504;&#1495;&#1514;  nachath, Nachath, "going down, rest." &#1494;&#1512;&#1495;  zerach, Zerach, "rising" (of light). &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1495;  shamma&#770;h, Shammah, "wasting." &#1502;&#1494;&#1492;  m&#305;&#770;zza&#770;h, Mizzah, "fear, sprinkling."<p>20. &#1500;&#1497;&#1496;&#1503;  lo&#770;t&#803;a&#770;n, Lotan, "covering, veiled." &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1489;&#1500;  sho&#770;ba&#770;l, Shobal, "flowing, a shoot."<p>21. &#1491;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503;  d&#305;&#770;ysho&#770;n, Dishon, "a kind of gazelle, fat." &#1488;&#1510;&#1512;  'etser, Etser, "store." &#1491;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1503;  d&#305;&#770;ysha&#770;n, Dishan, "threshing."<p>22. &#1495;&#1512;&#1497;  cho&#770;r&#305;&#770;y, Chori, "troglodyte." &#1492;&#1497;&#1502;&#1501;  he&#772;ma&#772;m, Hemam, "noise, commotion."<p>23. &#1506;&#1500;&#1493;&#1503;  &#8219;alva&#770;n, 'Alvan, "lofty." &#1502;&#1504;&#1495;&#1514;  ma&#770;nachath, Manachath, "rest." &#1506;&#1497;&#1489;&#1500;  &#8219;e&#770;yba&#770;l, 'Ebal, "stripped of leaves." &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1493;  shepho&#770;, Shepho, "bare." &#1488;&#1493;&#1504;&#1501;  'o&#770;na&#770;m, Onam, "strong."<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/genesis/35.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>29. Isaac gave up the ghost&#8212;The death of this venerable patriarch is here recorded by anticipation for it did not take place till fifteen years after Joseph's disappearance. Feeble and blind though he was, he lived to a very advanced age; and it is a pleasing evidence of the permanent reconciliation between Esau and Jacob that they met at Mamre to perform the funeral rites of their common father.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/genesis/35.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="ital">1715</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Was gathered unto his people; </span> either to the society of the dead, or to the congregation of the just.

According to an Arabic writer (l), he died at the end of the year 3,668, in the month Jiar, when Jacob was one hundred and twenty years old, and his children buried him in the cave in which Abraham was buried, in the city Chabil: According to Ussher this at about 1,716 B.C. <p>and was gathered unto his people; his soul was gathered to the righteous, his body was laid where Abraham and Sarah were buried: <p>being old, and full of days; the number of which is observed in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/35-28.htm">Genesis 35:28</a>, <p>and his sons Esau and Jacob buried him; in the cave of Machpelah near Mamre, where he lived and died, and where his parents had been buried, and Rebekah his wife. Esau very probably was sent for upon his father's death, or a little before it. This shows that there was a reconciliation between Jacob and Esau, and that it continued; and that Jacob did not decline the visit of him at Seir, nor in a clandestine manner took his journey another way, and avoided going thither on his invitation. <p>(l) Elmacin. p. 26. apud Hottinger.

Thus had he been blessed by the faithful covenant God. To show this, the account of his arrival in his father's tent at Hebron is preceded by a list of his 12 sons, arranged according to their respective mothers; and this list is closed with the remark, "These are the sons of Jacob, which were born to him in Padan-Aram" (&#1497;&#1500;&#1468;&#1491; for &#1497;&#1500;&#1468;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;; Ges. 143, 1), although Benjamin, the twelfth, was not born in Padan-Aram, but on the journey back. </body></html>
