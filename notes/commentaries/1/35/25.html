No more is said, but that is enough. Reuben thought that his father would never hear of it; but those that promise themselves secrecy in sin, are generally disappointed. The age and death of Isaac are recorded, though he died not till after Joseph was sold into Egypt. Isaac lived about forty years after he had made his will, chap. 27:2. We shall not die an hour the sooner, but much the better, for timely setting our hearts and houses in order. Particular notice is taken of the agreement of Esau and Jacob at their father's funeral, to show how God had wonderfully changed Esau's mind. It is awful to behold relations, sometimes for a little of this world's goods, disputing over the graves of their friends, while they are near going to the grave themselves.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/genesis/35.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Jacob's return and his father's death. The family of Jacob is now enumerated, because it has been completed by the birth of Benjamin. "In Padan-aram." This applies to all of them but Benjamin; an exception which the reader of the context can make for himself. Jacob at length arrives with his whole establishment at Hebron, the third notable station occupied by Abraham in the land <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/13-1.htm">Genesis 13:1</a>. Here also his father sojourns. The life of Isaac is now closed. Joseph must have been, at the time of Jacob's return, in his thirteenth year, and therefore, his father in his hundred and fourth. Isaac was consequently in his hundred and sixty-third year. He survived the return of Jacob to Hebron about seventeen years, and the sale of Joseph his grandson about thirteen. "Esau and Jacob his sons buried him." Hence, we learn that Esau and Jacob continued to be on brotherly terms from the day of their meeting at the ford of Jabbok.<p>This chapter closes the ninth of the pieces or documents marked off by the phrase "these are the generations." Its opening event was the birth of Isaac <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/25-19.htm">Genesis 25:19</a>, which took place in the hundreth year of Abraham, and therefore, seventy-five years before his death recorded in the seventh document. As the seventh purports to be the generations of Terah <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/11-27.htm">Genesis 11:27</a> and relates to Abraham who was his offspring, so the present document, containing the generations of Isaac, refers chiefly to the sons of Isaac, and especially to Jacob, as the heir of promise. Isaac as a son learned obedience to his father in that great typical event of his life, in which he was laid on the altar, and figuratively sacrificed in the ram which was his substitute. This was the great significant passage in his life, after which he retires into comparative tranquillity. <p> - Section XII - Jacob<p> - The History of Esau<p>2. &lt;&#1488;&#1492;&#1500;&#1489;&#1502;&#1492;  'oho&#774;l&#305;&#770;yba&#770;ma&#770;h, Oholibamah, "tent of the high place." &#1506;&#1504;&#1492;  &#8219;a&#780;na&#770;h, 'Anah, "answering." &#1510;&#1489;&#1506;&#1493;&#1503;  ts&#305;&#770;b&#8219;o&#770;n, Tsib'on, "dyer, colored."<p>4. &#1488;&#1500;&#1497;&#1508;&#1494;  'e&#780;l&#305;&#770;yphaz, Eliphaz, "God of strength." &#1512;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1500;  re&#8219;u&#770;'e&#770;l Re'uel, "friend of God."<p>5. &#1497;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;  ye&#8219;u&#770;sh, Je'ush, "haste." &#1497;&#1506;&#1500;&#1501;  ya&#8219;la&#770;m, Ja'lam, "hiding." &#1511;&#1512;&#1495;  qo&#770;rach Qorach, "ice."<p>11. &#1514;&#1497;&#1502;&#1503;  te&#770;yma&#770;n, Teman, "right-hand man." &#1488;&#1493;&#1502;&#1512;  'o&#770;ma&#772;r, Omar, "eloquent." &#1510;&#1508;&#1493;  tsepho&#770;, Tsepho, "watch." &#1490;&#1506;&#1514;&#1501;  ga&#8219;ta&#770;m Ga'tam, "touch." &#1511;&#1504;&#1494;  qenaz Qenaz, "hunting."<p>12. &#1514;&#1502;&#1504;&#1506;  t&#305;&#770;mna&#770;( Timna', "restraint." &#1506;&#1502;&#1500;&#1511;  &#8219;a&#780;ma&#770;le&#770;q, 'Amaleq, "licking up, laboring."<p>13. &#1504;&#1495;&#1514;  nachath, Nachath, "going down, rest." &#1494;&#1512;&#1495;  zerach, Zerach, "rising" (of light). &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1495;  shamma&#770;h, Shammah, "wasting." &#1502;&#1494;&#1492;  m&#305;&#770;zza&#770;h, Mizzah, "fear, sprinkling."<p>20. &#1500;&#1497;&#1496;&#1503;  lo&#770;t&#803;a&#770;n, Lotan, "covering, veiled." &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1489;&#1500;  sho&#770;ba&#770;l, Shobal, "flowing, a shoot."<p>21. &#1491;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503;  d&#305;&#770;ysho&#770;n, Dishon, "a kind of gazelle, fat." &#1488;&#1510;&#1512;  'etser, Etser, "store." &#1491;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1503;  d&#305;&#770;ysha&#770;n, Dishan, "threshing."<p>22. &#1495;&#1512;&#1497;  cho&#770;r&#305;&#770;y, Chori, "troglodyte." &#1492;&#1497;&#1502;&#1501;  he&#772;ma&#772;m, Hemam, "noise, commotion."<p>23. &#1506;&#1500;&#1493;&#1503;  &#8219;alva&#770;n, 'Alvan, "lofty." &#1502;&#1504;&#1495;&#1514;  ma&#770;nachath, Manachath, "rest." &#1506;&#1497;&#1489;&#1500;  &#8219;e&#770;yba&#770;l, 'Ebal, "stripped of leaves." &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1493;  shepho&#770;, Shepho, "bare." &#1488;&#1493;&#1504;&#1501;  'o&#770;na&#770;m, Onam, "strong."<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/genesis/35.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20. and Jacob set a pillar on her grave &#8230; unto this day&#8212;The spot still marked out as the grave of Rachel exactly agrees with the Scriptural record, being about a mile from Beth-lehem.

For the word &#1513;&#1473;&#1489; does not enjoin a permanent abode; but, when taken in connection with what follows, "make there an altar," it merely directs him to stay there and perform his vow. As they were travelling forward, Rachel was taken in labour not far from Ephratah. &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1514; is a space, answering probably to the Persian parassang, though the real meaning of &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1492; is unknown. The birth was a difficult one. &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1491;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468; &#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1513;&#1473;: she had difficulty in her labour (instead of Piel we find Hiphil in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-17.htm">Genesis 35:17</a> with the same signification). The midwife comforted her by saying: "Fear not, for this also is to thee a son," - a wish expressed by her when Joseph was born (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/30-24.htm">Genesis 30:24</a>). But she expired; and as she was dying, she called him Been-oni, "son of my pain." Jacob, however, called him Ben-jamin, probably son of good fortune, according to the meaning of the word jamin sustained by the Arabic, to indicate that his pain at the loss of his favourite wife was compensated by the birth of this son, who now completed the number twelve. Other explanations are less simple. He buried Rachel on the road to Ephratah, or Ephrath (probably the fertile, from &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492;), i.e., Bethlehem (bread-house), by which name it is better known, though the origin of it is obscure. He also erected a monument over her grave (&#1502;&#1510;&#1468;&#1489;&#1492;, &#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;), on which the historian observes, "This is the pillar of Rachel's grave unto this day:" a remark which does not necessarily point to a post-Mosaic period, but which could easily have been made even 10 or 20 years after its erection. For the fact that a grave-stone had been preserved upon the high road in a foreign land, the inhabitants of which had no interest whatever in it, might appear worthy of notice even though only a single decennary had passed away.<p>(Note: But even if this Mazzebah was really preserved till the conquest of Canaan by the Israelites, i.e., more than 450 years, and the remark referred to that time, it might be an interpolation by a later hand. The grave was certainly a well-known spot in Samuel's time (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-2.htm">1 Samuel 10:2</a>); but a monumentum ubi Rachel posita est uxor Jacob is first mentioned again by the Bordeaux pilgrims of a.d. 333 and Jerome. The Kubbet Rahil (Rachel's grave), which is now shown about half an hour's journey to the north of Bethlehem, to the right of the road from Jerusalem to Hebron, is merely "an ordinary Muslim wely, or tomb of a holy person, a small square building of stone with a dome, and within it a tomb in the ordinary Mohammedan form" (Rob. Pal. 1, p. 322). It has been recently enlarged by a square court with high walls and arches on the eastern side (Rob. Bibl. Researches. p. 357). Now although this grave is not ancient, the correctness of the tradition, which fixes upon this as the site of Rachel's grave, cannot on the whole be disputed. At any rate, the reasons assigned to the contrary by Thenius, Kurtz, and others are not conclusive.) </body></html>
