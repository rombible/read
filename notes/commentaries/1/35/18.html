Jacob’s name, “son of the right hand,” was probably given not merely that the child might-bear no ill-omened title, but to mark his sense of the value and preciousness of his last born son. Abravanel well remarks that earthly happiness is never perfect, and that the receiving of Divine revelations made no difference to Jacob’s earthly lot. God had just solemnly appeared to him, and he is on his last journey, within two days’ easy march of Hebron, when he loses the wife whom he so loved. For more than forty years he had been an exile from his home; he was now close to it, but may never welcome there the one for whom he had so deep and lasting an affection.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/genesis/35.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-18.htm" title="And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, (for she died) that she called his name Benoni: but his father called him Benjamin.">Genesis 35:18</a></span>. <span class="ital">As her soul was departing — </span><span class="greekheb">בצאת נפשׁה</span>, <span class="ital">when her soul was going out, </span>namely, of the body: an argument this of the soul’s immortality, especially if compared with <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-7.htm" title="Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit shall return to God who gave it.">Ecclesiastes 12:7</a>; from which places collated, we learn both whence it goes, and whither it goes. <span class="ital">She called his name Benoni — </span>The <span class="ital">Song of Solomon of my sorrow. </span>Thus, by her own confession<span class="ital">, </span>the gaining her desire became her sorrow: a lively instance this of the folly of inordinately desiring any thing temporal: the object obtained generally becomes a source of sorrow to us. <span class="ital">But his father called him Benjamin — The son of my right hand. </span>As near, dear, and precious to him as his right hand, which is both more useful and more honourable than the left, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80-17.htm" title="Let your hand be on the man of your right hand, on the son of man whom you made strong for yourself.">Psalm 80:17</a>; or, instead of his right hand, the staff, stay, and comfort of his old age.

The death of the body is but the departure of the soul to the world of spirits. When shall we learn that it is God alone who really knows what is best for his people, and that in all worldly affairs the safest path for the Christian is to say from the heart, It is the Lord, let him do what seemeth him good. Here alone is our safety and our comfort, to know no will but his. Her dying lips called her newborn son Ben-oni, the son of my sorrow; and many a son proves to be the heaviness of her that bare him. Children are enough the sorrow of their mothers; they should, therefore, when they grow up, study to be their joy, and so, if possible, to make them some amends. But Jacob, because he would not renew the sorrowful remembrance of the mother's death every time he called his son, changed his name to Benjamin, the son of my right hand: that is, very dear to me; the support of my age, like the staff in my right hand.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/genesis/35.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>God appears to Jacob again at Bethel, and renews the promise made to him there <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/28-13.htm">Genesis 28:13-14</a>. Again. The writer here refers to the former meeting of God with Jacob at Bethel, and thereby proves himself cognizant of the fact, and of the record already made of it. "When he went out of Padan-aram." This corroborates the explanation of the clause, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/35-6.htm">Genesis 35:6</a>, "which is in the land of Kenaan." Bethel was the last point in this land that was noticed in his flight from Esau. His arrival at the same point indicates that he has now returned from Padan-aram to the land of Kenaan. "He called his name Israel." At Bethel he renews the change of name, to indicate that the meetings here were of equal moment in Jacob's spiritual life with that at Penuel. It implies also that this life had been declining in the interval between Penuel and Bethel, and had now been revived by the call of God to go to Bethel, and by the interview.<p>The renewal of the naming aptly expresses this renewal of spiritual life. "I am God Almighty." So he proclaimed himself before to Abraham <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-1.htm">Genesis 17:1</a>. "Be fruitful, and multiply." Abraham and Isaac had each only one son of promise. But now the time of increase is come. Jacob has been blessed with eleven sons, and at least one daughter. And now he receives the long-promised blessing, "be fruitful and multiply." From this time forth the multiplication of Israel is rapid. In twenty-six years after this time he goes down into Egypt with seventy souls, besides the wives of his married descendants, and two hundred and ten years after that Israel goes out of Egypt numbering about one million eight hundred thousand. "A nation and a congregation of nations," such as were then known in the world, had at the last date come of him, and "kings" were to follow in due time. The land, as well as the seed, is again promised.<p>Jacob now, according to his wont, perpetuates the scene of divine manifestation with a monumental stone. "God went up;" as he went up from Abraham <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-22.htm">Genesis 17:22</a> after a similar conferencc with him. He had now spoken to Jacob face to face, as he communed with Abraham. "A pillar" in the place where he talked with him, a consecrated monument of this second interview, not in a dream as before, but in a waking vision. On this he pours a drink-offering of wine, and then anoints it with oil. Here, for the first time, we meet with the libation. It is possible there was such an offering when Melkizedec brought forth bread and wine, though it is not recorded. The drink-offering is the complement of the meat-offering, and both are accompaniments of the sacrifice which is offered on the altar. They are in themselves expressive of gratitude and devotion. Wine and oil are used to denote the quickening and sanctifying power of the Spirit of God. "Bethel." We are now familiar with the repetition of the naming of persons and places. This place was already called Bethel by Jacob himself; it is most likely that Abraham applied this name to it: and for aught we know, some servant of the true God, under the Noachic covenant, may have originated the name.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/genesis/35.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18. She called his name Ben-oni&#8212;The dying mother gave this name to her child, significant of her circumstances; but Jacob changed his name into Benjamin. This is thought by some to have been originally Benjamin, "a son of days," that is, of old age.

In childbirth; she had most passionately desired children, without which she could not live with ease and peace of mind, and now she dies by having one; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/30-1.htm">Genesis 30:1</a>; and by this account of her death it appears, that death is the separation and disunion of soul and body; that at death the soul departs from the body; that the soul does not die with it, but goes elsewhere, and lives in a separate state, and never dies; it goes into another world, a world of spirits, even unto God that gave it, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:7</a>, <p>that she called his name Benoni; which signifies "the son of my sorrow", having borne and brought him forth in sorrow, and now about to leave him as soon as born, which might increase her sorrow; or "the son, of my mourning"; as Aben Ezra and Ben Gersom interpret it; or "the son of my strength", all her strength being exhausted in bringing him forth: <p>but his father called him Benjamin; that is, "the son of the right hand", being as dear to him, and as beloved by him as his right hand; or who would be as the right hand to him, his staff and support in his old age; or else as being the son of her who was as his right hand, dear and assisting to him. Some render it, "the son of days", or years, that is, the son of his old age, as he is called, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/44-20.htm">Genesis 44:20</a>; Jarchi and Ben Gerson interpret it, "the son of the south"; the right hand being put for the south; and they think this son was so called, because he only was born in the land of Canaan, which lay, they say, to the south with respect to Mesopotamia, where the rest were born; but be the etymology of the word as it will, the change of the name seems to be made by Jacob, because that which Rachel gave her son would have perpetually put Jacob in mind of the sorrow of his beloved Rachel, and therefore gave him a name more pleasant and agreeable.

The gloom of that day of fear had now brightened into the clear daylight of salvation. This appearance was the answer, which God gave to Jacob on his acknowledgement of Him; and its reality is thereby established, in opposition to the conjecture that it is merely a legendary repetition of the previous vision.<p>(Note: This conjecture derives no support from the fact that the manifestations of God are ascribed to Elohim in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-1.htm">Genesis 35:1</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-9.htm">Genesis 35:9</a>., although the whole chapter treats of the display of mercy by the covenant God, i.e., Jehovah. For the occurrence of Elohim instead of Jehovah in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-1.htm">Genesis 35:1</a> may be explained, partly from the antithesis of God and man (because Jacob, the man, had neglected to redeem his vow, it was necessary that he should be reminded of it by God), and partly from the fact that there is no allusion to any appearance of God, but the words "God said" are to be understood, no doubt, as relating to an inward communication. The use of Elohim in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-9.htm">Genesis 35:9</a>. follows naturally from the injunction of Elohim in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-1.htm">Genesis 35:1</a>; and there was the less necessity for an express designation of the God appearing as Jehovah, because, on the one hand, the object of this appearance was simply to renew and confirm the former appearance of Jehovah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-12.htm">Genesis 28:12</a>.), and on the other hand, the title assumed in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/35-11.htm">Genesis 35:11</a>, El Shaddai, refers to <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-1.htm">Genesis 27:1</a>, where Jehovah announces Himself to Abram as El Shaddai.)<p>The former theophany had promised to Jacob divine protection in a foreign land and restoration to his home, on the ground of his call to be the bearer of the blessings of salvation. This promise God had fulfilled, and Jacob therefore performed his vow. On the strength of this, God now confirmed to him the name of Israel, which He had already given him in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-28.htm">Genesis 32:28</a>, and with it the promised of a numerous seed and the possession of Canaan, which, so far as the form and substance are concerned, points back rather to <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-6.htm">Genesis 17:6</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-8.htm">Genesis 17:8</a> than to <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/28-13.htm">Genesis 28:13-14</a>, and for the fulfilment of which, commencing with the birth of his sons and his return to Canaan, and stretching forward to the most remote future, the name of Israel was to furnish him with a pledge. - Jacob alluded to this second manifestation of God at Bethel towards the close of his life (<a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/48-3.htm">Genesis 48:3-4</a>); and Hosea (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/12-4.htm">Hosea 12:4</a>) represents it as the result of his wrestling with God. The remembrance of this appearance Jacob transmitted to his descendants by erecting a memorial stone, which he not only anointed with oil like the former one in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/28-17.htm">Genesis 28:17</a>, but consecrated by a drink-offering and by the renewal of the name Bethel. </body></html>
