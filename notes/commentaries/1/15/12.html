He had then, in his trance, also asked for some security that Canaan should be the heritage of his posterity, and in answer had received the command to arrange, upon a large scale, the ceremonial of a solemn treaty-making. The morning had been spent in the performance of the command, and after wards he had watched, probably for several hours, by the side of the divided bodies, uncertain what would happen, but occupied in driving away the vultures, which gathered from all quarters round the abundant feast. At sunset the revelation came to him, not in a waking trance, as on the previous night, but in “a deep sleep,” and with those accompaniments of terror so powerfully described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/4-12.htm" title="Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and my ear received a little thereof.">Job 4:12-16</a>, and which the creature cannot but feel when brought near to the manifest presence of the Creator (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-8.htm" title="Therefore I was left alone, and saw this great vision, and there remained no strength in me: for my comeliness was turned in me into corruption, and I retained no strength.">Daniel 10:8</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.</span>—Heb., <span class= "ital">lo, a terror, even great darkness, falling upon him. </span>The terror was not mental so much as bodily, caused by a deep gloom settling round him, such as would be the effect of an eclipse of the setting sun, and shutting all mortal things away from his view.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/genesis/15.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-12.htm" title="And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell on Abram; and, see, an horror of great darkness fell on him.">Genesis 15:12</a></span>. <span class="ital">And when the sun was going down — </span>About the time of the <span class="ital">evening oblation; </span>for, he <span class="ital">abode by them, </span>praying and waiting till toward evening; <span class="ital">a deep sleep fell upon Abram — </span>Not a common sloop through weariness or carelessness, but a divine ecstasy, that, being wholly <span class="ital">taken off </span>from things sensible, he might be wholly <span class="ital">taken up </span>with the contemplation of things spiritual. <span class="ital">And lo, a horror of great darkness fell upon him — </span>This was designed to strike an awe upon the spirit of Abram, and to possess him with a holy reverence.

The children of light do not always walk in the light. Several things were then foretold. 1. The suffering state of Abram's seed for a long time. They shall be strangers. The heirs of heaven are strangers on earth. They shall be servants; but Canaanites serve under a curse, the Hebrews under a blessing. They shall be suffers. Those that are blessed and beloved of God, are often sorely afflicted by wicked men. 2. The judgment of the enemies of Abram's seed. Though God may allow persecutors and oppressors to trample upon his people a great while, he will certainly reckon with them at last. 3. That great event, the deliverance of Abram's seed out of Egypt, is here foretold. 4. Their happy settlement in Canaan. They shall come hither again. The measure of sin fills gradually. Some people's measure of sin fills slowly. The knowledge of future events would seldom add to our comfort. In the most favoured families, and most happy lives, there are so many afflictions, that it is merciful in God to conceal what will befall us and ours.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/genesis/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And the sun was about to set. - This visit of the Lord to Abram continues for two nights, with the intervening day.

Take me an heifer, &c.&#8212;On occasions of great importance, when two or more parties join in a compact, they either observe precisely the same rites as Abram did, or, where they do not, they invoke the lamp as their witness. According to these ideas, which have been from time immemorial engraven on the minds of Eastern people, the Lord Himself condescended to enter into covenant with Abram. The patriarch did not pass between the sacrifice and the reason was that in this transaction he was bound to nothing. He asked a sign, and God was pleased to give him a sign, by which, according to Eastern ideas, He bound Himself. In like manner God has entered into covenant with us; and in the glory of the only-begotten Son, who passed through between God and us, all who believe have, like Abram, a sign or pledge in the gift of the Spirit, whereby they may know that they shall inherit the heavenly Canaan.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/genesis/15.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">A deep sleep fell upon Abram; </span> partly natural, from his labour in killing and sacrificing those creatures; and partly sent upon him from God, to make way for the following representation.

The divine promise to be a shield to him, that is to say, a protection against all enemies, and a reward, i.e., richly to reward his confidence, his ready obedience, stands here, as the opening words "after these things" indicate, in close connection with the previous guidance of Abram. Whilst the protection of his wife in Egypt was a practical pledge of the possibility of his having a posterity, and the separation of Lot, followed by the conquest of the kings of the East, was also a pledge of the possibility of his one day possessing the promised land, there was as yet no prospect whatever of the promise being realized, that he should become a great nation, and possess an innumerable posterity. In these circumstances, anxiety about the future might naturally arise in his mind. To meet this, the word of the Lord came to him with the comforting assurance, "Fear not, I am thy shield." But when the Lord added, "and thy very great reward," Abram could only reply, as he thought of his childless condition: "Lord Jehovah, what wilt Thou give me, seeing I go childless?" Of what avail are all my possessions, wealth, and power, since I have no child, and the heir of my house is Eliezer the Damascene? &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;, synonymous with &#1502;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-9.htm">Zephaniah 2:9</a>), possession, or the seizure of possession, is chosen on account of its assonance with &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1511;. &#1489;&#1468;&#1503;&#1470;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;, son of the seizing of possession  equals  seizer of possession, or heir. Eliezer of Damascus (lit., Damascus viz., Eliezer): Eliezer is an explanatory apposition to Damascus, in the sense of the Damascene Eliezer; though &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1511;, on account of its position before &#1488;&#1500;&#1497;&#1506;&#1494;&#1512;, cannot be taken grammatically as equivalent to &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1511;&#1497;.<p>(Note: The legend of Abram having been king in Damascus appears to have originated in this, though the passage before us does not so much as show that Abram obtained possession of Eliezer on his way through Damascus.)<p>To give still more distinct utterance to his grief, Abram adds (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-3.htm">Genesis 15:3</a>): "Behold, to me Thou hast given no seed; and lo, an inmate of my house (&#1489;&#1468;&#1503;&#1470;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497; in distinction from &#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1491;&#1470;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;, home-born, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-14.htm">Genesis 14:14</a>) will be my heir." The word of the Lord then came to him: "Not he, but one who shall come forth from thy body, he will be thine heir." God then took him into the open air, told him to look up to heaven, and promised him a posterity as numerous as the innumerable host of stars (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-17.htm">Genesis 22:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-4.htm">Genesis 24:4</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/32-13.htm">Exodus 32:13</a>, etc.). Whether Abram at this time was "in the body or out of the body," is a matter of no moment. The reality of the occurrence is the same in either case. This is evident from the remark made by Moses (the historian) as to the conduct of Abram in relation to the promise of God: "And he believed in Jehovah, and He counted it to him for righteousness." In the strictly objective character of the account in Genesis, in accordance with which the simple facts are related throughout without any introduction of subjective opinions, this remark appears so striking, that the question naturally arises, What led Moses to introduce it? In what way did Abram make known his faith in Jehovah? And in what way did Jehovah count it to him as righteousness? The reply to both questions must not be sought in the New Testament, but must be given or indicated in the context. What reply did Abram make on receiving the promise, or what did he do in consequence? When God, to confirm the promise, declared Himself to be Jehovah, who brought him out of Ur of the Chaldees to give him that land as a possession, Abram replied, "Lord, whereby shall I know that I shall possess it?" God then directed him to "fetch a heifer of three years old," etc.; and Abram fetched the animals required, and arranged them (as we may certainly suppose, thought it is not expressly stated) as God had commanded him. By this readiness to perform what God commanded him, Abram gave a practical proof that he believed Jehovah; and what God did with the animals so arranged was a practical declaration on the part of Jehovah, that He reckoned this faith to Abram as righteousness.<p>The significance of the divine act is, finally, summed up in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>, in the words, "On that day Jehovah made a covenant with Abram." Consequently Jehovah reckoned Abram's faith to him as righteousness, by making a covenant with him, by taking Abram into covenant fellowship with Himself. &#1492;&#1488;&#1502;&#1497;&#1503;, from &#1488;&#1502;&#1503; to continue and the preserve, to be firm and to confirm, in Hiphil to trust, believe (&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;), expresses "that state of mind which is sure of its object, and relies firmly upon it;" and as denoting conduct towards God, as "a firm, inward, personal, self-surrendering reliance upon a personal being, especially upon the source of all being," it is construed sometimes with &#1500; (e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-23.htm">Deuteronomy 9:23</a>), but more frequently with &#1489;&#1468; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-11.htm">Numbers 14:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-12.htm">Numbers 20:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-32.htm">Deuteronomy 1:32</a>), "to believe the Lord," and "to believe on the Lord," to trust in Him, - &#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;, as the apostle has more correctly rendered the &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; of the lxx (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-5.htm">Romans 4:5</a>). Faith therefore is not merely assensus, but fiducia also, unconditional trust in the Lord and His word, even where the natural course of events furnishes no ground for hope or expectation. This faith Abram manifested, as the apostle has shown in <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/4.htm">Romans 4</a>; and this faith God reckoned to him as righteousness by the actual conclusion of a covenant with him. &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1492;, righteousness, as a human characteristic, is correspondence to the will of God both in character and conduct, or a state answering to the divine purpose of a man's being. This was the state in which man was first created in the image of God; but it was lost by sin, through which he placed himself in opposition to the will of God and to his own divinely appointed destiny, and could only be restored by God. When the human race had universally corrupted its way, Noah alone was found righteous before God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/7-1.htm">Genesis 7:1</a>), because he was blameless and walked with God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-9.htm">Genesis 6:9</a>). This righteousness Abram acquired through his unconditional trust in the Lord, his undoubting faith in His promise, and his ready obedience to His word. This state of mind, which is expressed in the words &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; &#1492;&#1488;&#1502;&#1497;&#1503;, was reckoned to him as righteousness, so that God treated him as a righteous man, and formed such a relationship with him, that he was placed in living fellowship with God. The foundation of this relationship was laid in the manner described in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/15-7.htm">Genesis 15:7-11</a>. </body></html>
