The body may be buried far away, but the soul joins the company of its forefathers in some separate abode, not to be absorbed, but still to enjoy a personal existence. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-8.htm" title="Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people.">Genesis 25:8</a>.) A similar, but more exact, distinction between the body and the spirit is drawn in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-7.htm" title="Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit shall return to God who gave it.">Ecclesiastes 12:7</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/genesis/15.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-15.htm" title="And you shall go to your fathers in peace; you shall be buried in a good old age.">Genesis 15:15</a></span>. <span class="ital">Thou shalt go to thy fathers — </span>At death we <span class="ital">go to our fathers, </span>to <span class="ital">all </span>our fathers that are gone before us to the state of the dead, to our <span class="ital">godly </span>fathers that are gone before us to the state of the blessed.

The children of light do not always walk in the light. Several things were then foretold. 1. The suffering state of Abram's seed for a long time. They shall be strangers. The heirs of heaven are strangers on earth. They shall be servants; but Canaanites serve under a curse, the Hebrews under a blessing. They shall be suffers. Those that are blessed and beloved of God, are often sorely afflicted by wicked men. 2. The judgment of the enemies of Abram's seed. Though God may allow persecutors and oppressors to trample upon his people a great while, he will certainly reckon with them at last. 3. That great event, the deliverance of Abram's seed out of Egypt, is here foretold. 4. Their happy settlement in Canaan. They shall come hither again. The measure of sin fills gradually. Some people's measure of sin fills slowly. The knowledge of future events would seldom add to our comfort. In the most favoured families, and most happy lives, there are so many afflictions, that it is merciful in God to conceal what will befall us and ours.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/genesis/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Know, know thou. - Know certainly. This responds to Abram's question, Whereby shall I know? <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-8.htm">Genesis 15:8</a>. Four hundred years are to elapse before the seed of Abram shall actually proceed to take possession of the land. This interval can only commence when the seed is born; that is, at the birth of Isaac, when Abram was a hundred years of age and therefore thirty years after the call. During this interval they are to be, "first, strangers in a land not theirs" for one hundred and ninety years; and then for the remaining two hundred and ten years in Egypt: at first, servants, with considerable privilege and position; and at last, afflicted serfs, under a hard and cruel bondage. At the end of this period Pharaoh and his nation were visited with a succession of tremendous judgments, and Israel went out free from bondage "with great wealth" <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12.htm">Exodus 12-14</a>. "Go to thy fathers." This implies that the fathers, though dead, still exist. To go from one place to another implies, not annihilation, but the continuance of existence. The doctrine of the soul's perpetual existence is here intimated. Abram died in peace and happiness, one hundred and fifteen years before the descent into Egypt.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/genesis/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9-21. Take me an heifer, &c.&#8212;On occasions of great importance, when two or more parties join in a compact, they either observe precisely the same rites as Abram did, or, where they do not, they invoke the lamp as their witness. According to these ideas, which have been from time immemorial engraven on the minds of Eastern people, the Lord Himself condescended to enter into covenant with Abram. The patriarch did not pass between the sacrifice and the reason was that in this transaction he was bound to nothing. He asked a sign, and God was pleased to give him a sign, by which, according to Eastern ideas, He bound Himself. In like manner God has entered into covenant with us; and in the glory of the only-begotten Son, who passed through between God and us, all who believe have, like Abram, a sign or pledge in the gift of the Spirit, whereby they may know that they shall inherit the heavenly Canaan.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/genesis/15.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">To thy fathers, </span> i.e. either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

This may seem more probable, at least in this place, partly, because this or the like phrase is indifferently used concerning good and bad men; see <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-8.htm" title="Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people.">Genesis 25:8</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/49-19.htm" title="He shall go to the generation of his fathers; they shall never see light.">Psalm 49:19</a></span>; partly, because this phrase is so expounded, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-36.htm" title="For David, after he had served his own generation by the will of God, fell on sleep, and was laid to his fathers, and saw corruption:">Acts 13:36</a></span>, <span class="ital">He, </span> i.e. <span class="ital">David, was laid to his fathers, and</span> (for <span class="ital">that is</span>) <span class="ital">saw corruption; </span> partly, because some of Abraham’s fathers, and particularly Nahor, his grandfather, who lived and died an idolater, cannot with any warrant from Scripture be presumed to be gone to the place of blessedness in their souls.

Or die, which is a going the way of all flesh, to a man's long home, out of this world to another, to the world of spirits, to those that are gone before them; which is no inconsiderable proof of the immortality of the soul. Jarchi infers from hence, that Terah, Abram's father, was a penitent, and died a good man, and went to heaven, the place and state of the blessed, whither Abram should go at death; but the phrase of going to the fathers is used both of good and bad men: it is moreover said of Abram, that he should go in peace; being freed from all the fatigues of his journeying from place to place in his state of pilgrimage, and not living to see the afflictions of his posterity, and to have any share in them; and dying in spiritual peace, in tranquillity of mind, knowing in whom he had believed, and where his salvation was safe and secure, and whither he was going; for a good man dies with peace of conscience, having his sins freely forgiven, and he justified from them by the righteousness of the living Redeemer, and enters into eternal peace, see <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/37-37.htm">Psalm 37:37</a>, <p>thou shall be buried in a good old age; this signifies that he should live long, see many days and good ones, enjoy much health and prosperity, continue in the ways of truth and righteousness to the end, and come to his grave like a shock of corn fully ripe, and fit for an other world; and that he should have a decent interment in the land of Canaan, where he purchased a burial place, and which was a pledge and earnest of the future possession of it by his seed, the thing here promised. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/genesis/15.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/genesis/15.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">15</span>. <span class="ital">go to thy fathers</span>] i.e. depart in death to join thy forefathers in the place of departed spirits, i.e. <span class="ital">Sheôl</span>.

Not a periphrasis for going to the grave (Rosenm&uuml;ller), since Abram s ancestors were not entombed in Canaan; but a proof of the survival of departed spirits in a state of conscious existence after death (Knobel, Murphy, Wordsworth, 'Speaker s Commentary,' Inglis), to the company of which the patriarch was in due time to be gathered. The disposal of his remains is provided for in what follows. <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt be buried in a good old age.</span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/genesis/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Abram's question, "Whereby shall I know that I shall take possession of it (the land)?" was not an expression of doubt, but of desire for the confirmation or sealing of a promise, which transcended human thought and conception. To gratify this desire, God commanded him to make preparation for the conclusion of a covenant. "Take Me, He said, a heifer of three years old, and a she-goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtle-dove, and a young pigeon;" one of every species of the animals suitable for sacrifice. Abram took these, and "divided them in the midst," i.e., in half, "and placed one half of each opposite to the other (&#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1512;&#1493; &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, every one its half, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/42-25.htm">Genesis 42:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-17.htm">Numbers 16:17</a>); only the birds divided he not," just as in sacrifice the doves were not divided into pieces, but placed upon the fire whole (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-17.htm">Leviticus 1:17</a>). The animals chosen, as well as the fact that the doves were left whole, corresponded exactly to the ritual of sacrifice. Yet the transaction itself was not a real sacrifice, since there was neither sprinkling of blood nor offering upon an altar (oblatio), and no mention is made of the pieces being burned. The proceeding corresponded rather to the custom, prevalent in many ancient nations, of slaughtering animals when concluding a covenant, and after dividing them into pieces, of laying the pieces opposite to one another, that the persons making the covenant might pass between them. Thus Ephraem Syrus (1, 161) observes, that God condescended to follow the custom of the Chaldeans, that He might in the most solemn manner confirm His oath to Abram the Chaldean. The wide extension of this custom is evident from the expression used to denote the conclusion of a covenant, &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514; to hew, or cut a covenant, Aram. &#1511;&#1512;&#1501; &#1490;&#1468;&#1512;&#1494;, Greek &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3b1; &#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, faedus ferire, i.e., ferienda hostia facere faedus; cf. Bochart (Hieroz. 1, 332); whilst it is evident from <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-18.htm">Jeremiah 34:18</a>, that this was still customary among the Israelites of later times. The choice of sacrificial animals for a transaction which was not strictly a sacrifice, was founded upon the symbolical significance of the sacrificial animals, i.e., upon the fact that they represented and took the place of those who offered them. In the case before us, they were meant to typify the promised seed of Abram. This would not hold good, indeed, if the cutting of the animals had been merely intended to signify, that any who broke the covenant would be treated like the animals that were there cut in pieces. But there is no sure ground in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-18.htm">Jeremiah 34:18</a>. for thus interpreting the ancient custom. The meaning which the prophet there assigns to the symbolical usage, may be simply a different application of it, which does not preclude an earlier and different intention in the symbol. The division of the animals probably denoted originally the two parties to the covenant, and the passing of the latter through the pieces laid opposite to one another, their formation into one: a signification to which the other might easily have been attached as a further consequence and explanation. And if in such a case the sacrificial animals represented the parties to the covenant, so also even in the present instance the sacrificial animals were fitted for that purpose, since, although originally representing only the owner or offerer of the sacrifice, by their consecration as sacrifices they were also brought into connection with Jehovah. But in the case before us the animals represented Abram and his seed, not in the fact of their being slaughtered, as significant of the slaying of that seed, but only in what happened to and in connection with the slaughtered animals: birds of prey attempted to eat them, and when extreme darkness came on, the glory of God passed through them. As all the seed of Abram was concerned, one of every kind of animal suitable for sacrifice was taken, ut ex toto populo et singulis partibus sacrificium unum fieret (Calvin). The age of the animals, three years old, was supposed by Theodoret to refer to the three generations of Israel which were to remain in Egypt, or the three centuries of captivity in a foreign land; and this is rendered very probable by the fact, that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-25.htm">Judges 6:25</a> the bullock of seven years old undoubtedly refers to the seven years of Midianitish oppression. On the other hand, we cannot find in the six halves of the three animals and the undivided birds, either 7 things or the sacred number 7, for two undivided birds cannot represent one whole, but two; nor can we attribute to the eight pieces any symbolical meaning, for these numbers necessarily followed from the choice of one specimen of every kind of animal that was fit for sacrifice, and from the division of the larger animals into two. </body></html>
