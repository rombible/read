He lived 969 years, the longest that any man ever lived on earth; but the longest liver must die at last. Noah signifies rest; his parents gave him that name, with a prospect of his being a great blessing to his generation. Observe his father's complaint of the calamitous state of human life, by the entrance of sin, and the curse of sin. Our whole life is spent in labour, and our time filled up with continual toil. God having cursed the ground, it is as much as some can do, with the utmost care and pains, to get a hard livelihood out comfort us. It signifies not only that desire and expectation which parents generally have about their children, that they will be comforts to them and helpers, though they often prove otherwise; but it signifies also a prospect of something more. Is Christ ours? Is heaven ours? We need better comforters under our toil and sorrow, than the dearest relations and the most promising offspring; may we seek and find comforts in Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/genesis/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Methushelah is the oldest man on record.

Lamech, by whom the line was carried forward, was similarly far advanced when he begat a son, at the age of 182, and called his name <span class="cmt_word">Noah</span>, - "rest," from <span class="accented">nuach</span>, to rest (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/8-4.htm">Genesis 8:4</a>), - not "The Sailor," from the Latin no, and the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;</span> (Bohlen), but at the same time explaining it by saying, <span class="cmt_word">This same shall comfort</span> - <span class="accented">na</span>-<span class="accented">cham</span>, to pant, groan, Piel to comfort. "<span class="accented">Nuach</span> and <span class="accented">nacham</span> are stems not immediately connected, but they both point back to a common root, <span class="accented">nch</span>, signifying to sigh, breathe, rest, lie down" (Murphy) - <span class="cmt_word">us concerning our work and toil of our hands</span>. To say that Lamech anticipated nothing more than that the youthful Noah would assist him in the cultivation of the soil (Murphy) is to put too little into, and to allege that" this prophecy his father uttered of him, as he that should be a figure of Christ in his building of the ark, and offering of sacrifice, whereby God smelled a sweet savor of rest, and said he would not curse the ground any more for man's sake, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/8-21.htm">Genesis 8:21</a>" (Ainsworth), is to extract too much from his language. Possibly he had nothing but a dim, vague expectation of some good thing - the destruction of sinners in the Flood (Chrysostom), the use of the plough (R. Solomon), the grant of animal food (Kalisch), the invention of the arts and implements of husbandry (Sherlock, Bush) - that God was about to bestow upon his weary heritage; or at most a hope that the promise would be fulfilled in his son s day (Bonar), if not in his son himself (Calovius). The fulfillment of that promise he connects with a recall of the penal curse which Jehovah had pronounced upon the soil. <span class="cmt_word">Because of the ground which the Lord</span> <span class="accented">- Jehovah</span>, by whom the curse had Been pronounced (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-17.htm">Genesis 3:17</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">hath cursed</span>. The clause is not a Jehovistic interpolation (Bleek, Davidson, Colenso), but a proof "that the Elohistic theory is unfounded" ('Speaker's Commentary'). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/genesis/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>As Adam was created in the image of God, so did he beget "in his own likeness, after his image;" that is to say, he transmitted the image of God in which he was created, not in the purity in which it came direct from God, but in the form given to it by his own self-determination, modified and corrupted by sin. The begetting of the son by whom the line was perpetuated (no doubt in every case the first-born), is followed by an account of the number of years that Adam and the other fathers lived after that, by the statement that each one begat (other) sons and daughters, by the number of years that he lived altogether, and lastly, by the assertion &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1502;&#1514; "and he died." This apparently superfluous announcement is "intended to indicate by its constant recurrence that death reigned from Adam downwards as an unchangeable law (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-14.htm">Romans 5:14</a>). But against this background of universal death, the power of life was still more conspicuous. For the man did not die till he had propagated life, so that in the midst of the death of individuals the life of the race was preserved, and the hope of the seed sustained, by which the author of death should be overcome." In the case of one of the fathers indeed, viz., Enoch (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/5-21.htm">Genesis 5:21</a>.), life had not only a different issue, but also a different form. Instead of the expression "and he lived," which introduces in every other instance the length of life after the birth of the first-born, we find in the case of Enoch this statement, "he walked with God (Elohim);" and instead of the expression "and he died," the announcement, "and he was not, for God (Elohim) took him." The phrase "walked with God," which is only applied to Enoch and Noah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-9.htm">Genesis 6:9</a>), denotes the most confidential intercourse, the closest communion with the personal God, a walking as it were by the side of God, who still continued His visible intercourse with men (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-8.htm">Genesis 3:8</a>). It must be distinguished from "walking before God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-1.htm">Genesis 17:1</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-40.htm">Genesis 24:40</a>, etc.), and "walking after God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/13-4.htm">Deuteronomy 13:4</a>), both which phrases are used to indicate a pious, moral, blameless life under the law according to the directions of the divine commands. The only other passage in which this expression "walk with God" occurs is <a href="http://biblehub.com/malachi/2-6.htm">Malachi 2:6</a>, where it denotes not the piety of the godly Israelites generally, but the conduct of the priests, who stood in a closer relation to Jehovah under the Old Testament than the rest of the faithful, being permitted to enter the Holy Place, and hold direct intercourse with Him there, which the rest of the people could not do. The article in &#1492;&#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; gives prominence to the personality of Elohim, and shows that the expression cannot refer to intercourse with the spiritual world.<p>In Enoch, the seventh from Adam through Seth, godliness attained its highest point; whilst ungodliness culminated in Lamech, the seventh from Adam through Cain, who made his sword his god. Enoch, therefore, like Elijah, was taken away by God, and carried into the heavenly paradise, so that he did not see (experience) death (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-5.htm">Hebrews 11:5</a>); i.e., he was taken up from this temporal life and transfigured into life eternal, being exempted by God from the law of death and of return to the dust, as those of the faithful will be, who shall be alive at the coming of Christ to judgment, and who in like manner shall not taste of death and corruption, but be changed in a moment. There is no foundation for the opinion, that Enoch did not participate at his translation in the glorification which awaits the righteous at the resurrection. For, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-20.htm">1 Corinthians 15:20</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-23.htm">1 Corinthians 15:23</a>, it is not in glorification, but in the resurrection, that Christ is the first-fruits. Now the latter presupposes death. Whoever, therefore, through the grace of God is exempted from death, cannot rise from the dead, but reaches &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;, or the glorified state of perfection, through being "changed" or "clothed upon" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-4.htm">2 Corinthians 5:4</a>). This does not at all affect the truth of the statement in <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/5-12.htm">Romans 5:12</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-14.htm">Romans 5:14</a>. For the same God who has appointed death as the wages of sin, and given us, through Christ, the victory over death, possesses the power to glorify into eternal life an Enoch and an Elijah, and all who shall be alive at the coming of the Lord without chaining their glorification to death and resurrection. Enoch and Elijah were translated into eternal life with God without passing through disease, death, and corruption, for the consolation of believers, and to awaken the hope of a life after death. Enoch's translation stands about half way between Adam and the flood, in the 987th year after the creation of Adam. Seth, Enos, Cainan, Mahalaleel, and Jared were still alive. His son Methuselah and his grandson Lamech were also living, the latter being 113 years old. Noah was not yet born, and Adam was dead. His translation, in consequence of his walking with God, was "an example of repentance to all generations," as the son of Sirach says (Ecclus. 44:16); and the apocryphal legend in the book of Enoch <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-9.htm">Genesis 1:9</a> represents him as prophesying of the coming of the Lord, to execute judgment upon the ungodly (Jde 1:14-15). In comparison with the longevity of the other fathers, Enoch was taken away young, before he had reached half the ordinary age, as a sign that whilst long life, viewed as a time for repentance and grace, is indeed a blessing from God, when the ills which have entered the world through sin are considered, it is also a burden and trouble which God shortens for His chosen. That the patriarchs of the old world felt the ills of this earthly life in all their severity, was attested by Lamech (<a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/5-28.htm">Genesis 5:28</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/5-29.htm">Genesis 5:29</a>), when he gave his son, who was born 69 years after Enoch's translation, the name of Noah, saying, "This same shall comfort us concerning our work and the toil of our hands, because of the ground which the Lord hath cursed." Noah, &#1504;&#1493;&#1495; from &#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; to rest and &#1492;&#1504;&#1497;&#1495; to bring rest, is explained by &#1504;&#1495;&#1501; to comfort, in the sense of helpful and remedial consolation. Lamech not only felt the burden of his work upon the ground which God had cursed, but looked forward with a prophetic presentiment to the time when the existing misery and corruption would terminate, and a change for the better, a redemption from the curse, would come. This presentiment assumed the form of hope when his son was born; he therefore gave expression to it in his name. But his hope was not realized, at least not in the way that he desired. A change did indeed take place in the lifetime of Noah. By the judgment of the flood the corrupt race was exterminated, and in Noah, who was preserved because of his blameless walk with God, the restoration of the human race was secured; but the effects of the curse, though mitigated, were not removed; whilst a covenant sign guaranteed the preservation of the human race, and therewith, by implication, his hope of the eventual removal of the curse (<a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/9-8.htm">Genesis 9:8-17</a>).<p>The genealogical table breaks off with Noah; all that is mentioned with reference to him being the birth of his three sons, when he was 500 years old (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/5-32.htm">Genesis 5:32</a>; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/11-10.htm">Genesis 11:10</a>), without any allusion to the remaining years of his life-an indication of a later hand. "The mention of three sons leads to the expectation, that whereas hitherto the line has been perpetuated through one member alone, in the future each of the three sons will form a new beginning (vid., <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/9-18.htm">Genesis 9:18-19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-1.htm">Genesis 10:1</a>)." - M. Baumgarten. </body></html>
