Not only a man like himself, consisting of body and soul, but a sinner like himself. This was the reverse of that Divine likeness in which Adam was made; having lost it, he could not convey it to his seed. Adam lived, in all, 930 years; and then died, according to the sentence passed upon him, To dust thou shalt return. Though he did not die in the day he ate forbidden fruit, yet in that very day he became mortal. Then he began to die; his whole life after was but a reprieve, a forfeited, condemned life; it was a wasting, dying life.

The first is a diary, the second is a history, the third a genealogy. The first employs the name &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501;  'e&#774;loh&#305;&#770;ym exclusively; the second uses &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; yehova&#770;h'e&#774;loh&#305;&#770;ym in the second and third chapters, and &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; yehova&#770;h usually in the fourth; the third has &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501;  'e&#774;loh&#305;&#770;ym in the first part, and &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; yehova&#770;h in the second part. The name &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501;  'e&#774;loh&#305;&#770;ym is employed in the beginning of the chapter with a manifest reference to the first document, which is here quoted and abridged.<p>This chapter contains the line from Adam to Noah, in which are stated some common particulars concerning all, and certain special details concerning three of them. The genealogy is traced to the tenth in descent from Adam, and terminates with the flood. The scope of the chapter is to mark out the line of faith and hope and holiness from Adam, the first head of the human race, to Noah, who became eventually the second natural head of it.<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/5-1.htm">Genesis 5:1-2</a><p>These verses are a recapitulation of the creation of man. The first sentence is the superscription of the new piece of composition now before us. The heading of the second document was more comprehensive. It embraced the generations, evolutions, or outworkings of the skies and the land, as soon as they were called into existence, and was accordingly dated from the third day. The present document confines itself to the generations of man, and commences, therefore, with the sixth day. The generations here are literal for the most part, though a few particulars of the individuals mentioned are recorded. But taken in a large sense this superscription will cover the whole of the history in the Old and New Testaments. It is only in the prophetic parts of these books that we reach again in the end of things to the wider compass of the heavens and the earth <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-17.htm">Isaiah 65:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-13.htm">2 Peter 3:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-1.htm">Revelation 21:1</a>. Then only does the sphere of history enlarge itself to the pristine dimensions in the proper and blessed sense, when the second Adam appears on earth, and re-connects heaven and earth in a new, holy, and everlasting covenant.<p>The present superscription differs from the former one in the introduction of the word &#1505;&#1508;&#1512;  sepher, "book". There is here some ground in the text for supposing the insertion by Moses of an authentic document, handed down from the olden time, in the great work which he was directed to compose. The chapter before us could not have been completed, indeed, until after the birth of Shem, Ham, and Japheth. But if we except the last verse, there is no impossibility or improbability in its being composed before the deluge.<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/genesis/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 5<p>Ge 5:1-32.

If, therefore, we may conjecture that the original compiler of this ancient document was Noah, than whom no one would be more likely or better qualified than he to preserve some memorial of the lost race of which he and his family were the sole survivors, it affords an additional corroboration of the intelligence and culture of the antediluvian men. It is too frequently taken for granted that the people who could build cities, invent musical instruments, and make songs were unacquainted with the art of writing; and though certainly we cannot affirm that the transmission of such a family register as is here recorded was beyond the capabilities of oral tradition, it is obvious that its preservation would be much more readily secured by some kind of documentary notation. <span class="cmt_word">Of the generations</span>  - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> evolutions (<span class="accented">tol'doth</span>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-4.htm">Genesis 2:4</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">of Adam</span>.
