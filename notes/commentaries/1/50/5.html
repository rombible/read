Grace does not destroy, but it purifies, moderates, and regulates natural affection. The departed soul is out of the reach of any tokens of our affection; but it is proper to show respect to the body, of which we look for a glorious and joyful resurrection, whatever may become of its remains in this world. Thus Joseph showed his faith in God, and love to his father. He ordered the body to be embalmed, or wrapped up with spices, to preserve it. See how vile our bodies are, when the soul has forsaken them; they will in a very little time become noisome, and offensive.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/genesis/50.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Joseph, by means of Pharaoh's courtiers, not in person, because he was a mourner, applies for leave to bury his father in the land of Kenaan, according to his oath.

Besides, Joseph deemed it right to apply for a special leave of absence; and being unfit, as a mourner, to appear in the royal presence, he made the request through the medium of others.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/genesis/50.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Here is a triple obligation upon Joseph: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

In that large cave which Abraham bought for a burying-place for his family, Jacob had digged a particular and small cell or repository for himself, as others did after him upon the like occasion. And this reason is prudently added, to show that this desire proceeded not from any contempt of Pharaoh or his land, but from that common and customary desire of persons of all ages and nations to be buried in their fathers’ sepulchres. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/genesis/50.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>My father made me swear, saying, lo, I die,.... Having reason to believe he should not live long, he sent for Joseph, and took an oath of him to do as follows; this Joseph would have observed to Pharaoh, to show the necessity of his application to him, and the reasonableness of his request. The words of dying men are always to be regarded; their dying charge is always attended to by those who have a regard to duty and honour; but much more when an oath is annexed to them, which among all nations was reckoned sacred: <p>in the grave which I have digged for me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me; it was usual with persons in their lifetime to prepare graves or sepulchres for themselves, as appears from the instances of Shebna, Joseph of Arimathea, and others, and so Jacob provided one for himself; and when he is said to "dig" it, it is not to be supposed that he dug it himself, but ordered it to be dug by his servants, and very probably this was done at the time he buried Leah. Onkelos renders it, "which I have bought", possessed or obtained by purchase; and so the word is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/3-2.htm">Hosea 3:2</a> but the cave of Machpelah, in which Jacob's grave was, was not bought by him, but by Abraham; for to say, as some Jewish writers (h) suggest, that he bought Esau's part in it with a mess of pottage, is without foundation; it is better to take the words in the first sense. And now, since it was Jacob's desire, yea, his dying charge, to be buried in the grave he had provided for himself, the mention of this to an Egyptian king could not fail of having its desired effect; since the Egyptians, as the historian (i) says, were more careful about their graves than about their houses: <p>now therefore let me go up, I pray thee; to the land of Canaan, which lay higher than Egypt: <p>and bury my father; there, in the grave he has provided for himself: <p>and I will come again: to the land of Egypt; this he would have said, lest it should be thought he only contrived this to get an opportunity of going away to Canaan with all his wealth and riches. <p>(h) R.

Both meanings are possible. LXX and Lat. favour “digged.” Syr. Pesh. and Targ. Onk. favour “bought.” The word in the Hebrew appears for “to buy” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-6.htm" title="You shall buy meat of them for money, that you may eat; and you shall also buy water of them for money, that you may drink.">Deuteronomy 2:6</a>, and for “to dig” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/26-25.htm" title="And he built an altar there, and called on the name of the LORD, and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac's servants dig a well.">Genesis 26:25</a>. It has been objected that, in the case of Jacob, neither meaning is appropriate to Machpelah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/47-30.htm" title="But I will lie with my fathers, and you shall carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their burial plot. And he said, I will do as you have said.">Genesis 47:30</a>), and that this passage refers to some other grave, e.g. that of Rachel (see note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/48-7.htm" title="And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way, when yet there was but a little way to come to Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath; the same is Bethlehem.">Genesis 48:7</a>). But it is unreasonable to press this objection. Joseph’s report of Jacob’s words might well imply, that either Jacob or his forefathers had thus provided a burial-place. Moreover, he might possibly have hewn out a burial-place for himself in the rock of the cave. On the whole, “digged” seems more appropriate than “bought.” The language is not explicit enough to throw light upon the possibly independent legend of a burial-place, where Rachel was buried (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/48-7.htm" title="And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way, when yet there was but a little way to come to Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath; the same is Bethlehem.">Genesis 48:7</a>). The tradition of a “purchase” of ground by Jacob is connected with Shechem (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/33-19.htm" title="And he bought a parcel of a field, where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father, for an hundred pieces of money.">Genesis 33:19</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-16.htm" title="And were carried over into Sychem, and laid in the sepulcher that Abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of Emmor the father of Sychem.">Acts 7:16</a>), but not with a burial-place.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">I will come again</span>] Joseph is anxious to assure his master, Pharaoh, that he is not going treacherously to leave the Egyptian service.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/genesis/49.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Death of Jacob. - After the blessing, Jacob again expressed to his twelve sons his desire to be buried in the sepulchre of his fathers (<a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24.htm">Genesis 24</a>), where Isaac and Rebekah and his own wife Leah lay by the side of Abraham and Sarah, which Joseph had already promised on oath to perform (<a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/47-29.htm">Genesis 47:29-31</a>). He then drew his feet into the bed to lie down, for he had been sitting upright while blessing his sons, and yielded up the ghost, and was gathered to his people (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-8.htm">Genesis 25:8</a>). &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1490;&#1493;&#1506; instead of &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1502;&#1514; indicates that the patriarch departed from this earthly life without a struggle.
