But as regards the fifth day, its testimony is ample. In the lowest strata of rocks, such as the Cambrian and Silurian, we find marine animals, mollusca, and trilobites; higher up in the Devonian rocks we find fish; in the Carbonaceous period we find reptiles; and above these, in the Permian, those mighty saurians, described in our version as <span class= "ital">great whales. </span>Traces of birds, even in these higher strata, if existent at all, are rare, but indubitably occur in the Triassic series. We thus learn that this fifth day covers a vast space of time, and, in accordance with what has been urged before as regards vegetation, it is probable that the introduction of the various genera and species was gradual. God does nothing in haste, and our conceptions of His marvellous working are made more clear and worthy of His greatness by the evidence which geology affords.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:20-25 God commanded the fish and fowl to be produced. This command he himself executed. Insects, which are more numerous than the birds and beasts, and as curious, seem to have been part of this day's work. The Creator's wisdom and power are to be admired as much in an ant as in an elephant. The power of God's providence preserves all things, and fruitfulness is the effect of his blessing.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/genesis/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Blessed them. - We are brought into a new sphere of creation on this day, and we meet with a new act of the Almighty.

This blessing seems to indicate that, whereas in the case of some plants many individuals of the same species were simultaneously created, so as to produce a universal covering of verdure for the land and an abundant supply of aliment for the animals about to be created - in regard to these animals a single pair only, at all events of the larger kinds, was at first called into being, from which, by the potent blessing of the Creator, was propagated the multitude by which the waters and the air were peopled. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/genesis/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Ge 1:20-23.

When the first animal life was Introduced upon our globe may be said to be as yet <span class="accented">sub judice</span>. Principal Dawson inclines to claim for the gigantic foraminifer, <span class="accented">eozoon canadense</span>, of the Laurentian rocks, the honor of being one of the first aquatic creatures that swarmed in terrestrial waters, though Professor Huxley believes that the earliest life is not represented by the oldest known fossils ('Critiques and Addresses,' 9:1873); but, whether then or at some point of time anterior introduced, geology can trace it upwards through the Paleozoic and Mesozoic eras with the result that is here so exactly defined. Throughout the long ages that fill the interval between the Azoic period of our earth's history and that which witnessed the appearance of the higher animals she is able to detect an unbroken succession of aquatic life, rising gradually from lower to higher forms - from the trilobites and mollusks of the Cambrian and Silurian systems, up through the ganoid fishes of the Devonian and the amphibians of the Carboniferous to the saurian reptiles of the Permian periods. At this point certain ornithic tracks in the superincumbent Triassic strata reveal the introduction upon the scene of winged creatures, and with this accession to its strength and Volume the stream of life flows on till the higher animals appear. Thus geology confirms the Scripture record y attesting <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the priority of marine animals and birds to land animals; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the existence of a period when the great sea monsters, with the smaller aquatic tribes and winged fowls of the air, were the sole living creatures on the globe; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> that, precisely as Elohim designed life has continued in unbroken succession since the time of its first introduction. It may also be noted that the Palaeontological history of the earth s crust suggests a number of considerations that enable us to form a conception of the fifth day's work, which, though not contravened by the Mosaic narrative, is yet by it not explicitly disclosed. For example, whereas it might seem to be the teaching of the inspired writer that the <span class="accented">tanninim</span>, the <span class="accented">tomes</span>, and the <span class="accented">birds</span> were created simultaneously, and so were synchronous in their appearance, the testimony of the rocks rather points to a series of creative acts in which successive species of living creatures were summoned into being, as the necessary conditions of existence were prepared for their reception, and indeed with emphasis asserts that the order of creation was not, as in ver. 21, first the great sea monsters, and then the creepers, and then the birds; but first the smaller aquatic tribes, and then the monsters of the deep, and finally the winged creatures of the air. This, however, is not to contradict, but to elucidate, the word of God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/genesis/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Fifth Day. - "God said: Let the waters swarm with swarms, with living beings, and let birds fly above the earth in the face (the front, i.e., the side turned towards the earth) of the firmament." &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468; and &#1497;&#1506;&#1493;&#1508;&#1507; are imperative. Earlier translators, on the contrary, have rendered the latter as a relative clause, after the &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1; of the lxx, "and with birds that fly;" thus making the birds to spring out of the water, in opposition to <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-19.htm">Genesis 2:19</a>. Even with regard to the element out of which the water animals were created the text is silent; for the assertion that &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1509; is to be understood "with a causative colouring" is erroneous, and is not sustained by <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-3.htm">Exodus 8:3</a> or <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-30.htm">Psalm 105:30</a>. The construction with the accusative is common to all verbs of multitude. &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1509; and &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1509;, to creep and swarm, is applied, "without regard to size, to those animals which congregate together in great numbers, and move about among one another." &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; &#1490;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;, anima viva, living soul, animated beings (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>), is in apposition to &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1509;, "swarms consisting of living beings." The expression applies not only to fishes, but to all water animals from the greatest to the least, including reptiles, etc. In carrying out His word, God created (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-21.htm">Genesis 1:21</a>) the great "tanninim," - lit., the long-stretched, from &#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1503;, to stretch-whales, crocodiles, and other sea-monsters; and "all moving living beings with which the waters swarm after their kind, and all (every) winged fowl after its kind." That the water animals and birds of every kind were created on the same day, and before the land animals, cannot be explained on the ground assigned by early writers, that there is a similarity between the air and the water, and a consequent correspondence between the two classes of animals. For in the light of natural history the birds are at all events quite as near to the mammalia as to the fishes; and the supposed resemblance between the fins of fishes and the wings of birds, is counterbalanced by the no less striking resemblance between birds and land animals, viz., that both have feet. The real reason is rather this, that the creation proceeds throughout from the lower to the higher; and in this ascending scale the fishes occupy to a great extent a lower place in the animal economy than birds, and both water animals and birds a lower place than land animals, more especially the mammalia. Again, it is not stated that only a single pair was created of each kind; on the contrary, the words, "let the waters swarm with living beings," seem rather to indicate that the animals were created, not only in a rich variety of genera and species, but in large numbers of individuals. The fact that but one human being was created at first, by no means warrants the conclusion that the animals were created singly also; for the unity of the human race has a very different signification from that of the so-called animal species. - (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-22.htm">Genesis 1:22</a>). As animated beings, the water animals and fowls are endowed, through the divine blessing, with the power to be fruitful and multiply. The word of blessing was the actual communication of the capacity to propagate and increase in numbers. </body></html>
