Undoubtedly it means something solid; and such was the idea of the Greeks, and probably also of the Hebrews. As such it appears in the poetry of the Bible, where it is described as a mighty vault of molten glass (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/37-18.htm" title="Have you with him spread out the sky, which is strong, and as a molten looking glass?">Job 37:18</a>), upheld by the mountains as pillars (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/26-11.htm" title="The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his reproof.">Job 26:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-8.htm" title="Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations of heaven moved and shook, because he was wroth.">2Samuel 22:8</a>), and having doors and lattices through which the Deity pours forth abundance (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/7-11.htm" title="In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.">Genesis 7:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-23.htm" title="Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven,">Psalm 78:23</a>). Even in this “Hymn of Creation” we have poetry, but not expressed in vivid metaphors, but in sober and thoughtful language. Here, therefore, the word rendered “firmament” means an <span class= "ital">expanse. </span>If, as geologists tell us, the earth at this stage was an incandescent mass, this expanse would be the ring of equilibrium, where the heat supplied from below was exactly equal to that given off by radiation into the cold ether above. And gradually this would sink lower and lower, until finally it reached the surface of the earth; and at this point the work of the second day would be complete.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/genesis/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-6.htm" title="And God said, Let there be a firmament in the middle of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.">Genesis 1:6</a></span>. <span class="ital">Let there be a firmament — </span>This term, which is an exact translation of the word used by the Septuagint, or Greek translation of the Old Testament, by no means expresses the sense of the word used by Moses, <span class="greekheb">רקיע</span>, <span class="ital">rakiang, </span>which merely means <span class="ital">extension </span>or <span class="ital">expansion. </span>And as this <span class="ital">extension </span>or <span class="ital">expansion </span>was to be in <span class="ital">the midst of the waters, </span>and was to divide the <span class="ital">waters from the waters, </span>it chiefly, if not solely, means the <span class="ital">air </span>or <span class="ital">atmosphere </span>which separates the water in the clouds from that which is in and upon the earth. Thus the second great production of the Almighty was the element which is next in simplicity, purity, activity, and power, to the light, and no doubt was also used by him as an agent in producing some subsequent effects, especially in gathering the waters into one place.

This mass of turbid and noisy water must be reduced to order, and confined within certain limits, before the land can be reached. According to the laws of material nature, light or heat must be an essential factor in all physical changes, especially in the production of gases and vapors. Hence, its presence and activity are the first thing required in instituting a new process of nature. Air naturally takes the next place, as it is equally essential to the maintenance of vegetable and animal life. Hence, its adjustment is the second step in this latest effort of creation.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-6.htm">Genesis 1:6</a><p>Let there be an expanse in the midst of the water. - For this purpose God now calls into existence the expanse. This is that interval of space between the earth on the one side and the birds on the wing, the clouds and the heavenly bodies on the other, the lower part of which we know to be occupied by the air. This will appear more clearly from a comparison of other passages in this chapter (<a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/1-14.htm">Genesis 1:14</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-20.htm">Genesis 1:20</a>).<p>And let it be dividing between water and water. - It appears that the water in a liquid state was in contact with another mass of water, in the shape of dense fogs and vapors; not merely overhanging, but actually resting on the waters beneath. The object of the expanse is to divide the waters which are under it from those which are above it. Hence, it appears that the thing really done is, not to create the space that extends indefinitely above our heads (which, being in itself no thing, but only room for things, requires no creating), but to establish in it the intended disposition of the waters in two separate masses, the one above, and the other below the intervening expanse. This we know is effected by means of the atmosphere, which receives a large body of water in the state of vapor, and bears up a visible portion of it in the form of clouds. These ever-returning and ever-varying piles of mist strike the eye of the unsophisticated spectator; and when the dew is observed on the grass, or the showers of rain, hail, and snow are seen falling on the ground, the conclusion is obvious - that above the expanse, be the distance small or great, is laid up an unseen and inexhaustible treasury of water, by which the earth may be perpetually bedewed and irrigated.<p>The aqueous vapor is itself, as well as the element with which it is mingled, invisible and impalpable; but when condensed by cold it becomes apparent to the eye in the form of mists and clouds, and, at a certain point of coolness, begins to deposit itself in the palpable form of dew, rain, hail, or snow. As soon as it becomes obvious to the sense it receives distinguishing names, according to its varying forms. But the air being invisible, is unnoticed by the primitive observer until it is put in motion, when it receives the name of wind. The space it occupies is merely denominated the expanse; that is, the interval between us and the various bodies that float above and hang upon nothing, or nothing perceptible to the eye.<p>The state of things before this creative movement may be called one of disturbance and disorder, in comparison with the present condition of the atmosphere. This disturbance in the relations of air and water was so great that it could not be reduced to the present order without a supernatural cause. Whether any other gases, noxious or innocuous, entered into the constitution of the previous atmosphere, or whether any other ingredients were once held in solution by the watery deep, we are not informed. Whether any volcanic or plutonic violence had disturbed the scene, and raised a dense mass of gaseous damp and fuliginous matter into the airy region, is not stated. How far the disorder extended we cannot tell. We are merely certain that it reached over all the land known to man during the interval between this creation and the deluge. Whether this disorder was temporary or of long standing, and whether the change was effected by altering the axis of the earth's rotation, and thereby the climate of the land of primeval man, or by a less extensive movement confined to the region under consideration, are questions on which we receive no instruction, because the solution does not concern our well-being. As soon as human welfare comes to be in any way connected with such knowledge, it will by some means be made attainable.<p>The introduction of the expanse produced a vast change for the better on the surface of the earth. The heavy mass of murky damp and aqueous steam commingling with the abyss of waters beneath is cleared away. The fogs are lifted up to the higher regions of the sky, or attenuated into an invisible vapor. A leaden mass of clouds still overshadows the heavens. But a breathing space of pure pellucid air now intervenes between the upper and lower waters, enveloping the surface of the earth, and suited for the respiration of the flora and fauna of a new world.<p>Let it be noted that the word "be" is here again employed to denote the commencement of a new adjustment of the atmosphere. This, accordingly, does not imply the absolute creation on the second day of our present atmosphere: it merely indicates the constitution of it out of the materials already at hand, - the selecting and due apportionment of the proper elements; the relegation of all now foreign elements to their own places; the dissipation of the lazy, deadening damps, and the establishment of a clear and pure air fit for the use of the future man. Any or all of these alterations will satisfy the form of expression here adopted.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/genesis/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Ge 1:6-8.

The Firmament of the Heaven<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">6</span>. <span class="ital">Let there be … waters</span>] The work of the “second day” is the creation of the so-called “firmament” of heaven. The Hebrews had no conception of an infinite ethereal space. The vault of heaven was to them a solid arched, or vaulted, structure, resting upon the pillars of the earth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/26-11.htm" title="The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his reproof.">Job 26:11</a>). On the top of this dome were the reservoirs of “the waters above the heaven,” which supplied the rain and the dew. Beneath the earth were other reservoirs of waters, which were the sources of the seas, lakes, rivers and springs. After the creation of light the next creative act was, according to the Hebrew cosmogony, the division of the primaeval watery abyss, by means of a solid partition which is here denoted by the word rendered “firmament.” The waters are above it and below it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">a firmament</span>] This word reproduces the Lat. <span class="ital">firmamentum</span>; LXX <span class="greekheb">στερέωμα</span>.

The waters under the firmament are the waters upon the globe itself; those above are not ethereal waters <p>(Note: There is no proof of the existence of such "ethereal waters" to be found in such passages as <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-6.htm">Revelation 4:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/15-2.htm">Revelation 15:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-1.htm">Revelation 22:1</a>; for what the holy seer there beholds before the throne as "a sea of glass like unto crystal mingled with fire," and "a river of living water, clear as crystal," flowing from the throne of God into the streets of the heavenly Jerusalem, are wide as the poles from any fluid or material substance from which the stars were made upon the fourth day. Of such a fluid the Scriptures know quite as little, as of the nebular theory of La Place, which, notwithstanding the bright spots in Mars and the inferior density of Jupiter, Saturn, and other planets, is still enveloped in a mist which no astronomy will ever disperse. If the waters above the firmament were the elementary matter of which the stars were made, the waters beneath must be the elementary matter of which the earth was formed; for the waters were one and the same before the creation of the firmament.) But the earth was not formed from the waters beneath; on the contrary, these waters were merely spread upon the earth and then gathered together into one place, and this place is called Sea. The earth, which appeared as dry land after the accumulation of the waters in the sea, was created in the beginning along with the heavens; but until the separation of land and water on the third day, it was so completely enveloped in water, that nothing could be seen but "the deep," or "the waters" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a>). If, therefore, in the course of the work of creation, the heaven with its stars, and the earth with its vegetation and living creatures, came forth from this deep, or, to speak more correctly, if they appeared as well-ordered, and in a certain sense as finished worlds; it would be a complete misunderstanding of the account of the creation to suppose it to teach, that the water formed the elementary matter, out of which the heaven and the earth were made with all their hosts. Had this been the meaning of the writer, he would have mentioned water as the first creation, and not the heaven and the earth. How irreconcilable the idea of the waters above the firmament being ethereal waters is with the biblical representation of the opening of the windows of heaven when it rains, is evident from the way in which Keerl, the latest supporter of this theory, sets aside this difficulty, viz., by the bold assertion, that the mass of water which came through the windows of heaven at the flood was different from the rain which falls from the clouds; in direct opposition to the text of the Scriptures, which speaks of it not merely as rain (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/7-12.htm">Genesis 7:12</a>), but as the water of the clouds. Vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-12.htm">Genesis 9:12</a>., where it is said that when God brings a cloud over the earth, He will set the rainbow in the cloud, as a sign that the water (of the clouds collected above the earth) shall not become a flood to destroy the earth again.)<p>beyond the limits of the terrestrial atmosphere, but the waters which float in the atmosphere, and are separated by it from those upon the earth, the waters which accumulate in clouds, and then bursting these their bottles, pour down as rain upon the earth. For, according to the Old Testament representation, whenever it rains heavily, the doors or windows of heaven are opened (<a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/7-11.htm">Genesis 7:11-12</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/78-23.htm">Psalm 78:23</a>, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/7-2.htm">2 Kings 7:2</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/7-19.htm">2 Kings 7:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-18.htm">Isaiah 24:18</a>). It is in (or with) the upper waters that God layeth the beams of His chambers, from which He watereth the hills (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-13.htm">Psalm 104:13</a>), and the clouds are His tabernacle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/36-29.htm">Job 36:29</a>). If, therefore, according to this conception, looking from an earthly point of view, the mass of water which flows upon the earth in showers of rain is shut up in heaven (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/8-2.htm">Genesis 8:2</a>), it is evident that it must be regarded as above the vault which spans the earth, or, according to the words of <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/148-4.htm">Psalm 148:4</a>, "above the heavens."<p>(Note: In <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-8.htm">Genesis 1:8</a> the lxx interpolates &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#834;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#788; &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd; (and God saw that it was good), and transfers the words "and it was so" from the end of <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-7.htm">Genesis 1:7</a> to the close of <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-6.htm">Genesis 1:6</a> : two apparent improvements, but in reality two arbitrary changes. The transposition is copied from <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/1-9.htm">Genesis 1:9</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/1-15.htm">Genesis 1:15</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-24.htm">Genesis 1:24</a>; and in making the interpolation, the author of the gloss has not observed that the division of the waters was not complete till the separation of the dry land from the water had taken place, and therefore the proper place for the expression of approval is at the close of the work of the third day.)  </body></html>
