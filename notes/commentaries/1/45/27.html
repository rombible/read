We faint, because we do not believe. At length, Jacob is convinced of the truth. Jacob was old, and did not expect to live long. He says, Let my eyes be refreshed with this sight before they are closed, and then I need no more to make me happy in this world. Behold Jesus manifesting himself as a Brother and a Friend to those who once were his despisers, his enemies. He assures them of his love and the riches of his grace. He commands them to lay aside envy, anger, malice, and strife, and to live in peace with each other. He teaches them to give up the world for him and his fulness. He supplies all that is needful to bring them home to himself, that where he is they may be also. And though, when he at last sends for his people, they may for a time feel some doubts and fears, yet the thought of seeing his glory and of being with him, will enable them to say, It is enough, I am willing to die; and I go to see, and to be with the Beloved of my soul.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/genesis/45.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The returning brothers inform their father of the existence and elevation of Joseph in Egypt. The aged patriarch is overcome for the moment, but at length awakens to a full apprehension of the joyful news. His heart fainted; ceased to beat for a time, fluttered, sank within him. The news was too good for him to venture all at once to believe it. But the words of Joseph, which they recite, and the wagons which he had sent, at length lead to the conviction that it must be indeed true. He is satisfied. His only thought is to go and see Joseph before he dies. A sorrow of twenty-two years' standing has now been wiped away. <p> - Jacob Goes Down to Egypt<p>9. &#1508;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;  pallu&#770;', Pallu, "distinguished." &#1495;&#1510;&#1512;&#1503; chetsro&#770;n, Chetsron, of the "court," or "village." &#1499;&#1512;&#1502;&#1497;  karm&#305;&#770;y, Karmi, "vine-dresser."<p>10. &#1497;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1500;  yemu&#770;'e&#770;l, Jemuel, "day of El." &#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1503; ya&#770;m&#305;&#770;yn, Jamin, "right hand." &#1488;&#1492;&#1491;  'o&#770;had, Ohad, "joining together." &#1497;&#1499;&#1497;&#1503;  ya&#770;k&#305;&#770;yn, Jakin, "he shall establish." &#1510;&#1495;&#1512;  tso&#770;char, Tsochar, "whiteness."<p>11. &#1490;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503;  ge&#770;resho&#770;n, Gereshon, "expelling." &#1511;&#1492;&#1514;  qeha&#770;th, Qehath, "assembly." &#1502;&#1512;&#1512;&#1497;  mera&#770;r&#305;&#770;y, Merari, "flowing, bitter."<p>12. &#1495;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;  cha&#770;mu&#770;l, Chamul, "pitied, treated with mercy."<p>13. &#1514;&#1493;&#1500;&#1506;  to&#770;la&#770;&#8219;, Tola', "worm, scarlet." &#1508;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492;  pu&#770;'a&#770;h, Puvvah, "mouth?" &#1497;&#1493;&#1489;  yo&#770;b, Job, "enemy?" &#1513;&#1474;&#1502;&#1512;&#1503;  s&#769;&#305;&#770;mro&#770;n, Shimron, "watch."<p>14. &#1505;&#1512;&#1491;  sered, Sered, "fear." &#1488;&#1500;&#1493;&#1503; 'e&#770;lo&#770;n, Elon, "oak." &#1497;&#1495;&#1500;&#1488;&#1500; yachle'e&#770;l, Jachleel, "El shall sicken or inspire with hope."<p>16. &#1510;&#1508;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503;  ts&#305;&#770;phyo&#770;n, Tsiphjon, "watcher." &#1495;&#1490;&#1497;  chagg&#305;&#770;y, Chaggi, "festive." &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; shu&#770;n&#305;&#770;y, Shuni, "quiet." &#1488;&#1510;&#1489;&#1493;&#1503;  'etsbo&#770;n, Etsbon, "toiling?" &#1506;&#1512;&#1497;  &#8219;e&#770;r&#305;&#770;y, 'Eri, "watcher." &#1488;&#1512;&#1493;&#1491;&#1497;  'a&#780;ro&#770;d&#305;&#770;y, Arodi, rover? &#1488;&#1512;&#1488;&#1500;&#1497;  'ar'e&#770;l&#305;&#770;y, Areli, "lion of El?"<p>17. &#1497;&#1502;&#1504;&#1492;  y&#305;&#770;mna&#770;h, Jimnah, "prosperity." &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1492;  y&#305;&#770;shva&#770;h, Jishvah, &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1497;  y&#305;&#770;shv&#305;&#770;y, Jishvi, "even, level." &#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1506;&#1492;  ber&#305;&#770;y&#8219;a&#770;h, Beri'ah, "in evil." &#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1495;  s&#769;erach, Serach, "overflow." &#1495;&#1489;&#1512;  cheber, Cheber, "fellowship." &#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1497;&#1488;&#1500;  malk&#305;&#770;y'e&#770;l Malkiel, "king of EL"<p>21. &#1489;&#1500;&#1506;  bela&#8219;, Bela', "devouring." &#1489;&#1499;&#1512;  beker, Beker, "a young camel." &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1500;  'ashbe&#770;l Ashbel, "short?" &#1490;&#1512;&#1488;  ge&#770;ra&#770;', Gerah, "a grain." &lt;&#1504;&#1506;&#1502;&#1503; na&#8219;a&#774;ma&#770;n, Na'aman, "pleasant." &#1488;&#1495;&#1497;  'e&#770;ch&#305;&#770;y Echi, "brotherly?" &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;  ro&#770;'sh, Rosh, "head." &#1502;&#1508;&#1497;&#1501;  mu&#770;pp&#305;&#770;ym, Muppim, &#1495;&#1508;&#1497;&#1501;  chu&#770;pp&#305;&#770;ym, Chuppim, "covering." &#1488;&#1512;&#1491; 'ard, Ard, "fugitive, rover."<p>23. &#1510;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501;  chu&#770;sh&#305;&#770;ym, Chushim, "haste."<p>24. &#1497;&#1495;&#1510;&#1488;&#1500; yachtse'e&#770;l, Jachtseel, "El will divide." &#1490;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; gu&#770;n&#305;&#770;y, Guni, "dyed." &#1497;&#1510;&#1512;  ye&#770;tser, Jetser, "form." &#1513;&#1474;&#1500;&#1501;  s&#769;&#305;&#770;lle&#770;m, Shillem, "retribution."<p>The second dream of Joseph is now to receive its fulfillment.
