This is the meaning given to the passage in all the versions, and agrees with Joseph’s efforts to quiet their fears, and convince them of his good intentions. Several modern commentators, however, translate “Be not afraid of the journey,” but on insufficient grounds.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/genesis/45.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/45-24.htm" title="So he sent his brothers away, and they departed: and he said to them, See that you fall not out by the way.">Genesis 45:24</a></span>. <span class="ital">See that ye fall not out by the way — </span>He knew that they were but too apt to be quarrelsome; and that what had lately passed, as it revived the remembrance of what they had done formerly against their brother, might give them occasion to quarrel.

Egypt would make up the losses of their removal. Thus those for whom Christ intends his heavenly glory, ought not to regard the things of this world. The best of its enjoyments are but lumber; we cannot make sure of them while here, much less can we carry them away with us. Let us not set our eyes or hearts upon the world; there are better things for us in that blessed land, whither Christ, our Joseph, is gone to prepare a place. Joseph dismissed his brethren with a seasonable caution, See that ye fall not out by the way. He knew they were too apt to be quarrelsome; and having forgiven them all, he lays this charge upon them, not to upbraid one another. This command our Lord Jesus has given to us, that we love one another, and that whatever happens, or has happened, we fall not out. For we are brethren, we have all one Father. We are all guilty, and instead of quarrelling with one another, have reason to fall out with ourselves. We are, or hope to be, forgiven of God, whom we have all offended, and, therefore, should be ready to forgive one another. We are by the way, a way through the land of Egypt, where we have many eyes upon us, that seek advantage against us; a way that leads to the heavenly Canaan, where we hope to be for ever in perfect peace.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/genesis/45.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The brothers joyfully accept the hospitable invitation of Pharaoh, and set about the necessary arrangements for their journey. "The sons of Israel;" including Joseph, who had his own part to perform in the proposed arrangement. "At the mouth of Pharaoh;" as he had authorized him to do. "Changes of raiment;" fine raiment for change on a high or happy day. To Benjamin he gives special marks of fraternal affection, which no longer excite any jealous feeling among the brothers, as the reasonableness of them is obvious. "Fall out." The original word means to be stirred by any passion, whether fear or anger, and interpreters explain it as they conceive the circumstances and the context require. The English version corresponds with the Septuagint &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;  orgizesthe and with Onkelos. It refers, perhaps, to the little flashes of heat, impatience, and contention that are accustomed to disturb the harmony of companions in the East, who behave sometimes like overgrown children. Such ebullitions often lead to disastrous consequences. Joseph's exile arose from petty jealousies among brethren.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/genesis/45.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>24. so he sent his brethren away&#8212;In dismissing them on their homeward journey, he gave them this particular admonition:<p>See that ye fall not out by the way&#8212;a caution that would be greatly needed; for not only during the journey would they be occupied in recalling the parts they had respectively acted in the events that led to Joseph's being sold into Egypt, but their wickedness would soon have to come to the knowledge of their venerable father.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/genesis/45.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="ital">Or contend</span> one with another, each vindicating himself, and laying the blame upon his brother. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/genesis/45.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>So he sent his brethren away, and they departed,....

The Heb. word which he uses is not common. It occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/4-4.htm" title="Stand in awe, and sin not: commune with your own heart on your bed, and be still. Selah.">Psalm 4:4</a>, “Stand in awe” (R.V. marg. <span class="ital">be ye angry</span>). So here LXX <span class="greekheb">μὴ ὀργίζεσθε</span>; Lat. <span class="ital">ne irascamini</span>. The meaning then will be, “do not get excited, quarrel not, and dispute not” with one another about the degree of your guilt in your treatment of me. Cf. Reuben’s reproaches in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/42-22.htm" title="And Reuben answered them, saying, Spoke I not to you, saying, Do not sin against the child; and you would not hear? therefore, behold, also his blood is required.">Genesis 42:22</a>. The suggestion that he warns them against being indignant at the especial favours and gifts lavished upon Benjamin is not probable. A different rendering, “be not alarmed,” in the sense of “do not give way to the fear that I am nursing my revenge and am meditating an outbreak of wrath against you at a later time,” is hardly warranted, either by the use of the verb or by the context. But see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/50-15.htm" title="And when Joseph's brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, Joseph will peradventure hate us, and will certainly requite us all the evil which we did to him....">Genesis 50:15-21</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/45.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - So (literally, and) he sent his brethren away, and they departed: and he said unto them, See that ye fall not out by the way.

The report of the arrival of Joseph's brethren soon found it sway into the palace, and made so favourable an impression upon Pharaoh and his courtiers, that the king sent a message through Joseph to his brethren to come with their father and their families ("your houses") into Egypt, saying that he would give them "the good of the land of Egypt," and they should eat "the fat of the land." &#1496;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;, "the good," is not the best part, but the good things (produce) of the land, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/45-20.htm">Genesis 45:20</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/45-23.htm">Genesis 45:23</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-10.htm">Genesis 24:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-9.htm">2 Kings 8:9</a>. &#1495;&#1500;&#1489;, fat, i.e., the finest productions. </body></html>
