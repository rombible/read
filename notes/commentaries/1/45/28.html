It rather shows that the names were long both in use as regards the patriarch personally, but as the title of Israel was alone given to Jacob’s family, it is plain that a high significance was attached to it, and that the inheritance of the Abrahamic promises was at an early date connected therewith.<p><span class= "bld"><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/45.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>45:25-28 To hear that Joseph is alive, is too good news to be true; Jacob faints, for he believes it not. We faint, because we do not believe. At length, Jacob is convinced of the truth. Jacob was old, and did not expect to live long. He says, Let my eyes be refreshed with this sight before they are closed, and then I need no more to make me happy in this world. Behold Jesus manifesting himself as a Brother and a Friend to those who once were his despisers, his enemies. He assures them of his love and the riches of his grace. He commands them to lay aside envy, anger, malice, and strife, and to live in peace with each other. He teaches them to give up the world for him and his fulness. He supplies all that is needful to bring them home to himself, that where he is they may be also. And though, when he at last sends for his people, they may for a time feel some doubts and fears, yet the thought of seeing his glory and of being with him, will enable them to say, It is enough, I am willing to die; and I go to see, and to be with the Beloved of my soul.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/genesis/45.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The returning brothers inform their father of the existence and elevation of Joseph in Egypt. The aged patriarch is overcome for the moment, but at length awakens to a full apprehension of the joyful news. His heart fainted; ceased to beat for a time, fluttered, sank within him. The news was too good for him to venture all at once to believe it. But the words of Joseph, which they recite, and the wagons which he had sent, at length lead to the conviction that it must be indeed true. He is satisfied. His only thought is to go and see Joseph before he dies. A sorrow of twenty-two years' standing has now been wiped away. <p> - Jacob Goes Down to Egypt<p>9. &#1508;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;  pallu&#770;', Pallu, "distinguished." &#1495;&#1510;&#1512;&#1503; chetsro&#770;n, Chetsron, of the "court," or "village." &#1499;&#1512;&#1502;&#1497;  karm&#305;&#770;y, Karmi, "vine-dresser."<p>10. &#1497;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1500;  yemu&#770;'e&#770;l, Jemuel, "day of El." &#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1503; ya&#770;m&#305;&#770;yn, Jamin, "right hand." &#1488;&#1492;&#1491;  'o&#770;had, Ohad, "joining together." &#1497;&#1499;&#1497;&#1503;  ya&#770;k&#305;&#770;yn, Jakin, "he shall establish." &#1510;&#1495;&#1512;  tso&#770;char, Tsochar, "whiteness."<p>11. &#1490;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503;  ge&#770;resho&#770;n, Gereshon, "expelling." &#1511;&#1492;&#1514;  qeha&#770;th, Qehath, "assembly." &#1502;&#1512;&#1512;&#1497;  mera&#770;r&#305;&#770;y, Merari, "flowing, bitter."<p>12. &#1495;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;  cha&#770;mu&#770;l, Chamul, "pitied, treated with mercy."<p>13. &#1514;&#1493;&#1500;&#1506;  to&#770;la&#770;&#8219;, Tola', "worm, scarlet." &#1508;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492;  pu&#770;'a&#770;h, Puvvah, "mouth?" &#1497;&#1493;&#1489;  yo&#770;b, Job, "enemy?" &#1513;&#1474;&#1502;&#1512;&#1503;  s&#769;&#305;&#770;mro&#770;n, Shimron, "watch."<p>14. &#1505;&#1512;&#1491;  sered, Sered, "fear." &#1488;&#1500;&#1493;&#1503; 'e&#770;lo&#770;n, Elon, "oak." &#1497;&#1495;&#1500;&#1488;&#1500; yachle'e&#770;l, Jachleel, "El shall sicken or inspire with hope."<p>16. &#1510;&#1508;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503;  ts&#305;&#770;phyo&#770;n, Tsiphjon, "watcher." &#1495;&#1490;&#1497;  chagg&#305;&#770;y, Chaggi, "festive." &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; shu&#770;n&#305;&#770;y, Shuni, "quiet." &#1488;&#1510;&#1489;&#1493;&#1503;  'etsbo&#770;n, Etsbon, "toiling?" &#1506;&#1512;&#1497;  &#8219;e&#770;r&#305;&#770;y, 'Eri, "watcher." &#1488;&#1512;&#1493;&#1491;&#1497;  'a&#780;ro&#770;d&#305;&#770;y, Arodi, rover? &#1488;&#1512;&#1488;&#1500;&#1497;  'ar'e&#770;l&#305;&#770;y, Areli, "lion of El?"<p>17. &#1497;&#1502;&#1504;&#1492;  y&#305;&#770;mna&#770;h, Jimnah, "prosperity." &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1492;  y&#305;&#770;shva&#770;h, Jishvah, &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1497;  y&#305;&#770;shv&#305;&#770;y, Jishvi, "even, level." &#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1506;&#1492;  ber&#305;&#770;y&#8219;a&#770;h, Beri'ah, "in evil." &#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1495;  s&#769;erach, Serach, "overflow." &#1495;&#1489;&#1512;  cheber, Cheber, "fellowship." &#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1497;&#1488;&#1500;  malk&#305;&#770;y'e&#770;l Malkiel, "king of EL"<p>21. &#1489;&#1500;&#1506;  bela&#8219;, Bela', "devouring." &#1489;&#1499;&#1512;  beker, Beker, "a young camel." &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1500;  'ashbe&#770;l Ashbel, "short?" &#1490;&#1512;&#1488;  ge&#770;ra&#770;', Gerah, "a grain." &lt;&#1504;&#1506;&#1502;&#1503; na&#8219;a&#774;ma&#770;n, Na'aman, "pleasant." &#1488;&#1495;&#1497;  'e&#770;ch&#305;&#770;y Echi, "brotherly?" &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;  ro&#770;'sh, Rosh, "head." &#1502;&#1508;&#1497;&#1501;  mu&#770;pp&#305;&#770;ym, Muppim, &#1495;&#1508;&#1497;&#1501;  chu&#770;pp&#305;&#770;ym, Chuppim, "covering." &#1488;&#1512;&#1491; 'ard, Ard, "fugitive, rover."<p>23. &#1510;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501;  chu&#770;sh&#305;&#770;ym, Chushim, "haste."<p>24. &#1497;&#1495;&#1510;&#1488;&#1500; yachtse'e&#770;l, Jachtseel, "El will divide." &#1490;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; gu&#770;n&#305;&#770;y, Guni, "dyed." &#1497;&#1510;&#1512;  ye&#770;tser, Jetser, "form." &#1513;&#1474;&#1500;&#1501;  s&#769;&#305;&#770;lle&#770;m, Shillem, "retribution."<p>The second dream of Joseph is now to receive its fulfillment.

Or it is "much" or "great" (m); he had much joy, as the Targums; this was the greatest blessing of all, and more to him than all the glory and splendour that Joseph was in; that he was alive, that was enough for Jacob, which gave him content and pleasure; not so much the news of his grandeur in Egypt, as of his being in the land of the living: <p>I will go and see him before I die; though his age was great, the journey long and difficult, so great was his desire of seeing Joseph, that he determines at once upon going, expecting death shortly: no doubt but this was said in submission to the will of God, and in seeking him by prayer and supplication, and in the exercise of faith, believing that God would grant him his desire, than which nothing in life could be more desirable to him, and he only wished to live to enjoy this favour. In Joseph's making himself known unto his brethren, he was a type of Christ, who manifests himself to his people alone, and as he does not unto the world, saying unto them, that he is Jesus the Saviour, their friend and brother, and whom they crucified, whose sins were the cause of his sufferings; and yet encourages them to draw nigh unto him with an humble and holy boldness, giving them abundant reason to believe that he will receive them kindly, seeing that all that were done to him were by the determined counsel and foreknowledge of God, and for their good, even for their eternal salvation; and that they might not perish, but have everlasting life; and to whom he now gives change of raiment, riches and honour, yea, durable riches and righteousness; and declares it to be his will, that where he is, they may be also, and behold his glory: and this is sufficient to engage them to reckon all their worldly enjoyments as mere stuff, contemptible things in comparison of the good and glories of another world they are hastening to, where there will be fulness of joy, and pleasures for evermore; and therefore should not fall out by the way, as they too often do. <p>(m) "multum", Montanus, Munster, Drusius, Schmidt;   Sept. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/genesis/45.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And Israel said, It is enough; Joseph my son is yet alive: I will go and see him before I die.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/genesis/45.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">28</span>. <span class="ital">It is enough</span>] Lat. <span class="ital">sufficit mihi</span>.
