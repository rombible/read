Give God the best. We build ourselves ceiled houses and the ark dwells in curtains. Pagans build elaborate temples, but their houses are hovels.

The stones of Jacob’s altar may be standing yet. The Parthenon of Athens remains: where are the hovels of the people? ‘He that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.’ Permanent results of transitory deeds.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/genesis/13.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/13-3.htm" title="And he went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel, to the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Hai;">Genesis 13:3</a></span>. <span class="ital">He went on to Beth-el — </span>Because there he had formerly had an altar, and although the altar had fallen down, as being probably built of earth, or had been taken down by Abram, lest it should be polluted by the idolatrous Canaanites; yet he came to the <span class="ital">place of the altar, </span>either to revive the remembrance of the communion he had had with God at that place, or perhaps to pay the vows he had there made to God, when he undertook his journey into Egypt. And there Abram, prevented by no legal restraints, deterred by no <span class="ital">pains </span>or <span class="ital">penalties, </span>or insurrection of the inhabitants, although idolaters, “called on the name of the Lord,” worshipped God by prayer and thanksgiving, by offering sacrifices, and instructing his family, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-19.htm" title="For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD, to do justice and judgment; that the LORD may bring on Abraham that which he has spoken of him.">Genesis 18:19</a>.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/13.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>13:1-4 Abram was very rich: he was very heavy, so the Hebrew word is; for riches are a burden; and they that will be rich, do but load themselves with thick clay, Hab 2:6. There is a burden of care in getting riches, fear in keeping them, temptation in using them, guilt in abusing them, sorrow in losing them, and a burden of account at last to be given up about them. Yet God in his providence sometimes makes good men rich men, and thus God's blessing made Abram rich without sorrow, Pr 10:22. Though it is hard for a rich man to get to heaven, yet in some cases it may be, Mr 10:23,24. Nay, outward prosperity, if well managed, is an ornament to piety, and an opportunity for doing more good. Abram removed to Beth-el. His altar was gone, so that he could not offer sacrifice; but he called on the name of the Lord. You may as soon find a living man without breath as one of God's people without prayer.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/genesis/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div> - Abram and Lot Separate<p>7. &#1508;&#1512;&#1494;&#1497;  per&#305;&#770;z&#305;&#770;y, Perizzi, "descendant of Paraz." &#1508;&#1512;&#1494;  pa&#772;ra&#772;z, "leader," or inhabitant of the plain or open country.<p>10. &#1499;&#1499;&#1512;  k&#305;&#770;kar, "circle, border, vale, cake, talent;" related: "bow, bend, go round, dance." &#1497;&#1512;&#1491;&#1503;  yarde&#772;n, Jardan, "descending."

But it becomes gradually manifest that he has an independent interest, and is no longer disposed to follow the fortunes of the chosen of God. In the natural course of things, this under-feeling comes to the surface. Their serfs come into collision; and as Abram makes no claim of authority over Lot, he offers him the choice of a dwelling-place in the land. This issues in a peaceable separation, in which Abram appears to great advantage. The chosen of the Lord is now in the course of providence isolated from all associations of kindred. He stands alone, in a strange land. He again obeys the summons to survey the land promised to him and his seed in perpetuity.<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/13-1.htm">Genesis 13:1-4</a><p>Went up out of Mizraim. - Egypt is a low-lying valley, out of which the traveler ascends into Arabia Petraea and the hill-country of Kenaan. Abram returns, a wiser and a better man. When called to leave his native land, he had immediately obeyed. Such obedience evinced the existence of the new power of godliness in his breast. But he gets beyond the land of promise into a land of carnality, and out of the way of truth into a way of deceit. Such a course betrays the struggle between moral good and evil which has begun within him. This discovery humbles and vexes him. Self-condemnation and repentance are at work within him. We do not know that all these feelings rise into consciousness, but we have no doubt that their result, in a subdued, sobered, chastened spirit, is here, and will soon manifest itself.<p>And Lot with him. - Lot accompanied him into Egypt, because he comes with him out of it. The south is so called in respect, not to Egypt, but to the land of promise. It acquired this title before the times of the patriarch, among the Hebrew-speaking tribes inhabiting it. The great riches of Abram consist in cattle and the precious metals. The former is the chief form of wealth in the East. Abram's flocks are mentioned in preparation for the following occurrence. He advances north to the place between Bethel and Ai, and perhaps still further, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/13-4.htm">Genesis 13:4</a>, to the place of Shekem, where he built the first altar in the land. He now calls on the name of the Lord. The process of contrition in a new heart, has come to its right issue in confession and supplication. The sense of acceptance with God, which he had before experienced in these places of meeting with God, he has now recovered. The spirit of adoption, therefore, speaks within him.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/genesis/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. went on his journeys&#8212;His progress would be by slow marches and frequent encampments as Abram had to regulate his movements by the prospect of water and pasturage.<p>unto the place &#8230; between Beth-el and Hai&#8212;"a conspicuous hill&#8212;its topmost summit resting on the rocky slopes below, and distinguished by its olive groves&#8212;offering a natural base for the altar and a fitting shade for the tent of the patriarch" [Stanley].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/genesis/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">He went on his journey, </span> or rather, <span class="ital">according to his journeys, </span> which he took as he came, going in the same road, and resting in the same place, of which he had experience. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/genesis/13.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he went on in his journeys from the south,....

As Sarah was then 65 years old (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-17.htm">Genesis 17:17</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-4.htm">Genesis 12:4</a>), her beauty at such an age has been made a difficulty by some. But as she lived to the age of 127 (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/23-1.htm">Genesis 23:1</a>), she was then middle-aged; and as her vigour and bloom had not been tried by bearing children, she might easily appear very beautiful in the eyes of the Egyptians, whose wives, according to both ancient and modern testimony, were generally ugly, and faded early. Pharaoh (the Egyptian ouro, king, with the article Pi) is the Hebrew name for all the Egyptian kings in the Old Testament; their proper names being only occasionally mentioned, as, for example, Necho in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-29.htm">2 Kings 23:29</a>, or Hophra in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-30.htm">Jeremiah 44:30</a>. For Sarai's sake Pharaoh treated Abram well, presenting him with cattle and slaves, possessions which constitute the wealth of nomads. These presents Abram could not refuse, though by accepting them he increased his sin. God then interfered (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-17.htm">Genesis 12:17</a>), and smote Pharaoh and his house with great plagues. What the nature of these plagues was, cannot be determined; they were certainly of such a kind, however, that whilst Sarah was preserved by them from dishonour, Pharaoh saw at once that they were sent as punishment by the Deity on account of his relation to Sarai; he may also have learned, on inquiry from Sarai herself, that she was Abram's wife. He gave her back to him, therefore, with a reproof for his untruthfulness, and told him to depart, appointing men to conduct him out of the land together with his wife and all his possessions. &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;, to dismiss, to give an escort (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-16.htm">Genesis 18:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-27.htm">Genesis 31:27</a>), does not necessarily denote an involuntary dismissal here. For as Pharaoh had discovered in the plague the wrath of the God of Abraham, he did not venture to treat him harshly, but rather sought to mitigate the anger of his God, by the safe-conduct which he granted him on his departure. But Abram was not justified by this result, as was very apparent from the fact, that he was mute under Pharaoh's reproofs, and did not venture to utter a single word in vindication of his conduct, as he did in the similar circumstances described in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/10-11.htm">Genesis 10:11-12</a>. The saving mercy of God had so humbled him, that he silently acknowledged his guilt in concealing his relation to Sarah from the Egyptian king. </body></html>
