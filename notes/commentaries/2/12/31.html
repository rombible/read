(See above, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/11-8.htm" title="And all these your servants shall come down to me, and bow down themselves to me, saying, Get you out, and all the people that follow you: and after that I will go out. And he went out from Pharaoh in a great anger.">Exodus 11:8</a>.) The messengers were undoubtedly chief officials; they “bowed themselves down” before Moses, who was now recognised as “very great” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/11-3.htm" title="And the LORD gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians. Moreover the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in the sight of Pharaoh's servants, and in the sight of the people.">Exodus 11:3</a>), and delivered their master’s message, which granted in express terms all that Moses had ever demanded. Pharaoh’s spirit was, for the time, thoroughly broken.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/exodus/12.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/12-31.htm" title="And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up, and get you forth from among my people, both you and the children of Israel; and go, serve the LORD, as you have said....">Exodus 12:31-32</a></span>. <span class="ital">Rise up, and get you forth — Pha</span>raoh had told Moses he should <span class="ital">see his face no more, </span>but now he sent for him; those will seek God in their distress, who before had set him at defiance.

The plague struck their first-born, the joy and hope of their families. They had slain the Hebrews' children, now God slew theirs. It reached from the throne to the dungeon: prince and peasant stand upon the same level before God's judgments. The destroying angel entered every dwelling unmarked with blood, as the messenger of woe. He did his dreadful errand, leaving not a house in which there was not one dead. Imagine then the cry that rang through the land of Egypt, the long, loud shriek of agony that burst from every dwelling. It will be thus in that dreadful hour when the Son of man shall visit sinners with the last judgment. God's sons, his first-born, were now released. Men had better come to God's terms at first, for he will never come to theirs. Now Pharaoh's pride is abased, and he yields. God's word will stand; we get nothing by disputing, or delaying to submit. In this terror the Egyptians would purchase the favour and the speedy departure of Israel. Thus the Lord took care that their hard-earned wages should be paid, and the people provided for their journey.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This plague is distinctly attributed here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-23.htm">Exodus 12:23</a> to the personal intervention of the Lord; but it is to be observed that although the Lord Himself passed through to smite the Egyptians, He employed the agency of "the destroyer" <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-23.htm">Exodus 12:23</a>, in whom, in accordance with <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-28.htm">Hebrews 11:28</a>, all the ancient versions, and most critics, recognize an Angel (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-35.htm">2 Kings 19:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-16.htm">2 Samuel 24:16</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/exodus/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>31. called for Moses and Aaron&#8212;a striking fulfilment of the words of Moses (Ex 11:8), and showing that they were spoken under divine suggestion.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/exodus/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/exodus/12.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he called for Moses and Aaron by night,.... Not that Pharaoh went in person, but he sent his servants to call them; for they never saw his face more after he had drove them from his presence; but now was fulfilled what Moses told him, that his servants should come to him in a very suppliant manner, and entreat him and his people to get away in all haste, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-28.htm">Exodus 10:28</a>. Where Moses and Aaron now were is not certain, probably in the city, or suburbs of it, where Pharaoh's palace was, for it is not likely that they were gone to Goshen: <p>and said, rise up; from their beds in which they now were, being midnight: <p>and get ye forth from among my people, both ye and the children of Israel; even all of them, without any exception of women or children as before; and without limiting them to place or time, where they should go, and how long they should stay, and without obliging them to promise to return: <p>and go, serve the Lord, as ye have said; as they had entreated they might, and as they had demanded in the name of the Lord that they should; to which now he gave his consent, though he afterwards repented of it. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/exodus/12.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up, and get you forth from among my people, both ye and the children of Israel; and go, serve the LORD, as ye have said.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/exodus/12.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">31</span>. <span class="ital">as ye have said</span>] <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-18.htm" title="And they shall listen to your voice: and you shall come, you and the elders of Israel, to the king of Egypt, and you shall say to him, The LORD God of the Hebrews has met with us: and now let us go, we beseech you, three days' journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God.">Exodus 3:18</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/5-3.htm" title="And they said, The God of the Hebrews has met with us: let us go, we pray you, three days' journey into the desert, and sacrifice to the LORD our God; lest he fall on us with pestilence, or with the sword.">Exodus 5:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-16.htm" title="And you shall say to him, The LORD God of the Hebrews has sent me to you, saying, Let my people go, that they may serve me in the wilderness: and, behold, till now you would not hear.">Exodus 7:16</a> (all J). It seems therefore (Di.) that the Pharaoh only gives leave for a temporary absence.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">31, 32</span>. The Pharaoh hastily summons Moses and Aaron, and gives permission for the people to go and serve Yahweh with their flocks and herds, as they had requested. ‘The passage has sometimes been deemed inconsistent with <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-29.htm" title="And Moses said, You have spoken well, I will see your face again no more.">Exodus 10:29</a>. But there is a difference between seeking an audience to demand leave to depart or threaten chastisement, and response to the urgent summons of the stricken king’ (C.-H.).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 31-36.</span> - THE DISMISSAL The first action seems to have been taken by Pharaoh. The "cry" of the people had no doubt been heard in the palace, and he was aware that the blow had not fallen on himself alone, and may have anticipated what the people's feelings would be; but he did not wait for any direct pressure to be put upon him before yielding. He sent his chief officers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/11-8.htm">Exodus 11:8</a>) while it was still night (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-31.htm">Exodus 12:31</a>), to inform Moses and Aaron, not only that they might, but that they must take their departure immediately, with all the people, and added that they might take with them their flocks and herds. The surrender was thus complete; and it was accompanied by a request which we should scarcely have expected. Pharaoh craved at the hands of the two brothers a blessing! We are not told how his request was received; but that it should have been made is a striking indication of how his pride was humbled. The overture from Pharaoh was followed rapidly by a popular movement, which was universal and irresistible. The Egyptians "rose up" everywhere, and "were urgent upon the people," to "send them out of the land in haste" (ver. 33); and to expedite their departure readily supplied them at their request with gold and silver and raiment (ver. 35), thus voluntarily spoiling themselves for the benefit of the foreigners. The Israelites, long previously prepared for the moment which had now arrived, made their final arrangements, and before the day was over a lengthy column was set in motion, and proceeded from Rameses, which seems to have been a suburb of Tunis (Brugsch, <span class="accented">Hist</span>.  <span class="accented">of Egypt</span>, vol. 2. pp. 96-99), to an unknown place called Succoth, which must have lain towards the south-east, and was probably not very remote from the capital <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he called for Moses and Aaron</span>. Kalisch understands this as a summons to the King's presence (Commentary, p. 130), and even supposes that the two brothers complied, notwithstanding what Moses had said (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-29.htm">Exodus 10:29</a>). But perhaps no more is meant than at Pharaoh's instance Moses and Aaron were summoned to an interview with some of the Court officials (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/11-8.htm">Exodus 11:8</a>). As ye have said. Literally, "according to your words." The reference is to such passages as <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-1.htm">Exodus 8:1, 20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-1.htm">Exodus 9:1, 13</a>. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/exodus/12.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-13.htm">Exodus 12:13</a>). "He will not suffer (&#1497;&#1514;&#1468;&#1503;) the destroyer to come into your houses:" Jehovah effected the destruction of the first-born through &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1497;&#1514;, the destroyer, or destroying angel, &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3bf;&#788;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-28.htm">Hebrews 11:28</a>), i.e., not a fallen angel, but the angel of Jehovah, in whom Jehovah revealed Himself to the patriarchs and Moses. This is not at variance with <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-49.htm">Psalm 78:49</a>; for the writer of this psalm regards not only the slaying of the first-born, but also the pestilence (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/9-1.htm">Exodus 9:1-7</a>), as effected through the medium of angels of evil: though, according to the analogy of <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-17.htm">1 Samuel 13:17</a>, &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1497;&#1514; might certainly be understood collectively as applying to a company of angels. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-24.htm">Exodus 12:24</a>. "This word," i.e., the instructions respecting the Passover, they were to regard as an institution for themselves and their children for ever (&#1506;&#1491;&#1470;&#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501; in the same sense as &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/17-7.htm">Genesis 17:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-13.htm">Genesis 17:13</a>); and when dwelling in the promised land, they were to explain the meaning of this service to their sons. The ceremony is called &#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1492;, "service," inasmuch as it was the fulfilment of a divine command, a performance demanded by God, though it promoted the good of Israel.</body></html>
