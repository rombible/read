In every family in which the firstborn child had been a male, that child was stricken with death. Pharaoh’s firstborn son—the <span class= "ital">erpa suten sa</span>—the heir to his throne, was taken; and so in all other families. Nobles, priests, tradesmen, artisans, peasants, fishermen—all alike suffered. In the hyperbolic language of the narrator, “there was not a house where there was not one dead.” And the deaths took place “at midnight,” in the weirdest hour, at the most silent time, in the deepest darkness. So it had been prophesied (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/11-4.htm" title="And Moses said, Thus said the LORD, About midnight will I go out into the middle of Egypt:">Exodus 11:4</a>); but the particular night had not been announced. As several days had elapsed since the announcement, the Egyptians may have been wrapt in fancied security. Suddenly the calamity fell upon them and “there was a great cry.” Death did not come, as upon the host of Sennacherib, noiselessly, unperceivedly, but <span class= "ital">“</span>with observation.” Those who were seized woke up and aroused their relatives. There was a cry for help, a general alarm, a short, sharp struggle and then a death.<p>The visitation is ordinarily ascribed to God Himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-23.htm" title="And I say to you, Let my son go, that he may serve me: and if you refuse to let him go, behold, I will slay your son, even your firstborn.">Exodus 4:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/11-4.htm" title="And Moses said, Thus said the LORD, About midnight will I go out into the middle of Egypt:">Exodus 11:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-12.htm" title="For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment: I am the LORD.">Exodus 12:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-27.htm" title="That you shall say, It is the sacrifice of the LORD's passover, who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses. And the people bowed the head and worshipped.">Exodus 12:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-29.htm" title="And it came to pass, that at midnight the LORD smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sat on his throne to the firstborn of the captive that was in the dungeon; and all the firstborn of cattle.">Exodus 12:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-15.htm" title="And it came to pass, when Pharaoh would hardly let us go, that the LORD slew all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the firstborn of man, and the firstborn of beast: therefore I sacrifice to the LORD all that opens the matrix, being males; but all the firstborn of my children I redeem.">Exodus 13:15</a>, &c), but in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-23.htm" title="For the LORD will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when he sees the blood on the lintel, and on the two side posts, the LORD will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come in to your houses to smite you.">Exodus 12:23</a> to “the destroyer.” It has been already shown that this expression points to angelic agency. That agency, however, does not exclude a further natural one. As in 2 Samuel 24 the seventy thousand whom the destroying angel killed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-16.htm" title="And in the first day there shall be an holy convocation, and in the seventh day there shall be an holy convocation to you; no manner of work shall be done in them, save that which every man must eat, that only may be done of you.">Exodus 12:16</a>) are said to have been slain by a pestilence (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-15.htm" title="Seven days shall you eat unleavened bread; even the first day you shall put away leaven out of your houses: for whoever eats leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel.">Exodus 12:15</a>), so it may have been here. Pestilence often rages in Egypt in the spring of the year, and carries off thousands in a very short space. As with so many of the other plagues, God may here too have employed a natural agency. None the less would the plague have been miraculous—(1) in its intensity; (2) in its coming at the time prophesied, viz., midnight; (3) in its selection of victims, viz., the firstborn males only, and all of them; (4) in its avoidance of the Israelites; and (5) in its extension, as prophesied, to the firstborn of animals.<p>(29) <span class= "bld">All the firstborn.</span>—The Hebrew word used applies only to males.<p><span class= "bld">The firstborn of Pharaoh.</span>—The law of primogeniture prevailed in Egypt, as elsewhere generally. The Pharaoh’s eldest son was recognised as “hereditary crown prince,” and sometimes associated in the kingdom during his father’s lifetime. This had been the case with Lameses II., probably the Pharaoh from whom Moses fled (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/2-15.htm" title="Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelled in the land of Midian: and he sat down by a well.">Exodus 2:15</a>); but the practice was not common. In any case, however, the eldest son of the reigning monarch occupied a most important position, and his loss would be felt as a national calamity.<p><span class= "bld">The firstborn of the captive.</span>—The variation of phrase between this verse and <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/11-5.htm" title="And all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the first born of Pharaoh that sits on his throne, even to the firstborn of the maidservant that is behind the mill; and all the firstborn of beasts.">Exodus 11:5</a> is curious, but appears not to be of any significance. The writer simply means, in both places, “all, from the highest to the lowest.”<p><span class= "bld">All the firstborn of cattle.</span>—Rather, <span class= "ital">of beasts,</span> as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/11-5.htm" title="And all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the first born of Pharaoh that sits on his throne, even to the firstborn of the maidservant that is behind the mill; and all the firstborn of beasts.">Exodus 11:5</a>. (On the reasons for beasts being included in the calamity, see the Note on that passage.)<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/12.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>12:29-36 The Egyptians had been for three days and nights kept in anxiety and horror by the darkness; now their rest is broken by a far more terrible calamity. The plague struck their first-born, the joy and hope of their families. They had slain the Hebrews' children, now God slew theirs. It reached from the throne to the dungeon: prince and peasant stand upon the same level before God's judgments. The destroying angel entered every dwelling unmarked with blood, as the messenger of woe. He did his dreadful errand, leaving not a house in which there was not one dead. Imagine then the cry that rang through the land of Egypt, the long, loud shriek of agony that burst from every dwelling. It will be thus in that dreadful hour when the Son of man shall visit sinners with the last judgment. God's sons, his first-born, were now released. Men had better come to God's terms at first, for he will never come to theirs. Now Pharaoh's pride is abased, and he yields. God's word will stand; we get nothing by disputing, or delaying to submit. In this terror the Egyptians would purchase the favour and the speedy departure of Israel. Thus the Lord took care that their hard-earned wages should be paid, and the people provided for their journey.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This plague is distinctly attributed here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-23.htm">Exodus 12:23</a> to the personal intervention of the Lord; but it is to be observed that although the Lord Himself passed through to smite the Egyptians, He employed the agency of "the destroyer" <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-23.htm">Exodus 12:23</a>, in whom, in accordance with <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-28.htm">Hebrews 11:28</a>, all the ancient versions, and most critics, recognize an Angel (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-35.htm">2 Kings 19:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-16.htm">2 Samuel 24:16</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/exodus/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>29. at midnight the Lord smote all the first-born in the land of Egypt&#8212;At the moment when the Israelites were observing the newly instituted feast in the singular manner described, the threatened calamity overtook the Egyptians. It is more easy to imagine than describe the confusion and terror of that people suddenly roused from sleep and enveloped in darkness&#8212;none could assist their neighbors when the groans of the dying and the wild shrieks of mourners were heard everywhere around. The hope of every family was destroyed at a stroke. This judgment, terrible though it was, evinced the equity of divine retribution. For eighty years the Egyptians had caused the male children of the Israelites to be cast into the river [Ex 1:16], and now all their own first-born fell under the stroke of the destroying angel. They were made, in the justice of God, to feel something of what they had made His people feel. Many a time have the hands of sinners made the snares in which they have themselves been entangled, and fallen into the pit which they have dug for the righteous [Pr 28:10]. "Verily there is a God that judgeth in the earth" [Ps 58:11].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/exodus/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">At midnight; </span> a great aggravation of the plague; for then darkness itself strikes men with horror, and makes any calamity more terrible; then they were. asleep and secure, and least expected such a stroke. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">All the first-born, </span> both of man and beast, whether male or female.

Others confine it to the first-born child in the family. I conceive the heads of the family are not included, for these, though they might be the firstborn children of their parents’ families, yet were not, nor ever are called or accounted, the first-born of their own families, but the heads and roots of them: but for all the rest, I conceive they are all included, because all such were really first-born, and did first open their mother’s womb; and all such were to be set apart unto the Lord, instead of these first-born of the Egyptians now slain, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-12.htm" title="That you shall set apart to the LORD all that opens the matrix, and every firstling that comes of a beast which you have; the males shall be the LORD's.">Exodus 13:12</a>,15</span>, and therefore are in both places to be understood in the same latitude. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/exodus/12.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And it came to pass, that at midnight the Lord smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt,....

At last the time had come for the dealing of the final blow. Nine plagues had been sent, nine inflictions endured, and no serious effect had been produced. Once or twice Pharaoh had wavered, had made profession of submitting himself, had even acknowledged his sin. But each time he had relapsed into obstinacy. Now at length the fiat had gone forth for that last plague which had been announced the first (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-23.htm">Exodus 4:23</a>). Pharaoh's own son, his firstborn, the heir to his throne, was smitten with death, in common with all the other male Egyptians who had "opened the womb." What the effect on the king would have been, had he alone suffered, we cannot certainly say. As it was, the whole population of the country, nobles, tradesmen, peasants, suffered with him; and the feeling aroused was so intense that the popular movement left him no choice. The Egyptians everywhere "rose up in the night" (ver. 30), and raised "a great cry," and insisted that the Israelites should depart at once (ver. 33). Each man feared for himself, and felt his life insecure, so long as a single Israelite remained in the land. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">At midnight</span>. As prophesied by Moses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/11-4.htm">Exodus 11:4</a>).

We have no proof that the eldest son of Menephthah died before his father, unless we take this passage as proving it. He left a son, called Seti-Menephthah, or Seti II, who either succeeded him, or reigned after a short interval, during which the throne was held by Ammonmes, a usurper. <span class="cmt_word">The first-born of the captive who was in the dungeon</span>. This phrase takes the place of another expression, viz. "the first-born of the maid-servant that is behind the mill" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/11-5.htm">Exodus 11:5</a>). In both cases, the general meaning is, "all, from the highest to the lowest." This is perhaps the whole that is in the writer's thought; but it is also true that captives in dungeons were in some cases employed in turning hand-mills (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/16-21.htm">Judges 16:21</a><span class="cmt_word">). And all the first-born of cattle</span>. Rather, "of beasts." There is no limitation of the plague to domesticated animals. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/exodus/12.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-13.htm">Exodus 12:13</a>). "He will not suffer (&#1497;&#1514;&#1468;&#1503;) the destroyer to come into your houses:" Jehovah effected the destruction of the first-born through &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1497;&#1514;, the destroyer, or destroying angel, &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3bf;&#788;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-28.htm">Hebrews 11:28</a>), i.e., not a fallen angel, but the angel of Jehovah, in whom Jehovah revealed Himself to the patriarchs and Moses. This is not at variance with <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-49.htm">Psalm 78:49</a>; for the writer of this psalm regards not only the slaying of the first-born, but also the pestilence (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/9-1.htm">Exodus 9:1-7</a>), as effected through the medium of angels of evil: though, according to the analogy of <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-17.htm">1 Samuel 13:17</a>, &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1497;&#1514; might certainly be understood collectively as applying to a company of angels. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-24.htm">Exodus 12:24</a>. "This word," i.e., the instructions respecting the Passover, they were to regard as an institution for themselves and their children for ever (&#1506;&#1491;&#1470;&#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501; in the same sense as &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/17-7.htm">Genesis 17:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-13.htm">Genesis 17:13</a>); and when dwelling in the promised land, they were to explain the meaning of this service to their sons. The ceremony is called &#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1492;, "service," inasmuch as it was the fulfilment of a divine command, a performance demanded by God, though it promoted the good of Israel.</body></html>
