All that share in God's mercies should join in thankful praises for them. The New Testament passover, the Lord's supper, ought not to be neglected by any. Strangers, if circumcised, might eat of the passover. Here is an early indication of favour to the gentiles. This taught the Jews that their being a nation favoured by God, entitled them to their privileges, not their descent from Abraham. Christ our passover is sacrificed for us, 1Co 5:7; his blood is the only ransom for our souls; without the shedding of it there is no remission; without the sprinkling of it there can be no salvation. Have we, by faith in him, sheltered our souls from deserved vengeance under the protection of his atoning blood? Do we keep close to him, constantly depending upon him? Do we so profess our faith in the Redeemer, and our obligations to him, that all who pass by may know to whom we belong? Do we stand prepared for his service, ready to walk in his ways, and to separate ourselves from his enemies? These are questions of vast importance to the soul; may the Lord direct our consciences honestly to answer them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In one house - i. e.

This chronological statement, the genuineness of which is placed beyond all doubt by Onkelos, the Syriac, Vulgate, and other versions, is not only in harmony with the prediction in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/15-13.htm">Genesis 15:13</a>, where the round number 400 is employed in prophetic style, but may be reconciled with the different genealogical lists, if we only bear in mind that the genealogies do not always contain a complete enumeration of all the separate links, but very frequently intermediate links of little historical importance are omitted, as we have already seen in the genealogy of Moses and Aaron (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/6-18.htm">Exodus 6:18-20</a>). For example, the fact that there were more than the four generations mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-16.htm">Exodus 6:16</a>. between Levi and Moses, is placed beyond all doubt, not only by what has been adduced at <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/6-18.htm">Exodus 6:18-20</a>, but by a comparison with other genealogies also. Thus, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-29.htm">Numbers 26:29</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/27-1.htm">Exodus 27:1</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/17-3.htm">Joshua 17:3</a>, we find six generations from Joseph to Zelophehad; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/4-18.htm">Ruth 4:18</a>., <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-5.htm">1 Chronicles 2:5-6</a>, there are also six from Judah to Nahshon, the tribe prince in the time of Moses; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-18.htm">1 Chronicles 2:18</a> there are seven from Judah to Bezaleel, the builder of the tabernacle; and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-20.htm">1 Chronicles 7:20</a>., nine or ten are given from Joseph to Joshua. This last genealogy shows most clearly the impossibility of the view founded upon the Alexandrian version, that the sojourn of the Israelites in Egypt lasted only 215 years; for ten generations, reckoned at 40 years each, harmonize very well with 430 years, but certainly not with 215.<p>(Note: The Alexandrian translators have arbitrarily altered the text to suit the genealogy of Moses in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-16.htm">Exodus 6:16</a>., just as in the genealogies of the patriarchs in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/5.htm">Genesis 5</a> and 11. The view held by the Seventy became traditional in the synagogue, and the Apostle Paul followed it in <a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/3-17.htm">Galatians 3:17</a>, where he reckoned the interval between the promise to Abraham and the giving of the law as 430 years, the question of chronological exactness having no bearing upon his subject at the time.)<p>The statement in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-41.htm">Exodus 12:41</a>, "the self-same day," is not to be understood as relating to the first day after the lapse of the 430 years, as though the writer supposed that it was on the 14th Abib that Jacob entered Egypt 430 years before, but points back to the day of the exodus, mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-14.htm">Exodus 12:14</a>, as compared with <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-11.htm">Exodus 12:11</a>., i.e., the 15th Abib (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-51.htm">Exodus 12:51</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-4.htm">Exodus 13:4</a>).
