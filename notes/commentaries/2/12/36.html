The plague struck their first-born, the joy and hope of their families. They had slain the Hebrews' children, now God slew theirs. It reached from the throne to the dungeon: prince and peasant stand upon the same level before God's judgments. The destroying angel entered every dwelling unmarked with blood, as the messenger of woe. He did his dreadful errand, leaving not a house in which there was not one dead. Imagine then the cry that rang through the land of Egypt, the long, loud shriek of agony that burst from every dwelling. It will be thus in that dreadful hour when the Son of man shall visit sinners with the last judgment. God's sons, his first-born, were now released. Men had better come to God's terms at first, for he will never come to theirs. Now Pharaoh's pride is abased, and he yields. God's word will stand; we get nothing by disputing, or delaying to submit. In this terror the Egyptians would purchase the favour and the speedy departure of Israel. Thus the Lord took care that their hard-earned wages should be paid, and the people provided for their journey.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Lent - Or gave. The word in the Hebrew means simply "granted their request." Whether the grant is made as a loan, or as a gift, depends in every instance upon the context. Here the word "spoiled" ought to be regarded as conclusive that the grant was a gift, a moderate remuneration for long service, and a compensation for cruel wrongs. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/exodus/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>36. the Lord gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians&#8212;Such a dread of them was inspired into the universal minds of the Egyptians, that whatever they asked was readily given.<p>spoiled the Egyptians&#8212;The accumulated earnings of many years being paid them at this moment, the Israelites were suddenly enriched, according to the promise made to Abraham (Ge 15:14), and they left the country like a victorious army laden with spoil (Ps 105:37; Eze 39:10).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/exodus/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The Lord gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians, </span> i.e. inclined their hearts to do it willingly, and not only out of fear. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">So that they lent unto him; </span> Heb. <span class="ital">and they lent them</span>, to wit, the jewels or vessels mentioned <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-35.htm" title="And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses; and they borrowed of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment:">Exodus 12:35</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">They spoiled the Egyptians, </span> to wit, of their ornaments. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Quest.</span> Was not this unjustly done of the Israelites to borrow these jewels which they never paid again? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Answ.</span> No, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

Because the supreme Lord of all forbad them to restore what they borrowed, and gave them the entire right and sole propriety therein. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3.

And in truth the Egyptians did and might esteem it a good bargain to give these things to redeem their lives, and to engage the Israelites to a speedy departure, knowing that otherwise both their persons and all their estates were in extreme hazard. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>4. Because, if these jewels were properly borrowed, yet the Egyptians, by their causeless and hostile pursuit after the Israelites with intent to destroy them, did fully discharge them from all obligations to restitution, and give them a right not only to keep these goods, but to take ally other which they could from the Egyptians, according to the known and approved laws of war. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/exodus/12.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the Lord gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians,.... Their minds were disposed towards them, and their hearts were inclined to grant their request, and did grant it: <p>so they lent unto them: such things as they required; or "they gave unto them" (b); made presents of them freely to them; and so Josephus says (c), that they honoured them with gifts: <p>and they spoiled the Egyptians; stripped them of their substance and riches, of their most valuable things; in doing which they were in no wise criminal, since they did it by the direction and authority of God, who has a right to dispose of all the things in the world; and to take of them from one, and give to another, as he pleases; nor was any injustice done to the Egyptians, who owed all this, and perhaps abundantly more, to the Israelites, for the labour and service they had served them in for many years; besides, they were the avowed enemies of Israel, and the Lord had now put himself at the head of the armies of Israel, and was contending with them, and they with him, who should overcome; and this was doing no other than what, acceding to the law of nations, is lawful to be done in time of war; to spoil, plunder, and distress an enemy, in whatsoever way it can be done. And thus the promise made to Abraham, that his posterity should come out with great substance, was fulfilled, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-14.htm">Genesis 15:14</a>. This circumstance is taken notice of by some Heathen writers, as Artapanus (d); who says they borrowed many cups of the Egyptians, and not a little raiment, besides a great quantity of other treasure and riches; and so Ezekiel the tragedian (e) speaks of a vast deal of gold and silver, raiment, and other things, the Israelitish women had of the Egyptians at their departure, and who relates the history of Moses and the above plagues very agreeably to the sacred writings. <p>(b) "ut petita darent", Tigurine version, "ut dederint", Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator, Ainsworth, Cartwright.

So Exo <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-28.htm" title="Therefore also I have lent him to the LORD; as long as he lives he shall be lent to the LORD. And he worshipped the LORD there.">1 Samuel 1:28</a> (lit. ‘<span class="ital">let one ask him for Jehovah</span>’), correlative of ‘ask’ in <span class="ital">vv.</span> 17, 27, as of the same word here in <span class="ital">v.</span> 35. Still, it is remarkable that the ordinary word for ‘gave’ is not used: and it cannot be denied that ‘let ask’ <span class="ital">may</span>, as in Syriac (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-5.htm" title="And he said to them, Which of you shall have a friend, and shall go to him at midnight, and say to him, Friend, lend me three loaves;">Luke 11:5</a> Pesh.), have had in Heb. the meaning <span class="ital">lend</span>. In this case, we must suppose that the things were ‘lent’ for use at the festival in the wilderness; Pharaoh’s subsequent pursuit of the Israelites put their return out of the question, and so they ‘spoiled’ the Egyptians (Ewald, <span class="ital">Hist.</span> ii. 66). Dillm. writes: ‘In reality the fundamental idea of the narrative is this: God, in His contest for the oppressed and against the oppressor, brings it about by His judgements that the enemy is obliged not only to allow the people to hold their festival in the wilderness, but also at their request to provide them willingly with garments and ornaments to wear at it (cf. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-21.htm" title="And I will give this people favor in the sight of the Egyptians: and it shall come to pass, that, when you go, you shall not go empty.">Exodus 3:21</a> f.); and eventually even to give these things up to them, as lawful spoil, and also, probably, as a reward for long and hard service (so Jubilees 48:18, Philo, <span class="ital">Vit. Mos.</span> i. p. 103, Clem. Al. <span class="ital">Strom.</span> i. p. 345, Iren. iv. 49, and other Fathers), and as partial compensation for what the Hebrews left behind them in Egypt.’<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 36.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So that they lent unto them such things as they required</span>. Rather, "So that they granted them what they asked." <span class="cmt_word">They spoiled the Egyptians</span>. See the comment on Exodus 3:22, <span class="accented">ad fin</span>. The result was that the Israelites went forth, not as slaves, but as conquerors, decked with the jewels of the Egyptians, as though they had conquered and despoiled them <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 12:37-39 <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/exodus/12.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The very same night Pharaoh sent for Moses and Aaron, and gave them permission to depart with their people, their children, and their cattle. The statement that Pharaoh sent for Moses and Aaron is not at variance with <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/10-28.htm">Exodus 10:28-29</a>; and there is no necessity to resort to Calvin's explanation, "Pharaoh himself is said to have sent for those whom he urged to depart through the medium of messengers from the palace." The command never to appear in his sight again did not preclude his sending for them under totally different circumstances. The permission to depart was given unconditionally, i.e., without involving an obligation to return. This is evident from the words, "Get you forth from among my people," compared with <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/10-8.htm">Exodus 10:8</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/10-24.htm">Exodus 10:24</a>, "Go ye, serve Jehovah," and <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/8-25.htm">Exodus 8:25</a>, "Go ye, sacrifice to your God in the land." If in addition to this we bear in mind, that although at first, and even after the fourth plague (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-27.htm">Exodus 8:27</a>), Moses only asked for a three days' journey to hold a festival, yet Pharaoh suspected that they would depart altogether, and even gave utterance to this suspicion, without being contradicted by Moses (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/8-28.htm">Exodus 8:28</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-10.htm">Exodus 10:10</a>); the words "Get you forth from among my people" cannot mean anything else than "depart altogether." Moreover, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/11-1.htm">Exodus 11:1</a> it was foretold to Moses that the result of the last blow would be, that Pharaoh would let them go, or rather drive them away; so that the effect of this blow, as here described, cannot be understood in any other way. And this is really implied in Pharaoh's last words, "Go, and bless me also;" whereas on former occasions he had only asked them to intercede for the removal of the plagues (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/8-8.htm">Exodus 8:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-28.htm">Exodus 8:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-28.htm">Exodus 9:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-17.htm">Exodus 10:17</a>). &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498;, to bless, indicates a final leave-taking, and was equivalent to a request that on their departure they would secure or leave behind the blessing of their God, in order that henceforth no such plague might ever befall him and his people. This view of the words of the king is not at variance either with the expression "as ye have said" in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-31.htm">Exodus 12:31</a>, which refers to the words "serve the Lord," or with the same words in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-32.htm">Exodus 12:32</a>, for there they refer to the flock and herds, or lastly, with the circumstance that Pharaoh pursued the Israelites after they had gone, with the evident intention of bringing them back by force (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-5.htm">Exodus 14:5</a>.), because this resolution is expressly described as a change of mind consequent upon renewed hardening (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/14-4.htm">Exodus 14:4-5</a>).</body></html>
