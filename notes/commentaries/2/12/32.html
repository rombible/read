He is reduced by the terrible calamity of the last plague not only to grant all the demands made of him freely, and without restriction, but to crave the favour of a blessing from those whom he had despised, rebuked (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/5-4.htm" title="And the king of Egypt said to them, Why do you, Moses and Aaron, let the people from their works? get you to your burdens.">Exodus 5:4</a>), thwarted, and finally driven from his presence under the threat of death (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-28.htm" title="And Pharaoh said to him, Get you from me, take heed to yourself, see my face no more; for in that day you see my face you shall die.">Exodus 10:28</a>). Those with whom were the issues of life and death must, he felt, have the power to bless or curse effectually.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/12.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>12:29-36 The Egyptians had been for three days and nights kept in anxiety and horror by the darkness; now their rest is broken by a far more terrible calamity. The plague struck their first-born, the joy and hope of their families. They had slain the Hebrews' children, now God slew theirs. It reached from the throne to the dungeon: prince and peasant stand upon the same level before God's judgments. The destroying angel entered every dwelling unmarked with blood, as the messenger of woe. He did his dreadful errand, leaving not a house in which there was not one dead. Imagine then the cry that rang through the land of Egypt, the long, loud shriek of agony that burst from every dwelling. It will be thus in that dreadful hour when the Son of man shall visit sinners with the last judgment. God's sons, his first-born, were now released. Men had better come to God's terms at first, for he will never come to theirs. Now Pharaoh's pride is abased, and he yields. God's word will stand; we get nothing by disputing, or delaying to submit. In this terror the Egyptians would purchase the favour and the speedy departure of Israel. Thus the Lord took care that their hard-earned wages should be paid, and the people provided for their journey.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Bless me also - No words could show more strikingly the complete, though temporary, submission of Pharaoh. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/exodus/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>32. also take your flocks, &c.&#8212;All the terms the king had formerly insisted on were now departed from; his pride had been effectually humbled. Appalling judgments in such rapid succession showed plainly that the hand of God was against him. His own family bereavement had so crushed him to the earth that he not only showed impatience to rid his kingdom of such formidable neighbors, but even begged an interest in their prayers.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/exodus/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse.

The Targum of Jonathan is,"I desire nothing else of you, only pray for me, that I die not;''and so Jarchi. As he found his firstborn, and the heir to his crown and kingdom, was dead, he might justly fear it would be his case next, and perhaps very soon; and therefore desires their prayers for him, that his life might be spared. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/exodus/12.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Also take your flocks and your herds, as ye have said, and be gone; and <span class="cverse3">{p}</span> bless me also.</span><p>(p) Pray for me.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/exodus/12.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">32</span>. <span class="ital">as ye have said</span>] See <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-9.htm" title="And Moses said, We will go with our young and with our old, with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we go; for we must hold a feast to the LORD.">Exodus 10:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-26.htm" title="Our cattle also shall go with us; there shall not an hoof be left behind; for thereof must we take to serve the LORD our God; and we know not with what we must serve the LORD, until we come thither.">Exodus 10:26</a> (J).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and bless me also</span>] viz. at the festival which you are about to hold: include me as well as yourselves in the blessings which you will then invoke.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Also take your flocks and your herds</span>. Pharaoh thus retracted the prohibition of <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-24.htm">Exodus 10:24</a>, and "gave the sacrifices and burnt-offerings" which Moses had required (<span class="accented">ib</span>. ver. 25). <span class="cmt_word">Bless me also</span>. Pharaoh was probably accustomed to receive blessings from his own priests, and had thus been led to value them. His desire for a blessing from Moses and Aaron, ere they departed, probably sprang from a conviction - based on the miracles which he had witnessed - that their intercession would avail more with God than that of his own hierarchy. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/exodus/12.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-13.htm">Exodus 12:13</a>). "He will not suffer (&#1497;&#1514;&#1468;&#1503;) the destroyer to come into your houses:" Jehovah effected the destruction of the first-born through &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1497;&#1514;, the destroyer, or destroying angel, &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3bf;&#788;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-28.htm">Hebrews 11:28</a>), i.e., not a fallen angel, but the angel of Jehovah, in whom Jehovah revealed Himself to the patriarchs and Moses. This is not at variance with <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-49.htm">Psalm 78:49</a>; for the writer of this psalm regards not only the slaying of the first-born, but also the pestilence (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/9-1.htm">Exodus 9:1-7</a>), as effected through the medium of angels of evil: though, according to the analogy of <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-17.htm">1 Samuel 13:17</a>, &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1497;&#1514; might certainly be understood collectively as applying to a company of angels. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-24.htm">Exodus 12:24</a>. "This word," i.e., the instructions respecting the Passover, they were to regard as an institution for themselves and their children for ever (&#1506;&#1491;&#1470;&#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501; in the same sense as &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/17-7.htm">Genesis 17:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-13.htm">Genesis 17:13</a>); and when dwelling in the promised land, they were to explain the meaning of this service to their sons. The ceremony is called &#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1492;, "service," inasmuch as it was the fulfilment of a divine command, a performance demanded by God, though it promoted the good of Israel.</body></html>
