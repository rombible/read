Our Lord Jesus is the great High Priest of our profession, called of God to be so; anointed with the Spirit, whence he is called Messiah, the Christ; clothed with glory and beauty; sanctified by his own blood; made perfect, or consecrated through sufferings, Heb 2:10.

Aaron and his sons thou shalt bring unto the door of the tabernacle&#8212;as occupying the intermediate space between the court where the people stood, and the dwelling-place of Israel's king, and therefore the fittest spot for the priests being duly prepared for entrance, and the people witnessing the ceremony of inauguration.<p>wash them with water. And &#8230; take the garments&#8212;The manner in which these parts of the ceremonial were performed is minutely described, and in discovering their symbolical import, which indeed, is sufficiently plain and obvious, we have inspired authority to guide us. It signified the necessity and importance of moral purity or holiness (Isa 52:11; Joh 13:10; 2Co 7:1; 1Pe 3:21). In like manner, the investiture with the holy garments signified their being clothed with righteousness (Re 19:8) and equipped as men active and well-prepared for the service of God; the anointing the high priest with oil denoted that he was to be filled with the influences of the Spirit, for the edification and delight of the church (Le 10:7; Ps 45:7; Isa 61:1; 1Jo 2:27), and as he was officially a type of Christ (Heb 7:26; Joh 3:34; also Mt 3:16; 11:29).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/exodus/29.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">A perpetual statute</span>; so long as the Jewish pedagogy and policy lasts. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/exodus/29.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And thou shalt gird them with girdles (Aaron and his sons),....

Installation in an office was usually effected among the Eastern nations by putting into the hand of the official the insignia which marked his functions.

It will be more advisable therefore to defer the examination of this ceremony till we come to <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/8.htm">Leviticus 8</a>, where the consecration itself is described.
