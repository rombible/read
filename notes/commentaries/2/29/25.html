Our Lord Jesus is the great High Priest of our profession, called of God to be so; anointed with the Spirit, whence he is called Messiah, the Christ; clothed with glory and beauty; sanctified by his own blood; made perfect, or consecrated through sufferings, Heb 2:10.

And thou shalt cause a bullock to be brought before the tabernacle&#8212;This part of the ceremonial consisted of three sacrifices: (1) The sacrifice of a bullock, as a sin offering; and in rendering it, the priest was directed to put his hand upon the head of his sacrifice, expressing by that act a consciousness of personal guilt, and a wish that it might be accepted as a vicarious satisfaction. (2) The sacrifice of a ram as a burnt offering (Ex 29:15-18). The ram was to be wholly burnt, in token of the priest's dedication of himself to God and His service. The sin offering was first to be presented, and then the burnt offering; for until guilt be removed, no acceptable service can be performed. (3) There was to be a peace offering, called "the ram of consecration" (Ex 29:19-22). And there was a marked peculiarity in the manner in which this other ram was to be disposed of. The former was for the glory of God&#8212;this was for the comfort of the priest himself; and as a sign of a mutual covenant being ratified, the blood of the sacrifice was divided&#8212;part sprinkled on the altar round about, and part upon the persons and garments of the priests. Nay, the blood was, by a singular act, directed to be put upon the extremities of the body, thereby signifying that the benefits of the atonement would be applied to the whole nature of man. Moreover, the flesh of this sacrifice was to be divided, as it were, between God and the priest&#8212;part of it to be put into his hand to be waved up and down, in token of its being offered to God, and then it was to be burnt upon the altar; the other part was to be eaten by the priests at the door of the tabernacle&#8212;that feast being a symbol of communion or fellowship with God. These ceremonies, performed in the order described, showed the qualifications necessary for the priests.

Finally, Moses is himself—the priests being not as yet fully installed, and authorized to do so themselves—to take the offerings from their hands and burn them upon the altar. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-28.htm" title="And Moses took them from off their hands, and burnt them on the altar on the burnt offering: they were consecrations for a sweet smell: it is an offering made by fire to the LORD.">Leviticus 8:28</a> the parts thus burnt are expressly called the <span class="ital">installation</span>(-offering).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">burn them</span>] <span class="bld">consume</span> <span class="ital">them</span> <span class="bld">in sweet smoke</span>, as <span class="ital">v.</span> 18.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">upon the burnt offering</span>] mentioned in <span class="ital">v.</span> 18.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">for a</span> <span class="bld">soothing odour</span> <span class="ital">before</span> <span class="bld">Jehovah</span>] See on <span class="ital">v.</span> 18.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/29.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt receive them at their hands and burn them</span>. Moses was still to continue the priestly acts, and to complete the peace-offering by burning the selected parts (ver. 22) on the brazen altar.

This can only be fully understood in connection with the sacrificial law contained in <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/1.htm">Leviticus 1-7</a>. It will be more advisable therefore to defer the examination of this ceremony till we come to <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/8.htm">Leviticus 8</a>, where the consecration itself is described.
