The method of it is now laid down. It consists of five things :—(1) Ablution (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-4.htm" title="And Aaron and his sons you shall bring to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall wash them with water.">Exodus 29:4</a>); (2) Investiture (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/29-5.htm" title="And you shall take the garments, and put on Aaron the coat, and the robe of the ephod, and the ephod, and the breastplate, and gird him with the curious girdle of the ephod:">Exodus 29:5-9</a>); (3) Chrism, or anointing (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-7.htm" title="Then shall you take the anointing oil, and pour it on his head, and anoint him.">Exodus 29:7</a>); (4) Sacrifice (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/29-10.htm" title="And you shall cause a bullock to be brought before the tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands on the head of the bullock.">Exodus 29:10-23</a>); and (5) Filling the hand (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-24.htm" title="And you shall put all in the hands of Aaron, and in the hands of his sons; and shall wave them for a wave offering before the LORD.">Exodus 29:24</a>). All of these were symbolical acts, typical of things spiritual—ablution, of the putting away of impurity; investiture, of being clothed with holiness; unction, of the giving of Divine grace, &c.; the entire consecration forming an acted parable, very suggestive and full of instruction to such as understood its meaning.<p><span class= "bld">Take one young bullock.</span>—The <span class= "ital">first </span>thing to be done was to prepare the victims which would be needed, and to have them ready against the time when they would be required for sacrifice.<p><span class= "bld">Without blemish.</span>—Heb., <span class= "ital">perfect </span>(See Note 1 on <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-5.htm" title="Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year: you shall take it out from the sheep, or from the goats:">Exodus 12:5</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/exodus/29.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-1.htm" title="And this is the thing that you shall do to them to hallow them, to minister to me in the priest's office: Take one young bullock, and two rams without blemish,">Exodus 29:1</a></span>. <span class="ital">To hallow them, to minister to me — </span>We come now to the directions given to Moses about the ceremonies of consecrating Aaron and his sons to the priests’ office. These were to be performed in a solemn manner, thereby to strike both them and the people with a still deeper sense of the dignity and sacredness of that function. They were chiefly to consist of three sacrifices, which, though distinguished from each other, were all of the expiatory kind, as appears from this, that the priests laid their hands on the two former, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-10.htm" title="And you shall cause a bullock to be brought before the tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands on the head of the bullock.">Exodus 29:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-15.htm" title="You shall also take one ram; and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands on the head of the ram.">Exodus 29:15</a>,) and were sprinkled with the blood of the last. <span class="ital">Take one young bullock — </span>This is mentioned first as the chief part of the ceremony, though several things were to be done previously to it, as washing them with water, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-4.htm" title="And Aaron and his sons you shall bring to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall wash them with water.">Exodus 29:4</a>,) robing them in their sacerdotal garments, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-5.htm" title="And you shall take the garments, and put on Aaron the coat, and the robe of the ephod, and the ephod, and the breastplate, and gird him with the curious girdle of the ephod:">Exodus 29:5</a>,) anointing them with oil, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-7.htm" title="Then shall you take the anointing oil, and pour it on his head, and anoint him.">Exodus 29:7</a>,) then the ceremony was to be completed by peculiar sacrifices, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/29-10.htm" title="And you shall cause a bullock to be brought before the tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands on the head of the bullock....">Exodus 29:10-11</a>;) all which things are described as put in execution, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-2.htm" title="Take Aaron and his sons with him, and the garments, and the anointing oil, and a bullock for the sin offering, and two rams, and a basket of unleavened bread;">Leviticus 8:2</a>.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/29.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>29:1-37 Aaron and his sons were to be set apart for the priest's office, with ceremony and solemnity.

In short, they were taught to know that the service was for them as well as for the people; and every time they engaged in a new performance of their duties, they were reminded of their personal interest in the worship, by being obliged to offer for themselves, before they were qualified to offer as the representatives of the people.<p>this is the thing that thou shalt do&#8212;Steps are taken at the beginning of a society, which would not be repeated when the social machine was in full motion; and Moses, at the opening of the tabernacle, was employed to discharge functions which in later periods would have been regarded as sacrilege and punished with instant death.

From the description of the priestly attire, the Divine Law-giver passed to the form of priestly consecration, whereof investiture in the "holy garments" was a part. The ceremony of consecration was to consist of four things: - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> Ablution; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> Investiture; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> Chrism or Anointing with oil; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">4.</span> Sacrifice. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In the directions given, we have, first, the preparation of the offerings (vers. 1-3); secondly, directions for the ablutions (ver. 4); thirdly, directions for the investiture of Aaron (vers. 5, 6), of his sons (vers. 8, 9); fourthly, directions for the anointing (ver. 7); and fifthly, directions as to the mode in which the sacrifices should be offered and disposed of (vers. 10-34). A command is then given that the ceremonies should be repeated every day for a week (ver. 35); and another, that the altar should receive consecration at the same time as the priests (vers. 36, 37). Additional light is thrown on most of these matters by the account contained in Leviticus (ch. 8.), of the manner in which Moses carried oat the directions here given to him. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This is the thing that thou shalt do to them</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "This is the ceremonial that thou shalt use on the occasion." There is a tacit reference to verse 41 of ch. 28, which had announced that the priests were to be consecrated. <span class="cmt_word">Take one young bullock</span>. The offerings were to be provided beforehand, so as to be in readiness when the investiture and anointing were over. Hence they are mentioned first. <span class="cmt_word">Rams without blemish</span>. Literally "perfect." On the offence to God of offering him blemished offerings, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/1-6.htm">Malachi 1:6-14</a>. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/exodus/28.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The fourth article of the high priest's dress was the diadem upon his head-band. &#1510;&#1497;&#1509;, from &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509; to shine, a plate of pure gold, on which the words &#1500;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; &#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;, "holiness (i.e., all holy) to Jehovah," were engraved, and which is called the "crown of holiness" in consequence, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/39-30.htm">Exodus 39:30</a>. This gold plate was to be placed upon a riband of dark-blue purple, or, as it is expressed in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/39-31.htm">Exodus 39:31</a>, a riband of this kind was to be fastened to it, to attach it to the head-band, "upon the fore-front (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/26-9.htm">Exodus 26:9</a>) of the head-band," from above (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/39-31.htm">Exodus 39:31</a>); by which we are to understand that the gold plate was placed above the lower coil of the head-band and over Aaron's forehead. The word &#1502;&#1510;&#1504;&#1508;&#1514;, from &#1510;&#1504;&#1507; to twist or coil (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-18.htm">Isaiah 22:18</a>), is only applied to the head-band or turban of the high priest, which was made of simply byssus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-39.htm">Exodus 28:39</a>), and, judging from the etymology, was in the shape of a turban. This is all that can be determined with reference to its form. The diadem was the only thing about it that had any special significance. This was to be placed above (upon) Aaron's forehead, that he "might bear the iniquity of the holy things, which the children of Israel sanctified, with regard to all their holy gifts,...as an acceptableness for them before Jehovah." &#1506;&#1493;&#1503; &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;: to bear iniquity (sin) and take it away; in other words, to exterminate it by taking it upon one's self. The high priest was exalted into an atoning mediator of the whole nation; and an atoning, sin-exterminating intercession was associated with his office. The qualification for this he received from the diadem upon his forehead with the inscription, "holiness to the Lord." Through this inscription, which was fastened upon his head-dress of brilliant white, the earthly reflection of holiness, he was crowned as the sanctified of the Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-16.htm">Psalm 106:16</a>), and endowed with the power to exterminate the sin which clung to the holy offerings of the people on account of the unholiness of their nature, so that the gifts of the nation became well-pleasing to the Lord, and the good pleasure of God was manifested to the nation.<p>(Note: See my Archaeology i. pp. 183-4. The following are Calvin's admirable remarks: Oblationum sanctarum iniquitas tollenda et purganda fuit per sacerdotem. Frigidum est illud commentum, si quid erroris admissum est in ceremoniis, remissum fuisse sacerdotis precibus. Longius enim respicere nos oportet: ideo oblationum iniquitatem deleri a sacerdote, quia nulla oblatio, quatenus est hominis, omni vitio caret. Dictu hoc asperum est et fere &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, sanctitates ipsas esse immundas, ut venia indigeant; sed tenendum est, nihil esse sane purum, quod non aliquid labis a nobis contrahat.... Nihil Dei cultu praestantius: et tamen nihil offerre potuit populus, etiam a lege praescriptum, nisi intercedente venia, quam nonnisi per sacerdotem obtinuit.) </body></html>
