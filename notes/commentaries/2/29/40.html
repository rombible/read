This typified the continual intercession which Christ ever lives to make for his church. Though he offered himself but once for all, that one offering thus becomes a continual offering. This also teaches us to offer to God the spiritual sacrifices of prayer and praise every day, morning and evening. Our daily devotions are the most needful of our daily works, and the most pleasant of our daily comforts. Prayer-time must be kept up as duly as meal-time. Those starve their own souls, who keep not up constant attendance on the throne of grace; constancy in religion brings in the comfort of it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/29.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A tenth deal - i. e. the tenth part of an Ephah; it is sometimes called an Omer (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-36.htm">Exodus 16:36</a>; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-13.htm">Leviticus 23:13</a>). The Ephah seems to have been rather less than four gallons and a half (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-36.htm">Leviticus 19:36</a> note); and the tenth deal of flour may have weighed about 3 lbs. 2oz.<p>An hin - The word appears to be Egyptian. The measure was one-sixth of an ephah. The quarter of a bin was therefore about a pint and a half.

Nothing whatever is expressly said in the Old Testament regarding the mode in which the wine was treated: but it would seem probable, from the prohibition that it should not be poured upon the altar of incense <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/30-9.htm">Exodus 30:9</a>, that it used to be poured on the altar of burnt-offering.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/exodus/29.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Ex 29:38-46.

Jarchi says there were two silver basins on the top of the altar, and there were bored in them like two small nostrils, and wine was put in the middle of them; and it flowed and went out by the way of the nostrils, and fell upon the top of the altar, and from thence descended to the bottom: this wine poured may either signify the blood of Christ shed, or poured out for the remission of sin; or the love of Christ very plentifully manifested in the offering up of himself for men, and the acceptableness of to God: and, moreover, as sacrifices are called the bread of God, and he makes as it were a feast of them, feeding on them with delight and pleasure, it was necessary there should be wine to complete the banquet; wherefore wine is said to cheer both God and man, <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/9-13.htm">Judges 9:13</a>, alluding to the libations of wine in sacrifices. <p>(n) Of Scripture Weights and Measures, c. 3. p. 86. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/exodus/29.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And with the one lamb a <span class="cverse3">{n}</span> tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth part of an <span class="cverse3">{o}</span> hin of beaten oil; and the fourth part of an hin of wine <i>for</i> a drink offering.</span><p>(n) That is, an Omer, read Ex 16:16.<p>(o) Which is about a pint.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/exodus/29.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">40</span>.

The application of the "drink-offerings" is uncertain. Josephus says (<span class="accented">Ant. Jud.</span> 3:9, &sect; 4) that they were poured out round the brazen altar. But the analogy of the "meat offering" makes it probable that a portion only was thus treated, while the greater part belonged to the priests. In the entire provision by which burnt and peace-offering were to be necessarily accompanied with meat-offerings and drink-offerings, we can scarcely be wrong in seeing an arrangement made especially for the convenience of the priests. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/exodus/29.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Consecration of Aaron and his Sons through the anointing of their persons and the offering of sacrifices, the directions for which form the subject of vv. 1-35.
