Our Lord Jesus is the great High Priest of our profession, called of God to be so; anointed with the Spirit, whence he is called Messiah, the Christ; clothed with glory and beauty; sanctified by his own blood; made perfect, or consecrated through sufferings, Heb 2:10. All believers are spiritual priests, to offer spiritual sacrifices,<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/29.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A stranger - One of another family, i. e. in this case, one not of the family of Aaron. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/exodus/29.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10-22. And thou shalt cause a bullock to be brought before the tabernacle&#8212;This part of the ceremonial consisted of three sacrifices: (1) The sacrifice of a bullock, as a sin offering; and in rendering it, the priest was directed to put his hand upon the head of his sacrifice, expressing by that act a consciousness of personal guilt, and a wish that it might be accepted as a vicarious satisfaction. (2) The sacrifice of a ram as a burnt offering (Ex 29:15-18). The ram was to be wholly burnt, in token of the priest's dedication of himself to God and His service. The sin offering was first to be presented, and then the burnt offering; for until guilt be removed, no acceptable service can be performed. (3) There was to be a peace offering, called "the ram of consecration" (Ex 29:19-22). And there was a marked peculiarity in the manner in which this other ram was to be disposed of. The former was for the glory of God&#8212;this was for the comfort of the priest himself; and as a sign of a mutual covenant being ratified, the blood of the sacrifice was divided&#8212;part sprinkled on the altar round about, and part upon the persons and garments of the priests. Nay, the blood was, by a singular act, directed to be put upon the extremities of the body, thereby signifying that the benefits of the atonement would be applied to the whole nature of man. Moreover, the flesh of this sacrifice was to be divided, as it were, between God and the priest&#8212;part of it to be put into his hand to be waved up and down, in token of its being offered to God, and then it was to be burnt upon the altar; the other part was to be eaten by the priests at the door of the tabernacle&#8212;that feast being a symbol of communion or fellowship with God. These ceremonies, performed in the order described, showed the qualifications necessary for the priests.

For the sins of Aaron and his sons, for they were men of infirmity, and needed sacrifice for sin themselves; and herein Christ their antitype excelled them, that he had no sin of his own, and needed not to offer first for them, and then for the sins of others, as Aaron and his sons, the types of him, did; and their eating of the sacrifice for atonement points at the receiving of the atonement of Christ's sacrifice by faith, and the enjoyment of it and the blessings following on it: <p>to consecrate and to sanctify them; that they might be filled and fitted, and set apart and devoted to the office of the priesthood, and minister in it: <p>but a stranger shall not eat thereof, because they are holy; meaning not one of another nation, but of another family, though an Israelite; the Targum of Jonathan renders it, a profane and common person, a layman, one that was not a priest; who, though he was of the seed of Israel, yet not being of the seed of Aaron, as Aben Ezra interprets it, he might not eat of the above things, because they were devoted to holy uses; and therefore none but such who were sanctified or set apart to sacred service might partake of them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/exodus/29.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And they shall eat those things <span class="cverse3">{l}</span> wherewith the atonement was made, to consecrate <i>and</i> to sanctify them: but a stranger shall not eat <i>thereof</i>, because they <i>are</i> holy.</span><p>(l) That is, by the sacrifices.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/exodus/29.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">33</span>. <span class="ital">those things</span>] the flesh and the bread of <span class="ital">v.</span> 32.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">atonement</span>] i.e. <span class="ital">at-one-ment, setting at one, reconciliation</span>, as in Shakespeare (e.g. <span class="ital">Rich.

The burnt-, the guilt-, and the sin offering are in P often said to ‘make atonement’ (see the references in <span class="ital">DB.</span> iv. 130a), but this is the only passage of P in which that is predicated of a <span class="ital">peace</span>-offering.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">to consecrate</span>] <span class="ital">to</span> <span class="bld">install.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span></span><span class="ital">a stranger</span>] Heb. <span class="ital">zâr</span>; i.e., here, one not a priest (see esp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-40.htm" title="To be a memorial to the children of Israel, that no stranger, which is not of the seed of Aaron, come near to offer incense before the LORD; that he be not as Korah, and as his company: as the LORD said to him by the hand of Moses.">Numbers 16:40</a>), a frequent use of the word in P (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-33.htm" title="Whoever compounds any like it, or whoever puts any of it on a stranger, shall even be cut off from his people.">Exodus 30:33</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/3-10.htm" title="And you shall appoint Aaron and his sons, and they shall wait on their priest's office: and the stranger that comes near shall be put to death.">Numbers 3:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/3-38.htm" title="But those that encamp before the tabernacle toward the east, even before the tabernacle of the congregation eastward, shall be Moses, and Aaron and his sons, keeping the charge of the sanctuary for the charge of the children of Israel; and the stranger that comes near shall be put to death.">Numbers 3:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-7.htm" title="Therefore you and your sons with you shall keep your priest's office for everything of the altar, and within the veil; and you shall serve: I have given your priest's office to you as a service of gift: and the stranger that comes near shall be put to death.">Numbers 18:7</a> <span class="ital">al.</span>; see further <span class="ital">DB.</span> iv. 622a, near the bottom).
