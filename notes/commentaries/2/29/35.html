It is the number almost exclusively used under the old covenant, when acts are to attain their result by repetition. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-6.htm" title="And the priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle of the blood seven times before the LORD, before the veil of the sanctuary.">Leviticus 4:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-17.htm" title="And the priest shall dip his finger in some of the blood, and sprinkle it seven times before the LORD, even before the veil.">Leviticus 4:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-11.htm" title="And he sprinkled thereof on the altar seven times, and anointed the altar and all his vessels, both the laver and his foot, to sanctify them.">Leviticus 8:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/14-7.htm" title="And he shall sprinkle on him that is to be cleansed from the leprosy seven times, and shall pronounce him clean, and shall let the living bird loose into the open field.">Leviticus 14:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-14.htm" title="And he shall take of the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it with his finger on the mercy seat eastward; and before the mercy seat shall he sprinkle of the blood with his finger seven times.">Leviticus 16:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/19-4.htm" title="And Eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger, and sprinkle of her blood directly before the tabernacle of the congregation seven times:">Numbers 19:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/6-4.htm" title="And seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of rams' horns: and the seventh day you shall compass the city seven times, and the priests shall blow with the trumpets.">Joshua 6:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-43.htm" title="And said to his servant, Go up now, look toward the sea.

Here we are to understand <span class= "bld">a </span>sevenfold repetition of the entire ceremonial of consecration.

This was to be observed in after ages: he that was to succeed Aaron in the high-priesthood, must put on the holy garments seven days together, in token of a deliberate advance into his office, and that one sabbath might pass over him in his consecration. Every day of the seven, in this first consecrations, a bullock was to be offered for a <span class="ital">sin-offering, </span>which was to intimate, 1st, That though atonement was made, yet they must still keep up a penitent sense of sin, and often repeat the confession of it. 2d, That those sacrifices which were thus offered day by day, could not make the <span class="ital">comers thereunto perfect, </span>for then they would have ceased to be offered, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/10-1.htm" title="For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect....">Hebrews 10:1-2</a>. They must therefore expect the <span class="ital">bringing in of a better hope. </span>Now this consecration of the priests was a <span class="ital">shadow of good things to come. </span>1st, Our Lord Jesus is the great High-Priest of our profession, <span class="ital">called of God </span>to be so <span class="ital">consecrated </span>for evermore, anointed with the Spirit above his fellows, <span class="ital">clothed </span>with the holy garments, even with <span class="ital">glory </span>and <span class="ital">beauty, sanctified </span>by his own blood, not that of bullocks and rams. 2d, All believers are spiritual priests, to offer spiritual sacrifices, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-5.htm" title="You also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.">1 Peter 2:5</a>,) washed in the blood of Christ, and so <span class="ital">made to our God priests, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/1-5.htm" title="And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth.

Our Lord Jesus is the great High Priest of our profession, called of God to be so; anointed with the Spirit, whence he is called Messiah, the Christ; clothed with glory and beauty; sanctified by his own blood; made perfect, or consecrated through sufferings, Heb 2:10.

To make it the more solemn and efficacious, the entire installation-ceremony is to be repeated every day for seven days (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/8-33.htm" title="And you shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle of the congregation in seven days, until the days of your consecration be at an end: for seven days shall he consecrate you....">Leviticus 8:33-35</a>).

The repetition of the ceremony seven times on seven separate days seems to be intended. Thus was an ideal completeness given to it. Compare the seven days' compassing around of Jericho (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/6-3.htm">Joshua 6:3, 4</a>,), the seven washings in Jordan by Naaman (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/5-14.htm">2 Kings 5:14</a>), the seven ascents to the top of Carmel by the servant of Elijah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-43.htm">1 Kings 18:43, 44</a>), etc. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/exodus/29.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Consecration of Aaron and his Sons through the anointing of their persons and the offering of sacrifices, the directions for which form the subject of vv. 1-35. This can only be fully understood in connection with the sacrificial law contained in <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/1.htm">Leviticus 1-7</a>. It will be more advisable therefore to defer the examination of this ceremony till we come to <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/8.htm">Leviticus 8</a>, where the consecration itself is described. The same may also be said of the expiation and anointing of the altar, which are commanded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-36.htm">Exodus 29:36</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/29-37.htm">Exodus 29:37</a>, and carried out in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-11.htm">Leviticus 8:11</a>. </body></html>
