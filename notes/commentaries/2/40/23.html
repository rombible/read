Those who are unsettled in the world, must not think that this will excuse want of religion; as if it were enough to begin to serve God when they begin to be settled in the world. No; a tabernacle for God is very needful, even in a wilderness, especially as we may be in another world before we come to fix in this. And we may justly fear lest we should deceive ourselves with a form of godliness. The thought that so few entered Canaan, should warn young persons especially, not to put off the care of their souls.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/40.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Moses performed these priestly functions (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-1.htm">Exodus 28:1</a> note), before the holy things with which they were performed were anointed. The things had been made expressly for the service of Yahweh, by His command, and in this fact lay their essential sanctity, of which the anointing was only the seal and symbol. Aaron and his sons, on similar ground, having had the divine call, took part in the service of the sanctuary as soon as the work was completed <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-31.htm">Exodus 40:31</a>. But Moses took part with them, and most likely took the lead, until they were consecrated and invested <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/8.htm">Leviticus 8</a> and publicly set apart for the office.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/exodus/40.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16.

As not quite nine months had elapsed between the arrival of the Israelites at Sinai, in the third month after the Exodus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-1.htm">Exodus 19:1</a>), and the first day of the second year, when the work was finished and handed over to Moses, the building, and all the work connected with it, had not occupied quite half a year; as we have to deduct from the nine months (or somewhat less) not only the eighty days which Moses spent upon Sinai (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-18.htm">Exodus 24:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-28.htm">Exodus 34:28</a>), but the days of preparation for the giving of the law and conclusion of the covenant (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-1.htm">Exodus 19:1-24:11</a>), and the interval between the first and second stay that Moses made upon the mountain (ch. 32 and 33). The erection of the dwelling commenced with the fixing of the sockets, into which the boards were placed and fastened with their bolts, and the setting up of the pillars for the curtains (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-18.htm">Exodus 40:18</a>). "He (Moses) then spread the tent over the dwelling, and laid the covering of the tent upon the top." By the "covering of the tent" we are to understand the two coverings, made of red rams' skins and the skins of the sea-cow (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/26-14.htm">Exodus 26:14</a>). In analogy with this, &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1492;&#1488;&#1500;&#1500; &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1474; denotes not only the roofing with the goats' hair, but the spreading out of the inner cloth of mixed colours upon the wooden frame-work. </body></html>
