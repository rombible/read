Those who are unsettled in the world, must not think that this will excuse want of religion; as if it were enough to begin to serve God when they begin to be settled in the world. No; a tabernacle for God is very needful, even in a wilderness, especially as we may be in another world before we come to fix in this. And we may justly fear lest we should deceive ourselves with a form of godliness. The thought that so few entered Canaan, should warn young persons especially, not to put off the care of their souls.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/40.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The testimony - i. e. the tables of stone with the Ten Commandments engraved on them <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-16.htm">Exodus 25:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/31-18.htm">Exodus 31:18</a>.

The pot of manna was "laid up before the testimony" <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-34.htm">Exodus 16:34</a>; Aaron's rod was also placed "before the testimony" <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/17-10.htm">Numbers 17:10</a>; and the book of the law was put at "the side of the ark" <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-26.htm">Deuteronomy 31:26</a>. The expression "before the testimony" appears to mean the space immediately in front of the ark. Most interpreters hold that the pot of manna and Aaron's rod were at first placed between the ark and the veil, and afterward within the ark <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-4.htm">Hebrews 9:4</a>. It is very probable that the pot and the rod had been put into the ark before it was taken by the Philistines, but that they were not sent back with the ark and the tables. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-11.htm">1 Samuel 4:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-11.htm">1 Samuel 6:11</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/exodus/40.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16.

After that he was to anoint the dwelling and everything in it, also the altar of burnt-offering and laver, with the anointing oil, and to sanctify them (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/40-9.htm">Exodus 40:9-11</a>); and to consecrate Aaron and his sons before the door of the tabernacle, and clothe them, anoint them, and sanctify them as priests (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/40-12.htm">Exodus 40:12-15</a>). When we read here, however, that the dwelling and the vessels therein would be rendered "holy" through the anointing, but the altar of burnt-offering "most holy," we are not to understand this as attributing a higher degree of holiness to the altar of burnt-offering than to the dwelling and its furniture; but the former is called "most holy" merely in the sense ascribed to it in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-10.htm">Exodus 30:10</a> namely, that every one who touched it was to become holy; in other words, the distinction has reference to the fact, that, standing as it did in the court, it was more exposed to contact from the people than the vessels in the dwelling, which no layman was allowed to enter. In this relative sense we find the same statement in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/30-29.htm">Exodus 30:29</a>, with reference to the tabernacle and all the vessels therein, the dwelling as well as the court, that they would become most holy in consequence of the anointing (see the remarks on <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-10.htm">Exodus 30:10</a>). It is stated provisionally, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/40-16.htm">Exodus 40:16</a>, that this command was fulfilled by Moses. But from the further history we find that the consecration of the priests did not take place contemporaneously with the erection of the tabernacle, but somewhat later, or not till after the promulgation of the laws of sacrifice (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/8.htm">Leviticus 8</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-1.htm">Leviticus 1:1</a>.). </body></html>
