This cloud was a token of God's presence to be seen day and night, by all Israel, that they might never again question, Is the Lord among us, or is he not? It guided the camp of Israel through the wilderness. While the cloud rested on the tabernacle, they rested; when it removed, they followed it. The glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle. In light and fire the Shechinah made itself visible: God is Light; our God is a consuming Fire. Yet so dazzling was the light, and so dreadful the fire, that Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation, till the splendour was abated. But what Moses could not do, our Lord Jesus has done, whom God caused to draw near; and who has invited us to come boldly, even to the mercy-seat. Being taught by the Holy Spirit to follow the example of Christ, as well as to depend upon him, to attend his ordinances, and obey his precepts, we shall be kept from losing our way, and be led in the midst of the paths of judgment, till we come to heaven, the habitation of his holiness.

But its external construction was at this time somewhat changed, and doors, strictly so called, had taken the place of the entrance curtain <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-15.htm">1 Samuel 3:15</a> : hence, it seems to have been sometimes called the temple <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-9.htm">1 Samuel 1:9</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-3.htm">1 Samuel 3:3</a>, the name by which the structure of Solomon was afterward commonly known.

It was brought from Gibeon to Jerusalem by Solomon <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-4.htm">1 Kings 8:4</a>. After this, it disappears from the narrative of Scripture. When the temple of Solomon was built, "the tabernacle of the tent" had entirely performed its work; it had protected the ark of the covenant during the migrations of the people until they were settled in the land, and the promise was fulfilled, that the Lord would choose out a place for Himself in which His name should be preserved and His service should be maintained <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-14.htm">Deuteronomy 12:14</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-21.htm">Deuteronomy 12:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-24.htm">Deuteronomy 14:24</a>.<p>In accordance with its dignity as the most sacred object in the sanctuary, the original ark of the covenant constructed by Moses was preserved and transferred from the tabernacle to the temple. The golden altar, the candlestick and the showbread table were renewed by Solomon. They were subsequently renewed by Zerubbabel, and lastly by the Maccabees (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-23.htm">Exodus 25:23</a>.)

Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation&#8212;How does this circumstance show the incapacity of man, in his present state, to look upon the unveiled perfections of the Godhead! Moses could not endure the unclouded effulgence, nor the sublimest of the prophets (Isa 6:5). But what neither Moses nor the most eminent of God's messengers to the ancient church through the weakness of nature could endure, we can all now do by an exercise of faith; looking unto Jesus, who reflected with chastened radiance the brightness of the Father's glory; and who, having as the Forerunner for us, entered within the veil, has invited us to come boldly to the mercy seat. While Moses was compelled, through the influence of overwhelming awe, to stand aloof and could not enter the tabernacle, Christ entered into the holy place not made with hands; nay, He is Himself the true tabernacle, filled with the glory of God, ever with the grace and truth which the Shekinah typified. What great reason we have to thank God for Jesus Christ, who, while He Himself was the brightness of the Father's glory, yet exhibited that glory in so mild and attractive a manner, as to allure us to draw near with confidence and love into the Divine Presence!<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/exodus/40.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Moses was not able to enter in</span>, partly because of the extraordinary thickness and brightness of the cloud, which both dazzled his eyes and struck him with horror, as <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-11.htm" title="So that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud: for the glory of the LORD had filled the house of the LORD.">1 Kings 8:11</a></span>; and partly, because of his great reverence and dread of that eminent and glorious appearance of God; and partly, because he was not called to it, as he was not able to go up into the mount till he was called, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-16.htm" title="And the glory of the LORD stayed on mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it six days: and the seventh day he called to Moses out of the middle of the cloud.">Exodus 24:16</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/exodus/40.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation,....

It was not the external "cloud" which prevented Moses from entering, but the internal "glory." But the two are regarded as inseparable. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/exodus/40.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The altar of burnt-offering was then placed "before the door of the dwelling of the tabernacle," and the laver "between the tabernacle and the altar," from which it is evident that the altar was not placed close to the entrance to the dwelling, but at some distance off, though in a straight line with the door. The laver, which stood between the altar and the entrance to the dwelling, was probably placed more to the side; so that when the priests washed their hands and feet, before entering the dwelling or approaching the altar, there was no necessity for them to go round the altar, or to pass close by it, in order to get to the laver. Last of all the court was erected round about the dwelling and the altar, by the setting up of the pillars, which enclosed the space round the dwelling and the altar with their drapery, and the hanging up of the curtain at the entrance to the court. There is no allusion to the anointing of these holy places and things, as commanded in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/40-9.htm">Exodus 40:9-11</a>, in the account of their erection; for this did not take place till afterwards, viz., at the consecration of Aaron and his sons as priests (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-10.htm">Leviticus 8:10-11</a>). It is stated, however, on the other hand, that as the vessels were arranged, Moses laid out the shew-bread upon the table (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-23.htm">Exodus 40:23</a>), burned sweet incense upon the golden altar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-27.htm">Exodus 40:27</a>), and offered "the burnt-offering and meat-offering," i.e., the daily morning and evening sacrifice, upon the altar of burnt-offering (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/29-38.htm">Exodus 29:38-42</a>). Consequently the sacrificial service was performed upon them before they had been anointed. Although this may appear surprising, there is no ground for rejecting a conclusion, which follows so naturally from the words of the text. The tabernacle and its furniture were not made holy things for the first time by the anointing; this simply sanctified them for the use of the nation, i.e., for the service which the priests were to perform in connection with them on behalf of the congregation (see at <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-10.htm">Leviticus 8:10-11</a>). They were made holy things and holy vessels by the fact that they were built, prepared, and set up, according to the instructions given by Jehovah; and still more by the fact, that after the tabernacle had been erected as a dwelling, the "glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34</a>). But the glory of the Lord entered the dwelling before the consecration of the priests, and the accompanying anointing of the tabernacle and its vessels; for, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-1.htm">Leviticus 1:1</a>., it was from the tabernacle that Jehovah spake to Moses, when He gave him the laws of sacrifice, which were promulgated before the consecration of the priests, and were carried out in connection with it. But when the glory of the Lord had found a dwelling-place in the tabernacle, Moses was not required to offer continually the sacrifice prescribed for every morning and evening, and by means of this sacrifice to place the congregation in spiritual fellowship with its God, until Aaron and his sons had been consecrated for this service. </body></html>
