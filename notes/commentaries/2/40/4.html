In half a year the tabernacle was completed. When the hearts of numbers are earnest in a good cause, much may be done in a short time; and when the commandments of God are continually attended to, as the rule of working, all will be done well.

On the first day of the first month&#8212;From a careful consideration of the incidents recorded to have happened after the exodus (Ex 12:2; 13:4; 19:1; 20:18; 34:28, &c.), it has been computed that the work of the tabernacle was commenced within six months after that emigration; and consequently, that other six months had been occupied in building it. So long a period spent in preparing the materials of a movable pavilion, it would be difficult to understand, were it not for what we are told of the vast dimensions of the tabernacle, as well as the immense variety of curious and elaborate workmanship which its different articles of furniture required.<p>the tabernacle&#8212;the entire edifice.<p>the tent&#8212;the covering that surmounted it (Ex 40:19).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/exodus/40.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The things that are to be set in order; the vessels belonging to it, and the shew-bread, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-29.htm" title="And you shall make the dishes thereof, and spoons thereof, and covers thereof, and bowls thereof, to cover with: of pure gold shall you make them.">Exodus 25:29</a>,30</span> <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/exodus/40.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And thou shall bring in the table,....
