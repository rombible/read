In half a year the tabernacle was completed. When the hearts of numbers are earnest in a good cause, much may be done in a short time; and when the commandments of God are continually attended to, as the rule of working, all will be done well.

On the first day of the first month&#8212;From a careful consideration of the incidents recorded to have happened after the exodus (Ex 12:2; 13:4; 19:1; 20:18; 34:28, &c.), it has been computed that the work of the tabernacle was commenced within six months after that emigration; and consequently, that other six months had been occupied in building it. So long a period spent in preparing the materials of a movable pavilion, it would be difficult to understand, were it not for what we are told of the vast dimensions of the tabernacle, as well as the immense variety of curious and elaborate workmanship which its different articles of furniture required.<p>the tabernacle&#8212;the entire edifice.<p>the tent&#8212;the covering that surmounted it (Ex 40:19).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/exodus/40.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/exodus/40.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And thou shall set up the court round about,....

After that he was to anoint the dwelling and everything in it, also the altar of burnt-offering and laver, with the anointing oil, and to sanctify them (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/40-9.htm">Exodus 40:9-11</a>); and to consecrate Aaron and his sons before the door of the tabernacle, and clothe them, anoint them, and sanctify them as priests (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/40-12.htm">Exodus 40:12-15</a>). When we read here, however, that the dwelling and the vessels therein would be rendered "holy" through the anointing, but the altar of burnt-offering "most holy," we are not to understand this as attributing a higher degree of holiness to the altar of burnt-offering than to the dwelling and its furniture; but the former is called "most holy" merely in the sense ascribed to it in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-10.htm">Exodus 30:10</a> namely, that every one who touched it was to become holy; in other words, the distinction has reference to the fact, that, standing as it did in the court, it was more exposed to contact from the people than the vessels in the dwelling, which no layman was allowed to enter. In this relative sense we find the same statement in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/30-29.htm">Exodus 30:29</a>, with reference to the tabernacle and all the vessels therein, the dwelling as well as the court, that they would become most holy in consequence of the anointing (see the remarks on <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-10.htm">Exodus 30:10</a>). It is stated provisionally, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/40-16.htm">Exodus 40:16</a>, that this command was fulfilled by Moses. But from the further history we find that the consecration of the priests did not take place contemporaneously with the erection of the tabernacle, but somewhat later, or not till after the promulgation of the laws of sacrifice (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/8.htm">Leviticus 8</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-1.htm">Leviticus 1:1</a>.). </body></html>
