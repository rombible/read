It is no new thing for the greatest kindness to be basely represented as the greatest injuries. They so far undervalue their deliverance, that they wished they had died in Egypt; and by the hand of the Lord, that is, by the plagues which cut off the Egyptians. We cannot suppose they had plenty in Egypt, nor could they fear dying for want in the wilderness, while they had flocks and herds: none talk more absurdly than murmurers. When we begin to fret, we ought to consider, that God hears all our murmurings. God promises a speedy and constant supply. He tried whether they would trust him, and rest satisfied with the bread of the day in its day. Thus he tried if they would serve him, and it appeared how ungrateful they were. When God plagued the Egyptians, it was to make them know he was their Lord; when he provided for the Israelites, it was to make them know he was their God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Appeared in the cloud - Or, "was seen in a cloud."

What they brought with them from Egypt had been consumed in the 30 days that had elapsed since they came out (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-1.htm">Exodus 16:1</a>). In their vexation the people expressed the wish that they had died in Egypt by the flesh-pot, in the midst of plenty, "by the hand of Jehovah," i.e., by the last plague which Jehovah sent upon Egypt, rather than here in the desert of slow starvation. The form &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; is a Hiphil according to the consonants, and should be pointed &#1497;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, from &#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503; for &#1492;&#1500;&#1497;&#1503; (see Ges. 72, Anm. 9, and Ewald, 114c.). As the want really existed, Jehovah promised them help (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-4.htm">Exodus 16:4</a>). He would rain bread from heaven, which the Israelites should gather every day for their daily need, to try the people, whether they would walk in His law or not. In what the trial was to consist, is briefly indicated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-5.htm">Exodus 16:5</a> : "And it will come to pass on the sixth day (of the week), that they will prepare what they have brought, and it will be double what they gather daily." The meaning is, that what they gathered and brought into their tents on the sixth day of the week, and made ready for eating, would be twice as much as what they gathered on every other day; not that Jehovah would miraculously double what was brought home on the sixth day, as Knobel interprets the words in order to make out a discrepancy between <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-5.htm">Exodus 16:5</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-22.htm">Exodus 16:22</a>. &#1492;&#1499;&#1497;&#1503;, to prepare, is to be understood as applying partly to the measuring of what had been gathered (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-18.htm">Exodus 16:18</a>), and partly to the pounding and grinding of the grains of manna into meal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-8.htm">Numbers 11:8</a>). In what respect this was a test for the people, is pointed out in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-16.htm">Exodus 16:16</a>. Here, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-4.htm">Exodus 16:4</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16-5.htm">Exodus 16:5</a>, the promise of God is only briefly noticed, and its leading points referred to; it is described in detail afterwards, in the communications which Moses and Aaron make to the people. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16-6.htm">Exodus 16:6</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16-7.htm">Exodus 16:7</a>, they first tell the people, "At even, then shall ye know that Jehovah hath brought you out of Egypt; and in the morning, then shall ye see the glory of the Lord." Bearing in mind the parallelism of the clauses, we obtain this meaning, that in the evening and in the morning the Israelites would perceive the glory of the Lord, who had brought them out of Egypt. "Seeing" is synonymous with "knowing." Seeing the glory of Jehovah did not consist in the sight of the glory of the Lord which appeared in the cloud, as mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16-10.htm">Exodus 16:10</a>, but in their perception or experience of that glory in the miraculous gift of flesh and bread (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16-8.htm">Exodus 16:8</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-22.htm">Numbers 14:22</a>). "By His hearing" (&#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;&#1493;), i.e., because He has heard, "your murmuring against Jehovah ("Against Him" in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16-8.htm">Exodus 16:8</a>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-24.htm">Genesis 19:24</a>); for what are we, that ye murmur against us?" The murmuring of the people against Moses and Aaron as their leaders really affected Jehovah as the actual guide, and not Moses and Aaron, who had only executed His will. Jehovah would therefore manifest His glory to the people, to prove to them that He had heard their murmuring. The announcement of this manifestation of God is more fully explained to the people by Moses in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16-8.htm">Exodus 16:8</a>, and the explanation is linked on to the leading clause in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-7.htm">Exodus 16:7</a> by the words, "when He giveth," etc. Ye shall see the glory of Jehovah, when Jehovah shall give you, etc. </body></html>
