The result had been a series of manifestations calculated to impress the Israelites with a sense of God’s protecting care, the Egyptians and the neighbouring nations with a sense of His power to punish.<p><span class= "bld"><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/11.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>11:4-10 The death of all the first-born in Egypt at once: this plague had been the first threatened, but is last executed. See how slow God is to wrath. The plague is foretold, the time is fixed; all their first-born should sleep the sleep of death, not silently, but so as to rouse the families at midnight. The prince was not too high to be reached by it, nor the slaves at the mill too low to be noticed. While angels slew the Egyptians, not so much as a dog should bark at any of the children of Israel. It is an earnest of the difference there shall be in the great day, between God's people and his enemies. Did men know what a difference God puts, and will put to eternity, between those that serve him and those that serve him not, religion would not seem to them an indifferent thing; nor would they act in it with so much carelessness as they do. When Moses had thus delivered his message, he went out from Pharaoh in great anger at his obstinacy; though he was the meekest of the men of the earth. The Scripture has foretold the unbelief of many who hear the gospel, that it might not be a surprise or stumbling-block to us, Ro 10:16. Let us never think the worse of the gospel of Christ for the slights men put upon it. Pharaoh was hardened, yet he was compelled to abate his stern and haughty demands, till the Israelites got full freedom. In like manner the people of God will find that every struggle against their spiritual adversary, made in the might of Jesus Christ, every attempt to overcome him by the blood of the Lamb, and every desire to attain increasing likeness and love to that Lamb, will be rewarded by increasing freedom from the enemy of souls.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Shall not a dog move his tongue - A proverb expressive of freedom from alarm and immunity front assault. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/exodus/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. all these thy servants shall &#8230; bow down themselves unto me&#8212;This would be the effect of the universal terror; the hearts of the proudest would be humbled and do reverential homage to God, in the person of His representative.<p>went out &#8230; in a great anger&#8212;Holy and righteous indignation at the duplicity, repeated falsehood, and hardened impenitence of the king; and this strong emotion was stirred in the bosom of Moses, not at the ill reception given to himself, but the dishonor done to God (Mt 19:8; Eph 4:26).   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/exodus/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/exodus/11.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the Lord said unto Moses,....

With this summary he terminates the second great division of his work, that which began with ch. 2, and which traces the history of Moses from his birth to the close of his direct dealings with Pharaoh. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord said</span>. Rather, "had said." God had forewarned Moses that Pharaoh's heart would be hardened (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-21.htm">Exodus 4:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-3.htm">Exodus 7:3</a>), and that, in spite of all the miracles which he was empowered to perform before him, he would not let the people go (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-19.htm">Exodus 3:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-21.htm">Exodus 4:21</a>). It was not until God took Pharaoh's punishment altogether into his own hands, and himself came down and smote all the first-born, that the king's obstinacy was overcome, and he proceeded to "thrust the people out." <span class="cmt_word">That my wonders may be multiplied</span>. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-20.htm">Exodus 3:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-3.htm">Exodus 7:3</a>. If Pharaoh had yielded at the first, or even after two or three miracles, God's greatness and power would not have been shown forth very remarkably. Neither the Egyptians nor the neighbouring nations would have been much impressed. The circumstances would soon have been forgotten. As it was, the hardness of Pharaoh's heart, while it delayed the departure of the Israelites for a year, and so added to their sufferings, was of advantage to them in various ways: - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> It gave them time to organise them elves, and make all necessary preparations for a sudden departure. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> It deeply impressed the Egyptians, and led them to abstain from all interference with the Israelites for above three centuries. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> It impressed the neighbouring nations also to some extent, and either prevented them from offering opposition to the Israelites, or made them contend with less heart, and so with less success against them. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/exodus/11.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In this way Jehovah would overcome the resistance of Pharaoh; and even more than that, for Moses was to tell the people to ask the Egyptians for articles of silver and gold, for Jehovah would make them willing to give. The renown acquired by Moses through his miracles in Egypt would also contribute to this. (For the discussion of this subject, see <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/3-21.htm">Exodus 3:21-22</a>.) The communication of these instructions to the people is not expressly mentioned; but it is referred to in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-35.htm">Exodus 12:35-36</a>, as having taken place. </body></html>
