These grandees would come to Moses when the blow fell, and prostrate themselves before him as if he were their king, and beseech him to take his departure with all his nation. The details are given more fully and more graphically in this place than in the subsequent narrative (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-31.htm" title="And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up, and get you forth from among my people, both you and the children of Israel; and go, serve the LORD, as you have said.">Exodus 12:31</a>).<p><span class= "bld">In a great anger.</span>—Heb., <span class= "ital">in heat of anger: i.e.,</span> burning with indignation. Moses had not shown this in his speech, which had been calm and dignified; but he here records what he had felt. For once his acquired “meekness” failed, and the hot natural temper of his youth blazed up. His life had been threatened—he had been ignominiously dismissed—he had been deprived of his right of audience for the future (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-28.htm" title="And Pharaoh said to him, Get you from me, take heed to yourself, see my face no more; for in that day you see my face you shall die.">Exodus 10:28</a>). Under such circumstances, he “did well to be angry.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/exodus/11.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/11-8.htm" title="And all these your servants shall come down to me, and bow down themselves to me, saying, Get you out, and all the people that follow you: and after that I will go out.

See how slow God is to wrath. The plague is foretold, the time is fixed; all their first-born should sleep the sleep of death, not silently, but so as to rouse the families at midnight. The prince was not too high to be reached by it, nor the slaves at the mill too low to be noticed. While angels slew the Egyptians, not so much as a dog should bark at any of the children of Israel. It is an earnest of the difference there shall be in the great day, between God's people and his enemies. Did men know what a difference God puts, and will put to eternity, between those that serve him and those that serve him not, religion would not seem to them an indifferent thing; nor would they act in it with so much carelessness as they do. When Moses had thus delivered his message, he went out from Pharaoh in great anger at his obstinacy; though he was the meekest of the men of the earth. The Scripture has foretold the unbelief of many who hear the gospel, that it might not be a surprise or stumbling-block to us, Ro 10:16. Let us never think the worse of the gospel of Christ for the slights men put upon it. Pharaoh was hardened, yet he was compelled to abate his stern and haughty demands, till the Israelites got full freedom. In like manner the people of God will find that every struggle against their spiritual adversary, made in the might of Jesus Christ, every attempt to overcome him by the blood of the Lamb, and every desire to attain increasing likeness and love to that Lamb, will be rewarded by increasing freedom from the enemy of souls.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Shall not a dog move his tongue - A proverb expressive of freedom from alarm and immunity front assault. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/exodus/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. all these thy servants shall &#8230; bow down themselves unto me&#8212;This would be the effect of the universal terror; the hearts of the proudest would be humbled and do reverential homage to God, in the person of His representative.<p>went out &#8230; in a great anger&#8212;Holy and righteous indignation at the duplicity, repeated falsehood, and hardened impenitence of the king; and this strong emotion was stirred in the bosom of Moses, not at the ill reception given to himself, but the dishonor done to God (Mt 19:8; Eph 4:26).   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/exodus/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Thy courtiers and great officers, who now are so insolent and obstinate, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">shall come down unto me, </span> both by their own inclination and necessity, and in thy name, and by thy command. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">That follow thee; </span> that are under thy conduct and command; as this or the like expression is used <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-10.htm" title="And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh; and he went up with ten thousand men at his feet: and Deborah went up with him.">Judges 4:10</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-10.htm" title="And Benhadad sent to him, and said, The gods do so to me, and more also, if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all the people that follow me.">1 Kings 20:10</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-9.htm" title="So the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah, and the king of Edom: and they fetched a compass of seven days' journey: and there was no water for the host, and for the cattle that followed them.">2 Kings 3:9</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-2.htm" title="Who raised up the righteous man from the east, called him to his foot, gave the nations before him, and made him rule over kings? he gave them as the dust to his sword, and as driven stubble to his bow.">Isaiah 41:2</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">In a great anger; </span> not so much for the affront offered to himself, as for his incurable rebellion against God.
