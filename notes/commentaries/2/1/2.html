There, in about the same number of years, though under cruel bondage, they became a large nation. This wonderful increase was according to the promise long before made unto the fathers. Though the performance of God's promises is sometimes slow, it is always sure.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Now - Literally, "And," indicating a close connection with the preceding narrative.

The order is different from that observed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/46.htm">Genesis 46</a>, and seems intended to do honour to legitimate, as opposed to secondary, wedlock. The omission of Joseph follows necessarily from the exact form of the opening phrase, "These are the names of the children of Israel, which <span class="accented">came into Egypt with Jacob."</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> <span class="cmt_word">- All the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls</span>. This is manifestly intended as a repetition of <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/46-27.htm">Genesis 46:27</a>, and throws the reader back upon the details there adduced, which make up the exact number of "seventy souls," by the inclusion of Jacob himself, of Joseph, and of Joseph's two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh. The inaccuracy by which Jacob is counted among his own descendants, is thoroughly Oriental and Hebraistic, however opposed to Western habits of thought. To stumble at it shows a narrow and carping spirit. (Compare note on Genesis 46:15.) <span class="cmt_word">For Joseph was in Egypt already</span>. Joseph, <span class="accented">i.e</span>., has not been mentioned with the other sons of Jacob, since he did not "come into Egypt with Jacob," but was there previously. The transfer of the clause to the commencement of the verse, which is made by the LXX., is unnecessary. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/genesis/50.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Death of Joseph. - Joseph lived to see the commencement of the fulfilment of his father's blessing. Having reached the age of 110, he saw Ephraim's &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; "sons of the third link," i.e., of great-grandsons, consequently great-great-grandsons. &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; descendants in the third generation are expressly distinguished from "children's children" or grandsons in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-7.htm">Exodus 34:7</a>. There is no practical difficulty in the way of this explanation, the only one which the language will allow. As Joseph's two sons were born before he was 37 years old (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-50.htm">Genesis 41:50</a>), and Ephraim therefore was born, at the latest, in his 36th year, and possibly in his 34th, since Joseph was married in his 31st year, he might have had grandsons by the time he was 56 or 60 years old, and great-grandsons when he was from 78 to 85, so that great-great-grandsons might have been born when he was 100 or 110 years old. To regard the "sons of the third generation" as children in the third generation (great-grandsons of Joseph and grandsons of Ephraim), as many commentators do, as though the construct &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; stood for the absolute, is evidently opposed to the context, since it is stated immediately afterwards, that sons of Machir, the son of Manasseh, i.e., great-grandsons, were also born upon his knees, i.e., so that he could take them also upon his knees and show them his paternal love. There is no reason for thinking of adoption in connection with these words. And if Joseph lived to see only the great-grandsons of Ephraim as well as of Manasseh, it is difficult to imagine why the same expression should not be applied to the grandchildren of Manasseh, as to the descendants of Ephraim. </body></html>
