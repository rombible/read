The enmity that is in the seed of the serpent, against the Seed of the woman, makes men forget all pity. It is plain that the Hebrews were now under an uncommon blessing. And we see that the services done for God's Israel are often repaid in kind. Pharaoh gave orders to drown all the male children of the Hebrews. The enemy who, by Pharaoh, attempted to destroy the church in this its infant state, is busy to stifle the rise of serious reflections in the heart of man. Let those who would escape, be afraid of sinning, and cry directly and fervently to the Lord for assistance.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Made them houses - i. e. they married Hebrews and became mothers in Israel.

God dealt well with the midwives&#8212;This represents God as rewarding them for telling a lie. This difficulty is wholly removed by a more correct translation. To "make" or "build up a house" in Hebrew idiom, means to have a numerous progeny. The passage then should be rendered thus: "God protected the midwives, and the people waxed very mighty; and because the midwives feared, the Hebrews grew and prospered."   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/exodus/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> i.e. God greatly increased their families both in children and posterity, and in wealth, and other outward blessings.

And regarded his command, and not that of the king, though they risked his displeasure, and their lives: <p>that he made them houses; which some understand of the Israelites making houses for them, being moved to it by the Lord, to preserve them from the insults of the Egyptians; others of Pharaoh building houses for them, in which he kept them, until the Hebrew women came to their time of delivery, who were ordered to be brought to these houses, that it might be known by others, as well as the midwives, whether they brought forth sons or daughters, neither of which is likely: but rather the sense is, that God made them houses, and hid them from Pharaoh, as Kimchi interprets it, that he might not hurt them, just as he hid Jeremiah and Baruch: though it seems best of all to understand it of his building up the families of these midwives, increasing their number, especially their substance and wealth, making them and their households prosperous in all worldly good; but because the word is in the masculine gender, some choose to interpret it either of the infants themselves, the male children the midwives preserved, and of their being built up families in Israel, or by means of whom they were built up; or of the Israelites themselves, whose houses were built up by their means: and others are of opinion that material houses or buildings are meant, built for the Israelites, that the midwives might know where to find them and their wives, when ready to lie in, who before lived up and down in fields and tents: but the sense of God's building up the families of the midwives is to be preferred, there being an enallage or change of the gender, which is not unusual; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-21.htm">Exodus 15:21</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/exodus/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he <span class="cverse3">{h}</span> made them houses.</span><p>(h) That is, God increased the families of the Israelites by their means.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/exodus/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">21</span>. <span class="ital">made them houses</span>] i.e. gave them families, to perpetuate their names.

He commanded the midwives to destroy the male children in the birth and to leave only the girls alive. The midwives named in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/1-15.htm">Exodus 1:15</a>, who are not Egyptian but Hebrew women, were no doubt the heads of the whole profession, and were expected to communicate their instructions to their associates. &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/1-16.htm">Exodus 1:16</a> resumes the address introduced by &#1493;&#1497;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/1-15.htm">Exodus 1:15</a>. The expression &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1488;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, of which such various renderings have been given, is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-3.htm">Jeremiah 18:3</a> to denote the revolving table of a potter, i.e., the two round discs between which a potter forms his earthenware vessels by turning, and appears to be transferred here to the vagina out of which the child twists itself, as it were like the vessel about to be formed out of the potter's discs. Knobel has at length decided in favour of this explanation, at which the Targumists hint with their &#1502;&#1514;&#1489;&#1512;&#1488;. When the midwives were called in to assist at a birth, they were to look carefully at the vagina; and if the child were a boy, they were to destroy it as it came out of the womb. &#1493;&#1495;&#1497;&#1492; for &#1495;&#1497;&#1497;&#1492; rof &#1493; from &#1495;&#1497;&#1497;, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-22.htm">Genesis 3:22</a>.
