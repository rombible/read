Deliver them of their children: <p>and see them upon the stools; seats for women in labour to sit upon, and so contrived, that the midwives might do their office the more readily; but while they sat there, and before the birth, they could not tell whether the child was a son or a daughter; wherefore Kimchi (h) thinks the word here used signifies the place to which the infant falls down from its mother's belly, at the time of labour, and is called the place of the breaking forth of children, and takes it to be the "uterus" itself; and says it is called "Abanim", because "Banim", the children, are there, and supposes "A" or "Aleph" to be an additional letter; and so the sense then is, not when ye see the women on the seats, but the children in the place of coming forth; but then he asks, if it be so, why does he say, "and see them" there? could they see them before they were entirely out of the womb? to which he answers, they know by this rule, if a son, its face was downwards, and if a daughter, its face was upwards; how true this is, must be left to those that know better; the Jewish masters (i) constantly and positively affirm it: he further observes, that the word is of the dual number, because of the two valves of the womb, through which the infant passes: <p>if it be a son, then ye shall kill him; give it a private pinch as it comes forth, while under their hands, that its death might seem to be owing to the difficulty of its birth, or to something that happened in it. This was ordered, because what the king had to fear from the Israelites was only from the males, and they only could multiply their people; and because of the above information of his magicians, if there is any truth in that: <p>but if it be a daughter, then she shall live, be kept alive, and preserved, and brought up to woman's estate; and this the king chose to have done, having nothing to fear from them, being of the feeble sex, and that they might serve to gratify the lust of the Egyptians, who might be fond of Hebrew women, being more beautiful than theirs; or that they might be married and incorporated into Egyptian families, there being no males of their own, if this scheme took place, to match with them, and so by degrees the whole Israelitish nation would be mixed with, and swallowed up in the Egyptian nation, which was what was aimed at. <p>(h) Sepher Shorash. rad.

The explanation furnished by a remark of Mr. Lane ('Modem Egyptians,' vol. 3. p. 142) is more satisfactory than any other. In modern Egypt, he says, "two or three days before the expected time of delivery, the midwife conveys to the house the <span class="accented">kursee elwiladeh</span>, a chair of a peculiar form, upon which the patient is to be seated during the birth."

The reason assigned by the king for the measures he was about to propose, was the fear that in case of war the Israelites might make common cause with his enemies, and then remove from Egypt. It was not the conquest of his kingdom that he was afraid of, but alliance with his enemies and emigration. &#1506;&#1500;&#1492; is used here, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/13-1.htm">Genesis 13:1</a>, etc., to denote removal from Egypt to Canaan. He was acquainted with the home of the Israelites therefore, and cannot have been entirely ignorant of the circumstances of their settlement in Egypt. But he regarded them as his subjects, and was unwilling that they should leave the country, and therefore was anxious to prevent the possibility of their emancipating themselves in the event of war. - In the form &#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488;&#1504;&#1492; for &#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492;, according to the frequent interchange of the forms &#1492;&#1500; and &#1488;&#1500; (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/42-4.htm">Genesis 42:4</a>), nh is transferred from the feminine plural to the singular, to distinguish the 3rd pers. fem. from the 2nd pers., as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-26.htm">Judges 5:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-16.htm">Job 17:16</a> (vid., Ewald, 191c, and Ges. 47, 3, Anm. 3). Consequently there is no necessity either to understand &#1502;&#1500;&#1495;&#1502;&#1492; collectively as signifying soldiers, or to regard &#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; drager ot , the reading adopted by the lxx (&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;&#834; &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;), the Samaritan, Chaldee, Syriac, and Vulgate, as "certainly the original," as Knobel has done.<p>The first measure adopted (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/1-11.htm">Exodus 1:11</a>) consisted in the appointment of taskmasters over the Israelites, to bend them down by hard labour. &#1502;&#1505;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; &#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497; bailiffs over the serfs. &#1502;&#1505;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; from &#1502;&#1505; signifies, not feudal service, but feudal labourers, serfs (see my Commentary on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-6.htm">1 Kings 4:6</a>). &#1506;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; to bend, to wear out any one's strength (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102-24.htm">Psalm 102:24</a>). By hard feudal labour (&#1505;&#1489;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514; burdens, burdensome toil) Pharaoh hoped, according to the ordinary maxims of tyrants (Aristot. polit., 5, 9; Liv. hist. i. 56, 59), to break down the physical strength of Israel and lessen its increase-since a population always grows more slowly under oppression than in the midst of prosperous circumstances-and also to crush their spirit so as to banish the very wish for liberty. - &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1489;&#1503; - .ytrebil r, and so Israel built (was compelled to build) provision or magazine cities vid., <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-28.htm">2 Chronicles 32:28</a>, cities for the storing of the harvest), in which the produce of the land was housed, partly for purposes of trade, and partly for provisioning the army in time of war; - not fortresses, &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;, as the lxx have rendered it. Pithom was &#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;; it was situated, according to Herodotus (2, 158), upon the canal which commenced above Bybastus and connected the Nile with the Red Sea. This city is called Thou or Thoum in the Itiner. Anton., the Egyptian article pi being dropped, and according to Jomard (descript. t. 9, p. 368) is to be sought for on the site of the modern Abassieh in the Wady Tumilat. - Raemses (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/47-11.htm">Genesis 47:11</a>) was the ancient Heroopolis, and is not to be looked for on the site of the modern Belbeis. In support of the latter supposition, Stickel, who agrees with Kurtz and Knobel, adduces chiefly the statement of the Egyptian geographer Makrizi, that in the (Jews') book of the law Belbeis is called the land of Goshen, in which Jacob dwelt when he came to his son Joseph, and that the capital of the province was el Sharkiyeh. This place is a day's journey (for as others affirm, 14 hours) to the north-east of Cairo on the Syrian and Egyptian road. It served as a meeting-place in the middle ages for the caravans from Egypt to Syria and Arabia (Ritter, Erdkunde 14, p. 59). It is said to have been in existence before the Mohammedan conquest of Egypt. But the clue cannot be traced any farther back; and it is too far from the Red Sea for the Raemses of the Bible (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-37.htm">Exodus 12:37</a>). The authority of Makrizi is quite counterbalanced by the much older statement of the Septuagint, in which Jacob is made to meet his son Joseph in Heroopolis; the words of <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/46-29.htm">Genesis 46:29</a>, "and Joseph went up to meet Israel his father to Goshen," being rendered thus: &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#986;&#x3b1;&#769;&#986;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x399;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bb; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8; &#787; &#x397;&#788;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;. Hengstenberg is not correct in saying that the later name Heroopolis is here substituted for the older name Raemses; and Gesenius, Kurtz, and Knobel are equally wrong in affirming that &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8; &#787; &#x397;&#788;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#986; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; is supplied ex ingenio suo; but the place of meeting, which is given indefinitely as Goshen in the original, is here distinctly named. Now if this more precise definition is not an arbitrary conjecture of the Alexandrian translators, but sprang out of their acquaintance with the country, and is really correct, as Kurtz has no doubt, it follows that Heroopolis belongs to the &#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#834; &#x3a1;&#788;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#834; (<a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/46-28.htm">Genesis 46:28</a>, lxx), or was situated within it. But this district formed the centre of the Israelitish settlement in Goshen; for according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/47-11.htm">Genesis 47:11</a>, Joseph gave his father and brethren "a possession in the best of the land, in the land of Raemses." Following this passage, the lxx have also rendered &#1490;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1503; &#1488;&#1512;&#1510;&#1492; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/46-28.htm">Genesis 46:28</a> by &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3a1;&#788;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#834;, whereas in other places the land of Goshen is simply called &#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#834; &#x393;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bc; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/45-10.htm">Genesis 45:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/46-34.htm">Genesis 46:34</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/47-1.htm">Genesis 47:1</a>, etc.). But if Heroopolis belonged to the &#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#834; &#x3a1;&#788;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#834;, or the province of Raemses, which formed the centre of the land of Goshen that was assigned to the Israelites, this city must have stood in the immediate neighbourhood of Raemses, or have been identical with it. Now, since the researches of the scientific men attached to the great French expedition, it has been generally admitted that Heroopolis occupied the site of the modern Abu Keisheib in the Wady Tumilat, between Thoum  equals  Pithom and the Birket Temsah or Crocodile Lake; and according to the Itiner. p. 170, it was only 24 Roman miles to the east of Pithom, - a position that was admirably adapted not only for a magazine, but also for the gathering-place of Israel prior to their departure (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-37.htm">Exodus 12:37</a>).<p>But Pharaoh's first plan did not accomplish his purpose (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/1-12.htm">Exodus 1:12</a>). The multiplication of Israel went on just in proportion to the amount of the oppression (&#1499;&#1468;&#1503;  equals  &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; prout, ita; &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1509; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/30-30.htm">Genesis 30:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-14.htm">Genesis 28:14</a>), so that the Egyptians were dismayed at the Israelites (&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509; to feel dismay, or fear, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/22-3.htm">Numbers 22:3</a>). In this increase of their numbers, which surpassed all expectation, there was the manifestation of a higher, supernatural, and to them awful power. But instead of bowing before it, they still endeavoured to enslave Israel through hard servile labour. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/1-13.htm">Exodus 1:13</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/1-14.htm">Exodus 1:14</a> we have not an account of any fresh oppression; but "the crushing by hard labour" is represented as enslaving the Israelites and embittering their lives. &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498; hard oppression, from the Chaldee &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498; to break or crush in pieces. "They embittered their life with hard labour in clay and bricks (making clay into bricks, and working with the bricks when made), and in all kinds of labour in the field (this was very severe in Egypt on account of the laborious process by which the ground was watered, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-10.htm">Deuteronomy 11:10</a>), &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1514;&#1501; &#1488;&#1514; with regard to all their labour, which they worked (i.e., performed) through them (viz., the Israelites) with severe oppression." &#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1506; &#1488;&#1514; is also dependent upon &#1497;&#1502;&#1512;&#1512;&#1493;, as a second accusative (Ewald, 277d). Bricks of clay were the building materials most commonly used in Egypt. The employment of foreigners in this kind of labour is to be seen represented in a painting, discovered in the ruins of Thebes, and given in the Egyptological works of Rosellini and Wilkinson, in which workmen who are evidently not Egyptians are occupied in making bricks, whilst two Egyptians with sticks are standing as overlookers; - even if the labourers are not intended for the Israelites, as the Jewish physiognomies would lead us to suppose.
