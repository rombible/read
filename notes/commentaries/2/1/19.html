Though the midwives had the courage to disobey the king, they had not “the courage of their convictions,” and were afraid to confess their real motive. So they took refuge in a half truth, and pretended that what really occurred in some cases only was a general occurrence. It <span class= "ital">is </span>a fact, that in the East parturition is often so short a process that the attendance of a midwife is dispensed with.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:15-22 The Egyptians tried to destroy Israel by the murder of their children. The enmity that is in the seed of the serpent, against the Seed of the woman, makes men forget all pity. It is plain that the Hebrews were now under an uncommon blessing. And we see that the services done for God's Israel are often repaid in kind. Pharaoh gave orders to drown all the male children of the Hebrews. The enemy who, by Pharaoh, attempted to destroy the church in this its infant state, is busy to stifle the rise of serious reflections in the heart of man.

But the midwives feared God&#8212;Their faith inspired them with such courage as to risk their lives, by disobeying the mandate of a cruel tyrant; but it was blended with weakness, which made them shrink from speaking the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/exodus/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">They are lively, </span> or, <span class="ital">vigorous</span> and active in promoting the birth of their own children; or, like <span class="ital">the beasts</span>, which without any help of others bring forth their young.

And so it might be, either because their daily and excessive labours joined with the fears of the execution of the king’s command, whereof they seem to have gotten notice, did hasten their birth, as the same causes do commonly in other women; or because they, understanding their danger, would not send for the midwives, but committed themselves to God’s providence, and the care of some of their neighbours present with them. So here was nothing but truth, though they did not speak the whole truth, which they were not obliged to do. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/exodus/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women,.... Not so tender, weak, and feeble, nor so ignorant of midwifery, and needed not the assistance of midwives, as the Egyptian women: <p>for they are lively; or midwives themselves, as Kimchi (k) says the word signifies; and so (l) Symmachus translates the words, "for they are midwives"; or are skilful in the art of midwifery, as Jarchi interprets it; and so the, Vulgate Latin version is, "for they have knowledge of midwifery"; and so could help themselves; or, "for they are as beasts" (m), as animals which need not, nor have the assistance of any in bringing forth their young; and so Jarchi observes, that their Rabbins (n) explain it, they are like to the beasts of the field, who have no need of a midwife; or they were so lively, hale, and strong, as our version, and others, and their infants also, through a more than common blessing of God upon them at this time, that they brought forth children as soon as they were in travail, with scarce any pain or trouble, without the help of others: nor need this seem strange, if what is reported is true, of women in Illyria, Ireland, Italy (o), and other places (p), where it is said women will go aside from their work, or from the table, and bring forth their offspring, and return to their business or meal again; and especially in the eastern and hotter countries, women generally bring forth without much difficulty, and without the use of a midwife (q): <p>and are delivered ere the midwives come in unto them; which doubtless was true in some cases, though not in all, because it is before said, they saved the men children alive; and had it been so at all times, there would have been no proof and evidence of their fearing God, and obeying his commands, rather than the king's; and in some cases not only the strength and liveliness of the Hebrew women, and their fears also, occasioned by the orders of the king, might hasten their births before the midwives could get to them; and they might not choose to send for them, but use their own judgment, and the help of their neighbours, and do without them, knowing what the midwives were charged to do. <p>(k) Sepher Shorash.

Too much cannot be inferred from the midwives’ excuse with regard to the facts in question; but it is at least true that Arabian women are delivered very quickly (Knob., with references to travellers).

The reason assigned by the king for the measures he was about to propose, was the fear that in case of war the Israelites might make common cause with his enemies, and then remove from Egypt. It was not the conquest of his kingdom that he was afraid of, but alliance with his enemies and emigration. &#1506;&#1500;&#1492; is used here, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/13-1.htm">Genesis 13:1</a>, etc., to denote removal from Egypt to Canaan. He was acquainted with the home of the Israelites therefore, and cannot have been entirely ignorant of the circumstances of their settlement in Egypt. But he regarded them as his subjects, and was unwilling that they should leave the country, and therefore was anxious to prevent the possibility of their emancipating themselves in the event of war. - In the form &#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488;&#1504;&#1492; for &#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492;, according to the frequent interchange of the forms &#1492;&#1500; and &#1488;&#1500; (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/42-4.htm">Genesis 42:4</a>), nh is transferred from the feminine plural to the singular, to distinguish the 3rd pers. fem. from the 2nd pers., as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-26.htm">Judges 5:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-16.htm">Job 17:16</a> (vid., Ewald, 191c, and Ges. 47, 3, Anm. 3). Consequently there is no necessity either to understand &#1502;&#1500;&#1495;&#1502;&#1492; collectively as signifying soldiers, or to regard &#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; drager ot , the reading adopted by the lxx (&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;&#834; &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;), the Samaritan, Chaldee, Syriac, and Vulgate, as "certainly the original," as Knobel has done.<p>The first measure adopted (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/1-11.htm">Exodus 1:11</a>) consisted in the appointment of taskmasters over the Israelites, to bend them down by hard labour. &#1502;&#1505;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; &#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497; bailiffs over the serfs. &#1502;&#1505;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; from &#1502;&#1505; signifies, not feudal service, but feudal labourers, serfs (see my Commentary on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-6.htm">1 Kings 4:6</a>). &#1506;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; to bend, to wear out any one's strength (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102-24.htm">Psalm 102:24</a>). By hard feudal labour (&#1505;&#1489;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514; burdens, burdensome toil) Pharaoh hoped, according to the ordinary maxims of tyrants (Aristot. polit., 5, 9; Liv. hist. i. 56, 59), to break down the physical strength of Israel and lessen its increase-since a population always grows more slowly under oppression than in the midst of prosperous circumstances-and also to crush their spirit so as to banish the very wish for liberty. - &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1489;&#1503; - .ytrebil r, and so Israel built (was compelled to build) provision or magazine cities vid., <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-28.htm">2 Chronicles 32:28</a>, cities for the storing of the harvest), in which the produce of the land was housed, partly for purposes of trade, and partly for provisioning the army in time of war; - not fortresses, &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;, as the lxx have rendered it. Pithom was &#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;; it was situated, according to Herodotus (2, 158), upon the canal which commenced above Bybastus and connected the Nile with the Red Sea. This city is called Thou or Thoum in the Itiner. Anton., the Egyptian article pi being dropped, and according to Jomard (descript. t. 9, p. 368) is to be sought for on the site of the modern Abassieh in the Wady Tumilat. - Raemses (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/47-11.htm">Genesis 47:11</a>) was the ancient Heroopolis, and is not to be looked for on the site of the modern Belbeis. In support of the latter supposition, Stickel, who agrees with Kurtz and Knobel, adduces chiefly the statement of the Egyptian geographer Makrizi, that in the (Jews') book of the law Belbeis is called the land of Goshen, in which Jacob dwelt when he came to his son Joseph, and that the capital of the province was el Sharkiyeh. This place is a day's journey (for as others affirm, 14 hours) to the north-east of Cairo on the Syrian and Egyptian road. It served as a meeting-place in the middle ages for the caravans from Egypt to Syria and Arabia (Ritter, Erdkunde 14, p. 59). It is said to have been in existence before the Mohammedan conquest of Egypt. But the clue cannot be traced any farther back; and it is too far from the Red Sea for the Raemses of the Bible (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-37.htm">Exodus 12:37</a>). The authority of Makrizi is quite counterbalanced by the much older statement of the Septuagint, in which Jacob is made to meet his son Joseph in Heroopolis; the words of <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/46-29.htm">Genesis 46:29</a>, "and Joseph went up to meet Israel his father to Goshen," being rendered thus: &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#986;&#x3b1;&#769;&#986;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x399;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bb; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8; &#787; &#x397;&#788;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;. Hengstenberg is not correct in saying that the later name Heroopolis is here substituted for the older name Raemses; and Gesenius, Kurtz, and Knobel are equally wrong in affirming that &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8; &#787; &#x397;&#788;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#986; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; is supplied ex ingenio suo; but the place of meeting, which is given indefinitely as Goshen in the original, is here distinctly named. Now if this more precise definition is not an arbitrary conjecture of the Alexandrian translators, but sprang out of their acquaintance with the country, and is really correct, as Kurtz has no doubt, it follows that Heroopolis belongs to the &#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#834; &#x3a1;&#788;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#834; (<a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/46-28.htm">Genesis 46:28</a>, lxx), or was situated within it. But this district formed the centre of the Israelitish settlement in Goshen; for according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/47-11.htm">Genesis 47:11</a>, Joseph gave his father and brethren "a possession in the best of the land, in the land of Raemses." Following this passage, the lxx have also rendered &#1490;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1503; &#1488;&#1512;&#1510;&#1492; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/46-28.htm">Genesis 46:28</a> by &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3a1;&#788;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#834;, whereas in other places the land of Goshen is simply called &#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#834; &#x393;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bc; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/45-10.htm">Genesis 45:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/46-34.htm">Genesis 46:34</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/47-1.htm">Genesis 47:1</a>, etc.). But if Heroopolis belonged to the &#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#834; &#x3a1;&#788;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#834;, or the province of Raemses, which formed the centre of the land of Goshen that was assigned to the Israelites, this city must have stood in the immediate neighbourhood of Raemses, or have been identical with it. Now, since the researches of the scientific men attached to the great French expedition, it has been generally admitted that Heroopolis occupied the site of the modern Abu Keisheib in the Wady Tumilat, between Thoum  equals  Pithom and the Birket Temsah or Crocodile Lake; and according to the Itiner. p. 170, it was only 24 Roman miles to the east of Pithom, - a position that was admirably adapted not only for a magazine, but also for the gathering-place of Israel prior to their departure (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-37.htm">Exodus 12:37</a>).<p>But Pharaoh's first plan did not accomplish his purpose (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/1-12.htm">Exodus 1:12</a>). The multiplication of Israel went on just in proportion to the amount of the oppression (&#1499;&#1468;&#1503;  equals  &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; prout, ita; &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1509; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/30-30.htm">Genesis 30:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-14.htm">Genesis 28:14</a>), so that the Egyptians were dismayed at the Israelites (&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509; to feel dismay, or fear, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/22-3.htm">Numbers 22:3</a>). In this increase of their numbers, which surpassed all expectation, there was the manifestation of a higher, supernatural, and to them awful power. But instead of bowing before it, they still endeavoured to enslave Israel through hard servile labour. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/1-13.htm">Exodus 1:13</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/1-14.htm">Exodus 1:14</a> we have not an account of any fresh oppression; but "the crushing by hard labour" is represented as enslaving the Israelites and embittering their lives. &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498; hard oppression, from the Chaldee &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498; to break or crush in pieces. "They embittered their life with hard labour in clay and bricks (making clay into bricks, and working with the bricks when made), and in all kinds of labour in the field (this was very severe in Egypt on account of the laborious process by which the ground was watered, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-10.htm">Deuteronomy 11:10</a>), &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1514;&#1501; &#1488;&#1514; with regard to all their labour, which they worked (i.e., performed) through them (viz., the Israelites) with severe oppression." &#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1506; &#1488;&#1514; is also dependent upon &#1497;&#1502;&#1512;&#1512;&#1493;, as a second accusative (Ewald, 277d). Bricks of clay were the building materials most commonly used in Egypt. The employment of foreigners in this kind of labour is to be seen represented in a painting, discovered in the ruins of Thebes, and given in the Egyptological works of Rosellini and Wilkinson, in which workmen who are evidently not Egyptians are occupied in making bricks, whilst two Egyptians with sticks are standing as overlookers; - even if the labourers are not intended for the Israelites, as the Jewish physiognomies would lead us to suppose.
