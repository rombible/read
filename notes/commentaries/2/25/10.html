In one place it is applied to a mummy-case (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-26.htm" title="And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.">Genesis 1:26</a>). Here it designates a wooden chest three feet nine inches long, two feet three inches broad, and two feet three inches deep. The primary object of the ark was to contain the two tables of stone, written with the finger of God, which Moses was to receive before he came down from the mount. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-12.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Come up to me into the mount, and be there: and I will give you tables of stone, and a law, and commandments which I have written; that you may teach them.">Exodus 24:12</a>, and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-16.htm" title="You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.">Exodus 20:16</a>.) Sacred coffers were important parts of the furniture of temples in Egypt. They usually contained the image or emblem of some deity, and were constructed so as to be readily carried in processions.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/exodus/25.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/25-10.htm" title="And they shall make an ark of shittim wood: two cubits and a half shall be the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof....">Exodus 25:10-16</a></span>. The <span class="ital">ark </span>was a chest or coffer, in which the two tables of the law, written by the finger of God, were to be placed. If the Jewish cubit was, as some learned men compute, three inches longer than our half yard, (twenty-one inches in all,) this chest or cabinet was about fifty-two inches long, thirty-one broad, and thirty-one deep; it was overlaid within and without with thin plates of gold; it had a crown or cornice of gold round it; rings and staves to carry it with; and in it he must put <span class="ital">the testimony. </span>The tables of the law are called the <span class="ital">testimony, </span>because God did in them testify his will; his giving them that law was <span class="ital">in token </span>of his favour to them, and their acceptance of it was <span class="ital">in token </span>of their subjection to him. This law was a testimony <span class="ital">to them </span>to direct them in their duty, and would be a testimony <span class="ital">against them </span>if they transgressed. The ark is called the <span class="ital">ark of the testimony, </span>(<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-6.htm" title="And you shall put it before the veil that is by the ark of the testimony, before the mercy seat that is over the testimony, where I will meet with you.">Exodus 30:6</a>,) and the tabernacle, the <span class="ital">tabernacle of the testimony, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/10-11.htm" title="And it came to pass on the twentieth day of the second month, in the second year, that the cloud was taken up from off the tabernacle of the testimony.">Numbers 10:11</a>. The tables of the law were carefully preserved in the ark, to teach us to make much of the word of God, and to hide it in our inmost thoughts, as the ark was placed in the holy of holies. It intimates likewise the care which Divine Providence ever did, and ever will take to preserve the records of divine revelation in the church, so that even in the latter days there shall be <span class="ital">seen in his temple the ark of his testament. </span>See <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-19.htm" title="And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen in his temple the ark of his testament: and there were lightning, and voices, and thunder, and an earthquake, and great hail.">Revelation 11:19</a>.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/25.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>25:10-22 The ark was a chest, overlaid with gold, in which the two tables of the law were to be kept. These tables are called the testimony; God in them testified his will. This law was a testimony to the Israelites, to direct them in their duty, and would be a testimony against them, if they transgressed. This ark was placed in the holy of holies; the blood of the sacrifices was sprinkled, and the incense burned, before it, by the high priest; and above it appeared the visible glory, which was the symbol of the Divine presence. This was a type of Christ in his sinless nature, which saw no corruption, in personal union with his Divine nature, atoning for our sins against it, by his death. The cherubim of gold looked one towards another, and both looked downward toward the ark. It denotes the angels' attendance on the Redeemer, their readiness to do his will, their presence in the assemblies of saints, and their desire to look into the mysteries of the gospel. It was covered with a covering of gold, called the mercy-seat. God is said to dwell, or sit between the cherubim, on the mercy-seat. There he would give his law, and hear supplicants, as a prince on his throne.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/25.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>(compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/37-1.htm">Exodus 37:1-5</a>). The ark is uniformly designated in Exodus the ark of the testimony. Elsewhere it is called the testimony, the ark of the covenant (most frequently in Deuteronomy and the other books of the Old Testament), the ark of the lord, the ark of god, the ark of the strength of the lord, and the holy ark.<p>The ark of the covenant was the central point of the sanctuary. It was designed to contain the testimony <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-16.htm">Exodus 25:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-20.htm">Exodus 40:20</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-26.htm">Deuteronomy 31:26</a>, that is, the tables of the divine law, the terms of the covenant between Yahweh and His people: and it was to support the mercy-seat with its cherubim, from between which He was to hold communion with them <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-22.htm">Exodus 25:22</a>. On this account, in these directions for the construction of the sanctuary, it is named first of all the parts. But on the other hand, in the narrative of the work as it was actually carried out, we find that it was not made until after the tabernacle <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/37-1.htm">Exodus 37:1-9</a>. It was suitable that the receptacle should be first provided to receive and shelter the most sacred of the contents of the sanctuary as soon as it was completed. The order in which the works were executed seems to be given in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/31-7.htm">Exodus 31:7-10</a>, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/35-11.htm">Exodus 35:11-19</a>. The completion of the ark is recorded in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/37-1.htm">Exodus 37:1-5</a>.

The shorter cubit is estimated at 17.6–7 inches, and the longer at 20.5–6 inches (see <span class="ital">DB.</span> iv. 906b ff.; or <span class="ital">EB.</span> iv. 5292 f.). Which cubit is referred to by P is uncertain: but for the purpose of forming a general idea of the Tabernacle, as conceived by him, the difference is immaterial. It is remarkable that in Egypt also two cubits were in use, of almost exactly the same lengths, the ‘short cubit (= 17.68 in.) of 6 handbreadths, and the ‘royal’ cubit of 7 handbreadths (DB iv. 907b).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10-22.</span> - THE PATTERN OF THE ARK.  - Moses is first shown, not the pattern of the tabernacle, but the patterns of those things which it was to contain - the ark, the table of shew-bread, and the seven-branched candlestick, or lamp-stand, with its appurtenances. The ark, as the very most essential part of the entire construction, is described first. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt make an ark of shittim wood</span>. Arks were an ordinary part of the religious furniture of temples in Egypt, and were greatly venerated. They usually contained a figure or emblem, of some deity. Occasionally they were in the shape of boats; but the most ordinary form was that of a cupboard or chest. They were especially constructed for the purpose of being carried about in a procession, and had commonly rings at the side, through which poles were passed on such occasions. It must be freely admitted, that the general idea of the "Ark," as well as certain points in its ornamentation, was adopted from the Egyptian religion. Egyptian arks were commonly of sycamore wood. <span class="cmt_word">Two cubits and a half</span>, etc. As there is no reason to believe that the Hebrew cubit differed seriously from the cubits of Greece and Rome, we may safely regard the Ark of the Covenant as a chest or box, three feet nine inches long, two feet three inches wide, and two feet three inches deep. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/exodus/25.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>&#1514;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500;&#1514;, &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, purple of a dark blue shade, approaching black rather than bright blue. &#1488;&#1512;&#1490;&#1468;&#1502;&#1503;, &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1; (Chald. &#1488;&#1512;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1503;, 2 Chron, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/2-6.htm">Exodus 2:6</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/5-7.htm">Daniel 5:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/5-16.htm">Daniel 5:16</a>; - Sanskrit, rgaman or rgavan, colore rubro praeditus), true purple of a dark red colour. &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497; &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1500;&#1506;&#1514;, literally the crimson prepared from the dead bodies and nests of the glow-worm, <p>(Note: Glanzwurm: "the Linnean name is coccus ilicis.
