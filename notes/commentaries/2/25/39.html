The candlestick, with all its appurtenances, was to weigh exactly a talent of gold.

As both &#1493;&#1508;&#1512;&#1495; &#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1514;&#1468;&#1512; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-33.htm">Exodus 25:33</a>) and &#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1512;&#1495;&#1497;&#1492; &#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-34.htm">Exodus 25:34</a>) are connected with the previous words without a copula, Knobel and Thenius regard these words as standing in explanatory apposition to the preceding ones, and suppose the meaning to be that the flower-cups were to consist of knobs with flowers issuing from them. But apart from the singular idea of calling a knob or bulb with a flower bursting from it a flower-cup, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-31.htm">Exodus 25:31</a> decidedly precludes any such explanation; for cups, knobs, and flowers are mentioned there in connection with the base and stem, as three separate things which were quite as distinct the one from the other as the base and the stem. The words in question are appended in both verses to &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; in the sense of subordination; &#1493; is generally used in such cases, but it is omitted here before &#1499;&#1508;&#1514;&#1512;, probably to avoid ambiguity, as the two words to be subordinated are brought into closer association as one idea by the use of this copula. And if &#1499;&#1508;&#1514;&#1512; and &#1508;&#1512;&#1495; are to be distinguished from &#1504;&#1489;&#1497;&#1506;, the objection made by Thenius to our rendering &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1468;&#1491; "almond-blossom-shaped," namely, that neither the almond nor the almond-blossom has at all the shape of a basin, falls entirely to the ground; and there is all the less reason to question this rendering, on account of the unanimity with which it has been adopted in the ancient versions, whereas the rendering proposed by Thenius, "wakened up, i.e., a burst or opened calix," has neither foundation nor probability.</body></html>
