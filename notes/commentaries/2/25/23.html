When this had been shown to Moses the next thing to be done was to set before him the furniture of the outer sanctuary, or holy place. This consisted of three articles—(1) The table of shewbread, described in the present passage; (2) the golden candlestick, described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/25-31.htm" title="And you shall make a candlestick of pure gold: of beaten work shall the candlestick be made: his shaft, and his branches, his bowls, his knops, and his flowers, shall be of the same.">Exodus 25:31-40</a>; and (3) the altar of incense, described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/30-1.htm" title="And you shall make an altar to burn incense on: of shittim wood shall you make it.">Exodus 30:1-10</a>. The “table of shewbread” was a receptacle for the twelve loaves, which were to be “set continually before the Lord” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/24-8.htm" title="Every sabbath he shall set it in order before the LORD continually, being taken from the children of Israel by an everlasting covenant.">Leviticus 24:8</a>) as a thank-offering on the part of His people—a perpetual acknowledgment of His perpetual protection and favour. It was to be just large enough to contain the twelve loaves, set in two rows, being a yard long, and a foot and a-half broad. The vessels belonging to the table (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-29.htm" title="And you shall make the dishes thereof, and spoons thereof, and covers thereof, and bowls thereof, to cover with: of pure gold shall you make them.">Exodus 25:29</a>) were not placed on it.<p>(23) <span class= "bld">Of shittim wood.</span>—See the last Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-5.htm" title="And rams' skins dyed red, and badgers' skins, and shittim wood,">Exodus 25:5</a>.

This table, with the articles on it, and its use, seems to typify the communion which the Lord holds with his redeemed people in his ordinances, the provisions of his house, the feasts they are favoured with. Also the food for their souls, which they always find when they hunger after it; and the delight he takes in their persons and services, as presented before him in Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/25.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>(Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/37-10.htm">Exodus 37:10-16</a>.) The table and the candlestick figured on the Arch of Titus at Rome are those of the Maccabaean times, but made as nearly as possible after the ancient models reproduced under the direction of Solomon and Zerubbabel. The details and size of the figure, and the description of Josephus, appear to agree very nearly with the directions here given to Moses, and to illustrate them in several particulars. Josephus says that the table was like the so-called Delphic tables, richly ornamented pieces of furniture in use amongst the Romans, which were sometimes, if not always, covered with gold or silver.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/exodus/25.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>23. table of shittim wood&#8212;of the same material and decorations as the ark [see on [25]Ex 25:5], and like it, too, furnished with rings for the poles on which it was carried [Ex 25:26]. The staves, however, were taken out of it when stationary, in order not to encumber the priests while engaged in their services at the table. It was half a cubit less than the ark in length and breadth, but of the same height.

As the sanctuary or tabernacle was an house for God to dwell in, he would have the proper furniture of an house, as a table, candlestick, &amp;c. This table was to be in the same place with the ark and mercy seat; they were set in the holy of holies, where there were nothing else; but this in the holy place, on the north side of it, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/26-35.htm">Exodus 26:35</a> its principal use was to set the shewbread on, as after mentioned, and was typical of Christ, and communion with him, both in this life, and that to come. There is the table of the Lord, to which his people are now admitted, where he sits down with them, and they with him, to have fellowship with him in the ministration of the word and ordinances, of which he is the sum and substance; and this is very desirable and delightful, and an instance of his condescending grace, Sol 1:12, and he will have a table in his kingdom hereafter, where his saints shall eat and drink with him, in which their chief happiness will consist, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-30.htm">Luke 22:30</a> This table may be considered as typical of Christ himself, for he is both table and provisions and everything to his people; and of him in both his natures; in his human nature, it being made of shittim wood, incorruptible; for though Christ died in, that nature, yet he saw no corruption, he rose again and lives for evermore; in his divine nature, by the gold it was covered with: <p>two cubits shall be the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof; it was two Jewish square cubits in length, which are about six English square feet and above half, viz. ninety four inches, according to Bishop Cumberland (t). It was neither so long nor so broad as the ark by half a cubit, but was of the same height with it, being about thirty two inches high and three quarters, according to the Jewish and Egyptian cubit, which was about twenty one inches and more and was a proper height for a table; and this measure, no doubt, takes in the thickness of the table, and the height of the seat, as Jarchi and Aben Ezra observe. <p>(t) Ut supra.

From the description of the ark, which constituted the sole furniture of the most holy place, God proceeded to describe the furniture of the holy place, or body of the tabernacle, which was to consist of three objects - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> A table, called the table of shew-bread ("bread of presence" or "bread of setting-forth"). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> A candelabrum, or lamp-stand; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> An altar for the offering of incense. Of these the table seems to have been regarded as of primary importance; and its description is therefore made to follow immediately on that of the ark. It was of acacia wood, overlaid with pure gold, and was of the most ordinary shape - oblong-square, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, with four legs, one at each corner. The only peculiar features of the table, besides its material, were the border, or edging, which surrounded it at the top, the framework which strengthened the legs (ver. 25), and the rings by which it was to be carried from place to place. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Two cubits shall be the length thereof,</span> etc. The table was to be three feel long, one foot six inches broad, and two feet three inches high. It was thus quite a small table, narrow for its length, and about two inches below the ordinary height. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/exodus/25.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In addition to this, Moses was to make a capporeth (&#x3b9;&#788;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;, lxx; propitiatorium, Vulg.), an atoning covering. The meaning operculum, lid (Ges.), cannot be sustained, notwithstanding the fact that the capporeth was placed upon the ark (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-21.htm">Exodus 25:21</a>) and covered the tables laid within it; for the verb &#1499;&#1508;&#1512; has not the literal signification of covering or covering up either in Kal or Piel. In Kal it only occurs in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/6-14.htm">Genesis 6:14</a>, where it means to pitch or tar; in Piel it is only used in the figurative sense of covering up sin or guilt, i.e., of making atonement. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-11.htm">1 Chronicles 28:11</a> is decisive on this point, where the holy of holies, in which the capporeth was, is called &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;, which cannot possibly mean the covering-house, but must signify the house of atonement. The force of this passage is not weakened by the remark made by Delitzsch and others, to the effect that it was only in the later usage of the language that the idea of covering gave place to that of the covering up or expiation of sin; for neither in the earlier nor earliest usage of the language can the supposed primary meaning of the word be anywhere discovered. Knobel's remark has still less force, viz., that the ark must have had a lid, and it must have been called a lid. For if from the very commencement this lid had a more important purpose than that of a simple covering, it might also have received its name from this special purpose, even though this was not fully explained to the Israelites till a later period in the giving of the law (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-15.htm">Leviticus 16:15-16</a>). It must, however, have been obvious to every one, that it was to be something more than the mere lid of the ark, from the simple fact that it was not to be made, like the ark, of wood plated with gold, but to be made of pure gold, and to have two golden cherubs upon the top. The cherubim were to be made of gold &#1502;&#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492; (from &#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492; to turn), i.e., literally, turned work (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-24.htm">Isaiah 3:24</a>), here, according to Onkelos, &#1504;&#1490;&#1497;&#1491; opus ductile, work beaten with the hammer and rounded, so that the figures were not solid but hollow (see Bhr, i. p. 380). </body></html>
