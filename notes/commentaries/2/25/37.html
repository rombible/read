The candlestick was placed on the south side of the holy place <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/26-35.htm">Exodus 26:35</a>, with the line of lamps parallel with the wall, or, according to Josephus, somewhat obliquely. If the wick-mouths of the lamps were turned outwards, they would give light over against the candlestick; that is, toward the north side (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/8-2.htm">Numbers 8:2</a>).<p>Light was of necessity required in the tabernacle, and wherever light is used in ceremonial observance, it may of course be taken in a general way as a figure of the Light of Truth; but in the sanctuary of the covenanted people, it must plainly have been understood as expressly significant that the number of the lamps (seven) agreed with the number of the covenant.
