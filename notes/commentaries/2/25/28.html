This table, with the articles on it, and its use, seems to typify the communion which the Lord holds with his redeemed people in his ordinances, the provisions of his house, the feasts they are favoured with. Also the food for their souls, which they always find when they hunger after it; and the delight he takes in their persons and services, as presented before him in Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/25.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Over against the border - Rather, Over against the framing; that is, the rings were to be placed not upon the framing itself, but at the extremities of the legs answering to each corner of it.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/exodus/25.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>24. crown&#8212;the moulding or ornamental rim, which is thought to have been raised above the level of the table, to prevent anything from falling off.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/exodus/25.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/exodus/25.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And thou shall make the staves of shittim wood, and overlay them with gold,....

That is to say, the cherubs were to spread out their wings in such a manner as to form a screen over the capporeth, with their faces turned towards one another, but inclining or stooping towards the capporeth. The reason for this is given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-22.htm">Exodus 25:22</a>. There - viz., above the capporeth that was placed upon the ark containing the testimony - Jehovah would present Himself to Moses (&#1504;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491;, from &#1497;&#1506;&#1491; to appoint, to present one's self to a person at an appointed place, to meet with him), and talk with him "from above the capporeth, out from between the two cherubs upon the ark of testimony, all that I shall command thee for the sons of Israel" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-42.htm">Exodus 29:42</a>). Through this divine promise and the fulfilment of it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-35.htm">Exodus 40:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-1.htm">Leviticus 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/1-1.htm">Numbers 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-19.htm">Numbers 16:19</a>), the ark of the covenant together with the capporeth became the throne of Jehovah in the midst of His chosen people, the footstool of the God of Israel (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-2.htm">1 Chronicles 28:2</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/132-7.htm">Psalm 132:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/99-5.htm">Psalm 99:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-1.htm">Lamentations 2:1</a>). The ark, with the tables of the covenant as the self-attestation of God, formed the foundation of this throne, to show that the kingdom of grace which was established in Israel through the medium of the covenant, was founded in justice and righteousness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-15.htm">Psalm 89:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/97-2.htm">Psalm 97:2</a>). The gold plate upon the ark formed the footstool of the throne for Him, who caused His name, i.e., the real presence of His being, to dwell in a cloud between the two cherubim above their outspread wings; and there He not only made known His will to His people in laws and commandments, but revealed Himself as the jealous God who visited sin and showed mercy (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5-6</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6-7</a>), - the latter more especially on the great day of atonement, when, through the medium of the blood of the sin-offering sprinkled upon and in front of the capporeth, He granted reconciliation to His people for all their transgressions in all their sin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-14.htm">Leviticus 16:14</a>.). Thus the footstool of God became a throne of grace (<a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-16.htm">Hebrews 4:16</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-5.htm">Exodus 9:5</a>), which received its name capporeth or &#x3b9;&#788;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; from the fact that the highest and most perfect act of atonement under the Old Testament was performed upon it. Jehovah, who betrothed His people to Himself in grace and mercy for an everlasting covenant (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-2.htm">Hosea 2:2</a>), was enthroned upon it, above the wings of the two cherubim, which stood on either side of His throne; and hence He is represented as "dwelling (between) the cherubim" &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501; &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;   (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-4.htm">1 Samuel 4:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-2.htm">2 Samuel 6:2</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/80-2.htm">Psalm 80:2</a>, etc.). The cherubs were not combinations of animal forms, taken from man, the lion, the ox, and the eagle, as many have inferred from <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1.htm">Ezekiel 1</a> and 10, for even the composite beings which Ezekiel saw with four faces had a human figure (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-5.htm">Ezekiel 1:5</a>); but they are to be regarded as figures made in a human form, and not in a kneeling posture, but, according to the analogy of <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/3-13.htm">2 Chronicles 3:13</a>, standing upright. Consequently, as the union of four faces in one cherub is peculiar to Ezekiel, and the cherubs of the ark of the covenant, like those of Solomon's temple, had but one face each, not only did the human type form the general basis of these figures, but in every respect, with the exception of the wings, they were made in the likeness of men. And this is the only form which would answer the purpose for which they were intended, viz., to represent the cherubim, or heavenly spirits, who were stationed to prevent the return of the first man to the garden of Eden after his expulsion thence, and keep the way to the tree of life. Standing upon the capporeth of the ark of the covenant, the typical foundation of the throne of Jehovah, which Ezekiel saw in the vision as &#1512;&#1511;&#1497;&#1506; &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; &#1512;&#1511;&#1497; "the likeness of a firmament" (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-22.htm">Ezekiel 1:22</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-25.htm">Ezekiel 1:25</a>), with their wings outspread and faces lowered, they represented the spirits of heaven, who surround Jehovah, the heavenly King, when seated upon His throne, as His most exalted servants and the witnesses of His sovereign and saving glory; so that Jehovah enthroned above the wings of the cherubim was set forth as the God of Hosts who is exalted above all the angels, surrounded by the assembly or council of the holy ones (<a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/89-6.htm">Psalm 89:6-9</a>), who bow their faces towards the capporeth, studying the secrets of the divine counsels of love (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-12.htm">1 Peter 1:12</a>), and worshipping Him that liveth for ever and ever (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-10.htm">Revelation 4:10</a>). </body></html>
