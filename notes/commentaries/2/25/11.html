Gilding was well known in Egypt long before the time of Moses, and may have been within the artistic powers of some of the Hebrews. But it is a process requiring much apparatus, and less likely to have been practised in the desert than the far simpler one of overlaying with gold plates. Gold plate would also have been regarded as more suitable, because more valuable. It is the Jewish tradition that gold plates were employed.<p><span class= "bld">crown of gold</span>—i.e., a rim or border of gold, carried round the edge of the chest at the top.

These tables are called the testimony; God in them testified his will. This law was a testimony to the Israelites, to direct them in their duty, and would be a testimony against them, if they transgressed. This ark was placed in the holy of holies; the blood of the sacrifices was sprinkled, and the incense burned, before it, by the high priest; and above it appeared the visible glory, which was the symbol of the Divine presence. This was a type of Christ in his sinless nature, which saw no corruption, in personal union with his Divine nature, atoning for our sins against it, by his death. The cherubim of gold looked one towards another, and both looked downward toward the ark. It denotes the angels' attendance on the Redeemer, their readiness to do his will, their presence in the assemblies of saints, and their desire to look into the mysteries of the gospel. It was covered with a covering of gold, called the mercy-seat. God is said to dwell, or sit between the cherubim, on the mercy-seat. There he would give his law, and hear supplicants, as a prince on his throne.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/25.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Overlay it with pure gold - Words descriptive of the common process of gilding.

Or, "cover it with pure gold." As gilding was well known in Egypt long before the time of the exodus, it is quite possible that the chest was simply gilt without and  within. It may, however, have been overlaid with thin plates of gold (a practice also known in Egypt, and common elsewhere) - which is the view taken by the Jewish commentators. The <span class="cmt_word">crown of gold</span> was probably an ornamental moulding or edging round the top of the chest. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/exodus/25.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>&#1502;&#1488;&#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; &#1506;&#1512;&#1514; rams' skins reddened, i.e., dyed red. &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473; is either the seal, phoca, or else, as this is not known to exist in the Arabian Gulf, the &#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  equals  &#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1; of the ancients, as Knobel supposes, or &#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;, the sea-cow (Manati, Halicora), which is found in the Red Sea, and has a skin that is admirably adapted for sandals. Hesychius supposes it to have been the latter, which is probably the same as the large fish Tn or Atm, that is caught in the Red Sea, and belongs to the same species as the Halicora (Robinson, Pal. i. p. 170); as its skin is also used by the Bedouin Arabs for making sandals (Burckhardt, Syr. p. 861). In the Manati the upper skin differs from the under; the former being larger, thicker, and coarser than the latter, which is only two lines in thickness and very tough, so that the skin would be well adapted either for the thick covering of tents or for the finer kinds of ornamental sandals (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-10.htm">Ezekiel 16:10</a>). &#1513;&#1473;&#1496;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; &#1506;&#1510;&#1497; acacia-wood. &#1513;&#1473;&#1496;&#1468;&#1492; for &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1496;&#1492;, the true acacia (acacia vera), which grows in Egypt and on the Arabian peninsula into a tree of the size of a nut-tree, or even larger;<p>(Note: See Abdallatif's Merkwrdigkeiten Aegyptens, and Rosenmller, Althk. iv. i. pp. 278-9. This genuine acacia, Sont, must not be confounded, according to Robinson (Pal. 2, 350), with the Acacia gumnifera (Talh). Seetzen also makes a distinction between the Thollhh, the Szont of the Egyptians, and the Szeil, and between an acacia which produces gum and one which does not; but he also observes that the same tree is called both Thollhh and Szeil in different places. He then goes on to say that he did not find a single tree large enough to furnish planks of ten cubits in length and one and a half in breadth for the construction of the ark (he means, of the tabernacle), and he therefore conjectures that the Israelites may have gone to Egypt for the materials with which to build the tabernacle. But he has overlooked the fact, that it is not stated in the text of the Bible that the boards of the tabernacle, which were a cubit and a half in breadth, were cut from one plank of the breadth named; and also that the trees in the valleys of the peninsula of Sinai are being more and more sacrificed to the charcoal trade of the Bedouin Arabs (see p. 366), and therefore that no conclusion can be drawn from the present condition of the trees as to what they were in the far distant antiquity.)<p>the only tree in Arabia deserta from which planks could be cut, and the wood of which is very light and yet very durable.</body></html>
