It would seem from <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/25-33.htm">Exodus 25:33-35</a> that the ornamentation of the candlestick consisted of uniform members, each comprising a series of an almond flower, a knob and a lily; that the stem comprised four of these members; that each pair of branches was united to the stem at one of the knobs; and that each branch comprised three members. In comparing the description in the text with the sculptured figure, allowance must be made for some deviation in the sculptor's copy.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/exodus/25.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>33. knops&#8212;old spelling for "knobs"&#8212;bosses.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/exodus/25.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/exodus/25.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Three bowls made like unto almonds, with a knop and a flower in one branch,.... There were three bowls or cups in the form of almond nuts to each branch, which were either to hold oil for the lamps, as before observed, or, as others think, to catch the snuff which fell from them; and there were a "knop", which, according to the signification of the word, was in the form of a pomegranate, and a flower, which the Targum of Jonathan renders a lily; and they are both in Scripture emblems of the saints endowed with the gifts and graces of the Spirit: <p>and three bowls made like almonds in the other branch; on the other side of the candlestick, opposite to the former: <p>so in the six branches that come out of the candlestick; there were the same number of bowls, with a knop and a flower in the rest of the branches, as in those mentioned. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/exodus/25.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Three bowls made like unto almonds, with a knop and a flower in one branch; and three bowls made like almonds in the other branch, with a knop and a flower: so in the six branches that come out of the candlestick.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/exodus/25.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">33</span>.

Cups shaped like almond blossoms seem to be intended. Each branch had three of these in succession, then a pomegranate and a lily-flower. The lily probably represented the Egyptian lotus, or water-lily. <span class="cmt_word">In the other branch</span>. Rather, "on another branch." There were six branches, not two only. The ornamentation of two is described; then we are told that the remainder were similar. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/exodus/25.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Table of Shew-Bread (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/37-10.htm">Exodus 37:10-16</a>). - The table for the shew-bread (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-30.htm">Exodus 25:30</a>) was to be made of acacia-wood, two cubits long, one broad, and one and a half high, and to be plated with pure gold, having a golden wreath round, and a "finish (&#1502;&#1505;&#1490;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;) of a hand-breadth round about," i.e., a border of a hand-breadth in depth surrounding and enclosing the four sides, upon which the top of the table was laid, and into the four corners of which the feet of the table were inserted. A golden wreath was to be placed round this rim. As there is no article attached to &#1494;&#1512;&#1470;&#1494;&#1492;&#1489; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-25.htm">Exodus 25:25</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/37-12.htm">Exodus 37:12</a>), so as to connect it with the &#1494;&#1512; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/25-24.htm">Exodus 25:24</a>, we must conclude that there were two such ornamental wreaths, one round the slab of the table, the other round the rim which was under the slab. At the four corners of the four feet, near the point at which they joined the rim, four rings were to be fastened for &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, i.e., to hold the poles with which the table was carried, as in the case of the ark. </body></html>
