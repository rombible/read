He ordered a royal palace to be set up among them for himself, called a sanctuary, or holy place, or habitation. There he showed his presence among them. And because in the wilderness they dwelt in tents, this royal palace was ordered to be a tabernacle, that it might move with them. The people were to furnish Moses with the materials, by their own free will. The best use we can make of our worldly wealth, is to honour God with it in works of piety and charity. We should ask, not only, What must we do? but, What may we do for God? Whatever they gave, they must give it cheerfully, not grudgingly, for God loves a cheerful giver, 2Co 9:7. What is laid out in the service of God, we must reckon well bestowed; and whatsoever is done in God's service, must be done by his direction.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/25.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the notes to <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/27.htm">Exodus 27</a>; 28; 30,<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/exodus/25.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. ephod&#8212;a square cloak, hanging down from the shoulders, and worn by priests.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/exodus/25.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Onyx stones, </span> or, <span class="ital">sardonyx stones</span>.
