He ordered a royal palace to be set up among them for himself, called a sanctuary, or holy place, or habitation. There he showed his presence among them. And because in the wilderness they dwelt in tents, this royal palace was ordered to be a tabernacle, that it might move with them. The people were to furnish Moses with the materials, by their own free will. The best use we can make of our worldly wealth, is to honour God with it in works of piety and charity. We should ask, not only, What must we do? but, What may we do for God? Whatever they gave, they must give it cheerfully, not grudgingly, for God loves a cheerful giver, 2Co 9:7. What is laid out in the service of God, we must reckon well bestowed; and whatsoever is done in God's service, must be done by his direction.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/25.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the notes to <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/27.htm">Exodus 27</a>; 28; 30,<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/exodus/25.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. badgers' skins&#8212;The badger was an unclean animal, and is not a native of the East&#8212;rather some kind of fish, of the leather of which sandals are made in the East.

That the sanctuary to be erected would require to be artificially lighted is assumed. Later, a "candlestick" is ordered (vers. 31-37). The people were to provide the oil which was to be burnt in the "candlestick." In <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/27-20.htm">Exodus 27:20</a>, we are told that the oil was to be "pure oil olive beaten." <span class="cmt_word">Spices for anointing oil.</span> Anointing oil would be needed for the sanctification of the Tabernacle, the ark, and all the holy vessels, as also for the consecration of Aaron and his sons to the priesthood. The spices required are enumerated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-23.htm">Exodus 30:23, 24</a>. They consisted of pure myrrh, sweet cinnamon, sweet calamus, and cassia. <span class="cmt_word">And for sweet incense</span>. The spices needed for the incense were, according to our translators, stacte, onycha, galbanum and frankincense (<span class="accented">ib</span>, 34). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/exodus/24.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"And Moses was on the mountain forty days and forty nights," including the six days of waiting, - the whole time without eating and drinking (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-9.htm">Deuteronomy 9:9</a>). The number forty was certainly significant, since it was not only repeated on the occasion of his second protracted stay upon Mount Sinai (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-28.htm">Exodus 34:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-18.htm">Deuteronomy 9:18</a>), but occurred again in the forty days of Elijah's journey to Horeb the mount of God in the strength of the food received from the angel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-8.htm">1 Kings 19:8</a>), and in the fasting of Jesus at the time of His temptation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-2.htm">Matthew 4:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-2.htm">Luke 4:2</a>), and even appears to have been significant in the forty years of Israel's wandering in the desert (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-2.htm">Deuteronomy 8:2</a>). In all these cases the number refers to a period of temptation, of the trial of faith, as well as to a period of the strengthening of faith through the miraculous support bestowed by God. </body></html>
