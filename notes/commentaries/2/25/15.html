He who touched the ark imperilled his life. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_samuel/6-6.htm" title="And when they came to Nachon's threshing floor, Uzzah put forth his hand to the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the oxen shook it.">2Samuel 6:6-7</a>.)<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/25.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>25:10-22 The ark was a chest, overlaid with gold, in which the two tables of the law were to be kept. These tables are called the testimony; God in them testified his will. This law was a testimony to the Israelites, to direct them in their duty, and would be a testimony against them, if they transgressed. This ark was placed in the holy of holies; the blood of the sacrifices was sprinkled, and the incense burned, before it, by the high priest; and above it appeared the visible glory, which was the symbol of the Divine presence. This was a type of Christ in his sinless nature, which saw no corruption, in personal union with his Divine nature, atoning for our sins against it, by his death. The cherubim of gold looked one towards another, and both looked downward toward the ark. It denotes the angels' attendance on the Redeemer, their readiness to do his will, their presence in the assemblies of saints, and their desire to look into the mysteries of the gospel. It was covered with a covering of gold, called the mercy-seat. God is said to dwell, or sit between the cherubim, on the mercy-seat. There he would give his law, and hear supplicants, as a prince on his throne.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/25.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They shall not be taken from it - This direction was probably given in order that the ark might not be touched by the hand (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-6.htm">2 Samuel 6:6</a>).<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/exodus/25.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15. staves shall be in the rings of the ark&#8212;that is, always remain in the rings, whether the ark be at rest or in motion.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/exodus/25.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/exodus/25.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>The staves shall be in the rings of the ark,....

The object probably was that there might be no need of touching even the rings, when the ark was set down or taken up. The bearers took hold of the staves only, which were no part of the ark. On the danger of touching the ark itself, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-6.htm">2 Samuel 6:6, 7</a>. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/exodus/25.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>With these freewill-offerings they were to make the Lord a sanctuary, that He might dwell in the midst of them (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-22.htm">Exodus 25:22</a>). "According to all that I let thee see (show thee), the pattern of the dwelling and the pattern of all its furniture, so shall ye make it." The participle &#1502;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; does not refer to the past; and there is nothing to indicate that it does, either in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/25-40.htm">Exodus 25:40</a>, where "in the mount" occurs, or in the use of the preterite in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/26-30.htm">Exodus 26:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/27-8.htm">Exodus 27:8</a>. It does not follow from the expression, "which is showed thee in the mount," that Moses had already left the mountain and returned to the camp; and the use of the preterite in the passages last named may be simply explained, either on the supposition that the sight of the pattern or model of the whole building and its component parts preceded the description of the different things required for the completion of the building, or that the instructions to make the different parts in such and such a way, pointed to a time when the sight of the model really belonged to the past. On the other hand, the model for the building could not well be shown to Moses, before he had been told that the gifts to be made by the people were to be devoted to the building of a sanctuary. &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1514;, from &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492; to build, lit., a building, then a figure of anything, a copy of representation of different things, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-17.htm">Deuteronomy 4:17</a>.; a drawing or sketch, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-10.htm">2 Kings 16:10</a> : it never means the original, not even in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/144-12.htm">Psalm 144:12</a>, as Delitzsch supposes (see his Com. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-5.htm">Hebrews 8:5</a>). In such passages as <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-11.htm">1 Chronicles 28:11-12</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-19.htm">1 Chronicles 28:19</a>, where it may be rendered plan, it does not signify an original, but simply means a model or drawing, founded upon an idea, or taken from some existing object, according to which a building was to be constructed. Still less can the object connected with &#1514;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1514; in the genitive be understood as referring to the original, from which the &#1514;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1514; was taken; so that we cannot follow the Rabbins in their interpretation of this passage, as affirming that the heavenly originals of the tabernacle and its furniture had been shown to Moses in a vision upon the mountain. What was shown to him was simply a picture or model of the earthly tabernacle and its furniture, which were to be made by him. Both <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-44.htm">Acts 7:44</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-5.htm">Hebrews 8:5</a> are perfectly reconcilable with this interpretation of our verse, which is the only one that can be grammatically sustained. The words of Stephen, that Moses was to make the tabernacle &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#788;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;, "according to the fashion that he had seen," are so indefinite, that the text of Exodus must be adduced to explain them. And when the writer of the Epistle to the Hebrews cites the words, "See that thou make all things &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3bf;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;" (according to the pattern showed to thee in the mount), from <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-40.htm">Exodus 25:40</a> of this chapter, as a proof the Levitical priests only served the type and shadow of heavenly things (&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;); it is true, his words may be understood as showing that he regarded the earthly tabernacle with all its arrangements as only the counterpart and copy of a heavenly original. But this interpretation is neither necessary nor well founded. For although the author, by following the Sept., in which &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1504;&#1497;&#1514;&#1501; is rendered &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, the suffix being dropped, leaves it just a possible thing to understand the &#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; shown to Moses as denoting a heavenly tabernacle (or temple); yet he has shown very clearly that this was not his own view, when he explains the "patterns of things in the heavens" (&#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2;) and "the true" things (&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;) of both the tabernacle and its furniture as denoting the "heaven" (&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;) into which Christ had entered, and not any temple in heaven. If the &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3b1; are heaven itself, the &#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; showed to Moses cannot have been a temple in heaven, but either heaven itself, or, more probably still, as there could be no necessity for this to be shown to Moses in a pictorial representation, a picture of heavenly things or divine realities, which was shown to Moses that he might copy and embody it in the earthly tabernacle.<p>(Note: The conclusion drawn by Delitzsch (Hebrerbrief, p. 337), that because the author does not refer to anything between the &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3b1; and their &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3b1; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-24.htm">Exodus 9:24</a>), the &#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; can only have consisted of the &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3b1; themselves, is a mistake. All that the premises preclude, is the intervention of any objective reality, or third material object, but not the introduction of a pictorial representation, through which Moses was shown how to copy the heavenly realities and embody them in an earthly form. The earthly tent would no more be a copy of the copy of a heavenly original in this case, than a palace built according to a model is a copy of that model. Moreover, Delitzsch himself thinks it is "not conceivable that, when Moses was favoured with a view of the heavenly world, it was left to him to embody what he saw in a material form, to bring it within the limits of space." He therefore assumes, both for the reason assigned, and because "no mortal has ever looked directly at heavenly things," that "inasmuch as what was seen could not be directly reflected in the mirror of his mind, not to mention the retina of his eye, it was set before him in a visible form, and according to the operation of God who showed it, in a manner adapted to serve as a model of the earthly sanctuary to be erected." Thus he admits that it is true that Moses did not see the heavenly world itself, but only a copy of it that was shown to him by God.)<p>If we understand the verse before us in this sense, it merely expresses what is already implied in the fact itself. If God showed Moses a picture or model of the tabernacle, and instructed him to make everything exactly according to this pattern, we must assume that in the tabernacle and its furniture heavenly realities were to be expressed in earthly forms; or, to put it more clearly, that the thoughts of God concerning salvation and His kingdom, which the earthly building was to embody and display, were visibly set forth in the pattern shown. The symbolical and typical significance of the whole building necessarily follows from this, though without our being obliged to imitate the Rabbins, and seek in the tabernacle the counterpart or copy of a heavenly temple. What these divine thoughts were that were embodied in the tabernacle, can only be gathered from the arrangement and purpose of the whole building and its separate parts; and upon this point the description furnishes so much information, that when read in the light of the whole of the covenant revelation, it gives to all the leading points precisely the clearness that we require. </body></html>
