It is this which was taken from the Herodian Temple by the Romans, and is represented on the famous Arch of Titus. In the Temple at Shiloh there was only a single lamp (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-3.htm" title="And ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God was, and Samuel was laid down to sleep;">1 Samuel 3:3</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">The Ark<span class="p"><br /><br /></span></span>It is impossible to give here a history of the Ark; but a few words may be permitted, respecting the religious ideas associated with it, and opinions as to its possible origin.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The oldest name of the ark was the ‘ark of Jehovah,’ <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/3-13.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, as soon as the soles of the feet of the priests that bear the ark of the LORD, the LORD of all the earth, shall rest in the waters of Jordan, that the waters of Jordan shall be cut off from the waters that come down from above; and they shall stand on an heap.">Joshua 3:13</a> &c. (or ‘of God,’ <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-3.htm" title="And ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God was, and Samuel was laid down to sleep;">1 Samuel 3:3</a> &c.), or, less frequently, ‘the ark’ alone (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/10-35.htm" title="And it came to pass, when the ark set forward, that Moses said, Rise up, LORD, and let your enemies be scattered; and let them that hate you flee before you.">Numbers 10:35</a> <span class="ital">al.</span>): the Deut. expression (see p. 193) is ‘the ark of the covenant’ (with or without ‘of Jehovah’ added): P’s characteristic expression is the ‘ark of the testimony’ (13 times: see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-16.htm" title="And you shall put into the ark the testimony which I shall give you.">Exodus 25:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-22.htm" title="And there I will meet with you, and I will commune with you from above the mercy seat, from between the two cherubim which are on the ark of the testimony, of all things which I will give you in commandment to the children of Israel.">Exodus 25:22</a>). Both these latter terms are used with allusion to the tables inscribed with the Decalogue, which,—as in our extant sources (see however on <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-3.htm" title="And no man shall come up with you, neither let any man be seen throughout all the mount; neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that mount.">Exodus 34:3</a>) we first learn from <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-2.htm" title="And I will write on the tables the words that were in the first tables which you brake, and you shall put them in the ark.">Deuteronomy 10:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-5.htm" title="And I turned myself and came down from the mount, and put the tables in the ark which I had made; and there they be, as the LORD commanded me.">Deuteronomy 10:5</a>,—were contained in it. In itself the ‘ark’ is similar in principle to the sacred chests in which many other ancient nations, as the Egyptians, Etruscans, Greeks, kept images, or other sacred objects, and sometimes also carried them in processions. Now it is noticeable that in nearly all the pre-Deuteronomic references, the ark—which in these passages ‘must be thought of as a simple chest, very different from the gold-covered shrine of P, with its’ massive golden ‘mercy-seat, and over-arching cherubim’ (Kennedy)—appears as much more than a mere receptacle of two inscribed stones; it is, in fact, in a very special sense, a symbol and pledge of Jehovah’s presence; and it is even spoken of as if He were actually present in it, so that wherever the ark was, Jehovah was there with it. Especially in war is it thus regarded as the material vehicle or accompaniment of Jehovah’s presence. In the ancient verses preserved in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/10-35.htm" title="And it came to pass, when the ark set forward, that Moses said, Rise up, LORD, and let your enemies be scattered; and let them that hate you flee before you.">Numbers 10:35</a> f.—originally, to judge from the terms used, the prayer with which the Ark was sent forth to battle, and the welcome with which its return was greeted,—‘Arise, O Jehovah, and let thine enemies be scattered, Let them that hate thee flee before thee,’ and ‘Return, O Jehovah, to the myriads of Israel’s clans,’ Jehovah is addressed as though He were present in the ark, and moved with it. The case is similar in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-3.htm" title="And when the people were come into the camp, the elders of Israel said, Why has the LORD smitten us to day before the Philistines? Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of Shiloh to us, that, when it comes among us, it may save us out of the hand of our enemies.">1 Samuel 4:3</a>, where the Hebrew sheikhs say, ‘Let us fetch the ark of Jehovah … from Shiloh, that it may come … and save us,’ and when it arrives, the Philistines exclaim (<span class="ital">v.</span> 7), ‘God is come into the camp’; and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-19.htm" title="And the sons of Merari; Mahali and Mushi: these are the families of Levi according to their generations.">Exodus 6:19</a>, where, after the ark has been brought back, and some of the men of Bethshemesh are smitten, the others exclaim, ‘Who is able to stand before Jehovah this holy God?’ So in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-5.htm" title="And David and all the house of Israel played before the LORD on all manner of instruments made of fir wood, even on harps, and on psalteries, and on tambourines, and on cornets, and on cymbals.">2 Samuel 6:5</a> ff. David and the Israelites, accompanying the ark with dancing and music, are described as playing ‘before Jehovah’ (<span class="ital">vv.</span> 5, 21); and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/joshua/7-6.htm" title="And Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth on his face before the ark of the LORD until the eventide, he and the elders of Israel, and put dust on their heads....">Joshua 7:6-9</a> the Israelites fall down before the ark and pray to Him. It is also evidently as the pledge of Jehovah’s presence and effectual help, that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-11.htm" title="And Uriah said to David, The ark, and Israel, and Judah, abide in tents; and my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord, are encamped in the open fields; shall I then go into my house, to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? as you live, and as your soul lives, I will not do this thing.">2 Samuel 11:11</a> the ark is taken with the host on a campaign, and that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-24.htm" title="And see Zadok also, and all the Levites were with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God: and they set down the ark of God; and Abiathar went up, until all the people had done passing out of the city.">2 Samuel 15:24</a> f. Zadok takes it with David, when he leaves Jerusalem (though the king magnanimously sends it back): in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-44.htm" title="But they presumed to go up to the hill top: nevertheless the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and Moses, departed not out of the camp.">Numbers 14:44</a>, on the contrary, its absence from the host (which is tantamount to Jehovah’s absence, <span class="ital">v.</span> 42) is the cause of defeat. Other ancient nations took images of their gods into battle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-21.htm" title="And there they left their images, and David and his men burned them.">2 Samuel 5:21</a> : <span class="ital">Rel. Sem.</span> 37, citing Polyb. vii. 9, Diod. xx. 65 [the Carthaginians’ ‘sacred tent’]): the Israelites had a custom which was the same in principle; but their palladium was the image-less ark.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>These passages, which shew that in early Israel the ark was, in a very real sense, identified with the <span class="ital">presence</span> of Jehovah, are not adequately explained if the only purpose of the ark was to form a receptacle for the two tables of stone. How the former conception of the ark arose, the extant narratives do not state: they describe the ark as made purely to receive the tables of stone; and in P Jehovah speaks not from the ark itself, but <span class="ital">from between</span> the cherubim upon it. We are therefore reduced to conjecture. When we remember that Jacob speaks of the stone at Bethel as being itself the ‘house,’ or abode, of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-22.htm" title="And this stone, which I have set for a pillar, shall be God's house: and of all that you shall give me I will surely give the tenth to you.">Genesis 28:22</a>), one supposition that suggests itself is that in very remote times the ark may have sheltered a sacred stone, regarded by the primitive Israelites as the abode of a deity (so Benz. <span class="ital">Arch.</span>1 369 [2312 a very different view]; Bä.; in greater detail, Cheyne, <span class="ital">EB.</span> i. 307 f.), but ‘transformed’ ultimately, ‘in reverent Hebrew thought “into a perfect written embodiment of the fundamental demands of Israel’s righteous God” ’ (McNeile, p. 163, without, however, definitely accepting this view). Such conjectures are not illegitimate: for our accounts of the beginnings of Israel’s religion, it must be borne in mind, are both imperfect in themselves, and spring from a time when higher and more spiritual ideas were current than had once been the case. Another view, which admits of being more easily accommodated to <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/33-1.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Depart, and go up hence, you and the people which you have brought up out of the land of Egypt, to the land which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, To your seed will I give it:...">Exodus 33:1-7</a>, is that the ark contained a stone, or stones, taken from the sacred ‘mount of God,’ Horeb, which was regarded as an assurance of the protecting presence of Jehovah (whose abode was on Sinai, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-4.htm" title="You have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles' wings, and brought you to myself.">Exodus 19:4</a>) after they left it (Moore, <span class="ital">EB.</span> i. 2155): and there are independent reasons for thinking (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-6.htm" title="And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments by the mount Horeb.">Exodus 33:6</a>) that the ark was originally conceived as supplying some kind of visible substitute for Jehovah’s personal presence. Or, thirdly, Kennedy may be right (<span class="ital">Samuel</span>, in the <span class="ital">Century Bible</span>, p. 324) in seeing in the ark an embodiment of that ‘Presence of Jehovah,’ which it is promised shall accompany Israel to Canaan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-14.htm" title="And he said, My presence shall go with you, and I will give you rest.">Exodus 33:14</a>), as, not indeed Jehovah Himself, but His sufficient representative (cf. <span class="ital">DB.</span> i. 150 f.).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is common to all these theories to regard the ark as not originally intended to receive the tables of the Decalogue: it is not probable, it is argued, that laws of fundamental importance, intended to be observed by all, should be placed where they could not be seen. The question cannot be here pursued further; and it must suffice to refer the reader, for fuller discussion, to Kennedy, <span class="ital">DB.</span> i. s.v., and <span class="ital">Samuel</span>, p. 321 ff.; Kautzsch, <span class="ital">DB.</span> v. 628 f., and McNeile, p. 161 ff. Jehovah’s presence, it is clear, was regarded as in some way ‘objectively attached to the ark’: but the historical origin of this idea our extant data do not enable us certainly to determine. And this is why we are driven to conjecture. It may only be worth while to add that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-16.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, when you be multiplied and increased in the land, in those days, said the LORD, they shall say no more, The ark of the covenant of the LORD: neither shall it come to mind: neither shall they remember it; neither shall they visit it; neither shall that be done any more.">Jeremiah 3:16</a> the time is looked forward to, by the spiritually-minded prophet, when no such material symbol of Jehovah’s presence will be needed; and the ark, having served its purpose through many centuries, will be neither ‘remembered, nor missed (RVm.), nor made again.’<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 40.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Their</span> <span class="cmt_word">pattern, which was shewed thee in the mount</span>.

As both &#1493;&#1508;&#1512;&#1495; &#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1514;&#1468;&#1512; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-33.htm">Exodus 25:33</a>) and &#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1512;&#1495;&#1497;&#1492; &#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-34.htm">Exodus 25:34</a>) are connected with the previous words without a copula, Knobel and Thenius regard these words as standing in explanatory apposition to the preceding ones, and suppose the meaning to be that the flower-cups were to consist of knobs with flowers issuing from them. But apart from the singular idea of calling a knob or bulb with a flower bursting from it a flower-cup, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-31.htm">Exodus 25:31</a> decidedly precludes any such explanation; for cups, knobs, and flowers are mentioned there in connection with the base and stem, as three separate things which were quite as distinct the one from the other as the base and the stem. The words in question are appended in both verses to &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; in the sense of subordination; &#1493; is generally used in such cases, but it is omitted here before &#1499;&#1508;&#1514;&#1512;, probably to avoid ambiguity, as the two words to be subordinated are brought into closer association as one idea by the use of this copula. And if &#1499;&#1508;&#1514;&#1512; and &#1508;&#1512;&#1495; are to be distinguished from &#1504;&#1489;&#1497;&#1506;, the objection made by Thenius to our rendering &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1468;&#1491; "almond-blossom-shaped," namely, that neither the almond nor the almond-blossom has at all the shape of a basin, falls entirely to the ground; and there is all the less reason to question this rendering, on account of the unanimity with which it has been adopted in the ancient versions, whereas the rendering proposed by Thenius, "wakened up, i.e., a burst or opened calix," has neither foundation nor probability.</body></html>
