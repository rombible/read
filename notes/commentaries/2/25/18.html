It is generally allowed that in that passage, as in most others where the word occurs, living beings, angels of God, are intended. But not all angels are cherubim. The cherubim constitute a select class, very near to God, very powerful, very resolute, highly fitted to act as guards. It is probably with this special reference that the cherubic figures were selected to be placed upon the mercy seat—they guarded the precious deposit of the two tables, towards which they looked (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-20.htm" title="And the cherubim shall stretch forth their wings on high, covering the mercy seat with their wings, and their faces shall look one to another; toward the mercy seat shall the faces of the cherubim be.">Exodus 25:20</a>). The question as to the exact form of the figures is not very important; but it is one which has been discussed with great ingenuity and at great length. Some hold that the proper figure of a cherub is that of a bull or ox, and think that the cherubim of the tabernacle were winged bulls, not unlike the Assyrian. Others regard them as figures still more composite, like the Egyptian sphinxes or the chimæræ of the Greeks. But the predominant opinion seems to be that they were simply human figures with the addition of a pair of wings. (So Kaiisch, Keil, Bishop Harold Browne, Canon Cook, and others.) In this case they would bear a considerable resemblance to the figures of Ma, or Truth, so often seen inside Egyptian arks, sheltering with their wings the searabæus or some other emblem of deity.<p><span class= "bld">Of beaten work</span>—i.e., not cast, but brought into shape by the hammer.

The <span class="ital">cherubim </span>(<span class="ital">cherubim </span>is the plural of <span class="ital">cherub, </span>not <span class="ital">cherubims</span>) were fixed to the mercy-seat, and of a piece with it, and spread their wings over it. It is supposed these were designed to represent the holy angels, (who always attend the <span class="ital">Shechinah, </span>or divine majesty,) not by any effigies of an angel, but some emblem of the angelical nature, probably one or more of those <span class="ital">four faces </span>spoken of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-10.htm" title="As for the likeness of their faces, they four had the face of a man, and the face of a lion, on the right side: and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four also had the face of an eagle.">Ezekiel 1:10</a>. Whatever the faces were, <span class="ital">they looked one toward another, </span>and both downward toward the ark, while their wings were stretched out so as to touch one another. This denotes their attendance upon the Redeemer, their readiness to do his will, their presence in the assemblies of saints, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-17.htm" title="The chariots of God are twenty thousand, even thousands of angels: the Lord is among them, as in Sinai, in the holy place.">Psalm 68:17</a>; Psalms 1<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Corinthians <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/11-10.htm" title="And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh: and the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let the children of Israel go out of his land.">Exodus 11:10</a>,) and their desire to look into the mysteries of the gospel, which they diligently contemplate, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-12.htm" title="To whom it was revealed, that not to themselves, but to us they did minister the things, which are now reported to you by them that have preached the gospel to you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven; which things the angels desire to look into.">1 Peter 1:12</a>.

These tables are called the testimony; God in them testified his will. This law was a testimony to the Israelites, to direct them in their duty, and would be a testimony against them, if they transgressed. This ark was placed in the holy of holies; the blood of the sacrifices was sprinkled, and the incense burned, before it, by the high priest; and above it appeared the visible glory, which was the symbol of the Divine presence. This was a type of Christ in his sinless nature, which saw no corruption, in personal union with his Divine nature, atoning for our sins against it, by his death. The cherubim of gold looked one towards another, and both looked downward toward the ark. It denotes the angels' attendance on the Redeemer, their readiness to do his will, their presence in the assemblies of saints, and their desire to look into the mysteries of the gospel. It was covered with a covering of gold, called the mercy-seat. God is said to dwell, or sit between the cherubim, on the mercy-seat. There he would give his law, and hear supplicants, as a prince on his throne.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/25.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The cherubim of the mercy-seat were human figures, each having two wings. They must have been of small size, proportioned to the area of the mercy-seat. Comparing the different references to form in this place, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-11.htm">2 Samuel 22:11</a> <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/18-10.htm">Psalm 18:10</a>, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1.htm">Ezekiel 1</a>; 10 and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/4-1.htm">Revelation 4:1-11</a>, it would appear that the name "cherub" was applied to various combinations of animal forms. Among the Egyptians, the Assyrians and the Greeks, as well as the Hebrews, the creatures by far most frequently introduced into these composite figures, were man, the ox, the lion, and the eagle, as being types of the most important and familiarly known classes of living material beings. Hence, the cherubim, described by Ezekiel, have been regarded as representing the whole creation engaged in the worship and service of God (compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/4-9.htm">Revelation 4:9-11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-13.htm">Revelation 5:13</a>); and it would be in harmony with this view to suppose that the more strictly human shape of the cherubim of the mercy seat represented the highest form of created intelligence engaged in the devout contemplation of the divine law of love and justice. (Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-12.htm">1 Peter 1:12</a>.) It is worthy of notice that the golden cherubim from between which Yahweh spoke <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-22.htm">Exodus 25:22</a> to His people bore witness, by their place on the mercy-seat, to His redeeming mercy; while the cherubim that took their stand at the gate of Eden, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/3-24.htm">Genesis 3:24</a>, to keep the way to the tree of life, witnessed to His condemnation of sin in man.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-18.htm">Exodus 25:18</a><p>Of beaten work - i. e. elaborately worked with the hammer.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/exodus/25.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18. two cherubim&#8212;The real meaning of these figures, as well as the shape or form of them, is not known with certainty&#8212;probably similar to what was afterwards introduced into the temple, and described in Eze 10:8-22. They stretched out their wings, and their faces were turned towards the mercy seat [Ex 25:20], probably in a bowing attitude. The prevailing opinion now is, that those splendid figures were symbolical not of angelic but of earthly and human beings&#8212;the members of the Church of God interested in the dispensation of grace, the redeemed in every age&#8212;and that these hieroglyphic forms symbolized the qualities of the true people of God&#8212;courage, patience, intelligence, and activity.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/exodus/25.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Figures of human shape, in which alone the angels used to appear; but they had wings, to signify their expedition in God’s work and messages.

Composite figures of different kinds were, however, common in the art of many of Israel’s neighbours,—Egyptians, Phoenicians, Hittites, Babylonians, and Assyrians,—from one or other of whom they also found their way into early Greek art1[201]; and it is highly probable that elements from some of these quarters were also combined in the Hebrew idea of a cherub2[202].

The form "cherubims," which our translators affect, is abnormal and indefensible. They should have said either "cherubim," or "cherubs." The exact shape of the Temple cherubim was kept a profound secret among the Jews, so that Josephus declares - "No one is able to state, or conjecture of what form the cherubim were" (<span class="accented">Ant. Jud.</span> 8:3, &sect; 3). That they were winged figures appears from verse 28 of this chapter, while from other parts of Scripture we learn that cherubim might be of either human or animal forms, or of the two combined (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-5.htm">Ezekiel 1:5-14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-1.htm">Ezekiel 10:1-22</a>). These last have been with some reason compared to the symbolical composite figures of other nations, the andro-sphinxes and crio-sphinxes of the Egyptians, the Assyrian winged bulls and lions, the Greek chimaerae, and the griffins of the northern nations. But it is doubtful whether the cherubim of Moses were of this character. The most sober of recent inquirers (Bp. Harold Browne, Canon Cook, Kalisch, Keil),while admitting the point to be doubtful, come to the conclusion that they were in all probability, "winged human figures, with human face too." In this case their prototype would seem to have been the winged figures of Ma, the Goddess of Truth, frequently seen inside Egyptian arks, sheltering with their wings the scarabaeus or other emblem of the deity. (See Lepsius, <span class="accented">Denkmaler</span>, pt. 3. pl. 14; Wilkinson in Rawlinson's Herodotus, vol. it. p. 85, 2nd edition; Smith's Dictionary of the Bible, vol. 1. p. 3040 <span class="cmt_word">Of beaten work shalt thou make them</span>.
