Cover it with a plate of gold, so that the wood was not seen; which may denote either the excellency of Christ's human nature, being pure and spotless, and adorned with the grace of the Spirit of God without measure; or rather of his divine nature, which is the head of Christ, and said to be as the most fine gold, for in him dwells all the fulness of the Godhead bodily: <p>and make thereto a crown of gold round about; that is, on both sides and at both ends; for though it is called a crown, it was a square, and this was both to ornament the table, and to keep from falling off of it what was set upon it. Jarchi says, it was a sign of the crown of the kingdom, for a table signifies riches and greatness, as they say a king's table: and indeed this was the table of the King of kings, who has on his head many crowns, and one must be made upon his table. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/exodus/25.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, and make thereto a crown of gold round about.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/exodus/25.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">24</span>. <span class="ital">a crown</span>] rather, <span class="ital">a</span> beaded or spiral <span class="bld">moulding</span>, as explained on <span class="ital">v.</span> 11.

The meaning operculum, lid (Ges.), cannot be sustained, notwithstanding the fact that the capporeth was placed upon the ark (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-21.htm">Exodus 25:21</a>) and covered the tables laid within it; for the verb &#1499;&#1508;&#1512; has not the literal signification of covering or covering up either in Kal or Piel. In Kal it only occurs in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/6-14.htm">Genesis 6:14</a>, where it means to pitch or tar; in Piel it is only used in the figurative sense of covering up sin or guilt, i.e., of making atonement. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-11.htm">1 Chronicles 28:11</a> is decisive on this point, where the holy of holies, in which the capporeth was, is called &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;, which cannot possibly mean the covering-house, but must signify the house of atonement. The force of this passage is not weakened by the remark made by Delitzsch and others, to the effect that it was only in the later usage of the language that the idea of covering gave place to that of the covering up or expiation of sin; for neither in the earlier nor earliest usage of the language can the supposed primary meaning of the word be anywhere discovered. Knobel's remark has still less force, viz., that the ark must have had a lid, and it must have been called a lid. For if from the very commencement this lid had a more important purpose than that of a simple covering, it might also have received its name from this special purpose, even though this was not fully explained to the Israelites till a later period in the giving of the law (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-15.htm">Leviticus 16:15-16</a>). It must, however, have been obvious to every one, that it was to be something more than the mere lid of the ark, from the simple fact that it was not to be made, like the ark, of wood plated with gold, but to be made of pure gold, and to have two golden cherubs upon the top. The cherubim were to be made of gold &#1502;&#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492; (from &#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492; to turn), i.e., literally, turned work (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-24.htm">Isaiah 3:24</a>), here, according to Onkelos, &#1504;&#1490;&#1497;&#1491; opus ductile, work beaten with the hammer and rounded, so that the figures were not solid but hollow (see Bhr, i. p. 380). </body></html>
