His heart remained hard. He had no need to harden it by an act of his will. Probably the visitation affected him but little, since he would possess mosquito curtains, and could inhabit the loftier parts of his palace, which would be above the height whereto the mosquito ascends (Herod, ii. 95).<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/exodus/8.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-19.htm" title="Then the magicians said to Pharaoh, This is the finger of God: and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he listened not to them; as the LORD had said.">Exodus 8:19</a></span>. <span class="ital">This is the finger of God — </span>The devil’s agents, when God permitted them, could do great things; but when he laid an embargo upon them they could do nothing.

His kingly pride, the desire of detaining so many people in slavish dependance and subjection to him, and, above all, his superstitious prejudices, so blinded his mind that he still remained obdurate. Perhaps he yet considered Moses as a mere magician, like his own, only somewhat more expert in his art.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:16-19 These lice were produced out of the dust of the earth; out of any part of the creation God can fetch a scourge, with which to correct those who rebel against him. Even the dust of the earth obeys him. These lice were very troublesome, as well as disgraceful to the Egyptians, whose priests were obliged to take much pains that no vermin ever should be found about them. All the plagues inflicted on the Egyptians, had reference to their national crimes, or were rendered particularly severe by their customs. The magicians attempted to imitate it, but they could not. It forced them to confess, This is the finger of God! The check and restraint put upon us, must needs be from a Divine power. Sooner or later God will force even his enemies to acknowledge his own power.

In ordinary circumstances they embitter life in Eastern countries, and therefore the terrible nature of this infliction on Egypt may be imagined when no precautions could preserve from their painful sting. The very smallness and insignificance of these fierce insects made them a dreadful scourge. The magicians never attempted any imitation, and what neither the blood of the river nor the nuisance of the frogs had done, the visitation of this tiny enemy constrained them to acknowledge "this is the finger of God"&#8212;properly "gods," for they spoke as heathens.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/exodus/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The finger is put either synecdochically for the hand, </span> as it is <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/31-18.htm" title="And he gave to Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him on mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God.">Exodus 31:18</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/8-3.htm" title="When I consider your heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars, which you have ordained;">Psalm 8:3</a> 144:1</span>; or metaphorically for the power or virtue, as <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-20.htm" title="But if I with the finger of God cast out devils, no doubt the kingdom of God is come on you.">Luke 11:20</a></span>, compared with <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-28.htm" title="But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God is come to you.">Matthew 12:28</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Of God; </span> of that supreme God, whom both the Egyptians and other heathen idolaters acknowledged as superior to all men, and idols, and devils.

This is to be ascribed to a power superior to human, to a divine power; so long as they could do something similar, or impose upon the senses of men, and make them believe they did the like, they would not acknowledge divine omnipotence; but when they no longer could deceive the sight of Pharaoh and the Egyptian, then they own the effects of a superior power: and this they did partly to detract from the power of Moses and Aaron, because they would not have them pass for more skilful persons in the magic art than themselves; and therefore suggest, that this was done not by virtue of any human skill and art, but by the power of the Supreme Being; and partly to detract from the honour of the God of Israel; for they do not say this is the finger of Jehovah, whom they accounted, as Dr. Lightfoot (g) observes, as a petty trivial god, but this is the finger of Elohim, the Supreme Deity. It is conjectured by some (h), that in memory of this plague the Egyptian priests scrape their whole bodies, lest there should be a louse or any unclean thing on them when they worship their gods, as Herodotus (i) relates: <p>and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them; either not unto the magicians owning the hand of God, and his divine power in the plague inflicted; or to Moses and Aaron demanding the dismission of the people of Israel, which latter seems to be confirmed by the usual phrase, as follows: <p>as the Lord had said; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-4.htm">Exodus 7:4</a>. <p>(g) Ut supra.

Or "of a God." It is not probable that the magicians believed in a single God, or intended in what they said to express any monotheistic idea. All that they meant to say was - "This is beyond the power of man - it is supernatural  - some god must be helping the Israelites." No doubt they had come to this conclusion by a careful scrutiny of all the miracles hitherto wrought by Aaron. <span class="cmt_word">He hearkened not unto them</span>. The magicians were minded to resist no longer; but Pharaoh was otherwise minded. It is quite possible that the mosquito plague did not greatly annoy him. He would probably possess lofty apartments above the height to which the mosquito ascends (Herod. 2:95); or he may have guarded himself by mosquito curtains of the finest Egyptian muslin. His subjects would naturally suffer from such a plague far more than he. <span class="cmt_word">As the Lord had said.</span> See the comment on the same phrase in ver. 11 <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 8:20-24 THE FOURTH PLAGUE. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/exodus/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The king appointed the following day, probably because he hardly thought it possible for so great a work to be performed at once. Moses promised that it should be so: "According to thy word (sc., let it be), that thou mayest know that there is not (a God) like Jehovah our God." He then went out and cried, i.e., called aloud and earnestly, to Jehovah concerning the matter (&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; &#1506;&#1500;) of the frogs, which he had set, i.e., prepared, for Pharaoh (&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/45-7.htm">Genesis 45:7</a>). In consequence of his intercession God took the plague away. The frogs died off (&#1502;&#1503; &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;, to die away out of, from), out of the houses, and palaces, and fields, and were gathered together by bushels (&#1495;&#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; from &#1495;&#1502;&#1512;, the omer, the largest measure used by the Hebrews), so that the land stank with the odour of their putrefaction. Though Jehovah had thus manifested Himself as the Almighty God and Lord of the creation, Pharaoh did not keep his promise; but when he saw that there was breathing-time (&#1512;&#1493;&#1495;&#1492;, &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, relief from an overpowering pressure), literally, as soon as he "got air," he hardened his heart, so that he did not hearken to Moses and Aaron (&#1493;&#1492;&#1499;&#1489;&#1468;&#1491; inf. abs. as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-43.htm">Genesis 41:43</a>). </body></html>
