The frogs did not return into the river; neither were they devoured by flights of cranes or ibises. They simply died—died where they were—in thousands and tens of thousands, so that they had to be “gathered upon heaps.” And “the land stank.” In the great plague of frogs mentioned by Eustathius (see the comment on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/8-1.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses, Go to Pharaoh, and say to him, Thus said the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me.">Exodus 8:1-4</a>) it was the stench of the frogs after they were dead which caused the people to quit their country.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/exodus/8.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/8-13.htm" title="And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and the frogs died out of the houses, out of the villages, and out of the fields....">Exodus 8:13-14</a></span>. <span class="ital">The frogs died.

God could have plagued Egypt with lions, or bears, or wolves, or with birds of prey, but he chose to do it by these despicable creatures. God, when he pleases, can arm the smallest parts of the creation against us. He thereby humbled Pharaoh. They should neither eat, nor drink, nor sleep in quiet; but wherever they were, they should be troubled by the frogs. God's curse upon a man will pursue him wherever he goes, and lie heavy upon him whatever he does. Pharaoh gave way under this plague. He promises that he will let the people go. Those who bid defiance to God and prayer, first or last, will be made to see their need of both. But when Pharaoh saw there was respite, he hardened his heart. Till the heart is renewed by the grace of God, the thoughts made by affliction do not abide; the convictions wear off, and the promises that were given are forgotten. Till the state of the air is changed, what thaws in the sun will freeze again in the shade.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Villages - Literally, enclosures, or courtyards. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/exodus/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8-15. Pharaoh called, &#8230; Intreat the Lord, that he may take away the frogs from me&#8212;The frog, which was now used as an instrument of affliction, whether from reverence or abhorrence, was an object of national superstition with the Egyptians, the god Ptha being represented with a frog's head. But the vast numbers, together with their stench, made them an intolerable nuisance so that the king was so far humbled as to promise that, if Moses would intercede for their removal, he would consent to the departure of Israel, and in compliance with this appeal, they were withdrawn at the very hour named by the monarch himself. But many, while suffering the consequences of their sins, make promises of amendment and obedience which they afterwards forget; and so Pharaoh, when he saw there was a respite, was again hardened [Ex 8:15].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/exodus/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> A short speech for <span class="ital">they died</span> and were removed out of, &c, as appears from the next verse; it being frequent in the Hebrew tongue under one verb expressed to understand another agreeable to it.

He heard his prayers, and fulfilled what he had promised Pharaoh: <p>and the frogs died out of the houses, and out of the villages, and out of the fields; the word for "villages" signifies "courts" (b), and may be so rendered here; and the sense is, that they not only died out of their dwelling houses, but out of their courtyards, and even out of their gardens, orchards, and fields, so that there were none near them to give any manner of trouble and offence. And their dying, and remaining dead upon the spot, were clear proofs that they were real frogs that were produced, and not in appearance only, as the frogs of the magicians might be; God could have caused them to return to the river from whence they came, or have annihilated them, or removed them out of sight in an instant; but the killing of them, and letting them lie dead, proved the truth of the miracle, and gave apparent evidence of it both ways, both in the bringing and removing them. <p>(b)  "ex atriis", Montanus, Tigurine version, Piscator. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/exodus/8.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and the frogs <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> died out of the houses, out of the villages, and out of the fields.</span><p>(d) In things of this life God often hears the prayers of the just for the ungodly.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The villages</span>.

But if they were able to bring the plague, they could not take it away. The latter is not expressly stated, it is true; but it is evident from the fact that Pharaoh was obliged to send for Moses and Aaron to intercede with Jehovah to take them away. The king would never have applied to Moses and Aaron for help if his charmers could have charmed the plague away. Moreover the fact that Pharaoh entreated them to intercede with Jehovah to take away the frogs, and promised to let the people go, that they might sacrifice to Jehovah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-8.htm">Exodus 8:8</a>), was a sign that he regarded the God of Israel as the author of the plague. To strengthen the impression made upon the king by this plague with reference to the might of Jehovah, Moses said to him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-9.htm">Exodus 8:9</a>), "Glorify thyself over me, when I shall entreat for thee," i.e., take the glory upon thyself of determining the time when I shall remove the plague through my intercession. The expression is elliptical, and &#1500;&#1506;&#1502;&#1512; (saying) is to be supplied, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/7-2.htm">Judges 7:2</a>. To give Jehovah the glory, Moses placed himself below Pharaoh, and left him to fix the time for the frogs to be removed through his intercession. </body></html>
