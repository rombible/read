In the original it is called the plague of “the ‘<span class= "ital">arób.”</span> which is used throughout in the singular number. The LXX. translate <span class= "ital">ha-’arob</span> by “the dog-fly” (<span class= "greekheb">ή κυνόμυιά</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> The Jewish commentators connect the word with the root ‘ereb or <span class= "ital">‘arab,</span> and suppose it to designate either a mixed multitude of all kinds of wild beasts (Josephus and Jonathan), or a mixture of all sorts of insects (Aquila, &c). Moderns generally agree with the LXX. that a definite species of animal—probably an insect—is meant, but doubt about the particular creature. The dog-fly, it is said <span class= "ital">(Musca canina),</span> is not a pest in houses, as the ‘<span class= "ital">arôb</span> was (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-21.htm" title="Else, if you will not let my people go, behold, I will send swarms of flies on you, and on your servants, and on your people, and into your houses: and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms of flies, and also the ground where on they are.">Exodus 8:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-24.htm" title="And the LORD did so; and there came a grievous swarm of flies into the house of Pharaoh, and into his servants' houses, and into all the land of Egypt: the land was corrupted by reason of the swarm of flies.">Exodus 8:24</a>), nor does it do any damage to the land (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-24.htm" title="And the LORD did so; and there came a grievous swarm of flies into the house of Pharaoh, and into his servants' houses, and into all the land of Egypt: the land was corrupted by reason of the swarm of flies.">Exodus 8:24</a>). It is therefore suggested that the plague was really one of the kakerlaque, a kind of beetle, which is injurious both to the persons of men, to the furniture and fittings of houses, and to the crops in the fields. It is in favour of the kakerlaque that, like all beetles, it was sacred, and might not be destroyed, being emblematic of the sun-god, Ra, especially in his form of Khepra, or “the creator.” Egyptians were obliged to submit to such a plague without attempting to diminish it, and would naturally view the infliction as a sign that the sun-god was angry with them. They would also suffer grievously in person, for the kakerlaque “inflicts very painful bites with its jaws” (Kalisch); and they would begin for the first time to suffer in their property, which neither the frogs nor the mosquitoes had damaged. The plague was thus—if one of the kakerlaque—an advance on previous plagues, and if less disgusting than some others, was far more injurious.<p>(20) <span class= "bld">Early in the morning.—</span>Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-15.htm" title="Get you to Pharaoh in the morning; see, he goes out to the water; and you shall stand by the river's brink against he come; and the rod which was turned to a serpent shall you take in your hand.">Exodus 7:15</a>; and on the early habits of an Egyptian king, see Herod. ii. 172.<p><span class= "bld">He cometh forth to the water.</span>—It is conjectured that this was on the occasion of the great autumn festival, when, after the retirement of the Nile within its banks, and the scattering of the grain upon the fresh deposit of mud, the first blades of corn began to appear.

The Egyptians and the Hebrews were to be marked in the plague of flies. The Lord knows them that are his, and will make it appear, perhaps in this world, certainly in the other, that he has set them apart for himself. Pharaoh unwillingly entered into a treaty with Moses and Aaron. He is content they should sacrifice to their God, provided they would do it in the land of Egypt. But it would be an abomination to God, should they offer the Egyptian sacrifices; and it would be an abomination to the Egyptians, should they offer to God the objects of the worship of the Egyptians, namely, their calves or oxen. Those who would offer acceptable sacrifice to God, must separate themselves from the wicked and profane. They must also retire from the world. Israel cannot keep the feast of the Lord, either among the brick-kilns or among the flesh-pots of Egypt. And they must sacrifice as God shall command, not otherwise. Though they were in slavery to Pharaoh, yet they must obey God's commands. Pharaoh consents for them to go into the wilderness, provided they do not go so far but that he might fetch them back again. Thus, some sinners, in a pang of conviction, part with their sins, yet are loth they should go very far away; for when the fright is over, they will turn to them again. Moses promised the removal of this plague. But let not Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more. Be not deceived; God is not mocked: if we think to cheat God by a sham repentance and a false surrender of ourselves to him, we shall put a fatal cheat upon our own souls. Pharaoh returned to his hardness. Reigning lusts break through the strongest bonds, and make men presume and go from their word. Many seem in earnest, but there is some reserve, some beloved, secret sin. They are unwilling to look upon themselves as in danger of everlasting misery. They will refrain from other sins; they do much, give much, and even punish themselves much. They will leave it off sometimes, and, as it were, let their sin depart a little way; but will not make up their minds to part with all and follow Christ, bearing the cross. Rather than that, they venture all. They are sorrowful, but depart from Christ, determined to keep the world at present, and they hope for some future season, when salvation may be had without such costly sacrifices; but, at length, the poor sinner is driven away in his wickedness, and left without hope to lament his folly.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Cometh forth to the water - See the <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-15.htm">Exodus 7:15</a> note. It is not improbable that on this occasion Pharaoh went to the Nile with a procession in order to open the solemn festival, which was held 120 days after the first rise, at the end of October or early in November. At that time the inundation is abating and the first traces of vegetation are seen on the deposit of fresh soil.<p>The plague now announced may be regarded as connected with the atmosphere, also an object of worship. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/exodus/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Ex 8:20-32.

Rise up early &#8230; Pharaoh; lo, he cometh forth to the water, &c.&#8212;Pharaoh still appearing obdurate, Moses was ordered to meet him while walking on the banks of the Nile and repeat his request for the liberation of Israel, threatening in case of continued refusal to cover every house from the palace to the cottage with swarms of flies&#8212;while, as a proof of the power that accomplished this judgment, the land of Goshen should be exempted from the calamity. The appeal was equally vain as before, and the predicted evil overtook the country in the form of what was not "flies," such as we are accustomed to, but divers sorts of flies (Ps 78:45), the gad fly, the cockroach, the Egyptian beetle, for all these are mentioned by different writers. They are very destructive, some of them inflicting severe bites on animals, others destroying clothes, books, plants, every thing. The worship of flies, particularly of the beetle, was a prominent part of the religion of the ancient Egyptians. The employment of these winged deities to chastise them must have been painful and humiliating to the Egyptians while it must at the same time have strengthened the faith of the Israelites in the God of their fathers as the only object of worship.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/exodus/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/exodus/8.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the Lord said unto Moses, rise up early in the morning,....

(See <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-16.htm">Exodus 8:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-8.htm">Exodus 9:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-21.htm">Exodus 10:21</a>.) In other respects, no great regularity is observable. There is a general principle of increasing severity in the afflictions, but it does not obtain throughout the entire series. The first three caused annoyance, rather than actual injury, either to persons or property. Of the next three, two were upon property, one upon both property and person (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-10.htm">Exodus 9:10</a>). Of the remaining three, two again inflicted injury on property, while one (the plague of darkness) was a mere personal annoyance. The exact character of the fourth plague depends on the proper translation of the word <span class="accented">arob. The</span> Jewish commentators connected this word with <span class="accented">Ereb and 'Arab</span>, words meaning "mingled" or "mixed;" and supposed a mixed multitude of animals - beasts, reptiles, and insects - to be meant. But the expression used throughout, which is <span class="accented">ha-'arob</span>, "the <span class="accented">arob</span>," marks very clearly a single definite species. So much was clear to the LXX., who rendered the word by <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>, "the dog-fly," which is not the common house-fly (M<span class="accented">usca domestica</span>), but a distinct species (<span class="accented">Musca canina</span>). Flies of this kind are said to constitute a terrible affliction in Egypt (Philo, De <span class="accented">vit</span>. Mos. 2. p. 101; Munk, <span class="accented">Palestine</span>, p. 120; etc.); but they attack men chiefly, and do no harm to houses or to the fruits of the field, whereas the '<span class="accented">arob</span> is spoken of as a pest in the houses, and as "destroying the land" (verse 24). It has been, therefore, suggested that the <span class="accented">Blatta orientalis</span>, or kakerlaque, a kind of beetle, is really intended. These creatures suddenly appear upon the Nile in great numbers; they "inflict very painful bites with their jaws; gnaw and destroy clothes, household furniture, leather, and articles of every kind, and either consume or render unavailable all eatables"(Kalisch). They sometimes drive persons out of their houses; and they also devastate the fields. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Lo, he cometh forth to the water</span>. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-15.htm">Exodus 7:15</a>, and comment. It is suspected that on this occasion Pharaoh "went to the Nile with a procession to open the solemn festival "held in the autumn when the inundation was beginning to abate (Cook). <span class="cmt_word">Say unto him</span>.

Moses promised that it should be so: "According to thy word (sc., let it be), that thou mayest know that there is not (a God) like Jehovah our God." He then went out and cried, i.e., called aloud and earnestly, to Jehovah concerning the matter (&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; &#1506;&#1500;) of the frogs, which he had set, i.e., prepared, for Pharaoh (&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/45-7.htm">Genesis 45:7</a>). In consequence of his intercession God took the plague away. The frogs died off (&#1502;&#1503; &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;, to die away out of, from), out of the houses, and palaces, and fields, and were gathered together by bushels (&#1495;&#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; from &#1495;&#1502;&#1512;, the omer, the largest measure used by the Hebrews), so that the land stank with the odour of their putrefaction. Though Jehovah had thus manifested Himself as the Almighty God and Lord of the creation, Pharaoh did not keep his promise; but when he saw that there was breathing-time (&#1512;&#1493;&#1495;&#1492;, &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, relief from an overpowering pressure), literally, as soon as he "got air," he hardened his heart, so that he did not hearken to Moses and Aaron (&#1493;&#1492;&#1499;&#1489;&#1468;&#1491; inf. abs. as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-43.htm">Genesis 41:43</a>). </body></html>
