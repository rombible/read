Mosquitoes were things too delicate to be caught, and manipulated, and produced at a given moment by sleight-of-hand. The magicians tried to produce a counterfeit of the miracle, but could not. Then they excused themselves to their master with the words, “This is the finger of a god.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/exodus/8.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-18.htm" title="And the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth lice, but they could not: so there were lice on man, and on beast.">Exodus 8:18</a></span>. <span class="ital">The magicians did so </span>— They also smote the dust of the earth to <span class="ital">bring forth lice with their enchantments, but they could not — </span>Some have said that this verse is not accurately translated, and that the true sense of it is, that the magicians endeavoured not to <span class="ital">bring forth, </span>but to <span class="ital">draw off, </span>or <span class="ital">take away, </span>the lice. But surely they have affirmed this without having examined the original. The words <span class="greekheb">להוציא את הכנים</span><span class="ital">, Lehoatsi eth hachinnim, </span>signify to <span class="ital">bring forth </span>the lice, and not to take them away. Nor is the word <span class="greekheb">εξαγαγειν</span>, used by the LXX., at all inimical to this construction, signifying properly to <span class="ital">bring out, </span>or <span class="ital">bring forth. </span>So that the thing asserted, as commentators have generally understood, is, that the magicians could not <span class="ital">produce lice, </span>as they had frogs, much less could they take away those that God, by Moses, had produced. Now, as it surely was as easy to produce lice as frogs, from this it appeared by what power they had done the other two miracles; not by any virtue that was in their enchantments, but by a supernatural power which God had permitted Satan to give them, but the further operation of which he now thought proper to prevent, to show them that all their power, to whatever cause they might attribute it, was limited, and not to be compared with that of the God of Israel.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:16-19 These lice were produced out of the dust of the earth; out of any part of the creation God can fetch a scourge, with which to correct those who rebel against him. Even the dust of the earth obeys him. These lice were very troublesome, as well as disgraceful to the Egyptians, whose priests were obliged to take much pains that no vermin ever should be found about them. All the plagues inflicted on the Egyptians, had reference to their national crimes, or were rendered particularly severe by their customs. The magicians attempted to imitate it, but they could not. It forced them to confess, This is the finger of God! The check and restraint put upon us, must needs be from a Divine power. Sooner or later God will force even his enemies to acknowledge his own power. Pharaoh, notwithstanding this, was more and more obstinate.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>It is observed by Hebrew commentators that the nine plagues are divided into three groups: distinct warnings are given of the first two plagues in each group; the third in each is inflicted without any previous notice; namely, the third, lice, the sixth, boils, the ninth, darkness.<p>The dust of the land - The two preceding plagues fell upon the Nile. This fell on the earth, which was worshipped in Egypt as the father of the gods. An special sacredness was attached to the black fertile soil of the basin of the Nile, called Chemi, from which the ancient name of Egypt is supposed to be derived.<p>Lice - The Hebrew word occurs only in connection with this plague. These insects are generally identified with mosquitos, a plague nowhere greater than in Egypt. They are most troublesome toward October, i. e. soon after the plague of frogs, and are dreaded not only for the pain and annoyance which they cause, but also because they are said to penetrate into the body through the nostrils and ears. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/exodus/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Ex 8:16-19.

In ordinary circumstances they embitter life in Eastern countries, and therefore the terrible nature of this infliction on Egypt may be imagined when no precautions could preserve from their painful sting. The very smallness and insignificance of these fierce insects made them a dreadful scourge. The magicians never attempted any imitation, and what neither the blood of the river nor the nuisance of the frogs had done, the visitation of this tiny enemy constrained them to acknowledge "this is the finger of God"&#8212;properly "gods," for they spoke as heathens.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/exodus/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Did so, </span> i.e. endeavoured to do so.

The magicians stretched out their rods over certain collections of dust, but no gnats were produced; which would be the natural result, if they had made no secret arrangements. No reason can be assigned why they should not have seemed to produce gnats, as easily as frogs, if they had employed all the arts of which they were masters in so doing. But events had convinced them that they could not cope with Moses and Aaron; and it would seem that they therefore declined further contest, <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/exodus/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The king appointed the following day, probably because he hardly thought it possible for so great a work to be performed at once. Moses promised that it should be so: "According to thy word (sc., let it be), that thou mayest know that there is not (a God) like Jehovah our God." He then went out and cried, i.e., called aloud and earnestly, to Jehovah concerning the matter (&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; &#1506;&#1500;) of the frogs, which he had set, i.e., prepared, for Pharaoh (&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/45-7.htm">Genesis 45:7</a>).
