Moses could not tell whether it was a personal promise to himself, or a renewal of the old engagement to go with the people. He consequently requires something more explicit. Will God go, not merely with him, but with the people?

Thus, by the intercession of Christ, we are not only saved from ruin, but become entitled to everlasting happiness. Observe here how he pleads. We find grace in God's sight, if we find grace in our hearts to guide and quicken us in the way of our duty. Moses speaks as one who dreaded the thought of going forward without the Lord's presence. God's gracious promises, and mercy towards us, should not only encourage our faith, but also excite our fervency in prayer. Observe how he speeds. See, in a type, Christ's intercession, which he ever lives to make for all that come to God by him; and that it is not by any thing in those for whom he intercedes. Moses then entreats a sight of God's glory, and is heard in that also. A full discovery of the glory of God, would overwhelm even Moses himself. Man is mean, and unworthy of it; weak, and could not bear it; guilty, and could not but dread it. The merciful display which is made in Christ Jesus, alone can be borne by us. The Lord granted that which would abundantly satisfy. God's goodness is his glory; and he will have us to know him by the glory of his mercy, more than by the glory of his majesty. Upon the rock there was a fit place for Moses to view the goodness and glory of God. The rock in Horeb was typical of Christ the Rock; the Rock of refuge, salvation, and strength. Happy are they who stand upon this Rock. The cleft may be an emblem of Christ, as smitten, crucified, wounded, and slain. What follows, denotes the imperfect knowledge of God in the present state, even as revealed in Christ; for this, when compared with the heavenly sight of him. is but like seeing a man that is gone by, whose back only is to be seen. God in Christ, as he is, even the fullest and brightest displays of his glory, grace, and goodness, are reserved to another state.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/33.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Rest - This was the common expression for the possession of the promised land. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-20.htm">Deuteronomy 3:20</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/1-13.htm">Joshua 1:13</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/1-15.htm">Joshua 1:15</a>; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-8.htm">Hebrews 4:8</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/exodus/33.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9-11. the cloudy pillar descended, and stood at the door of the tabernacle&#8212;How would the downcast hearts of the people revive&#8212;how would the tide of joy swell in every bosom, when the symbolic cloud was seen slowly and majestically to descend and stand at the entrance of the tabernacle!<p>as Moses entered&#8212;It was when he appeared as their mediator, when he repaired from day to day to intercede for them, that welcome token of assurance was given that his advocacy prevailed, that Israel's sin was forgiven, and that God would again be gracious.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/exodus/33.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">My presence</span>, Heb. <span class="ital">my face</span>, i.e. I myself, by comparing this with <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-11.htm" title="Therefore I counsel that all Israel be generally gathered to you, from Dan even to Beersheba, as the sand that is by the sea for multitude; and that you go to battle in your own person.">2 Samuel 17:11</a></span>.

The "tent" is neither the sanctuary of the tabernacle described in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/25.htm">Exodus 25</a>., which was not made till after the perfect restoration of the covenant (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/35.htm">Exodus 35</a>.), nor another sanctuary that had come down from their forefathers and was used before the tabernacle was built, as Clericus, J. D. Michaelis, Rosenmller, and others suppose; but a tent belonging to Moses, which was made into a temporary sanctuary by the fact that the pillar of cloud came down upon it, and Jehovah talked with Moses there, and which was called by the same name as the tabernacle, viz., &#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491; &#1488;&#1495;&#1500; (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/27-21.htm">Exodus 27:21</a>), because Jehovah revealed Himself there, and every one who sought Him had to go to this tent outside the camp. There were two reasons for this: in the first place, Moses desired thereby to lead the people to a fuller recognition of their separation from their God, that their penitence might be deepened in consequence; and in the second place, he wished to provide such means of intercourse with Jehovah as would not only awaken in the minds of the people a longing for the renewal of the covenant, but render the restoration of the covenant possible. And this end was answered. Not only did every one who sought Jehovah go out to the tent, but the whole nation looked with the deepest reverence when Moses went out to the tent, and bowed in adoration before the Lord, every one in front of his tent, when they saw the pillar of cloud come down upon the tent and stand before the door. Out of this cloud Jehovah talked with Moses (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/33-7.htm">Exodus 33:7-10</a>) "face to face, as a man talks with his friend" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-11.htm">Exodus 33:11</a>); that is to say, not from the distance of heaven, through any kind of medium whatever, but "mouth to mouth," as it is called in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/12-8.htm">Numbers 12:8</a>, as closely and directly as friends talk to one another. "These words indicate, therefore, a familiar conversation, just as much as if it had been said, that God appeared to Moses in some peculiar form of manifestation. If any one objects to this, that it is at variance with the assertion which we shall come to presently, 'Thou canst not see My face,' the answer is a very simple one. Although Jehovah showed Himself to Moses in some peculiar form of manifestation, He never appeared in His own essential glory, but only in such a mode as human weakness could bear. This solution contains a tacit comparison, viz., that there never was any one equal to Moses, or who had attained to the same dignity as he" (Calvin). When Moses returned to the tent, his servant Joshua remained behind as guard. - This condescension on the part of Jehovah towards Moses could not fail to strengthen the people in their reliance upon their leader, as the confidant of Jehovah. And Moses himself was encouraged thereby to endeavour to effect a perfect restoration of the covenant bond that had been destroyed. </body></html>
