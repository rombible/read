In the “Book of the Covenant” He had promised to go up with them by an Angel, in whom was His Name (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/23-20.htm" title="Behold, I send an Angel before you, to keep you in the way, and to bring you into the place which I have prepared.">Exodus 23:20-23</a>): <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>by His Son, the Second Person in the Holy Trinity. He now, to mark His displeasure, withdrew this promise, and substituted for the Divine presence that of a mere angel. “I will send an angel before thee” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-2.htm" title="And I will send an angel before you; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite:">Exodus 33:2</a>); “I will not go up in the midst of thee” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-3.htm" title="To a land flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up in the middle of you; for you are a stiff necked people: lest I consume you in the way.">Exodus 33:3</a>). Dimly the people felt the importance of the change, the vast difference between the angelic and the Divine, and “mourned” their loss (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-4.htm" title="And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned: and no man did put on him his ornaments.">Exodus 33:4</a>). mourned with some touch of real godly sorrow, and, as was the custom of the Orientals in mourning (Terent. <span class= "ital">Heaut</span>. ii. 3, 47; Herodian. iv. 2, &c.), “put off their ornaments.”<p>(1) <span class= "bld">The Lord said unto Moses</span>.—In continuation and explanation of the words recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/32-33.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Whoever has sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book.">Exodus 32:33-34</a>, but probably at another time, after Moses had once more descended from the Ras Sufsafeh to the plain at its base.<p><span class= "bld">The land which I sware unto Abraham . . . —</span>The misconduct of Israel in their worship of the calf would not annul the promises of God to the patriarchs.

Let them go forward as they are; this was very expressive of God's displeasure. Though he promises to make good his covenant with Abraham, in giving them Canaan, yet he denies them the tokens of his presence they had been blessed with. The people mourned for their sin. Of all the bitter fruits and consequences of sin, true penitents most lament, and dread most, God's departure from them. Canaan itself would be no pleasant land without the Lord's presence. Those who parted with ornaments to maintain sin, could do no less than lay aside ornaments, in token of sorrow and shame for it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/32.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Mine Angel shall go before thee - See the marginal references and <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>.<p>In the day when I visit ... - Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-22.htm">Numbers 14:22-24</a>.

The intercession of Moses, and his offer to sacrifice himself for his people had obtained from God some great concessions, viz.  - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> That the people's lives should be spared (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-14.htm">Exodus 32:14</a>); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> And that they should be led into Palestine (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> ver. 34) But a change had been introduced into the conditions under which the future journeys were to be made, somewhat obscurely indicated in the words  - "Behold, mine angel shall go before thee" (<span class="accented">ibid.</span>) - which was now to be more distinctly set forth. "God's angel" may mean his Presence in the Person of his Son - as it appears to mean in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-20.htm">Exodus 23:20-23</a> - or it may mean simply one of the created angelic host, which seems to be its sense in  <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-34.htm">Exodus 32:34</a>, and in ver. 2 of this chapter. By vers. 2 and 3 taken in combination it was rendered manifest, both to Moses and to the people (ver. 4), that they were threatened with the loss of God's actual presence and personal protection during the remainder of their wanderings, and would have, instead of it, the mere guidance and help of an angel in the inferior sense of the word. This was felt to be "evil tidings" and the people consequently "mourned" and "stripped themselves of their ornaments" (ver. 6). Real penitence at last entered their hearts, and led to self-abasement. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> <span class="cmt_word">The Lord said unto Moses</span>.

He had received no assurance of mercy in reply to his first entreaty (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/32-11.htm">Exodus 32:11-13</a>). He therefore announced his intention to the people in these words: "Peradventure I can make an atonement for your sin." But to the Lord he said (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/32-31.htm">Exodus 32:31</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-32.htm">Exodus 32:32</a>), "The sin of this people is a great sin; they have made themselves a god of gold," in opposition to the clear commandment in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-23.htm">Exodus 20:23</a> : "and now, if Thou wilt forgive their sin, and if not, blot me out of the book that Thou hast written." The book which Jehovah has written is the book of life, or of the living (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-29.htm">Psalm 69:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/12-1.htm">Daniel 12:1</a>). This expression is founded upon the custom of writing the names of the burgesses of a town or country in a burgess-list, whereby they are recognised as natives of the country, or citizens of the city, and all the privileges of citizenship are secured to them. The book of life contains the list of the righteous (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-29.htm">Psalm 69:29</a>), and ensures to those whose names are written there, life before God, first in the earthly kingdom of God, and then eternal life also, according to the knowledge of salvation, which keeps pace with the progress of divine revelation, e.g., in the New Testament, where the heirs of eternal life are found written in the book of life (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-3.htm">Philippians 4:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-5.htm">Revelation 3:5</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/13-8.htm">Revelation 13:8</a>, etc.), - an advance for which the way was already prepared by <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/4-3.htm">Isaiah 4:3</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/12-1.htm">Daniel 12:1</a>. To blot out of Jehovah's book, therefore, is to cut off from fellowship with the living God, or from the kingdom of those who live before God, and to deliver over to death. As a true mediator of his people, Moses was ready to stake his own life for the deliverance of the nation, and not to live before God himself, if Jehovah did not forgive the people their sin. These words of Moses were the strongest expression of devoted, self-sacrificing love. And they were just as deep and true as the wish expressed by the Apostle Paul in <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/9-3.htm">Romans 9:3</a>, that he might be accursed from Christ for the sake of his brethren according to the flesh. Bengel compares this wish of the apostle to the prayer of Moses, and says with regard to this unbounded fulness of love, "It is not easy to estimate the measure of love in a Moses and a Paul; for the narrow boundary of our reasoning powers does not comprehend it, as the little child is unable to comprehend the courage of warlike heroes" (Eng. Tr.). The infinite love of God is unable to withstand the importunity of such love. God, who is holy love, cannot sacrifice the righteous and good for the unrighteous and guilty, nor can He refuse the mediatorial intercession of His faithful servant, so long as the sinful nation has not filled up the measure of its guilt, in which case even the intercession of a Moses and a Samuel would not be able to avert the judgment (<a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-1.htm">Jeremiah 15:1</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-16.htm">Ezekiel 14:16</a>). Hence, although Jehovah puts back the wish and prayer of Moses with the words, "Whoever (&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1502;&#1497;, both here and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-11.htm">2 Samuel 20:11</a>, is more emphatic than either one or the other alone) has sinned, him will I blot out of My book," He yields to the entreaty that He will ensure to Moses the continuance of the nation under His guidance, and under the protection of His angel, which shall go before it (see at <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/33-2.htm">Exodus 33:2-3</a>), and defer the punishment of their sin until the day of His visitation. </body></html>
