The LXX. render <span class= "greekheb">σφραγῖδας καὶ ἐνώτια καὶ δακτυλίους καὶ ἐμπλόκια καὶ περιδέξια</span>, “signets, and earrings, and rings, and chains, and armlets,” substituting five terms for four. Rosenmüller thinks the <span class= "ital">khâkh </span>was a “nose ring;” others make it a “brooch” or “buckle.” The last word of the four, <span class= "ital">kumâz, </span>cannot possibly mean “tablets.” It comes from a root signifying “rounded,” and designates probably a bead necklace, such as was often worn by the Egyptians. On the use of personal ornaments by the Hebrew <span class= "ital">men, </span>as well as women, see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-2.htm" title="And Aaron said to them, Break off the golden earrings, which are in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters, and bring them to me.">Exodus 32:2</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Jewels of gold.</span>—Literally, <span class= "ital">articles of gold.</span><p><span class= "bld">And every man that offered, offered an offering of gold.</span>—By repeating the word “offered,” our translators have spoiled the sense.

Our hearts are willing, when we cheerfully assist in promoting the cause of God. Those who are diligent and contented in employments considered mean, are as much accepted of God as those engaged in splendid services. The women who spun the goats' hair were wise-hearted, because they did it heartily to the Lord. Thus the labourer, mechanic, or servant who attends to his work in the faith and fear of God, may be as wise, for his place, as the most useful minister, and he equally accepted of the Lord. Our wisdom and duty consist in giving God the glory and use of our talents, be they many or few.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/35.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Bracelets - Rather, brooches.<p>Earrings - The Hebrew word signifies a ring, either for the nose (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-22.htm">Genesis 24:22</a>) or for the ear <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-2.htm">Exodus 32:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-4.htm">Genesis 35:4</a>.

What money passed current with the merchant consisted of rings which were weighed, and principally of ornaments for personal decoration. Astonishment at the abundance of their ornaments is at an end when we learn that costly and elegant ornaments abounded in proportion as clothing was simple and scarce among the Egyptians, and some, entirely divested of clothing, yet wore rich necklaces [Hengstenberg]. Among people with Oriental sentiments and tastes, scarcely any stronger proof could have been given of the power of religion than their willingness not only to lay aside, but to devote those much-valued trinkets to the house of God; and thus all, like the Eastern sages, laid the best they had at the service of God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/exodus/35.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Earrings</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Object</span>.

The rend, ‘even’ is impossible, besides yielding a wrong sense: the reference in this clause is not to those who brought brooches, and earrings, &c., but to such as brought gold in any form,—probably, in particular, ingots. ‘Wave’ and ‘wave-offering’ are used here, not in their proper sense (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-24.htm" title="And you shall put all in the hands of Aaron, and in the hands of his sons; and shall wave them for a wave offering before the LORD.">Exodus 29:24</a>) of a ceremony implying that the object ‘waved’ is given ultimately to the priests, but in a weakened and later sense of <span class="ital">present, presentation</span>: so <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/38-24.htm" title="All the gold that was occupied for the work in all the work of the holy place, even the gold of the offering, was twenty and nine talents, and seven hundred and thirty shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary.">Exodus 38:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/38-29.htm" title="And the brass of the offering was seventy talents, and two thousand and four hundred shekels.">Exodus 38:29</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-11.htm" title="And this is yours; the heave offering of their gift, with all the wave offerings of the children of Israel: I have given them to you, and to your sons and to your daughters with you, by a statute for ever: every one that is clean in your house shall eat of it.">Numbers 18:11</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/35.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They came, both men and women</span>.

After the restoration of the covenant, Moses announced to the people the divine commands with reference to the holy place of the tabernacle which was to be built. He repeated first of all (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/35-1.htm">Exodus 35:1-3</a>) the law of the Sabbath according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/31-13.htm">Exodus 31:13-17</a>, and strengthened it by the announcement, that on the Sabbath no fire was to be kindled in their dwelling, because this rule was to be observed even in connection with the work to be done for the tabernacle. (For a fuller comment, see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-9.htm">Exodus 20:9</a>.). Then, in accordance with the command of Jehovah, he first of all summoned the whole nation to present freewill-offerings for the holy things to be prepared (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/35-4.htm">Exodus 35:4</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/35-5.htm">Exodus 35:5</a>), mentioning one by one all the materials that would be required (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/35-5.htm">Exodus 35:5-9</a>, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/25-3.htm">Exodus 25:3-7</a>); and after that he called upon those who were endowed with understanding to prepare the different articles, as prescribed in ch. 25-30, mentioning these also one by one (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/35-11.htm">Exodus 35:11-19</a>), even down to the pegs of the dwelling and court (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/27-19.htm">Exodus 27:19</a>), and "their cords," i.e., the cords required to fasten the tent and the hangings round the court to the pegs that were driven into the ground, which had not been mentioned before, being altogether subordinate things. (On the "cloths of service," <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/35-19.htm">Exodus 35:19</a>, see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/31-10.htm">Exodus 31:10</a>.) In <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/35-20.htm">Exodus 35:20-29</a> we have an account of the fulfilment of this command. The people went from Moses, i.e., from the place where they were assembled round Moses, away to their tents, and willingly offered the things required as a heave-offering for Jehovah; every one "whom his heart lifted up," i.e., who felt himself inclined and stirred up in his heart to do this. The men along with (&#1506;&#1500; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-12.htm">Genesis 32:12</a>; see Ewald, 217) the women brought with a willing heart all kinds of golden rings and jewellery: chak, lit., hook, here a clasp or ring; nezem, an ear or nose-ring (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-4.htm">Genesis 35:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-47.htm">Genesis 24:47</a>); tabbaath, a finger-ring; cumaz, globulus aureus, probably little golden balls strung together like beads, which were worn by the Israelites and Midianites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/31-50.htm">Numbers 31:50</a>) as an ornament round the wrist and neck, as Diod. Sic. relates that they were by the Arabians (3, 44). "All kinds of golden jewellery, and every one who had waved (dedicated) a wave (offering) of gold to Jehovah," sc., offered it for the work of the tabernacle. The meaning is, that in addition to the many varieties of golden ornaments, which were willingly offered for the work to be performed, every one brought whatever gold he had set apart as a wave-offering (a sacrificial gift) for Jehovah. &#1492;&#1504;&#1497;&#1507; to wave, lit., to swing or move to and fro, is used in connection with the sacrificial ritual to denote a peculiar ceremony, through which certain portions of a sacrifice, which were not intended for burning upon the altar, but for the maintenance of the priests (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-11.htm">Numbers 18:11</a>), were consecrated to the Lord, or given up to Him in a symbolical manner (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-30.htm">Leviticus 7:30</a>). Tenuphah, the wave-offering, accordingly denoted primarily those portions of the sacrificial animal which were allotted to the priests as their share of the sacrifices; and then, in a more general sense, every gift or offering that was consecrated to the Lord for the establishment and maintenance of the sanctuary and its worship. In this wider sense the term tenuphah (wave-offering) is applied both here and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/38-24.htm">Exodus 38:24</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/38-29.htm">Exodus 38:29</a> to the gold and copper presented by the congregation for the building of the tabernacle. So that it does not really differ from terumah, a lift of heave-offering, as every gift intended for the erection and maintenance of the sanctuary was called, inasmuch as the offerer lifted it off from his own property, to dedicate it to the Lord for the purposes of His worship. Accordingly, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/35-24.htm">Exodus 35:24</a> the freewill-offerings of the people in silver and gold for the erection of the tabernacle are called terumah; and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/36-6.htm">Exodus 36:6</a>, all the gifts of metal, wood, leather, and woven materials, presented by the people for the erection of the tabernacle, are called &#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473; &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1514;. (On heaving and the heave-offering, see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-2.htm">Exodus 25:2</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-9.htm">Leviticus 2:9</a>.) </body></html>
