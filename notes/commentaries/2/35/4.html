Having warned the Israelites against breaches of the sabbath, Moses proceeded to enumerate the offerings which God had said that they might bring (vers. 4-9), and the works which he had required to be constructed (vers. 10-19). In the former enumeration, he follows exactly the order and wording of the Divine command to himself, as recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-3.htm">Exodus 25:3-7</a>; in the latter, he changes the order, mentioning first the building, with its component parts (ver. 11), then the contents of the building (vers. 12-15), then the court with its contents (vers. 16, 17) together with some details which had been omitted in the former account (ver. 18), and finally the holy garments (ver. 19). After hearing him, the people returned to their several tents (ver. 20). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/exodus/34.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The sight of the glory of Jehovah, though only of the back or reflection of it, produced such an effect upon Moses' face, that the skin of it shone, though without Moses observing it. When he came down from the mountain with the tables of the law in his hand, and the skin of his face shone &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493; &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;, i.e., on account of his talking with God, Aaron and the people were afraid to go near him when they saw the brightness of his face. But Moses called them to him, - Viz. first of all Aaron and the princes of the congregation to speak to them, and then all the people to give them the commandments of Jehovah; but on doing this (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-33.htm">Exodus 34:33</a>), he put a veil upon (before) his face, and only took it away when he went in before Jehovah to speak with Him, and then, when he came out (from the Lord out of the tabernacle, of course after the erection of the tabernacle), he made known His commands to the people. But while doing this, he put the veil upon his face again, and always wore it in his ordinary intercourse with the people (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/34-34.htm">Exodus 34:34</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-35.htm">Exodus 34:35</a>). This reflection of the splendour thrown back by the glory of God was henceforth to serve as the most striking proof of the confidential relation in which Moses stood to Jehovah, and to set forth the glory of the office which Moses filled. The Apostle Paul embraces this view in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-7.htm">2 Corinthians 3:7</a>., and lays stress upon the fact that the glory was to be done away, which he was quite justified in doing, although nothing is said in the Old Testament about the glory being transient, from the simple fact that Moses died. The apostle refers to it for the purpose of contrasting the perishable glory of the law with the far higher and imperishable glory of the Gospel. At the same time he regards the veil which covered Moses' face as a symbol of the obscuring of the truth revealed in the Old Testament. But this does not exhaust the significance of this splendour. The office could only confer such glory upon the possessor by virtue of the glory of the blessings which it contained, and conveyed to those for whom it was established. Consequently, the brilliant light on Moses' face also set forth the glory of the Old Covenant, and was intended both for Moses and the people as a foresight and pledge of the glory to which Jehovah had called, and would eventually exalt, the people of His possession. </body></html>
