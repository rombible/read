Very solemn it was, typifying the covenant of grace between God and believers, through Christ. As soon as God separated to himself a peculiar people, he governed them by a written word, as he has done ever since. God's covenants and commands are so just in themselves, and so much for our good, that the more we think of them, and the more plainly and fully they are set before us, the more reason we may see to comply with them. The blood of the sacrifice was sprinkled on the altar, on the book, and on the people. Neither their persons, their moral obedience, nor religious services, would meet with acceptance from a holy God, except through the shedding and sprinkling' of blood. Also the blessings granted unto them were all of mercy; and the Lord would deal with them in kindness. Thus the sinner, by faith in the blood of Christ, renders willing and acceptable obedience.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Twelve pillars - As the altar was a symbol of the presence of Yahweh, so these twelve pillars represented the presence of the Twelve tribes with whom He was making the covenant. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/exodus/24.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3, 4.

On the basis of the promise in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>, certain grand and prominent points are mentioned, as constituting the boundaries towards both the east and west. On the west the boundary extended from the Red Sea (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-18.htm">Exodus 13:18</a>) to the sea of the Philistines, or Mediterranean Sea, the south-eastern shore of which was inhabited by the Philistines; and on the east from the desert, i.e., according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-24.htm">Deuteronomy 11:24</a>, the desert of Arabia, to the river (Euphrates). The poetic suffix &#1502;&#1493; affixed to &#1490;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468; answers to the elevated oratorical style. Making a covenant with them and their gods would imply the recognition and toleration of them, and, with the sinful tendencies of Israel, would be inevitably followed by the worship of idols. The first &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-33.htm">Exodus 23:33</a> signifies if; the second, imo, verily, and serves as an energetic introduction to the apodosis. &#1502;&#1493;&#1511;&#1513;&#1473;, a snare (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-7.htm">Exodus 10:7</a>); here a clause of destruction, inasmuch as apostasy from God is invariably followed by punishment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-3.htm">Judges 2:3</a>). </body></html>
