Very solemn it was, typifying the covenant of grace between God and believers, through Christ. As soon as God separated to himself a peculiar people, he governed them by a written word, as he has done ever since. God's covenants and commands are so just in themselves, and so much for our good, that the more we think of them, and the more plainly and fully they are set before us, the more reason we may see to comply with them. The blood of the sacrifice was sprinkled on the altar, on the book, and on the people. Neither their persons, their moral obedience, nor religious services, would meet with acceptance from a holy God, except through the shedding and sprinkling' of blood. Also the blessings granted unto them were all of mercy; and the Lord would deal with them in kindness. Thus the sinner, by faith in the blood of Christ, renders willing and acceptable obedience.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Young men of the children of Israel - See <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-22.htm">Exodus 19:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-1.htm">Exodus 28:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-5.htm">Leviticus 1:5</a>.<p>Burnt offerings ... peace offerings - The burnt offerings <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/1.htm">Leviticus 1</a> figured the dedication of the nation to Yahweh, and the peace offerings <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/3.htm">Leviticus 3</a> their communion with Yahweh and with each other. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/exodus/24.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. young men&#8212;priests (Ex 19:22), probably the oldest sons of particular families, who acted under the direction of Moses.<p>oxen&#8212;Other animals, though not mentioned, were offered in sacrifice (Heb 9:18-20).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/exodus/24.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> It matters not whether they were the first-born, or others; it is sufficient that they were persons appointed and authorized for the present service, not without God’s direction. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Peace-offerings of oxen; </span> one kind, as the principal is named for all; for there were offered also goats, as appears both from <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-19.htm" title="For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and all the people,">Hebrews 9:19</a></span>, and from hence, that <span class="ital">burnt-offerings</span> were usually made of the goats, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-10.htm" title="And if his offering be of the flocks, namely, of the sheep, or of the goats, for a burnt sacrifice; he shall bring it a male without blemish.">Leviticus 1:10</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/7-28.htm" title="One kid of the goats for a sin offering:">Numbers 7:28</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/exodus/24.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he sent young men of the children Israel,....

And very probably, as the seventy elders were such as were selected from the senior and graver part of the people, so these were choice young men, that were separated from others for this service, without any regard to birthright: <p>which offered burnt offerings, and sacrificed peace offerings of oxen unto the Lord; by way of thankfulness; and such were used at making covenants, when the parties ate and drank together.

On the basis of the promise in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>, certain grand and prominent points are mentioned, as constituting the boundaries towards both the east and west. On the west the boundary extended from the Red Sea (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-18.htm">Exodus 13:18</a>) to the sea of the Philistines, or Mediterranean Sea, the south-eastern shore of which was inhabited by the Philistines; and on the east from the desert, i.e., according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-24.htm">Deuteronomy 11:24</a>, the desert of Arabia, to the river (Euphrates). The poetic suffix &#1502;&#1493; affixed to &#1490;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468; answers to the elevated oratorical style.
