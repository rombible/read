Very solemn it was, typifying the covenant of grace between God and believers, through Christ. As soon as God separated to himself a peculiar people, he governed them by a written word, as he has done ever since. God's covenants and commands are so just in themselves, and so much for our good, that the more we think of them, and the more plainly and fully they are set before us, the more reason we may see to comply with them. The blood of the sacrifice was sprinkled on the altar, on the book, and on the people. Neither their persons, their moral obedience, nor religious services, would meet with acceptance from a holy God, except through the shedding and sprinkling' of blood. Also the blessings granted unto them were all of mercy; and the Lord would deal with them in kindness. Thus the sinner, by faith in the blood of Christ, renders willing and acceptable obedience.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Are placed by some with great probability between <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/24-8.htm">Exodus 24:8-9</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/exodus/24.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 24<p>Ex 24:1-18.

It seems, by this account, that Moses had been down from the mount after he had received the laws recorded in the two preceding chapters; though as yet he had not related them to the people, but did before he went up again by the above order, as appears from what follows. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/exodus/24.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And Moses alone shall come near the LORD: but they shall not come nigh; neither shall the people go up with him.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/exodus/24.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">2</span>.<span class="bld"> they</span> (emph.)] Aaron, his two sons, and the elders.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">neither</span>, &c.] Observe the gradation: the people generally are to remain at the foot of the mountain; Aaron, his two sons, and the elders come partly up the mountain; only Moses goes to the top (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-21.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest they break through to the LORD to gaze, and many of them perish.">Exodus 19:21</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-21.htm" title="And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near to the thick darkness where God was.">Exodus 20:21</a>).<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/exodus/23.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In addition to the fear of God, hornets (&#1492;&#1510;&#1468;&#1512;&#1506;&#1492; construed as a generic word with the collective article), a very large species of wasp, that was greatly dreaded both by man and beast on account of the acuteness of its sting, should come and drive out the Canaanites, of whom three tribes are mentioned instar omnium, from before the Israelites. Although it is true that Aelian (hist. anim. 11, 28) relates that the Phaselians, who dwelt near the Solymites, and therefore probably belonged to the Canaanites, were driven out of their country by wasps, and Bochart (Hieroz. iii. pp. 409ff.) has collected together accounts of different tribes that have been frightened away from their possessions by frogs, mice, and other vermin, "the sending of hornets before the Israelites" is hardly to be taken literally, not only because there is not a word in the book of Joshua about the Canaanites being overcome and exterminated in any such way, but chiefly on account of <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/24-12.htm">Joshua 24:12</a>, where Joshua says that God sent the hornet before them, and drove out the two kings of the Amorites, referring thereby to their defeat and destruction by the Israelites through the miraculous interposition of God, and thus placing the figurative use of the term hornet beyond the possibility of doubt. These hornets, however, which are very aptly described in Wis. 12:8, on the basis of this passage, as &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;, the pioneers of the army of Jehovah, do not denote merely varii generis mala, as Rosenmller supposes, but acerrimos timoris aculeos, quibus quodammodo volantibus rumoribus pungebantur, ut fugerent (Augustine, quaest. 27 in Jos.). If the fear of God which fell upon the Canaanites threw them into such confusion and helpless despair, that they could not stand before Israel, but turned their backs towards them, the stings of alarm which followed this fear would completely drive them away. Nevertheless God would not drive them away at once, "in one year," lest the land should become a desert for want of men to cultivate it, and the wild beasts should multiply against Israel; in other words, lest the beasts of prey should gain the upper hand and endanger the lives of man and beast (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-22.htm">Leviticus 26:22</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-15.htm">Ezekiel 14:15</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-21.htm">Ezekiel 14:21</a>), which actually was the case after the carrying away of the ten tribes (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-25.htm">2 Kings 17:25-26</a>). He would drive them out by degrees (&#1502;&#1506;&#1496; &#1502;&#1506;&#1496;, only used here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-22.htm">Deuteronomy 7:22</a>), until Israel was sufficiently increased to take possession of the land, i.e., to occupy the whole of the country. This promise was so far fulfilled, according to the books of Joshua and Judges, that after the subjugation of the Canaanites in the south and north of the land, when all the kings who fought against Israel had been smitten and slain and their cities captured, the entire land was divided among the tribes of Israel, in order that they might exterminate the remaining Canaanites, and take possession of those portions of the land that had not yet been conquered (<a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/13-1.htm">Joshua 13:1-7</a>). But the different tribes soon became weary of the task of exterminating the Canaanites, and began to enter into alliance with them, and were led astray by them to the worship of idols; whereupon God punished them by withdrawing His assistance, and they were oppressed and humiliated by the Canaanites because of their apostasy from the Lord (<a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/1.htm">Judges 1</a> and 2).</body></html>
