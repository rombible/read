Thus the two parties to the covenant, sprinkled with the blood of the same sacrifices, were brought into sacramental union. Rites somewhat similar, involving blood communion, were common throughout the East in connection with covenants (Horn. <span class= "ital">Il. iii.</span> 298, xix. 252; Herod. I. 74, iii. 8, iv. 70; Xen. <span class= "ital">Anab. ii.</span> 2, § 9; Lucian. <span class= "ital">Toxar. </span>37; Pomp. <span class= "ital">Mel. </span>ii. 1; Tac. <span class= "ital">Ann. xii.</span> 47; &c), and were regarded as adding to their force and sacredness.<p><span class= "bld">On the people.</span>—It has been suggested (Abarbarnel) that the blood was really sprinkled on the twelve pillars which represented the people; but the words used scarcely seem to admit of such an interpretation. The writer of the Epistle to the Hebrews understood the passage as declaring that the people were sprinkled (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-19.htm" title="For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and all the people,">Hebrews 9:19</a>).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/24.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>24:1-8 A solemn covenant was made between God and Israel. Very solemn it was, typifying the covenant of grace between God and believers, through Christ. As soon as God separated to himself a peculiar people, he governed them by a written word, as he has done ever since. God's covenants and commands are so just in themselves, and so much for our good, that the more we think of them, and the more plainly and fully they are set before us, the more reason we may see to comply with them. The blood of the sacrifice was sprinkled on the altar, on the book, and on the people. Neither their persons, their moral obedience, nor religious services, would meet with acceptance from a holy God, except through the shedding and sprinkling' of blood. Also the blessings granted unto them were all of mercy; and the Lord would deal with them in kindness. Thus the sinner, by faith in the blood of Christ, renders willing and acceptable obedience.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The blood which sealed the covenant was the blood of burnt offerings and peace offerings. The sin-offering <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/4.htm">Leviticus 4</a> had not yet been instituted. That more complicated view of human nature which gave to the sin-offering its meaning, had yet to be developed by the law, which was now only receiving its ratification. The covenant between Yahweh and His people therefore took precedence of the operation of the law, by which came the knowledge of sin. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-20.htm">Romans 3:20</a>.<p>Upon the people - Either upon the elders or those who stood foremost; or, upon the twelve pillars representing the Twelve tribes, as the first half had been cast upon the altar, which witnessed to the presence of Yahweh. The blood thus divided between the two parties to the covenant signified the sacramental union between the Lord and His people. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-5.htm">Psalm 50:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/9-11.htm">Zechariah 9:11</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/exodus/24.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. Moses took the blood, and sprinkled it on the people&#8212;probably on the twelve pillars, as representing the people (also the book, Heb 9:19), and the act was accompanied by a public proclamation of its import. It was setting their seal to the covenant (compare 1Co 11:25). It must have been a deeply impressive, as well as instructive scene, for it taught the Israelites that the covenant was made with them only through the sprinkling of blood&#8212;that the divine acceptance of themselves and services, was only by virtue of an atoning sacrifice, and that even the blessings of the national covenant were promised and secured to them only through grace. The ceremonial, however, had a further and higher significance, as is shown by the apostle (see as above).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/exodus/24.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Moses took the blood; </span> the other half of the blood, which was put in the basons for this end, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-6.htm" title="And Moses took half of the blood, and put it in basins; and half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar.">Exodus 24:6</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">On the people; </span> either upon the twelve pillars representing the people; or upon the people’s representatives, to wit, the elders mentioned <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-1.htm" title="And he said to Moses, Come up to the LORD, you, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel; and worship you afar off.">Exodus 24:1</a></span>, as when the people are commanded to lay on their hands, the elders do it in their name and stead, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-15.htm" title="And the elders of the congregation shall lay their hands on the head of the bullock before the LORD: and the bullock shall be killed before the LORD.">Leviticus 4:15</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-2.htm" title="Then your elders and your judges shall come forth, and they shall measure to the cities which are round about him that is slain:">Deu 21:2</a></span>; or upon those of the people which are nearest him, which was imputed to all the rest, and was to be taken by them as if it had reached unto them all.

It has been supposed by some that he merely sprinkled the blood on the twelve pillars, as representing the twelve tribes; but, had this been the case, the expression in the text would probably have been different. We read, in the Epistle to the Hebrews, that he "sprinkled both the book, <span class="accented">and all the people"</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-19.htm">Hebrews 9:19</a>). As he sprinkled, he said, <span class="cmt_word">Behold the blood of the covenant</span>, etc. It was a common practice among the nations of antiquity to seal covenants with blood. Sometimes the blood was that of a victim, and the two parties to the covenant prayed, that, if they broke it, his fate might be theirs (Hom. <span class="accented">1l.</span> 3:298; 19:252; Leviticus 1:24; 21:45; etc.). Sometimes it was the blood of the two parties themselves, who each drank of the other's blood, and thereby contracted a blood-relationship, which would have made their breaking the covenant more unpardonable (Herod. 1:74; 4:70; Tacit. <span class="accented">Ann</span>. 12:47). Moses seems to have followed neither practice at all closely, but, adopting simply the principle that a covenant required to be sealed with blood, to have arranged the details as he thought best. By the sprinkling of both the altar and the people the two parties to the covenant were made partakers of one and the same blood, and so brought into a sort of sacramental union. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 24:9-11 <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/exodus/24.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>These two verses form part of the address of God in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/20-22.htm">Exodus 20:22-23:33</a>; for &#1488;&#1502;&#1512; &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492; &#1493;&#1488;&#1500; ("but to Moses He said") cannot be the commencement of a fresh address, which would necessarily require &#1502; &#1488;&#1500; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-12.htm">Exodus 24:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-21.htm">Exodus 19:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-22.htm">Exodus 20:22</a>). The turn given to the expression &#1502; &#1493;&#1488;&#1500; presupposes that God had already spoken to others, or that what had been said before related not to Moses himself, but to other persons. But this cannot be affirmed of the decalogue, which applied to Moses quite as much as to the entire nation (a sufficient refutation of Knobel's assertion, that these verses are a continuation of <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-20.htm">Exodus 19:20-25</a>, and are linked on to the decalogue), but only of the address concerning the mishpatim, or "rights," which commences with <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/20-22.htm">Exodus 20:22</a>, and, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-22.htm">Exodus 20:22</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/21-1.htm">Exodus 21:1</a>, was intended for the nation, and addressed to it, even though it was through the medium of Moses. What God said to the people as establishing its rights, is here followed by what He said to Moses himself, namely, that he was to go up to Jehovah, along with Aaron, Nadab, Abihu, and seventy elders. At the same time, it is of course implied that Moses, who had ascended the mountain with Aaron alone (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-21.htm">Exodus 20:21</a>), was first of all to go down again and repeat to the people the "rights" which God had communicated to him, and only when this had been done, to ascend again with the persons named. According to <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-3.htm">Exodus 24:3</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-12.htm">Exodus 24:12</a> (? 9), this is what Moses really did. But Moses alone was to go near to Jehovah: the others were to worship afar off, and the people were not to come up at all. </body></html>
