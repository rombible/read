So awful a manifestation has never been made at any other place or time, nor will be until the consummation of all things. To regard it as a mere “storm of thunder and lightning,” or as “an earthquake with volcanic eruptions,” is to miss altogether the meaning of the author, and to empty his narrative of all its natural significance.<p><span class= "bld">The voice of the trumpet.</span>—Heb., <span class= "ital">a voice of a trumpet. </span>The trumpet’s blare is the signal of a herald calling attention to a proclamation about to be made.

It might be supposed that the terrors would have checked presumption and curiosity in the people; but the hard heart of an unawakened sinner can trifle with the most terrible threatenings and judgments. In drawing near to God, we must never forget his holiness and greatness, nor our own meanness and pollution. We cannot stand in judgment before him according to his righteous law. The convinced transgressor asks, What must I do to be saved? and he hears the voice, Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved. The Holy Ghost, who made the law to convince of sin, now takes of the things of Christ, and shows them to us. In the gospel we read, Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us. We have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins. Through him we are justified from all things, from which we could not be justified by the law of Moses. But the Divine law is binding as a rule of life. The Son of God came down from heaven, and suffered poverty, shame, agony, and death, not only to redeem us from its curse, but to bind us more closely to keep its commands.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Touch it - Rather "touch him."

But all was in keeping with the character of the law about to be proclaimed. As the mountain burned with fire, God was exhibited as a consuming fire to the transgressors of His law. The thunder and lightning, more awful amid the deep stillness of the region and reverberating with terrific peals among the mountains, would rouse the universal attention; a thick cloud was an apt emblem of the dark and shadowy dispensation (compare Mt 17:5).<p>the voice of a trumpet&#8212;This gave the scene the character of a miraculous transaction, in which other elements than those of nature were at work, and some other than material trumpet was blown by other means than human breath.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/exodus/19.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">thunders and lightnings</span> were sent partly as evidences and tokens both of God’s glorious presence, and of the anger of God, and the dreadful punishments due to the transgressors of the law now to be delivered; and partly as means to humble, and awaken, and convince, and terrify proud and secure sinners, that they might more reverently attend to the words and commands of God, more willingly yield obedience to them, and be more afraid of the violation of them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">A thick cloud</span> was both a fit mean for the production and reception of the thunders and lightnings, and a signification as well of the invisible and unconceivable nature of God, as of the obscurity of the legal dispensation in regard of its types and shadows, & c., <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-13.htm" title="And not as Moses, which put a veil over his face, that the children of Israel could not steadfastly look to the end of that which is abolished:">2 Corinthians 3:13</a>,18 4:6</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The trumpet</span> was a fit instrument, both for the promulgation of God’s law, and for the signification of that war that is between God and sinners. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">All the people, </span> Moses himself not excepted, as appears from <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-21.htm" title="And so terrible was the sight, that Moses said, I exceedingly fear and quake:)">Hebrews 12:21</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/exodus/19.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, The sixth of the month, according to the Targum of Jonathan, and so Jarchi; on which day, as the Jews generally say (t), the law was given, and which, they also observe, was a sabbath day: yea, they are sometimes so very particular as to fix the hour of the day, and say (u), it was the sixth hour of the day, or twelve o'clock at noon, that Israel received the decalogue, and at the ninth hour, at three o'clock in the afternoon, returned to their stations: <p>there were thunders, and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount; which were to awaken the attention of the people to what they were to hear and receive, and to strike their minds with an awe of the divine Being; and to add to the solemnity of the day, and the service of it; and to signify the obscurity and terror of the legal dispensation, and the wrath and curse that the transgressors the law might expect, even an horrible tempest of divine vengeance, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-18.htm">Hebrews 12:18</a>. <p>and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; or, "exceeding strong" (w); being blown by the mighty angels, and by ten thousand them, with whom the Lord now descended: <p>so that all the people that was in the camp trembled, at the sound of it, it was so loud and terrible, and it so pierced their ears and their hearts: a different effect the Gospel trumpet the jubilee trumpet, the joyful sound of love, grace, and mercy, has upon sensible sinners, and on true believers: the law with its curses terrifies, the Gospel with its blessings comforts. <p>(t) T.

All was ready. The fence had been made (ver. 23); the people had purified themselves - at least so far as externals went. The third day was come - there was a breathless hush of expectation. Then suddenly, in the morning, the presence manifested itself. "There were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud" (ver. 16); "and Mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the Lord descended upon it in fire; and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace and the whole mount quaked greatly" (ver. 18) Or, as the scene is elsewhere (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-11.htm">Deuteronomy 4:11, 12</a>) described by Moses - "Ye came near and stood under the mountain, and the mountain burned with fire <span class="accented">unto the midst of heaven</span>, with darkness, clouds, and <span class="accented">thick darkness</span>. And the Lord spoke unto you <span class="accented">out of the midst of the fire</span>: ye heard the voice of the words, but saw no similitude; only ye heard a voice." The phenomena were not a mere "storm of thunder and lightning, whereof Moses took advantage to persuade the people that they had heard God's voice" - not "an earthquake with volcanic eruptions"  - not even these two combined - but a real theophany, in which amid the phenomena of storm and tempest, and fire and smoke, and thick darkness, and hearings of the ground as by an earthquake shock, first the loud blast of a trumpet sounded long commanding attention, and then a clear penetrating voice, like that of a man, made itself heard in distinctly articulated words, audible to the whole multitude,  and recognised by them as superhuman - as "the voice of God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-33.htm">Deuteronomy 4:33</a>). It is in vain to seek to minimise, and to rationalise the scene, and tone it down into something not supernatural. The only honest course is either to accept it as a plain record of plain (albeit miraculous) facts, or to reject it altogether as the fiction of a romancer. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There were thunders</span>.

The hedging or bounding (&#1492;&#1490;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;) of the people is spoken of in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-23.htm">Exodus 19:23</a> as setting bounds about the mountain, and consisted therefore in the erection of a barrier round the mountain, which was to prevent the people form ascending or touching it. Any one who touched it (&#1511;&#1510;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;, "its end," i.e., the outermost or lowest part of the mountain) was to be put to death, whether man or beast. "No hand shall touch him" (the individual who passed the barrier and touched the mountain), i.e., no one was to follow him within the appointed boundaries, but he was to be killed from a distance either by stones or darts. (&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492; for &#1497;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492;, see Gesenius, 69.) Not till "the drawing out of the trumpet blast," or, as Luther renders it, "only when it sounded long," could they ascend the mountain (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-13.htm">Exodus 19:13</a>). &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1489;&#1500;, from &#1497;&#1489;&#1500; to stream violently with noise, is synonymous with &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1489;&#1500; &#1511;&#1512;&#1503; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/6-5.htm">Joshua 6:5</a>), and was really the same thing as the &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1508;&#1512;, i.e., a long wind instrument shaped like a horn. &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1489;&#1500; &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498; is to draw the horn, i.e., to blow the horn with tones long drawn out. This was done either to give a signal to summon the people to war (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-27.htm">Judges 3:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-34.htm">Judges 6:34</a>), or to call them to battle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/7-18.htm">Judges 7:18</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/39-24.htm">Job 39:24-25</a>, etc.), or for other public proclamations. No one (this is the idea) was to ascend the mountain on pain of death, or even to touch its outermost edge; but when the horn was blown with a long blast, and the signal to approach was given thereby, then they might ascend it (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-21.htm">Exodus 19:21</a>), - of course not 600,000 men, which would have been physically impossible, but the people in the persons of their representatives the elders. &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1512; &#1506;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514; signifies to go up the mountain in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-13.htm">Exodus 19:13</a> as well as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-12.htm">Exodus 19:12</a>, and not merely to come to the foot of the mountain (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-5.htm">Deuteronomy 5:5</a>). </body></html>
