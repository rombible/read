The Maker and first Mover of the covenant, is God himself. This blessed charter was granted out of God's own free grace. The covenant here mentioned was the national covenant, by which the Israelites were a people under the government of Jehovah. It was a type of the new covenant made with true believers in Christ Jesus; but, like other types, it was only a shadow of good things to come. As a nation they broke this covenant; therefore the Lord declared that he would make a new covenant with Israel, writing his law, not upon tables of stone, but in their hearts, Jer 31:33; Heb 8:7-10. The covenant spoken of in these places as ready to vanish away, is the national covenant with Israel, which they forfeited by their sins. Unless we carefully attend to this, we shall fall into mistakes while reading the Old Testament. We must not suppose that the nation of the Jews were under the covenant of works, which knows nothing of repentance, faith in a Mediator, forgiveness of sins, or grace; nor yet that the whole nation of Israel bore the character, and possessed the privileges of true believers, as being actually sharers in the covenant of grace. They were all under a dispensation of mercy; they had outward privileges and advantages for salvation; but, like professing Christians, most rested therein, and went no further. Israel consented to the conditions. They answered as one man, All that the Lord hath spoken we will do. Oh that there had been such a heart in them! Moses, as a mediator, returned the words of the people to God. Thus Christ, the Mediator, as a Prophet, reveals God's will to us, his precepts and promises; and then, as a Priest, offers up to God our spiritual sacrifices, not only of prayer and praise, but of devout affections, and pious resolutions, the work of his own Spirit in us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A peculiar treasure - A costly possession acquired with exertion, and carefully guarded. The special relation in which Israel stands, taken out of the pagan world and consecrated to God, as His slaves, subjects, and children, determines their privileges, and is the foundation of their duties. The same principle applies even in a stronger sense to the Church. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-28.htm">Acts 20:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-20.htm">1 Corinthians 6:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>.<p>All the earth is mine - It was a point of great practical importance, to impress upon the Jews that their God was no mere national Deity.

In thus negotiating between God and His people, the highest post of duty which any mortal man was ever called to occupy, Moses was still but a servant.

In a religious sense, a ‘covenant’ is the most formal, and, so to say, official expression of the gracious relation subsisting between God and men: God promises that, if man observes the conditions laid down by Him, He will bestow upon him certain specified blessings. In references to a covenant of this kind, the stress may rest, according to the context and purpose of the writer, either on the Divine promise (e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-31.htm" title="(For the LORD your God is a merciful God;) he will not forsake you, neither destroy you, nor forget the covenant of your fathers which he swore to them.">Deuteronomy 4:31</a>), or on the human obligation (e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-23.htm" title="Take heed to yourselves, lest you forget the covenant of the LORD your God, which he made with you, and make you a graven image, or the likeness of any thing, which the LORD your God has forbidden you.">Deuteronomy 4:23</a>). The following are the ‘covenants’ referred to in the Pentateuch:—<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In J:—1. The covenant with Abraham, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-18.htm" title="In the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, To your seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates:">Genesis 15:18</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">5, 6</span>. The promise. The high privileges in store for Israel, if it but listens to Jehovah’s voice, and observes His covenant. The verses, in style and thought, approximate to Dt. (cf. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/12-25.htm" title="You shall not eat it; that it may go well with you, and with your children after you, when you shall do that which is right in the sight of the LORD....">Deuteronomy 12:25-27</a> a), and may have been expanded by the compiler of JE.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now therefore</span>.

(Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/135-4.htm">Psalm 135:4</a>; and see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-1.htm">Isaiah 43:1-4</a>.) and this preciousness they shall not share with others on equal terms, but enjoy exclusively - it shall be theirs <span class="cmt_word">above</span> <span class="cmt_word">all</span> <span class="cmt_word">people.</span> No other nation on the earth shall hold the position which they shall hold, or be equally precious in God's sight. All the earth is his: and so all nations are his in a certain sense. But this shall not interfere with the special Israelite prerogative they alone shall be his "peculiar people" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-2.htm">Deuteronomy 14:2</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/exodus/18.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The judges chosen were arranged as chiefs (&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;) over thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens, after the analogy of the military organization of the people on their march (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/31-14.htm">Numbers 31:14</a>), in such a manner, however, that this arrangement was linked on to the natural division of the people into tribes, families, etc. (see my Archologie, 140). For it is evident that the decimal division was not made in an arbitrary manner according to the number of heads, from the fact that, on the one hand, the judges were chosen from the heads of their tribes and according to their tribes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-13.htm">Deuteronomy 1:13</a>); and on the other hand, the larger divisions of the tribes, viz., the families (mishpachoth), were also called thousands (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/1-15.htm">Numbers 1:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/10-4.htm">Numbers 10:4</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/22-14.htm">Joshua 22:14</a>, etc.), just because the number of their heads of families would generally average about a thousand; so that in all probability the hundreds, fifties, and tens denote smaller divisions of the nation, in which there were about this number of fathers. Thus in Arabic, for example, "the ten" is a term used to signify a family (cf. Hengstenberg, Dissertations v. ii. 343, and my Arch. 149). The difference between the harder or greater matters and the smaller matters consisted in this: questions which there was not definite law to decide were great or hard; whereas, on the other hand, those which could easily be decided from existing laws or general principles of equity were simple or small. (Vide Joh. Selden de Synedriis i. c. 16, in my Arch. 149, Not. 3, where the different views are discussed respecting the relative positions and competency of the various judges, about which there is no precise information given in the law.) So far as the total number of judges is concerned, all that can be affirmed with certainty is, that the estimated number of 600 judges over thousands, 6000 over hundreds, 12,000 over fifties, and 60,000 over tens, in all 78,600 judges, which is given by Grotius and in the Talmud, and according to which there must have been a judge for every seven adults, is altogether erroneous (cf. J. Selden l.c. pp. 339ff.). For if the thousands answered to the families (Mishpachoth), there cannot have been a thousand males in every one; and in the same way the hundreds, etc., are not to be understood as consisting of precisely that number of persons, but as larger or smaller family groups, the numerical strength of which we do not know. And even if we did know it, or were able to estimate it, this would furnish no criterion by which to calculate the number of the judges, for the text does not affirm that every one of these larger or smaller family groups had a judge of its own; in fact, the contrary may rather be inferred, from the fact that, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-15.htm">Deuteronomy 1:15</a>, the judges were chosen out of the heads of the tribes, so that the number of judges must have been smaller than that of the heads, and can hardly therefore have amounted to many hundreds, to say nothing of many thousands. </body></html>
