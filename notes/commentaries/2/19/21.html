Actual contact with the mountain was forbidden under penalty of death (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-12.htm" title="And you shall set bounds to the people round about, saying, Take heed to yourselves, that you go not up into the mount, or touch the border of it: whoever touches the mount shall be surely put to death:">Exodus 19:12</a>). It is evident from <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-23.htm" title="And Moses said to the LORD, The people cannot come up to mount Sinai: for you charged us, saying, Set bounds about the mount, and sanctify it.">Exodus 19:23</a> that the command to “set bounds” had been obeyed, and a fence erected which it would have required some force to “break through;” nor can there be any doubt that Moses had promulgated the directions, which he had received from God, forbidding any approach to the mount, and threatening death to those who should “touch” it. Yet still it is evident from this concluding paragraph of the chapter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/19-21.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest they break through to the LORD to gaze, and many of them perish.">Exodus 19:21-25</a>) that the first warning was insufficient. An intention to “break through, to gaze,” must have been entertained by many. To this intention the existing priesthood, whatever it was, were parties (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-22.htm" title="And let the priests also, which come near to the LORD, sanctify themselves, lest the LORD break forth on them.">Exodus 19:22</a>). It always grates upon men’s feelings to be told that they are less holy than others; and we can easily understand that those who had hitherto acted as priests to the nation would resent their exclusion from “holy ground” to which the sons of Amram were about to be admitted. Even of the people there may have been many who participated in the feeling, and thought that Moses and Aaron were “taking too much upon them, seeing that the whole congregation” was holy. Hence, a further very stringent command was requisite, and Moses, having reached the summit, was sent down again from the top to the bottom in order to enjoin upon priests and people alike, in the most solemn possible way, the necessity of their observing the bounds set.<p>(21) <span class= "bld">Lest they break through</span>—<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, <span class= "ital">force their way through the barrier which Moses had erected.</span><p><span class= "bld">To gaze, and many of them perish.</span>—Some might have perished by the execution of the orders given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-13.htm" title="There shall not an hand touch it, but he shall surely be stoned, or shot through; whether it be beast or man, it shall not live: when the trumpet sounds long, they shall come up to the mount.">Exodus 19:13</a>. But the allusion is perhaps rather to such a heaven-sent plague as destroyed the men of Beth-shemesh to the number of 50,070 (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-19.htm" title="And he smote the men of Bethshemesh, because they had looked into the ark of the LORD, even he smote of the people fifty thousand and three score and ten men: and the people lamented, because the LORD had smitten many of the people with a great slaughter.">1Samuel 6:19</a>).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/19.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>19:16-25 Never was there such a sermon preached, before or since, as this which was preached to the church in the wilderness. It might be supposed that the terrors would have checked presumption and curiosity in the people; but the hard heart of an unawakened sinner can trifle with the most terrible threatenings and judgments. In drawing near to God, we must never forget his holiness and greatness, nor our own meanness and pollution. We cannot stand in judgment before him according to his righteous law. The convinced transgressor asks, What must I do to be saved? and he hears the voice, Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved. The Holy Ghost, who made the law to convince of sin, now takes of the things of Christ, and shows them to us. In the gospel we read, Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us. We have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins. Through him we are justified from all things, from which we could not be justified by the law of Moses. But the Divine law is binding as a rule of life. The Son of God came down from heaven, and suffered poverty, shame, agony, and death, not only to redeem us from its curse, but to bind us more closely to keep its commands.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A furnace - The word in the original is Egyptian, and occurs only in the Pentateuch. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/exodus/19.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21. the Lord said unto Moses, Go down, charge the people&#8212;No sooner had Moses proceeded a little up the mount, than he was suddenly ordered to return, in order to keep the people from breaking through to gaze&#8212;a course adopted to heighten the impressive solemnity of the scene. The strict injunctions renewed to all, whatever their condition, at a time and in circumstances when the whole multitude of Israel were standing at the base of the mount, was calculated in the highest degree to solemnize and awe every heart.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/exodus/19.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Through curiosity to know in what form or manner I appear to thee. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/exodus/19.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the Lord said unto Moses, go down,....

It is very remarkable that, after all the directions given (vers. 10-13), and all the pains taken by Moses and the Israelites themselves (vers. 14, 15, 23), God should still have thought it necessary to interpose with a fresh warning, and to send Moses back from the top of the mount to the bottom, in order to communicate the renewed warning to the people. We can only suppose that, in spite of the instructions previously given and the precautions taken, there were those among the people who were prepared to "break through" the fence, and invade the mount, and who would have done so, to their own destruction (ver. 21), but for this second warning. The special mention of the "priests" (vers. 22, 24) raises the suspicion, that this proud and rebellious spirit was particularly developed among them. Accustomed to the exercise of sacred functions, they may have been inclined to regard their own purity as equal to that of Moses and Aaron; and they may even have resented their exclusion from a sacred spot to which the two sons of Amram were admitted. Apparently, they had conceived that the injunction to go through the recognised ceremonies of purification (ver. 10) did not apply to them, and had neglected to do so, on which account a special command had to be issued, addressed to them only (ver. 22). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Charge the people lest they break through</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "lest they force a passage through the barrier made by Moses" in accordance with the command given in ver. 12. <span class="cmt_word">And many of them perish</span>. Irreverent gazing on holy things was forbidden by the law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/4-20.htm">Numbers 4:20</a>), and on one occasion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-19.htm">1 Samuel 6:19</a>) was actually punished with death. It did not, however, require a law to make it an offence, natural reason being quite sufficient to teach the duty of reverence. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/exodus/19.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>God then commanded Moses to prepare the people for His appearing or speaking to them: (1) by their sanctification, through the washing of the body and clothes (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-2.htm">Genesis 35:2</a>), and abstinence from conjugal intercourse (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-15.htm">Exodus 19:15</a>) on account of the defilement connected therewith (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/15-18.htm">Leviticus 15:18</a>); and (2) by setting bounds round the people, that they might not ascend or touch the mountain. The hedging or bounding (&#1492;&#1490;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;) of the people is spoken of in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-23.htm">Exodus 19:23</a> as setting bounds about the mountain, and consisted therefore in the erection of a barrier round the mountain, which was to prevent the people form ascending or touching it. Any one who touched it (&#1511;&#1510;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;, "its end," i.e., the outermost or lowest part of the mountain) was to be put to death, whether man or beast. "No hand shall touch him" (the individual who passed the barrier and touched the mountain), i.e., no one was to follow him within the appointed boundaries, but he was to be killed from a distance either by stones or darts. (&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492; for &#1497;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492;, see Gesenius, 69.) Not till "the drawing out of the trumpet blast," or, as Luther renders it, "only when it sounded long," could they ascend the mountain (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-13.htm">Exodus 19:13</a>). &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1489;&#1500;, from &#1497;&#1489;&#1500; to stream violently with noise, is synonymous with &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1489;&#1500; &#1511;&#1512;&#1503; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/6-5.htm">Joshua 6:5</a>), and was really the same thing as the &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1508;&#1512;, i.e., a long wind instrument shaped like a horn. &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1489;&#1500; &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498; is to draw the horn, i.e., to blow the horn with tones long drawn out. This was done either to give a signal to summon the people to war (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-27.htm">Judges 3:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-34.htm">Judges 6:34</a>), or to call them to battle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/7-18.htm">Judges 7:18</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/39-24.htm">Job 39:24-25</a>, etc.), or for other public proclamations. No one (this is the idea) was to ascend the mountain on pain of death, or even to touch its outermost edge; but when the horn was blown with a long blast, and the signal to approach was given thereby, then they might ascend it (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-21.htm">Exodus 19:21</a>), - of course not 600,000 men, which would have been physically impossible, but the people in the persons of their representatives the elders. &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1512; &#1506;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514; signifies to go up the mountain in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-13.htm">Exodus 19:13</a> as well as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-12.htm">Exodus 19:12</a>, and not merely to come to the foot of the mountain (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-5.htm">Deuteronomy 5:5</a>). </body></html>
