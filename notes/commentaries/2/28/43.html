If we appear not before God in that, we shall bear our iniquity, and die. Blessed is he, therefore, that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, Re 16:15. And blessed be God that we have a High Priest, appointed of God, and set apart for his work; furnished for his high office by the glory of his Divine majesty, and the beauty of perfect holiness. Happy are we, if by the law spiritually understood, we see that such a High Priest became us; that we cannot draw near to a holy God, or be accepted, but by him. There is no light, no wisdom, no perfection, but from him; no glory, no beauty, but in being like unto him. Let us take encouragement from the power, love, and compassion of our High Priest, to draw near with boldness to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/28.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>That they bear not iniquity and die - See <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/28-35.htm">Exodus 28:35</a>, note; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-38.htm">Exodus 28:38</a> note. <p>The consecration of the priests.

Literally," when they go into the tent of meeting - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the place where God and the high priest were to meet. <span class="cmt_word">The holy place</span>. The "holy place" seems in this passage to include the court of the tabernacle, wherein the altar was situated. <span class="cmt_word">That they bear not iniquity</span>. To "bear iniquity" is to incur guilt, or have sin imputed to one. If even through forgetfulness a priest entered the sanctuary without this necessary article of clothing, and so risked an unseemly, exposure of his person, he was to be accounted guilty, and punished by death. This was to be a "statute for ever," and to apply both to the high priest and the ordinary priests. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-26.htm">Exodus 20:26</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/exodus/28.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The fourth article of the high priest's dress was the diadem upon his head-band. &#1510;&#1497;&#1509;, from &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509; to shine, a plate of pure gold, on which the words &#1500;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; &#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;, "holiness (i.e., all holy) to Jehovah," were engraved, and which is called the "crown of holiness" in consequence, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/39-30.htm">Exodus 39:30</a>. This gold plate was to be placed upon a riband of dark-blue purple, or, as it is expressed in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/39-31.htm">Exodus 39:31</a>, a riband of this kind was to be fastened to it, to attach it to the head-band, "upon the fore-front (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/26-9.htm">Exodus 26:9</a>) of the head-band," from above (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/39-31.htm">Exodus 39:31</a>); by which we are to understand that the gold plate was placed above the lower coil of the head-band and over Aaron's forehead. The word &#1502;&#1510;&#1504;&#1508;&#1514;, from &#1510;&#1504;&#1507; to twist or coil (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-18.htm">Isaiah 22:18</a>), is only applied to the head-band or turban of the high priest, which was made of simply byssus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-39.htm">Exodus 28:39</a>), and, judging from the etymology, was in the shape of a turban. This is all that can be determined with reference to its form. The diadem was the only thing about it that had any special significance. This was to be placed above (upon) Aaron's forehead, that he "might bear the iniquity of the holy things, which the children of Israel sanctified, with regard to all their holy gifts,...as an acceptableness for them before Jehovah." &#1506;&#1493;&#1503; &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;: to bear iniquity (sin) and take it away; in other words, to exterminate it by taking it upon one's self. The high priest was exalted into an atoning mediator of the whole nation; and an atoning, sin-exterminating intercession was associated with his office. The qualification for this he received from the diadem upon his forehead with the inscription, "holiness to the Lord." Through this inscription, which was fastened upon his head-dress of brilliant white, the earthly reflection of holiness, he was crowned as the sanctified of the Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-16.htm">Psalm 106:16</a>), and endowed with the power to exterminate the sin which clung to the holy offerings of the people on account of the unholiness of their nature, so that the gifts of the nation became well-pleasing to the Lord, and the good pleasure of God was manifested to the nation.<p>(Note: See my Archaeology i. pp. 183-4. The following are Calvin's admirable remarks: Oblationum sanctarum iniquitas tollenda et purganda fuit per sacerdotem. Frigidum est illud commentum, si quid erroris admissum est in ceremoniis, remissum fuisse sacerdotis precibus. Longius enim respicere nos oportet: ideo oblationum iniquitatem deleri a sacerdote, quia nulla oblatio, quatenus est hominis, omni vitio caret. Dictu hoc asperum est et fere &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, sanctitates ipsas esse immundas, ut venia indigeant; sed tenendum est, nihil esse sane purum, quod non aliquid labis a nobis contrahat.... Nihil Dei cultu praestantius: et tamen nihil offerre potuit populus, etiam a lege praescriptum, nisi intercedente venia, quam nonnisi per sacerdotem obtinuit.) </body></html>
