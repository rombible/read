The holy garments not only distinguished the priests from the people, but were emblems of that holy conduct which should ever be the glory and beauty, the mark of the ministers of religion, without which their persons and ministrations will be had in contempt. They also typified the glory of the Divine majesty, and the beauty of complete holiness, which rendered Jesus Christ the great High Priest. But our adorning under the gospel, is not to be of gold and costly array, but the garments of salvation, the robe of righteousness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/28.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>With the exception of the gold, the materials were the same as those of the tabernacle-cloth, the veil of the tabernacle and the entrance-curtain of the tent <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/26-1.htm">Exodus 26:1</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/26-31.htm">Exodus 26:31</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/26-36.htm">Exodus 26:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-4.htm">Exodus 25:4</a>.

But they are called "holy" simply because they were not worn on ordinary occasions, but assumed in the discharge of the sacred functions (Eze 44:19).<p>for glory and for beauty&#8212;It was a grand and sumptuous attire. In material, elaborate embroidery, and color, it had an imposing splendor. The tabernacle being adapted to the infantine aid of the church, it was right and necessary that the priests' garments should be of such superb and dazzling appearance, that the people might be inspired with a due respect for the ministers as well as the rites of religion. But they had also a further meaning; for being all made of linen, they were symbolical of the truth, purity, and other qualities in Christ that rendered Him such a high priest as became us.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/exodus/28.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/exodus/28.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And they shall take,....

It was supported by two ‘shoulder-pieces’ (Heb. <span class="ital">shoulders</span>), i.e. probably two broad flaps or straps passing, like braces, over the shoulders, and attached to the ephod in front and behind: on the top of each of these shoulder-straps was an onyx-stone, enclosed in a filigree setting of gold, and engraved with the names of six of the tribes of Israel. Round the body the ephod was further held in its place by a band woven in one piece with it, but perhaps of a different pattern, probably forming a border at its lower edge, and passing closely round the waist.
