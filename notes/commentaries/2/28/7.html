It was a short coat without sleeves, fastened close to the body with a girdle. The shoulder-pieces were buttoned together with precious stones set in gold, one on each shoulder, on which were engraven the names of the children of Israel. Thus Christ, our High Priest, presents his people before the Lord for a memorial. As Christ's coat had no seam, but was woven from the top throughout, so it was with the ephod. The golden bells on this ephod, by their preciousness and pleasant sound, well represent the good profession that the saints make, and the pomegranates the fruit they bring forth.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/28.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/39-4.htm">Exodus 39:4</a>. The ephod consisted of two principal pieces of cloth, one for the back and the other for the front, joined together by shoulder straps (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-27.htm">Exodus 28:27</a> note). Below the arms, probably just above the hips, the two pieces were kept in place by a band attached to one of the pieces. On the respect in which the ephod of the High priest was held, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-28.htm">1 Samuel 2:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-3.htm">1 Samuel 14:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/21-9.htm">1 Samuel 21:9</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-6.htm">1 Samuel 23:6-9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-7.htm">1 Samuel 30:7</a>. But an ephod made of linen appears to have been a recognized garment not only for the common priests <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-18.htm">1 Samuel 22:18</a>, but also for those who were even temporarily engaged in the service of the sanctuary <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-18.htm">1 Samuel 2:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-14.htm">2 Samuel 6:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-27.htm">1 Chronicles 15:27</a>.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/exodus/28.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6-14. ephod&#8212;It was a very gorgeous robe made of byssus, curiously embroidered, and dyed with variegated colors, and further enriched with golden tissue, the threads of gold being either originally interwoven or afterwards inserted by the embroiderer. It was short&#8212;reaching from the breast to a little below the loins&#8212;and though destitute of sleeves, retained its position by the support of straps thrown over each shoulder. These straps or braces, connecting the one with the back, the other with the front piece of which the tunic was composed, were united on the shoulder by two onyx stones, serving as buttons, and on which the names of the twelve tribes were engraved, and set in golden encasements. The symbolical design of this was, that the high priest, who bore the names along with him in all his ministrations before the Lord, might be kept in remembrance of his duty to plead their cause, and supplicate the accomplishment of the divine promises in their favor. The ephod was fastened by a girdle of the same costly materials, that is, dyed, embroidered, and wrought with threads of gold. It was about a handbreadth wide and wound twice round the upper part of the waist; it fastened in front, the ends hanging down at great length (Re 1:13).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/exodus/28.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The two shoulder-pieces</span> were two parts of the ephod going up from the body of the ephod, the one before, the other behind, which when the priest had put over his head, were tied together, and covered the priest’s shoulders, and part of his back and breast. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/exodus/28.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>It shall have the two shoulder pieces thereof,....

Appointment and Clothing of the Priests. - <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/28-1.htm">Exodus 28:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-5.htm">Exodus 28:5</a>. "Let Aaron thy brother draw near to thee from among the children of Israel, and his sons with him, that he may be a priest to Me." Moses is distinguished from the people as the mediator of the covenant. Hence he was to cause Aaron and his sons to come to him, i.e., to separate them from the people, and install them as priests, or perpetual mediators between Jehovah and His people. The primary meaning of cohen, the priest, has been retained in the Arabic, where it signifies administrator alieni negotii, viz., to act as a mediator for a person, or as his plenipotentiary, from which it came to be employed chiefly in connection with priestly acts. Among the heathen Arabs it is used "maxime de hariolis vatibusque;" by the Hebrews it was mostly applied to the priests of Jehovah; and there are only a few placed in which it is used in connection with the higher officers of state, who stood next to the king, and acted as it were as mediators between the king and the nation (thus <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-18.htm">2 Samuel 8:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-26.htm">2 Samuel 20:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-5.htm">1 Kings 4:5</a>). For the duties of their office the priests were to receive "holy garments for glory and for honour." Before they could draw near to Jehovah the Holy One (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-45.htm">Leviticus 11:45</a>), it was necessary that their unholiness should be covered over with holy clothes, which were to be made by men endowed with wisdom, whom Jehovah had filled with the spirit of wisdom. "Wise-hearted," i.e., gifted with understanding and judgment; the heart being regarded as the birth-place of the thoughts. In the Old Testament wisdom is constantly used for practical intelligence in the affairs of life; here, for example, it is equivalent to artistic skill surpassing man's natural ability, which is therefore described as being filled with the divine spirit of wisdom. These clothes were to be used "to sanctify him (Aaron and his sons), that he might be a priest to Jehovah." Sanctification, as the indispensable condition of priestly service, was not merely the removal of the uncleanness which flowed from sin, but, as it were, the transformation of the natural into the glory of the image of God. In this sense the holy clothing served the priest for glory and ornament. The different portions of the priest's state-dress mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-4.htm">Exodus 28:4</a> are described more fully afterwards. For making them, the skilled artists were to take the gold, the hyacinth, etc. The definite article is sued before gold and the following words, because the particular materials, which would be presented by the people, are here referred to. </body></html>
