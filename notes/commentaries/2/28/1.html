He had been, from the time that Egypt was quitted, the one and only intermediary between God and the people—the one and only priest of the nation. Now this was to be changed. Perhaps in consequence of his original reluctance and want of faith (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-11.htm" title="And Moses said to God, Who am I, that I should go to Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?">Exodus 3:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/4-10.htm" title="And Moses said to the LORD, O my LORD, I am not eloquent, neither heretofore, nor since you have spoken to your servant: but I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue.">Exodus 4:10-13</a>), perhaps on account of Aaron’s elder birth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-7.htm" title="And Moses was fourscore years old, and Aaron fourscore and three years old, when they spoke to Pharaoh.">Exodus 7:7</a>), it pleased God to commit the office of ministering to Him in the tabernacle, not to Moses and his descendants, but to Aaron and those sprung from his loins. In this way Aaron and his sons were <span class= "ital">“</span>drawn near” to Moses in respect of rank, position, and dignity.<p><span class= "bld">That he may minister to me in the priest’s office.</span>—Or, “that he may be priest to me.” The actual investiture of Aaron with the priestly office did not take place until some time after the tabernacle was completed. It is related in Leviticus 8; and his first priestly acts are recorded in the following chapter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/9-8.htm" title="Aaron therefore went to the altar, and slew the calf of the sin offering, which was for himself.">Leviticus 9:8-22</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Nadab and Abihu.</span>—On Nadab and Abihu, the two eldest sons of Aaron, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-23.htm" title="And Aaron took him Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab, sister of Naashon, to wife; and she bore him Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.">Exodus 6:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-1.htm" title="And he said to Moses, Come up to the LORD, you, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel; and worship you afar off.">Exodus 24:1</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Eleazar and Ithamar.</span>—The priestly office was, in fact, continued in the families of these two. Eleazar became high priest at the death of Aaron (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-28.htm" title="And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them on Eleazar his son; and Aaron died there in the top of the mount: and Moses and Eleazar came down from the mount.">Numbers 20:28</a>), and was succeeded by his son Phinehas, whom we find high priest in the time of Joshua (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/22-13.htm" title="And the children of Israel sent to the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, into the land of Gilead, Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest,">Joshua 22:13</a>) and afterwards (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-28.htm" title="And Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before it in those days,) saying, Shall I yet again go out to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother, or shall I cease? And the LORD said, Go up; for to morrow I will deliver them into your hand.">Judges 20:28</a>). At a later date, but under what circumstances is unknown, the high priesthood passed to the line of Ithamar, to which Eli belonged.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/exodus/28.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-1.htm" title="And take you to you Aaron your brother, and his sons with him, from among the children of Israel, that he may minister to me in the priest's office, even Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar, Aaron's sons.">Exodus 28:1</a></span>. <span class="ital">Aaron and his sons — </span>Hitherto every master of a family was priest to his own family. But now, as the families of Israel began to be incorporated into a nation, and a <span class="ital">tabernacle of the congregation </span>was to be erected, as a visible centre of their unity, it was requisite there should be a public priesthood instituted. Moses, who had hitherto officiated, and is therefore reckoned among the <span class="ital">priests of the Lord, </span>(<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/99-6.htm" title="Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among them that call on his name; they called on the LORD, and he answered them.">Psalm 99:6</a>,) had enough to do as their prophet, to consult the oracle for them, and as their prince, to judge among them. Nor was he desirous to engross all the honours to himself, or to entail that of the priesthood, which alone was <span class="ital">hereditary, </span>upon his own family; but was very well pleased to see his brother Aaron invested with this office, and his sons after him; while (how great soever he himself was) his sons after him would be but common Levites. It is an instance of the humility of that great man, and an evidence of his sincere regard to the glory of God, that he had so little regard to the preferment of his own family. Aaron, that had humbly served as a prophet to his younger brother Moses, and did not decline the office, is now advanced to be a priest to God. God had said to Israel in general, that they should be to him a <span class="ital">kingdom of priests; </span>but because it was requisite that those who ministered at the altar should give themselves wholly to the service of God, he had chosen from among them one to be a <span class="ital">family of priests, </span>the father and his four sons; and from Aaron’s loins descended all the priests of the Jewish Church, whom we read of both in the Old Testament and in the New.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/28.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>28:1-5 Hitherto the heads of families were the priests, and offered sacrifices; but now this office was confined to the family of Aaron only; and so continued till the gospel dispensation. The holy garments not only distinguished the priests from the people, but were emblems of that holy conduct which should ever be the glory and beauty, the mark of the ministers of religion, without which their persons and ministrations will be had in contempt. They also typified the glory of the Divine majesty, and the beauty of complete holiness, which rendered Jesus Christ the great High Priest. But our adorning under the gospel, is not to be of gold and costly array, but the garments of salvation, the robe of righteousness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/28.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>(Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/39-1.htm">Exodus 39:1-31</a>.) Moses is now commanded to commit all that pertains to the offerings made to the Lord in the sanctuary to the exclusive charge of the members of a single family, who were to hold their office from generation to generation. In the patriarchal times, the external rites of worship had generally been conducted by the head of the tribe or family, in accordance with the principle involved in the dedication of the firstborn <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-2.htm">Exodus 13:2</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/3-12.htm">Numbers 3:12-13</a>. Moses, as the divinely-appointed and acknowledged leader of the nation, had, on a special occasion, appointed those who were to offer sacrifice, and had himself sprinkled the consecrating blood of the victims on the people <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/24-5.htm">Exodus 24:5-6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-8.htm">Exodus 24:8</a>. On the completion of the tabernacle, after Aaron and his sons had been called to the priesthood, he took chief part in the daily service of the sanctuary <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/40-23.htm">Exodus 40:23-29</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/40-31.htm">Exodus 40:31-32</a> until the consecration of the family of Aaron, on which occasion he appears to have exercised the priest's office for the last time (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-14.htm">Leviticus 8:14-29</a>; compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/29-10.htm">Exodus 29:10-26</a>). The setting apart of the whole tribe of Levi for the entire cycle of religious services is mentioned <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/3-5.htm">Numbers 3:5-13</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/8-5.htm">Numbers 8:5-26</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/18-1.htm">Numbers 18:1-32</a>.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-1.htm">Exodus 28:1</a><p>Nadab and Abihu, the two older sons of Aaron, had accompanied their father and the seventy Elders when they went a part of the way with Moses up the mountain <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/24-1.htm">Exodus 24:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-9.htm">Exodus 24:9</a>. Soon after their consecration they were destroyed for offering "strange fire before the Lord" <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-1.htm">Leviticus 10:1-2</a>. Eleazar and Ithamar are here mentioned for the first time, except in the genealogy, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-23.htm">Exodus 6:23</a>.

It is hinted in the latter part of the preceding chapter, that Aaron and his sons should minister in the sanctuary, and look after the candlestick, and its lamps; and here the design of God concerning them is more fully opened, which was, that they should be his peculiar ministers and servants in his house, to do all the business appertaining to it: <p>even Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar, Aaron's sons: who were all the sons that Aaron had that we read of; though Aben Ezra thinks it probable that he might have other sons, and therefore the names of those are particularly mentioned, who were to be taken into the priest's office with him; the two first of these died very quickly after this, in a very awful manner, as the sacred story relates; and from the other two sprung all the priests that were in all successive generations. <p>(n) "appropinquare fac", Pagninus, Montanus, Vatablus. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/exodus/28.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And take thou unto thee Aaron thy brother, and his sons with him, from among the children of Israel, that he may minister unto me in the priest's office, even Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar, Aaron's sons.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/exodus/28.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">1</span>. <span class="ital">And</span> <span class="bld">thou</span>, <span class="ital">bring thou near</span>, &c.] as <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/27-20.htm" title="And you shall command the children of Israel, that they bring you pure oil olive beaten for the light, to cause the lamp to burn always.">Exodus 27:20</a>. <span class="ital">hikrib</span> (‘bring near’) has here the special, sacred sense of <span class="ital">present</span>, or, of a sacrifice, <span class="ital">offer</span>, as very often in P; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/29-3.htm" title="And you shall put them into one basket, and bring them in the basket, with the bullock and the two rams....">Exodus 29:3-4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-8.htm" title="And you shall bring his sons, and put coats on them.">Exodus 29:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-10.htm" title="And you shall cause a bullock to be brought before the tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands on the head of the bullock.">Exodus 29:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-12.htm" title="And you shall bring Aaron and his sons to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and wash them with water.">Exodus 40:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-14.htm" title="And you shall bring his sons, and clothe them with coats:">Exodus 40:14</a>; and <span class="ital">DB.</span> iii. 587b.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and his sons with him</span>] the addition of ‘with him,’ as often in P: <span class="ital">v.</span> 41, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-21.htm" title="And you shall take of the blood that is on the altar, and of the anointing oil, and sprinkle it on Aaron, and on his garments, and on his sons, and on the garments of his sons with him: and he shall be hallowed, and his garments, and his sons, and his sons' garments with him.">Exodus 29:21</a> (twice), <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-18.htm" title="But with you will I establish my covenant; and you shall come into the ark, you, and your sons, and your wife, and your sons' wives with you.">Genesis 6:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/7-7.htm" title="And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.">Genesis 7:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/7-13.htm" title="In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark;">Genesis 7:13</a> &c.

The special object of the present chapter is to prescribe the form, materials, colour, etc., of the holy garments - or the attire of those who were to minister in the tabernacle at the time of their ministration. As the service of the tabernacle was about to be committed to Aaron and his sons, their selection for this office is mentioned in verse 1, and their investiture and consecration briefly touched in verse 41. Otherwise the whole chapter is concerned with the attire That of Aaron is first prescribed (vers. 4-39). It consists of an ephod (vers. 6-12); a breastplate (vers. 13-30); a robe (vers. 31-35); a mitre (vers 36-38); a coat, or tunic; and a girdle (ver. 39). The dress of his sons follows. It comprises drawers (ver. 42), tunics, girdles, and caps or turbans (ver. 40). Incidentally it is mentioned in verse 43, that drawers are also to be worn by Aaron; and, in conclusion, the neglect of this ordinance in the case of either Aaron or his sons is forbidden under penalty of death <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Take thou unto thee</span>. Literally, "Make to draw near to thee." Moses had hitherto been of all the people the one nearest to God, <span class="accented">the</span> medium of communication. He was now to abdicate a portion of his functions, transferring them to his brother and his brother's sons. By this act he would draw them nearer to him than they were before. It is worthy of remark that he makes no remonstrance or opposition, but carries out God's will in this matter as readily and  willingly as in all others. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-4.htm">Leviticus 8:4-30</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">From among the children of Israel</span>. The LXX. reads "And from among the children of Israel," as if others besides the family of Aaron had been admitted to the priesthood. But this is contrary to the entire tenor of the later narrative. The existing Hebrew text is correct. <span class="cmt_word">Nadab and Abihu</span>, and again, <span class="cmt_word">Eleazar and Ithamar</span>, are always coupled together in the Pentateuch (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-1.htm">Exodus 24:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-1.htm">Leviticus 10:1, 12</a>; etc.), while a marked division is made between the two pairs of brothers. It is probably the sin and early death of the two elder (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-1.htm">Leviticus 10:1-2</a>) that causes the separation. Of Ithamar after the death of his brothers, nothing is known. Eleazar became high priest (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/34-17.htm">Numbers 34:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/14-1.htm">Joshua 14:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/17-4.htm">Joshua 17:4</a>; etc.). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/exodus/27.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"As for the breadth of the court on the west side, (there shall be) curtains fifty cubits; their pillars twenty; and the breadth of the court towards the front, on the east side, fifty cubits." The front is divided in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/27-14.htm">Exodus 27:14-16</a> into two &#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1507;, lit., shoulders, i.e., sides or side-pieces, each consisting of 15 cubits of hangings and three pillars with their sockets, and a doorway (&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512;), naturally in the middle, which was covered by a curtain (&#1502;&#1505;&#1498;) formed of the same material as the covering at the entrance to the dwelling, of 20 cubits in length, with four pillars and the same number of sockets. The pillars were therefore equidistant from one another, viz., 5 cubits apart. Their total number was 60 (not 56), which was the number required, at the distance mentioned, to surround a quadrangular space of 100 cubits long and 50 cubits broad.<p>(Note: Although any one may easily convince himself of the correctness of these numbers by drawing a figure, Knobel has revived Philo's erroneous statement about 56 pillars and the double reckoning of the pillars in the corner. And the statement in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/27-14.htm">Exodus 27:14-16</a>, that three pillars were to be made in front to carry the hangings on either side of the door, and four to carry the curtain which covered the entrance, may be easily shown to be correct, notwithstanding the fact that, as every drawing shows, four pillars would be required, and not three only, to carry 15 cubits of hangings, and five (not four) to carry a curtain 20 cubits broad, if the pillars were to be placed 5 cubits apart; for the corner pillars, as belonging to both sides, and the pillars which stood between the hangings and the curtain on either side, could only be reckoned as halves in connection with each side or each post; and in reckoning the number of pillars according to the method adopted in every other case, the pillar from which you start would not be reckoned at all. Now, if you count the pillars of the eastern side upon this principle (starting from a corner pillar, which is not reckoned, because it is the starting-point and is the last pillar of the side wall), you have 1, 2, 3, then 1, 2, 3, 4, and then again 1, 2, 3; that is to say, 3 pillars for each wing and 4 for the curtain, although the hangings of each wing would really be supported by 4 pillars, and the curtain in the middle by 5.) </body></html>
