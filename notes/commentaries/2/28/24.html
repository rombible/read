The name of each tribe was graven in a precious stone, fixed in the breastplate, to signify how precious, in God's sight, believers are, and how honourable. How small and poor soever the tribe was, it was as a precious stone in the breastplate of the high priest; thus are all the saints dear to Christ, however men esteem them. The high priest had the names of the tribes, both on his shoulders and on his breast, which reminds us of the power and the love with which our Lord Jesus pleads for those that are his. He not only bears them up in his arms with almighty strength, but he carries them in his bosom with tender affection. What comfort is this to us in all our addresses to God! The Urim and Thummim, by which the will of God was made known in doubtful cases, were put in this breastplate. Urim and Thummim signify light and integrity. There are many conjectures what these were; the most probable opinion seems to be, that they were the twelve precious stones in the high priest's breastplate. Now, Christ is our Oracle. By him God, in these last days, makes known himself and his mind to us, Heb 1:1,2; Joh 1:18. He is the true Light, the faithful Witness, the Truth itself, and from him we receive the Spirit of Truth, who leads into all truth.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/28.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>On the two ends of the breastplate - The extremities spoken of here, and in the next verse, must have been the upper corners of the square.

There were twelve different stones, containing each the name of a tribe, and arranged in four rows, three in each. The Israelites had acquired a knowledge of the lapidary's art in Egypt, and the amount of their skill in cutting, polishing, and setting precious stones, may be judged of by the diamond forming one of the engraved ornaments on this breastplate. A ring was attached to each corner, through which the golden chains were passed to fasten this brilliant piece of jewelry at the top and bottom tightly on the breast of the ephod.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/exodus/28.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/exodus/28.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And thou shalt put two wreathen chains of gold in the two rings,....

The stones, so far as their names can be determined with the help of the ancient versions, the researches of L. de Dieu (animadv. ad <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/28.htm">Exodus 28</a>) and Braun (vestit. ii. c. 8-10), and other sources pointed out in Winer's R.

In the third row, lesehm, &#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, lugurius, i.e., according to Braun and others, a kind of hyacinth, a transparent stone chiefly of an orange colour, but running sometimes into a reddish brown, at other times into a brownish or pale red, and sometimes into an approach to a pistachio green; shevo, &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;, a composite stone formed of quartz, chalcedony, cornelian, flint, jasper, etc., and therefore glittering with different colours; and achlaham, &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, amethyst, a stone for the most part of a violet colour.
