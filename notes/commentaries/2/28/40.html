If we appear not before God in that, we shall bear our iniquity, and die. Blessed is he, therefore, that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, Re 16:15. And blessed be God that we have a High Priest, appointed of God, and set apart for his work; furnished for his high office by the glory of his Divine majesty, and the beauty of perfect holiness. Happy are we, if by the law spiritually understood, we see that such a High Priest became us; that we cannot draw near to a holy God, or be accepted, but by him. There is no light, no wisdom, no perfection, but from him; no glory, no beauty, but in being like unto him. Let us take encouragement from the power, love, and compassion of our High Priest, to draw near with boldness to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/28.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Bonnets - Caps of a simple construction which seem to have been cup-shaped.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/exodus/28.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>40. bonnets&#8212;turbans.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/exodus/28.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The <span class="bld">coats</span> were not of woollen, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-17.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, that when they enter in at the gates of the inner court, they shall be clothed with linen garments; and no wool shall come on them, whiles they minister in the gates of the inner court, and within.">Ezekiel 44:17</a></span>, but of linen, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/39-27.htm" title="And they made coats of fine linen of woven work for Aaron, and for his sons,">Exodus 39:27</a></span>.

The chapter concludes with brief directions concerning the official attire of the ordinary priests. This was to consist of linen drawers like those of the high priest; of a tunic, also of linen (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/39-27.htm">Exodus 39:27</a>), shaped like his, but not diapered; of a linen girdle, the exact character of which is not stated; and of a close-fitting cap. The entire dress, with perhaps the exception of the girdle, was white. The linen drawers were regarded as of primary necessity, and the priest who did not wear them was threatened with death. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 40.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For Aaron's sons</span>. His actual sons at this time - his descendants afterwards, to whom the priesthood was rigidly confined. <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt make coats</span>. The verb is different from that used in ver 39, and seems to imply that the priests' tunics were not to be patterned. <span class="cmt_word">Girdles</span>. It has generally been supposed that these were of the same material and workmanship as the high priest's; but this is nowhere stated. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/39-29.htm">Exodus 39:29</a>, the high priest's girdle alone is spoken cf. <span class="cmt_word">Bonnets</span>. Certainly not "bonnets "in the modern sense. Plain, close-fitting caps, shaped like a cup, or rather basin, seem to be meant. Such caps were often worn in Egypt, but not by the priests. <span class="cmt_word">For glory and for beauty</span>. See above, ver. 2. It is very noticeable, that the extremely simple attire of the ordinary priests - a dress of pure white, without anything ornamental about it, unless it were the girdle - is still regarded as sufficient "for glory and for beauty." White robes have certainly a vast amount of scriptural testimony in their favour (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-4.htm">Leviticus 16:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/9-3.htm">Mark 9:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-12.htm">John 20:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-10.htm">Acts 1:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-4.htm">Revelation 4:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-11.htm">Revelation 6:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9, 14</a>, etc.). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/exodus/28.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>On the lower hem (&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; the tail or skirt) there were to be pomegranates of dark-blue and dark-red purple and crimson, made of twisted yarn of these colours (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/39-24.htm">Exodus 39:24</a>), and little golden bells between them round about, a bell and a pomegranate occurring alternately all round. According to Rashi the pomegranates were "globi quidam rotundi instar malorum punicorum, quasi essent ova gallinarum." &#1508;&#1468;&#1506;&#1502;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; (from &#1508;&#1468;&#1506;&#1501; to strike of knock, like the old High German cloccon, clochon, i.e., to smite) signifies a little bell, not a spherical ball.</body></html>
