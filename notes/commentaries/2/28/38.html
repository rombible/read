These would always have some “iniquity” attaching to them, some imperfection, owing to the imperfection of human nature and the mixed character of human motives. The high priest’s official holiness enabled him to present to God offerings thus imperfect without offending Him. It was accepted as purging the offerings from their impurity.<p><span class= "bld">It shall be always upon his forehead</span>—that is to say, during his ministrations.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/exodus/28.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-38.htm" title="And it shall be on Aaron's forehead, that Aaron may bear the iniquity of the holy things, which the children of Israel shall hallow in all their holy gifts; and it shall be always on his forehead, that they may be accepted before the LORD.">Exodus 28:38</a></span>. Aaron must have this upon his <span class="ital">forehead, </span>that he may <span class="ital">bear the iniquity of the holy things, </span>and that <span class="ital">they may be accepted before the Lord — </span>Herein he was a type of Christ, the great Mediator between God and man. Through him, what is amiss in our services, is pardoned: even this would be our ruin, if God should enter into judgment with us: but Christ, our High-Priest, bears this iniquity; bears it <span class="ital">for us, </span>so as to bear it <span class="ital">from us</span>. Through him, likewise, what is good is accepted; our persons, our performances, are pleasing to God upon the account of Christ’s intercession, and not otherwise. His being <span class="ital">holiness to the Lord, </span>recommends all those to the divine favour that believe in him.

Aaron must minister in the garments appointed. We must serve the Lord with holy fear, as those who know they deserve to die. A golden plate was fixed on Aaron's forehead, engraven with Holiness to the Lord. Aaron was hereby reminded that God is holy, and that his priests must be holy, devoted to the Lord. This must appear in their forehead, in open profession of their relation to God. It must be engraven like the engravings of a signet; deep and durable; not painted so as to be washed off, but firm and lasting; such must our holiness to the Lord be. Christ is our High Priest; through him sins are forgiven to us, and not laid to our charge. Our persons, our doings, are pleasing to God upon the account of Christ, and not otherwise.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/28.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Bear the iniquity of the holy things - The Hebrew expression "to bear iniquity" is applied either to one who suffers the penalty of sin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-43.htm">Exodus 28:43</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-1.htm">Leviticus 5:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-17.htm">Leviticus 5:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/17-16.htm">Leviticus 17:16</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-41.htm">Leviticus 26:41</a>, etc.), or to one who takes away the sin of others (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/50-17.htm">Genesis 50:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-17.htm">Leviticus 10:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-22.htm">Leviticus 16:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/30-15.htm">Numbers 30:15</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-25.htm">1 Samuel 15:25</a>, etc.).

It belonged to the high priest, as the chief atoning mediator between Yahweh and His people (see the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-36.htm">Exodus 28:36</a>), to atone for the holy things that they might be "accepted before the Lord" (compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-15.htm">Leviticus 8:15</a>, note; <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-20.htm">Leviticus 16:20</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-33.htm">Leviticus 16:33</a>, note): but the common priests also, in their proper functions, had to take their part in making atonement (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-20.htm">Leviticus 4:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-10.htm">Leviticus 5:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-17.htm">Leviticus 10:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/22-16.htm">Leviticus 22:16</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/18-23.htm">Numbers 18:23</a>, etc.).<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/exodus/28.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>37. mitre&#8212;crown-like cap for the head, not covering the entire head, but adhering closely to it, composed of fine linen.

That is, the plate of gold, with the inscription on it, holiness to the Lord, and so was very visible and legible. The Targum of Jonathan adds, from temple to temple, that is, from the furthermost end of the one, to the furthermost end of the other, the same as from ear to ear; see Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-36.htm">Exodus 28:36</a> the use of it follows: <p>that Aaron may bear the iniquity of the holy things, which the children of Israel shall hallow in all their holy gifts; this supposes that the sacrifices of the children of Israel, which they brought to the priests to offer for them, or the gifts they devoted to sacred use, might be attended with sin and blame, either in the matter of their offerings and gifts, or in the manner in which they brought them; and which through the high priest having this plate of gold, with the above inscription on it, were expiated; they were bore away from them, and were not placed to their account, but they were cleared and discharged of them: and so it is that there is sin in the best performances of the saints; there is not a just man that does good, but he sins in doing that good; the best righteousness of men is imperfect, and attended with sin; and this cannot be borne, or taken away by themselves; if God should mark such sins as these, they could not stand before him; now Christ, their High Priest, bears and takes away these, along with all others, which are laid upon him, and borne by him: <p>and it shall be always upon his forehead, that they may be accepted before the Lord; not that he had always this plate of gold on his forehead, only in time of service; but then it was continually for the acceptance of them, though it was not upon his forehead, as Jarchi observes; at Maimonides (h) says, there was great necessity that the high priest should be always in the sanctuary, as it is said, "it shall be always upon his forehead", and therefore must be always there, for he might not wear it outside of it. This with respect to the antitype may signify, that the persons and services of the people of God are accepted with him through the holiness and righteousness of Christ, who is always in the presence of the Lord, ever appears in heaven for them, and is the Lamb of God, to whose person, blood, righteousness, and sacrifice, they are directed to look for the removal of their sins of every sort. <p>(h) Moreh Nevochim, par. 3. c. 47. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/exodus/28.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And it shall be upon Aaron's forehead, that Aaron may <span class="cverse3">{p}</span> bear the iniquity of the holy things, which the children of Israel shall hallow in all their holy gifts; and it shall be always upon his forehead, that they may be accepted before the LORD.</span><p>(p) Their offerings could not be so perfect, but some fault would be in them: which sin the high priest bore and pacified God.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/exodus/28.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">38</span>. <span class="ital">bear the iniquity</span>, &c.] i.e. take upon himself the guilt of any ritual error or mistake made accidentally in offering the holy things; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/22-16.htm" title="Or suffer them to bear the iniquity of trespass, when they eat their holy things: for I the LORD do sanctify them.">Leviticus 22:16</a>.

Imperfection attaches to everything that man does; and even the sacrifices that the people offered to God required to be atoned for and purified. It was granted to the high priest in his official capacity to make the necessary atonement, and so render the people's gifts acceptable. For this purpose he was invested with an official holiness, proclaimed by the inscription upon the plate, which exhibited him as the type and representative of that perfectly Holy One, through whom alone can any real atonement be made to the Father. <span class="cmt_word">It shall be always upon his forehead</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, whenever he ministers. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 28:39 <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/exodus/28.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"And the opening of the head thereof shall be in the middle of it;" i.e., there was to be an opening in the middle of it to put the head through when it was put on; - "a hem shall be round the opening of it, weavers' work, like the opening of the habergeon shall it (the seam) be to it; it shall not be torn." By the habergeon (&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3be;), or coat-of-mail, we have to understand the linothoo'reex, the linen coat, such as was worn by Ajax for example (Il. 2, 529). Linen habergeons of this kind were made in Egypt in a highly artistic style (see Hengstenberg, Egypt, etc., pp. 141-2). In order that the mel might not be torn when it was put on, the opening for the head was to be made with a strong hem, which was to be of weavers' work; from which it follows as a matter of course that the robe was woven in one piece, and not made in several pieces and then sewed together; and this is expressly stated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/39-22.htm">Exodus 39:22</a>.
