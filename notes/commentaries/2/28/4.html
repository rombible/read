The most conspicuous was the breastplate, described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/28-13.htm" title="And you shall make ouches of gold;">Exodus 28:13-30</a>, and here mentioned first of all. Next to this came the peculiar vestment called the “ephod,” a sort of jerkin or waistcoat, upon which the breastplate was worn (described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/28-6.htm" title="And they shall make the ephod of gold, of blue, and of purple, of scarlet, and fine twined linen, with cunning work.">Exodus 28:6-12</a>). Under the ephod was the long robe of blue, called “the robe of the ephod,” which may be considered as the main garment, and which is described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/28-31.htm" title="And you shall make the robe of the ephod all of blue.">Exodus 28:31-35</a>. Upon his head the high priest wore a “mitre” or turban (described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/28-36.htm" title="And you shall make a plate of pure gold, and grave on it, like the engravings of a signet, HOLINESS TO THE LORD.">Exodus 28:36-38</a>); and inside his “robe” he wore a linen shirt or tunic, secured by a girdle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-39.htm" title="And you shall embroider the coat of fine linen, and you shall make the turban of fine linen, and you shall make the girdle of needlework.">Exodus 28:39</a>). Underneath the tunic he wore linen drawers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/28-42.htm" title="And you shall make them linen breeches to cover their nakedness; from the loins even to the thighs they shall reach:">Exodus 28:42-43</a>). Nothing is said as to any covering for his feet; but it is probable that they were protected by sandals.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/28.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>28:1-5 Hitherto the heads of families were the priests, and offered sacrifices; but now this office was confined to the family of Aaron only; and so continued till the gospel dispensation. The holy garments not only distinguished the priests from the people, but were emblems of that holy conduct which should ever be the glory and beauty, the mark of the ministers of religion, without which their persons and ministrations will be had in contempt. They also typified the glory of the Divine majesty, and the beauty of complete holiness, which rendered Jesus Christ the great High Priest. But our adorning under the gospel, is not to be of gold and costly array, but the garments of salvation, the robe of righteousness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/28.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The spirit of wisdom - See <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/31-3.htm">Exodus 31:3</a> note.

But they are called "holy" simply because they were not worn on ordinary occasions, but assumed in the discharge of the sacred functions (Eze 44:19).<p>for glory and for beauty&#8212;It was a grand and sumptuous attire. In material, elaborate embroidery, and color, it had an imposing splendor. The tabernacle being adapted to the infantine aid of the church, it was right and necessary that the priests' garments should be of such superb and dazzling appearance, that the people might be inspired with a due respect for the ministers as well as the rites of religion. But they had also a further meaning; for being all made of linen, they were symbolical of the truth, purity, and other qualities in Christ that rendered Him such a high priest as became us.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/exodus/28.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">An ephod</span> was a short upper garment, made without sleeves, which was girt about the body.

The vessels of the dwelling are not the things required for the performance of worship, but the tools used in setting up the tabernacle and taking it down again.<p>If we inquire still further into the design and meaning of the court, the erection of a court surrounding the dwelling on all four sides is to be traced to the same circumstance as that which rendered it necessary to divide the dwelling itself into two parts, viz., to the fact, that on account of the unholiness of the nation, it could not come directly into the presence of Jehovah, until the sin which separates unholy man from the holy God had been atoned for. Although, by virtue of their election as the children of Jehovah, or their adoption as the nation of God, it was intended that the Israelites should be received by the Lord into His house, and dwell as a son in his father's house; yet under the economy of the law, which only produced the knowledge of sin, uncleanness, and unholiness, their fellowship with Jehovah, the Holy One, could only be sustained through mediators appointed and sanctified by God: viz., at the institution of the covenant, through His servant Moses; and during the existence of this covenant, through the chosen priests of the family of Aaron. It was through them that the Lord was to be approached, and the nation to be brought near to Him. Every day, therefore, they entered the holy place of the dwelling, to offer to the Lord the sacrifices of prayer and the fruits of the people's earthly vocation. But even they were not allowed to go into the immediate presence of the holy God. The most holy place, where God was enthroned, was hidden from them by the curtain, and only once a year was the high priest permitted, as the head of the whole congregation, which was called to be the holy nation of God, to lift this curtain and appear before God with the atoning blood of the sacrifice and the cloud of incense (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/16.htm">Leviticus 16</a>). The access of the nation to its God was restricted to the court. There it could receive from the Lord, through the medium of the sacrifices which it offered upon the altar of burnt-offering, the expiation of its sins, His grace and blessing, and strength to live anew. Whilst the dwelling itself represented the house of God, the dwelling-place of Jehovah in the midst of His people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-19.htm">Exodus 23:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/6-24.htm">Joshua 6:24</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-7.htm">1 Samuel 1:7</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-24.htm">1 Samuel 1:24</a>, etc.), the palace of the God-King, in which the priestly nation drew near to Him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-9.htm">1 Samuel 1:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-3.htm">1 Samuel 3:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/5-8.htm">Psalm 5:8</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/26-4.htm">Psalm 26:4</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/26-6.htm">Psalm 26:6</a>); the court which surrounded the dwelling represented the kingdom of the God-King, the covenant land or dwelling-place of Israel in the kingdom of its God. In accordance with this purpose, the court was in the form of an oblong, to exhibit its character as part of the kingdom of God. But its pillars and hangings were only five cubits high, i.e., half the height of the dwelling, to set forth the character of incompleteness, or of the threshold to the sanctuary of God. All its vessels were of copper-brass, which, being allied to the earth in both colour and material, was a symbolical representation of the earthly side of the kingdom of God; whereas the silver of the capitals of the pillars, and of the hooks and rods which sustained the hangings, as well as the white colour of the byssus-hangings, might point to the holiness of this site for the kingdom of God. On the other hand, in the gilding of the capitals of the pillars at the entrance to the dwelling, and the brass of their sockets, we find gold and silver combined, to set forth the union of the court with the sanctuary, i.e., the union of the dwelling-place of Israel with the dwelling-place of its God, which is realized in the kingdom of God.<p>The design and significance of the court culminated in the altar of burnt-offering, the principal object in the court; and upon this the burnt-offerings and slain-offerings, in which the covenant nation consecrated itself as a possession to its God, were burnt. The heart of this altar was of earth or unhewn stones, having the character of earth, not only on account of its being appointed as the place of sacrifice and as the hearth for the offerings, but because the earth itself formed the real or material sphere for the kingdom of God in the Old Testament stage of its development. This heart of earth was elevated by the square copper covering into a vessel of the sanctuary, a place where Jehovah would record His name, and come to Israel and bless them (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/20-24.htm">Exodus 20:24</a>, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/29-42.htm">Exodus 29:42</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-44.htm">Exodus 29:44</a>), and was consecrated as a place of sacrifice, by means of which Israel could raise itself to the Lord, and ascend to Him in the sacrifice. And this significance of the altar culminated in its horns, upon which the blood of the sin-offering was smeared. Just as, in the case of the horned animals, their strength and beauty are concentrated in the horns, and the horn has become in consequence a symbol of strength, or of fulness of vital energy; so the significance of the altar as a place of the saving and life-giving power of God, which the Lord bestows upon His people in His kingdom, was concentrated in the horns of the altar. </body></html>
