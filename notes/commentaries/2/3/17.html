God, who, by his grace, inclines the heart, and opens the ear, could say beforehand, They shall hearken to thy voice; for he would make them willing in this day of power. As to Pharaoh, Moses is here told that petitions and persuasions, and humble complaints, would not prevail with him; nor a mighty hand stretched out in signs and wonders. But those will certainly be broken by the power of God's hand, who will not bow to the power of his word. Pharaoh's people should furnish Israel with riches at their departure. In Pharaoh's tyranny and Israel's oppression, we see the miserable, abject state of sinners. However galling the yoke, they drudge on till the Lord sends redemption. With the invitations of the gospel, God sends the teaching of his Spirit. Thus are men made willing to seek and to strive for deliverance. Satan loses his power to hold them, they come forth with all they have and are, and apply all to the glory of God and the service of his church.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Lord God ... - Better, Jehovah &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; yehova&#770;h, God of your fathers, God of Abraham, God of Isaac, and God of Jacob.

Come now therefore, and I will send thee&#8212;Considering the patriotic views that had formerly animated the breast of Moses, we might have anticipated that no mission could have been more welcome to his heart than to be employed in the national emancipation of Israel.

So regularly (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/1-10.htm" title="Come on, let us deal wisely with them; lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there falls out any war, they join also to our enemies, and fight against us, and so get them up out of the land.">Exodus 1:10</a>).<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/exodus/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>To the divine commission Moses made this reply: "Who am I, that I should go to Pharaoh, and bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?" Some time before he had offered himself of his own accord as a deliverer and judge; but now he had learned humility in the school of Midian, and was filled in consequence with distrust of his own power and fitness. The son of Pharaoh's daughter had become a shepherd, and felt himself too weak to go to Pharaoh. But God met this distrust by the promise, "I will be with thee," which He confirmed by a sign, namely, that when Israel was brought out of Egypt, they should serve (&#1506;&#1489;&#1491;, i.e., worship) God upon that mountain. This sign, which was to be a pledge to Moses of the success of his mission, was one indeed that required faith itself; but, at the same time, it was a sign adapted to inspire both courage and confidence. God pointed out to him the success of his mission, the certain result of his leading the people out: Israel should serve Him upon the very same mountain in which He had appeared to Moses. As surely as Jehovah had appeared to Moses as the God of his fathers, so surely should Israel serve Him there. The reality of the appearance of God formed the pledge of His announcement, that Israel would there serve its God; and this truth was to till Moses with confidence in the execution of the divine command. The expression "serve God" (&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837;, lxx) means something more than the immolare of the Vulgate, or the "sacrifice" of Luther; for even though sacrifice formed a leading element, or the most important part of the worship of the Israelites, the patriarchs before this had served Jehovah by calling upon His name as well as offering sacrifice. And the service of Israel at Mount Horeb consisted in their entering into covenant with Jehovah (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/24.htm">Exodus 24</a>); not only in their receiving the law as the covenant nation, but their manifesting obedience by presenting free-will offerings for the building of the tabernacle (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/36-1.htm">Exodus 36:1-7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/7-1.htm">Numbers 7:1</a>).<p>(Note: Kurtz follows the Lutheran rendering "sacrifice," and understands by it the first national sacrifice; and then, from the significance of the first, which included potentially all the rest, supposes the covenant sacrifice to be intended. But not only is the original text disregarded here, the fact is also overlooked, that Luther himself has translated &#1506;&#1489;&#1491; correctly, to "serve," in every other place. And it is not sufficient to say, that by the direction of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-18.htm">Exodus 3:18</a>) Moses first of all asked Pharaoh for permission merely to go a three days' journey into the wilderness to sacrifice to their God (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/5-1.htm">Exodus 5:1-3</a>), in consequence of which Pharaoh afterwards offered to allow them to sacrifice (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-3.htm">Exodus 8:3</a>) within the land, and at a still later period outside (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-21.htm">Exodus 8:21</a>.). For the fact that Pharaoh merely spoke of sacrificing may be explained on the ground that at first nothing more was asked. But this first demand arose from the desire on the part of God to make known His purposes concerning Israel only step by step, that it might be all the easier for the hard heart of the king to grant what was required. But even if Pharaoh understood nothing more by the expression "serve God" than the offering of sacrifice, this would not justify us in restricting the words which Jehovah addressed to Moses, "When thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain," to the first national offering, or to the covenant sacrifice.) </body></html>
