God, who, by his grace, inclines the heart, and opens the ear, could say beforehand, They shall hearken to thy voice; for he would make them willing in this day of power. As to Pharaoh, Moses is here told that petitions and persuasions, and humble complaints, would not prevail with him; nor a mighty hand stretched out in signs and wonders. But those will certainly be broken by the power of God's hand, who will not bow to the power of his word. Pharaoh's people should furnish Israel with riches at their departure. In Pharaoh's tyranny and Israel's oppression, we see the miserable, abject state of sinners. However galling the yoke, they drudge on till the Lord sends redemption. With the invitations of the gospel, God sends the teaching of his Spirit. Thus are men made willing to seek and to strive for deliverance. Satan loses his power to hold them, they come forth with all they have and are, and apply all to the glory of God and the service of his church.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>No, not - See the marginal rendering.

Come now therefore, and I will send thee&#8212;Considering the patriotic views that had formerly animated the breast of Moses, we might have anticipated that no mission could have been more welcome to his heart than to be employed in the national emancipation of Israel. But he evinced great reluctance to it and stated a variety of objections [Ex 3:11, 13; 4:1, 10] all of which were successfully met and removed&#8212;and the happy issue of his labors was minutely described.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/exodus/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/exodus/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And I will stretch out my hand,.... Or "therefore" (e) he would stretch out his mighty hand, exert his almighty power; and for this purpose was Pharaoh raised up, and his heart hardened, that God might show his power in him, and on him: <p>and smite Egypt with all my wonders, which I will do in the midst thereof: with those wondrous plagues, the amazing effects of his almighty power, which were wrought by him in the midst of Egypt, by which their land, their rivers, their persons, and their cattle, were smitten: <p>and after that he will let you go; this is said for their encouragement, that their faith and patience might hold out, who otherwise seeing him so obstinate and inflexible, might be ready to despair of ever succeeding. <p>(e) "ideo", "propterea", Noldius, p. 279. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/exodus/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And I will stretch out my hand, and smite Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in the midst thereof: and after that he will let you go.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/exodus/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">20</span>. <span class="ital">wonders</span>] <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-10.htm" title="And he said, Behold, I make a covenant: before all your people I will do marvels, such as have not been done in all the earth, nor in any nation: and all the people among which you are shall see the work of the LORD: for it is a terrible thing that I will do with you.">Exodus 34:10</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/3-5.htm" title="And Joshua said to the people, Sanctify yourselves: for to morrow the LORD will do wonders among you.">Joshua 3:5</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will stretch out my hand</span>. To encourage Moses and the people, to support them in what was, humanly speaking, a most unequal contest, this important promise is made. It is a confirmation, and to some extent, an explanation of the pledge, already, given, "Certainly I will be with thee" (ver. 12). It shows <span class="accented">how</span> God would be with him - <span class="cmt_word">he would smite Egypt with all his wonders</span> - what those would be was left obscure. He would come to his people's aid, and openly assert himself, and afflict and strike terror into their enemies-until at last even Pharaoh's stubborn spirit would be broken, and he would consent to <span class="cmt_word">let them go</span>. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/exodus/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When Moses had been thus emboldened by the assurance of divine assistance to undertake the mission, he inquired what he was to say, in case the people asked him for the name of the God of their fathers. The supposition that the people might ask the name of their fathers' God is not to be attributed to the fact, that as the Egyptians had separate names for their numerous deities, the Israelites also would want to know the name of their own God. For, apart from the circumstance that the name by which God had revealed Himself to the fathers cannot have vanished entirely from the memory of the people, and more especially of Moses, the mere knowledge of the name would not have been of much use to them. The question, "What is His name?" presupposed that the name expressed the nature and operations of God, and that God would manifest in deeds the nature expressed in His name. God therefore told him His name, or, to speak more correctly, He explained the name &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;, by which He had made Himself known to Abraham at the making of the covenant (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-7.htm">Genesis 15:7</a>), in this way, &#1488;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1488;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492;, "I am that I am," and designated Himself by this name as the absolute God of the fathers, acting with unfettered liberty and self-dependence. This name precluded any comparison between the God of the Israelites and the deities of the Egyptians and other nations, and furnished Moses and his people with strong consolation in their affliction, and a powerful support to their confidence in the realization of His purposes of salvation as made known to the fathers. To establish them in this confidence, God added still further: "This is My name for ever, and My memorial unto all generations;" that is to say, God would even manifest Himself in the nature expressed by the name Jehovah, and by this He would have all generations both know and revere Him. &#1513;&#1473;&#1501;, the name, expresses the objective manifestation of the divine nature; &#1494;&#1489;&#1512;, memorial, the subjective recognition of that nature on the part of men. &#1491;&#1468;&#1512; &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/17-16.htm">Exodus 17:16</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/27-24.htm">Proverbs 27:24</a>. The repetition of the same word suggests the idea of uninterrupted continuance and boundless duration (Ewald, 313a).
