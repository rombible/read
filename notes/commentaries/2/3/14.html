But perhaps it is rather a deep and mysterious statement of His nature. “I am that which I am.” My nature, i.e., cannot be declared in words, cannot be conceived of by human thought. I exist in such sort that my whole inscrutable nature is implied in my existence. I exist, as nothing else does—necessarily, eternally, really. If I am to give myself a name expressive of my nature, so far as language can be, let me be called “I AM.”<p><span class= "bld">Tell them I AM hath sent me unto you.</span>—I AM, assumed as a name, implies (1) an existence different from all other existence. “I am, and there is none beside me” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-6.htm" title="That they may know from the rising of the sun, and from the west, that there is none beside me.

The Septuagint renders the words <span class="greekheb">ειμι ο ων</span>, I AM <span class="ital">the existing Being, </span>or HE WHO IS; and the Chaldee, I AM HE WHO IS, and WHO WILL BE. That is, I am He that enjoys an essential, independent, immutable, and necessary existence, <span class="ital">He that </span>IS<span class="ital">, and </span>WAS, <span class="ital">and </span>IS TO COME. It explains his name Jehovah, and signifies, 1st, That he is <span class="ital">self- existent: </span>he has his being of himself, and has no dependance on any other. And being <span class="ital">self-existent, </span>he cannot but be <span class="ital">self-sufficient, </span>and therefore <span class="ital">all-sufficient, </span>and the inexhaustible fountain of being and blessedness. 2d, That he is <span class="ital">eternal </span>and <span class="ital">unchangeable: </span>the <span class="ital">same yesterday, to-day, and for ever. </span>For the words are with equal propriety rendered, I WILL BE WHAT I AM, or, I AM WHAT I WILL BE, or, I WILL BE WHAT I WILL BE. Other beings <span class="ital">are, </span>and <span class="ital">have been, </span>and <span class="ital">shall be; </span>but because what they have been might have been otherwise, and what they are might possibly not have been at all, and what they shall be may be very different from what now is therefore their changeable, dependant, and precarious essence, which to-day may be one thing, to- morrow another thing, and the next day possibly nothing at all, scarce deserves the name of <span class="ital">being. </span>There is another consideration which makes this name peculiarly applicable to God, namely that he is the fountain of all <span class="ital">being </span>and perfection, and that from him all things have derived their existence; so that it is he alone that has <span class="ital">life in himself: </span>and no creature, of whatever rank or order, has so much as an existence of its own: <span class="ital">For in him we live, and move, and have our being. </span>And though divers of God’s attributes are, through his goodness, participated by his creatures, yet because they possess them in a way so inferior to that transcendent, peculiar, and divine manner in which they belong to God, the Scriptures seem absolutely to exclude created beings from any title to those attributes.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Thus our Saviour says, <span class="ital">There is none good but one, that is God. </span>Thus St. Paul terms God the <span class="ital">only Potentate, </span>though the earth be shared by several potentates; and the <span class="ital">only wise God, </span>though many men and the holy angels are wise. And thus he describes him as one who <span class="ital">only hath immortality, </span>although angels and human souls are also immortal. In so incommunicable a manner does the superiority of God’s nature make him possess those very excellences which the diffusiveness of his goodness has induced him to communicate. 3d, That he is <span class="ital">faithful </span>and <span class="ital">true </span>to all his promises, unchangeable in his word, as well as in his nature; and not a <span class="ital">man that he should lie. </span>Let Israel know this; I AM <span class="ital">hath sent me unto you.</span><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:11-15 Formerly Moses thought himself able to deliver Israel, and set himself to the work too hastily. Now, when the fittest person on earth for it, he knows his own weakness. This was the effect of more knowledge of God and of himself. Formerly, self-confidence mingled with strong faith and great zeal, now sinful distrust of God crept in under the garb of humility; so defective are the strongest graces and the best duties of the most eminent saints. But all objections are answered in, Certainly I will be with thee. That is enough. Two names God would now be known by. A name that denotes what he is in himself, I AM THAT I AM. This explains his name Jehovah, and signifies, 1. That he is self-existent: he has his being of himself. 2. That he is eternal and unchangeable, and always the same, yesterday, to-day, and for ever. 3. That he is incomprehensible; we cannot by searching find him out: this name checks all bold and curious inquiries concerning God. 4. That he is faithful and true to all his promises, unchangeable in his word as well as in his nature; let Israel know this, I AM hath sent me unto you. I am, and there is none else besides me. All else have their being from God, and are wholly dependent upon him. Also, here is a name that denotes what God is to his people. The Lord God of your fathers sent me unto you. Moses must revive among them the religion of their fathers, which was almost lost; and then they might expect the speedy performance of the promises made unto their fathers.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I am that I am - That is, "I am what I am." The words express absolute, and therefore unchanging and eternal Being. The name, which Moses was thus commissioned to use, was at once new and old; old in its connection with previous revelations; new in its full interpretation, and in its bearing upon the covenant of which Moses was the destined mediator. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/exodus/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10-22. Come now therefore, and I will send thee&#8212;Considering the patriotic views that had formerly animated the breast of Moses, we might have anticipated that no mission could have been more welcome to his heart than to be employed in the national emancipation of Israel. But he evinced great reluctance to it and stated a variety of objections [Ex 3:11, 13; 4:1, 10] all of which were successfully met and removed&#8212;and the happy issue of his labors was minutely described.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/exodus/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">I am that I am; </span> a most comprehensive and significant name, and most proper for the present occasion, It notes, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

This signifies the real being of God, his self-existence, and that he is the Being of beings; as also it denotes his eternity and immutability, and his constancy and faithfulness in fulfilling his promises, for it includes all time, past, present, and to come; and the sense is, not only I am what I am at present, but I am what I have been, and I am what I shall be, and shall be what I am. The Platonists and Pythagoreans seem to have borrowed their  from hence, which expresses with them the eternal and invariable Being; and so the Septuagint version here is : it is said (z), that the temple of Minerva at Sais, a city of Egypt, had this inscription on it,"I am all that exists, is, and shall be.''And on the temple of Apollo at Delphos was written  the contraction of  "I am" (a). Our Lord seems to refer to this name, <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/8-58.htm">John 8:58</a>, and indeed is the person that now appeared; and the words may be rendered, "I shall be what I shall be" (b) the incarnate God, God manifest in the flesh: <p>thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you; or as the Targum of Jonathan has it,"I am he that is, and that shall be.''This is the name Ehjeh, or Jehovah, Moses is empowered to make use of, and to declare, as the name of the Great God by whom he was sent; and which might serve both to encourage him, and strengthen the faith of the Israelites, that they should be delivered by him. <p>(z) Phutarch. de Iside &amp; Osir.

The rendering given appears to the present writer, as it appeared to W. R. Smith, and A. B. Davidson, to give the true meaning of the Heb. <span class="ital">’Ehyeh ’ăsher ’ehyeh</span>: Jehovah promises that He <span class="ital">will be</span>, to Moses and His people, <span class="ital">what He will be</span>,—something which is undefined, but which, as His full nature is more and more completely unfolded by the lessons of history and the teaching of the prophets, will prove to be more than words can express. The explanation is thus of a character to reassure Moses. See further the separate note, p. 40.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Additional Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-14.htm" title="And God said to Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shall you say to the children of Israel, I AM has sent me to you.">Exodus 3:14</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The following are the reasons which lead the present writer to agree with W. R. Smith1[109] and A. B. Davidson2[110] in adopting the rend. <span class="ital">I will be that I will be</span> for <span class="ital">’Ehyeh ’ăsher ’ehyeh</span>. In the first place the verb <span class="ital">hâyâh</span> expresses not to <span class="ital">be essentially</span>, but to <span class="ital">be phaenomenally</span>; it corresponds to <span class="greekheb">γίγνομαι</span> not <span class="greekheb">εἶναι</span>; it denotes, in Delitzsch’s words, not the idea of inactive, abstract existence, but the active manifestation of existence. Secondly the imperfect tense used expresses not a fixed, present state (‘I <span class="ital">am</span>’), but <span class="ital">action</span>, either <span class="ital">reiterated</span> (habitual) or <span class="ital">future</span>, i.e. either <span class="ital">I am wont to be</span> or <span class="ital">I will be</span>. Whichever rend. be adopted, it is implied (1) that Jehovah’s nature can be defined only in terms of itself (‘I am wont to be <span class="ital">that I am wont to be</span>,’ or ‘I will be <span class="ital">that I will be</span>’), and (2) that, while He <span class="ital">is</span>, as opposed to non-existent heathen deities, He exists, not simply in an abstract sense (‘I am that I Amos 3[111]’; LXX. <span class="greekheb">ἐγώ εἰμι ὁ ὤν</span>), but <span class="ital">actively</span>: He either <span class="ital">is wont to be what He is wont to be</span>, i.e. is ever in history manifesting Himself anew to mankind, and especially to Israel4[112]; or He <span class="ital">will be what He will be</span>, i.e. He will,—not, of course, once only, but habitually,—approve Himself to His people as ‘what He will be’; as what is not further defined, or defined only in terms of Himself, but, it is understood, as what He has promised, and they look for, as their helper, strengthener, deliverer, &c.5[113] The two renderings do not yield a substantially different sense: for what is <span class="ital">wont to be</span> does not appreciably differ from what at any moment <span class="ital">will be. I will be</span> is however the preferable rendering. As both W. R. Smith and Davidson point out, the important thing to bear in mind is that <span class="ital">’ehyeh</span> expresses not the abstract, metaphysical idea of being, but the being of Yahweh as revealed and known to Israel. ‘The expression <span class="ital">I will be</span> is a historical formula; it refers, not to what God will be in Himself: it is no predication regarding His essential nature, but one regarding what He will approve Himself to others, regarding what He will shew Himself to be to those in convenant with Him,’ as by His providential guidance of His people, and the teaching of His prophets, His character and attributes were more and more fully unfolded to them1[114].<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[109] In an interesting article in the <span class="ital">Brit. and Foreign Evang. Rev.</span> 1876, p. 163.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[110] <span class="ital">The Theology of the OT.</span> (1904), pp. 46, 54–58; more briefly in <span class="ital">DB.</span> ii. 199b.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[111] A translation, as Davidson remarks (p. 55), ‘doubly false: the tense is wrong, being present [i.e. a real ‘present,’ not the ‘present,’ as often in English, expressive of habit], and the idea is wrong, because <span class="ital">am</span> is used in the sense of essential being.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[112] So Delitzsch, <span class="ital">Genesis</span>, ed. 4 (1872), p. 26; in the <span class="ital">New Commentary</span> of 1887 (translated) towards the end of the note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/2-4.htm" title="And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to him.">Exodus 2:4</a> : Oehler, <span class="ital">OT.

I (viz.) <span class="ital">who will be</span> it,’ will be viz. what I have promised and said. This, however, as W. R. Smith remarks, is a clumsy version: <span class="ital">v.</span> 14 is rendered far more naturally as is done above: <span class="ital">I will be what I will be</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">I am</span>] better, as before, <span class="bld">I will be.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span></span><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I AM THAT I AM</span>. No better translation can be given of the Hebrew words. "I <span class="accented">will be</span> that I <span class="accented">will be</span> (Geddes) is more literal, but less idiomatic, since the Hebrew was the simplest possible form of the verb substantive. "I am <span class="accented">because</span> I am" (Boothroyd) is wrong, since the word <span class="accented">asher is</span> certainly the relative.

The land to which the Israelites were to be taken up is called a "good" land, on account of its great fertility (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-7.htm">Deuteronomy 8:7</a>.), and a "broad" land, in contrast with the confinement and oppression of the Israelites in Egypt. The epithet "good" is then explained by the expression, "a land flowing with milk and honey" (&#1494;&#1489;&#1514;, a participle of &#1494;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489; in the construct state; vid., Ges. 135); a proverbial description of the extraordinary fertility and loveliness of the land of Canaan (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-17.htm">Exodus 3:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-5.htm">Exodus 13:5</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16-14.htm">Exodus 16:14</a>, etc.). Milk and honey are the simplest and choicest productions of a land abounding in grass and flowers, and were found in Palestine in great abundance even when it was in a desolate condition (<a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-15.htm">Isaiah 7:15</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-22.htm">Isaiah 7:22</a>; see my Comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/5-6.htm">Joshua 5:6</a>).
