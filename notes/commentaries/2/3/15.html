Now, when the fittest person on earth for it, he knows his own weakness. This was the effect of more knowledge of God and of himself. Formerly, self-confidence mingled with strong faith and great zeal, now sinful distrust of God crept in under the garb of humility; so defective are the strongest graces and the best duties of the most eminent saints. But all objections are answered in, Certainly I will be with thee. That is enough. Two names God would now be known by. A name that denotes what he is in himself, I AM THAT I AM. This explains his name Jehovah, and signifies, 1. That he is self-existent: he has his being of himself. 2. That he is eternal and unchangeable, and always the same, yesterday, to-day, and for ever. 3. That he is incomprehensible; we cannot by searching find him out: this name checks all bold and curious inquiries concerning God. 4. That he is faithful and true to all his promises, unchangeable in his word as well as in his nature; let Israel know this, I AM hath sent me unto you. I am, and there is none else besides me. All else have their being from God, and are wholly dependent upon him. Also, here is a name that denotes what God is to his people. The Lord God of your fathers sent me unto you. Moses must revive among them the religion of their fathers, which was almost lost; and then they might expect the speedy performance of the promises made unto their fathers.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Lord God ... - Better, Jehovah &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; yehova&#770;h, God of your fathers, God of Abraham, God of Isaac, and God of Jacob.

Come now therefore, and I will send thee&#8212;Considering the patriotic views that had formerly animated the breast of Moses, we might have anticipated that no mission could have been more welcome to his heart than to be employed in the national emancipation of Israel.

The land to which the Israelites were to be taken up is called a "good" land, on account of its great fertility (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-7.htm">Deuteronomy 8:7</a>.), and a "broad" land, in contrast with the confinement and oppression of the Israelites in Egypt. The epithet "good" is then explained by the expression, "a land flowing with milk and honey" (&#1494;&#1489;&#1514;, a participle of &#1494;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489; in the construct state; vid., Ges. 135); a proverbial description of the extraordinary fertility and loveliness of the land of Canaan (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-17.htm">Exodus 3:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-5.htm">Exodus 13:5</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16-14.htm">Exodus 16:14</a>, etc.). Milk and honey are the simplest and choicest productions of a land abounding in grass and flowers, and were found in Palestine in great abundance even when it was in a desolate condition (<a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-15.htm">Isaiah 7:15</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-22.htm">Isaiah 7:22</a>; see my Comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/5-6.htm">Joshua 5:6</a>). The epithet broad is explained by an enumeration of the six tribes inhabiting the country at that time (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-15.htm">Genesis 10:15</a>. and <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/15-20.htm">Genesis 15:20</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-21.htm">Genesis 15:21</a>). </body></html>
