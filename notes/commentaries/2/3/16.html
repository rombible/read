God, who, by his grace, inclines the heart, and opens the ear, could say beforehand, They shall hearken to thy voice; for he would make them willing in this day of power. As to Pharaoh, Moses is here told that petitions and persuasions, and humble complaints, would not prevail with him; nor a mighty hand stretched out in signs and wonders. But those will certainly be broken by the power of God's hand, who will not bow to the power of his word. Pharaoh's people should furnish Israel with riches at their departure. In Pharaoh's tyranny and Israel's oppression, we see the miserable, abject state of sinners. However galling the yoke, they drudge on till the Lord sends redemption. With the invitations of the gospel, God sends the teaching of his Spirit. Thus are men made willing to seek and to strive for deliverance. Satan loses his power to hold them, they come forth with all they have and are, and apply all to the glory of God and the service of his church.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Lord God ... - Better, Jehovah &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; yehova&#770;h, God of your fathers, God of Abraham, God of Isaac, and God of Jacob.

Come now therefore, and I will send thee&#8212;Considering the patriotic views that had formerly animated the breast of Moses, we might have anticipated that no mission could have been more welcome to his heart than to be employed in the national emancipation of Israel. But he evinced great reluctance to it and stated a variety of objections [Ex 3:11, 13; 4:1, 10] all of which were successfully met and removed&#8212;and the happy issue of his labors was minutely described.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/exodus/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The elders; </span> either by age, or rather by office and authority.

It is generally thought that we are to understand by "the elders" not so much the more aged men, as these who bore a certain official rank and position among their brethren, the heads of the various houses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-14.htm">Exodus 6:14, 25</a>; 11:21), who exercised a certain authority even during the worst times of the oppression. Moses was first to prevail, on them to acknowledge his mission, and was then to go with them to Pharaoh and make his representation (ver. 18). <span class="cmt_word">I have surely visited you</span>. The words are a repetition of those used by Joseph on his deathbed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/50-24.htm">Genesis 50:24</a>), and may be taken to mean, "I have done as Joseph prophesied - I have made his words good thus far. Expect, therefore, the completion of what he promised." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/exodus/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Jehovah had seen the affliction of His people, had heard their cry under their taskmasters, and had come down (&#1497;&#1512;&#1491;, vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/11-5.htm">Genesis 11:5</a>) to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up to a good and broad land, to the place of the Canaanites; and He was about to send Moses to Pharaoh to bring them forth. The land to which the Israelites were to be taken up is called a "good" land, on account of its great fertility (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-7.htm">Deuteronomy 8:7</a>.), and a "broad" land, in contrast with the confinement and oppression of the Israelites in Egypt. The epithet "good" is then explained by the expression, "a land flowing with milk and honey" (&#1494;&#1489;&#1514;, a participle of &#1494;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489; in the construct state; vid., Ges. 135); a proverbial description of the extraordinary fertility and loveliness of the land of Canaan (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-17.htm">Exodus 3:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-5.htm">Exodus 13:5</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16-14.htm">Exodus 16:14</a>, etc.). Milk and honey are the simplest and choicest productions of a land abounding in grass and flowers, and were found in Palestine in great abundance even when it was in a desolate condition (<a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-15.htm">Isaiah 7:15</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-22.htm">Isaiah 7:22</a>; see my Comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/5-6.htm">Joshua 5:6</a>). The epithet broad is explained by an enumeration of the six tribes inhabiting the country at that time (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-15.htm">Genesis 10:15</a>. and <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/15-20.htm">Genesis 15:20</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-21.htm">Genesis 15:21</a>). </body></html>
