Their sorrows; even the secret sorrows of God's people are known to him. Their cry; God hears the cries of his afflicted people. The oppression they endured; the highest and greatest of their oppressors are not above him. God promises speedy deliverance by methods out of the common ways of providence. Those whom God, by his grace, delivers out of a spiritual Egypt, he will bring to a heavenly Canaan.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The natural richness of Palestine, the variety and excellence of its productions, are attested by sacred (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-22.htm">Jeremiah 32:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-6.htm">Ezekiel 20:6</a>) and ancient writers, whose descriptions are strongly in contrast with those of later travelers. The expression "flowing with milk and honey" is used proverbially by Greek poets.<p>The Canaanites ... - This is the first passage in this book where the enumeration, so often repeated, of the nations then in possession of Palestine, is given. Moses was to learn at once the extent of the promise, and the greatness of the enterprise. In Egypt, the forces, situation, and character of these nations were then well known. Aahmes I had invaded the south of Palestine in his pursuit of the Shasous; Tothmosis I had traversed the whole land on his campaign in Syria and Mesopotamia; representations of Canaanites, and of the Cheta, identified by most Egyptologers with the Hittites, are common on monuments of the 18th and 19th Dynasties, and give a strong impression of their civilization, riches, and especially of their knowledge of the arts of war. In this passage, the more general designations come first - Canaanites probably includes all the races; the Hittites, who had great numbers of chariots (892 were taken from them by Tothmosis III in one battle), occupied the plains; the Amorites were chiefly mountaineers, and, in Egyptian inscriptions, gave their name to the whole country; the name Perizzites probably denotes the dwellers in scattered villages, the half-nomad population; the Hivites, a comparatively unwarlike but influential people, held 4 cities in Palestine proper, but their main body dwelt in the northwestern district, from Hermon to Hamath (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/11-3.htm">Joshua 11:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-3.htm">Judges 3:3</a>); the Jebusites at that time appear to have occupied Jerusalem and the adjoining district. Soon after their expulsion by Joshua, they seem to have recovered possession of part of Jerusalem, probably Mount Zion, and to have retained it until the time of David. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/exodus/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6-8. I am the God &#8230; come down to deliver&#8212;The reverential awe of Moses must have been relieved by the divine Speaker (see Mt 22:32), announcing Himself in His covenant character, and by the welcome intelligence communicated. Moreover, the time, as well as all the circumstances of this miraculous appearance, were such as to give him an illustrious display of God's faithfulness to His promises. The period of Israel's journey and affliction in Egypt had been predicted (Ge 15:13), and it was during the last year of the term which had still to run that the Lord appeared in the burning bush.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/exodus/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The cry of the children of Israel; </span> either in prayer, or rather forced by their oppressions, as the next clause explains it. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/exodus/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me,....

When Moses turned aside from the road or spot where he was standing, "to look at this great sight" (&#1502;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492;), i.e., the miraculous vision of the bush that was burning and yet not burned up, Jehovah called to him out of the midst of the thorn-bush, "Moses, Moses (the reduplication as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-11.htm">Genesis 22:11</a>), draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground" (&#1488;&#1491;&#1502;&#1492;). The symbolical meaning of this miraculous vision, - that is to say, the fact that it was a figurative representation of the nature and contents of the ensuing message from God, - has long been admitted. The thorn-bush in contrast with the more noble and lofty trees (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-15.htm">Judges 9:15</a>) represented the people of Israel in their humiliation, as a people despised by the world. Fire and the flame of fire were not "symbols of the holiness of God;" for, as the Holy One, "God is light, and in Him is no darkness at all" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-5.htm">1 John 1:5</a>), He "dwells in the light which no man can approach unto" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-16.htm">1 Timothy 6:16</a>); and that not merely according to the New Testament, but according to the Old Testament view as well, as is evident from <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-17.htm">Isaiah 10:17</a>, where "the Light of Israel" and "the Holy One of Israel" are synonymous. But "the Light of Israel became fire, and the Holy One a flame, and burned and consumed its thorns and thistles." Nor is "fire, from its very nature, the source of light," according to the scriptural view. On the contrary, light, the condition of all life, is also the source of fire. The sun enlightens, warms, and burns (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-28.htm">Job 30:28</a>; Sol. Sol 1:6); the rays of the sun produce warmth, heat, and fire; and light was created before the sun. Fire, therefore, regarded as burning and consuming, is a figurative representation of refining affliction and destroying punishment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-11.htm">1 Corinthians 3:11</a>.), or a symbol of the chastening and punitive justice of the indignation and wrath of God. It is in fire that the Lord comes to judgment (<a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/7-9.htm">Daniel 7:9-10</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-13.htm">Ezekiel 1:13-14</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-27.htm">Ezekiel 1:27-28</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/1-14.htm">Revelation 1:14-15</a>). Fire sets forth the fiery indignation which devours the adversaries (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-27.htm">Hebrews 10:27</a>). He who "judges and makes war in righteousness' has eyes as a flame of fire (<a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11-12</a>). Accordingly, the burning thorn-bush represented the people of Israel as they were burning in the fire of affliction, the iron furnace of Egypt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-20.htm">Deuteronomy 4:20</a>). Yet, though the thorn-bush was burning in the fire, it was not consumed; for in the flame was Jehovah, who chastens His people, but does not give them over unto death (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/118-18.htm">Psalm 118:18</a>). The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob had come down to deliver His people out of the hand of the Egyptians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>). Although the affliction of Israel in Egypt proceeded from Pharaoh, yet was it also a fire which the Lord had kindled to purify His people and prepare it for its calling. In the flame of the burning bush the Lord manifested Himself as the "jealous God, who visits the sins of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generations of them that hate Him, and showeth mercy unto thousands of them that love Him and keep His commandments" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-9.htm">Deuteronomy 5:9-10</a>), who cannot tolerate the worship of another god (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-14.htm">Exodus 34:14</a>), and whose anger burns against idolaters, to destroy them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-15.htm">Deuteronomy 6:15</a>). The "jealous God" was a "consuming fire" in the midst of Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-24.htm">Deuteronomy 4:24</a>). These passages show that the great sight which Moses saw not only had reference to the circumstances of Israel in Egypt, but was a prelude to the manifestation of God on Sinai for the establishment of the covenant (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19.htm">Exodus 19</a> and 20), and also a representation of the relation in which Jehovah would stand to Israel through the establishment of the covenant made with the fathers. For this reason it occurred upon the spot where Jehovah intended to set up His covenant with Israel. But, as a jealous God, He also "takes vengeance upon His adversaries" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/1-2.htm">Nahum 1:2</a>.). Pharaoh, who would not let Israel go, He was about to smite with all His wonders (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-20.htm">Exodus 3:20</a>), whilst He redeemed Israel with outstretched arm and great judgments (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-6.htm">Exodus 6:6</a>). - The transition from the Angel of Jehovah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-2.htm">Exodus 3:2</a>) to Jehovah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-4.htm">Exodus 3:4</a>) proves the identity of the two; and the interchange of Jehovah and Elohim, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/3-4.htm">Exodus 3:4</a>, precludes the idea of Jehovah being merely a national God. The command of God to Moses to put off his shoes, may be accounted for from the custom in the East of wearing shoes or sandals merely as a protection from dirt. No Brahmin enters a pagoda, no Moslem a mosque, without first taking off at least his overshoes (Rosenm. Morgenl. i. 261; Robinson, Pal. ii. p. 373); and even in the Grecian temples the priests and priestesses performed the service barefooted (Justin, Apol. i. c. 62; Bhr, Symbol. ii. 96). when entering other holy places also, the Arabs and Samaritans, and even the Yezidis of Mesopotamia, take off their shoes, that the places may not be defiled by the dirt or dust upon them (vid., Robinson, Pal. iii. 100, and Layard's Nineveh and its Remains). The place of the burning bush was holy because of the presence of the holy God, and putting off the shoes was intended to express not merely respect for the place itself, but that reverence which the inward man (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-16.htm">Ephesians 3:16</a>) owes to the holy God. </body></html>
