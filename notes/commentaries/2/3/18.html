He would quite understand that the Hebrews, being of a different race from the Egyptians, had a God of their own, and that this God would from time to time give intimations to them of His will. Such intimations were supposed to be given to the Egyptian kings occasionally by their gods.<p><span class= "bld">Three days’ journey.</span>—The necessity for withdrawing to so great a distance arose from that remarkable peculiarity in the Egyptian religion, the worship of animals. Cows, or at any rate, white cows, were sacred throughout the whole of Egypt, and to kill them was regarded as a crime of the deepest dye. Sheep were sacred to the inhabitants of one nome or canton, goats to those of another (Herod. ii. 42). Unless the Hebrews retired to a place where there were no Egyptians, they would be unable to perform their sacred rites without danger of disturbance, and even bloodshed. (See below, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-26.htm" title="And Moses said, It is not meet so to do; for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to the LORD our God: see, shall we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and will they not stone us?">Exodus 8:26</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">The wilderness.</span>—“<span class= "ital">The </span>wilderness” to those who dwelt in Goshen was the broad sandy and rocky tract which intervened between Egypt and Palestine—the modern <span class= "ital">El-Tih</span>—a desert reckoned at three days’ journey across (Herod. iii. 5). It is “a vast limestone plateau of irregular surface, projecting wedge-fashion into the peninsula of Sinai, just as Sinai itself projects into the Red Sea. It terminates in a long cliff or encampment, steep and abrupt on the south-western side, gradually falling away towards the south-east.”—(<span class= "ital">Our Work in Palestine, </span>p. 275.)<p><span class= "bld">That we may sacrifice.</span>—It is idle to speculate whether, if Pharaoh had granted the request, the Israelites would have returned to Egypt after sacrificing.

God, who, by his grace, inclines the heart, and opens the ear, could say beforehand, They shall hearken to thy voice; for he would make them willing in this day of power. As to Pharaoh, Moses is here told that petitions and persuasions, and humble complaints, would not prevail with him; nor a mighty hand stretched out in signs and wonders. But those will certainly be broken by the power of God's hand, who will not bow to the power of his word. Pharaoh's people should furnish Israel with riches at their departure. In Pharaoh's tyranny and Israel's oppression, we see the miserable, abject state of sinners. However galling the yoke, they drudge on till the Lord sends redemption. With the invitations of the gospel, God sends the teaching of his Spirit. Thus are men made willing to seek and to strive for deliverance. Satan loses his power to hold them, they come forth with all they have and are, and apply all to the glory of God and the service of his church.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Three days' journey - i. e. a journey which would occupy three days in going and returning. This was a demand quite in accordance with Egyptian customs. The refusal of Pharaoh and the subsequent proceedings were revealed to Moses at once; but it is important to observe that the first request which Pharaoh rejected could have been granted without any damage to Egypt, or any risk of the Israelites passing the strongly-fortified frontier. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/exodus/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10-22. Come now therefore, and I will send thee&#8212;Considering the patriotic views that had formerly animated the breast of Moses, we might have anticipated that no mission could have been more welcome to his heart than to be employed in the national emancipation of Israel. But he evinced great reluctance to it and stated a variety of objections [Ex 3:11, 13; 4:1, 10] all of which were successfully met and removed&#8212;and the happy issue of his labors was minutely described.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/exodus/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Hath met with us; </span> hath appeared to us, expressing his displeasure for our neglect of him, and declaring his will that we should do what follows. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Three days’ journey; </span> to Sinai, which, going the nearest way, was no further from Egypt; for here God had declared he would be served, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-12.htm" title="And he said, Certainly I will be with you; and this shall be a token to you, that I have sent you: When you have brought forth the people out of Egypt, you shall serve God on this mountain.">Exodus 3:12</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Quest.</span> Was not this deceitfully and unjustly spoken, when they intended to go quite away from him? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Answ.</span> No; for, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

Moses doth not say any thing which is false, but only conceals a part of the truth; and he was not obliged to discover the whole truth to so cruel a tyrant, and so implacable an enemy. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. Moses cannot be blamed, both because he was none of Pharaoh’s subject, and because herein he follows the direction and command of his Master that sent him. And God surely was not obliged to acquaint Pharaoh with all his mind, but only so far as he pleased. And it pleased him for wise and just reasons to propose only this to Pharaoh, that his denial of so modest a request (which God foresaw) might make his tyranny more manifest, and God’s vengeance upon him more just and remarkable. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Sacrifice to the Lord our God, </span> which they could not do freely and safely in Egypt, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-26.htm" title="And Moses said, It is not meet so to do; for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to the LORD our God: see, shall we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and will they not stone us?">Exodus 8:26</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/exodus/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And they shall hearken to thy voice,....

Some think the reason of this request they were directed to make, to sacrifice out of the land of Egypt, was, because what they sacrificed the Egyptians worshipped as gods, and therefore would be enraged at such sacrifices; but for this there is no sufficient foundation; See Gill on <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/46-34.htm">Genesis 46:34</a>, rather the design was under this pretence to get quite away from them, they being no subjects of the king of Egypt, nor had he a right to detain them; nor were they obliged to acquaint him with the whole of their intentions, and especially as they were directed of God himself to say this, and no more, and which being so reasonable, made Pharaoh's refusal the more inexcusable. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/exodus/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And they shall hearken to thy voice: and thou shalt come, thou and the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye shall say unto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath met with us: and now let us go, we beseech thee, three days' journey into the wilderness, that we may <span class="cverse3">{o}</span> sacrifice to the LORD our God.</span><p>(o) Because Egypt was full of idolatry, God would appoint them a place where they could serve him purely.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/exodus/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">18</span>. <span class="ital">shall hearken</span>] rather, <span class="bld">will</span> <span class="ital">hearken</span>.

The ‘wilderness’ would be the broad and arid limestone plateau, now called <span class="ital">et-Tih</span>, extending from the E. border of Egypt to the S. of Palestine, and bounded on the S. by the mountains of the Sinaitic Peninsula. In an age in which every people had its own god, or gods, whom they worshipped in their own special way, a request to be allowed to make such a pilgrimage would seem quite natural. In the form, <span class="ital">Let my people go, that they may serve me</span>, it is repeated in the sequel of J seven times (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-23.htm" title="And I say to you, Let my son go, that he may serve me: and if you refuse to let him go, behold, I will slay your son, even your firstborn.">Exodus 4:23</a>); comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/5-3.htm" title="And they said, The God of the Hebrews has met with us: let us go, we pray you, three days' journey into the desert, and sacrifice to the LORD our God; lest he fall on us with pestilence, or with the sword.">Exodus 5:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/10-7.htm" title="And Pharaoh's servants said to him, How long shall this man be a snare to us? let the men go, that they may serve the LORD their God: know you not yet that Egypt is destroyed?...">Exodus 10:7-11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/10-24.htm" title="And Pharaoh called to Moses, and said, Go you, serve the LORD; only let your flocks and your herds be stayed: let your little ones also go with you....">Exodus 10:24-26</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In what sense is the request meant? If, as has been supposed, it was intended merely as an excuse for getting a good start for their subsequent flight, then it was clearly a case of deception: the Israelites would in this case have sought to obtain from the Pharaoh by a ruse what, if he had known their entire purpose, he would not have granted. It is not however said that, if the request had been acceded to, they would not have returned, when the three days’ festival was over: so it may have been intended merely (Di.) to test the feeling of the Pharaoh towards the Israelites; to serve their God in their own way was in itself ‘the smallest request that subjects could make of their ruler’; and if this request had been viewed by the Pharaoh favourably, the door might have been opened for further negotiations, and the people might eventually have been allowed to depart altogether: the request was <span class="ital">not</span> granted, and so it resolved itself in the end into a demand for the unconditional release of the people and their actual departure.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They shall hearken to thy voice</span>. Moses thought they would despise him - turn a deaf ear to his words - look upon him as  unworthy of credit. But it was not so. The hearts of men are in God's hands, and he disposed those of the elders to receive the message of his servant, Moses, favourably, and believe in it. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-29.htm">Exodus 4:29-31</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt come</span>, <span class="cmt_word">thou and the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt</span>. This future is perhaps one of command rather than of prophetic announcement. The elders do not seem to have actually made their appearance before Pharaoh. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/5-1.htm">Exodus 5:1-4</a>.) They may, however, have authorised Moses and Aaron to speak in their name. <span class="cmt_word">The Lord God of the Hebrews hath met with us</span>. Through our representative Moses. "Met with us" is undoubtedly the true meaning. <span class="cmt_word">That we may sacrifice</span>. There was reticence here, no doubt, but no falseness. It was a part of God's design that sacrifice, interrupted during the sojourn in Egypt for various reasons, should be resumed beyond the bounds of Egypt by His people. So much of his purpose, and no more, he bade Moses lay before Pharaoh on the first occasion. The object of the reticence was not to deceive Pharaoh, but to test him. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/exodus/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>To the divine commission Moses made this reply: "Who am I, that I should go to Pharaoh, and bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?" Some time before he had offered himself of his own accord as a deliverer and judge; but now he had learned humility in the school of Midian, and was filled in consequence with distrust of his own power and fitness. The son of Pharaoh's daughter had become a shepherd, and felt himself too weak to go to Pharaoh. But God met this distrust by the promise, "I will be with thee," which He confirmed by a sign, namely, that when Israel was brought out of Egypt, they should serve (&#1506;&#1489;&#1491;, i.e., worship) God upon that mountain. This sign, which was to be a pledge to Moses of the success of his mission, was one indeed that required faith itself; but, at the same time, it was a sign adapted to inspire both courage and confidence. God pointed out to him the success of his mission, the certain result of his leading the people out: Israel should serve Him upon the very same mountain in which He had appeared to Moses. As surely as Jehovah had appeared to Moses as the God of his fathers, so surely should Israel serve Him there. The reality of the appearance of God formed the pledge of His announcement, that Israel would there serve its God; and this truth was to till Moses with confidence in the execution of the divine command. The expression "serve God" (&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837;, lxx) means something more than the immolare of the Vulgate, or the "sacrifice" of Luther; for even though sacrifice formed a leading element, or the most important part of the worship of the Israelites, the patriarchs before this had served Jehovah by calling upon His name as well as offering sacrifice. And the service of Israel at Mount Horeb consisted in their entering into covenant with Jehovah (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/24.htm">Exodus 24</a>); not only in their receiving the law as the covenant nation, but their manifesting obedience by presenting free-will offerings for the building of the tabernacle (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/36-1.htm">Exodus 36:1-7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/7-1.htm">Numbers 7:1</a>).<p>(Note: Kurtz follows the Lutheran rendering "sacrifice," and understands by it the first national sacrifice; and then, from the significance of the first, which included potentially all the rest, supposes the covenant sacrifice to be intended. But not only is the original text disregarded here, the fact is also overlooked, that Luther himself has translated &#1506;&#1489;&#1491; correctly, to "serve," in every other place. And it is not sufficient to say, that by the direction of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-18.htm">Exodus 3:18</a>) Moses first of all asked Pharaoh for permission merely to go a three days' journey into the wilderness to sacrifice to their God (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/5-1.htm">Exodus 5:1-3</a>), in consequence of which Pharaoh afterwards offered to allow them to sacrifice (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-3.htm">Exodus 8:3</a>) within the land, and at a still later period outside (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-21.htm">Exodus 8:21</a>.). For the fact that Pharaoh merely spoke of sacrificing may be explained on the ground that at first nothing more was asked. But this first demand arose from the desire on the part of God to make known His purposes concerning Israel only step by step, that it might be all the easier for the hard heart of the king to grant what was required. But even if Pharaoh understood nothing more by the expression "serve God" than the offering of sacrifice, this would not justify us in restricting the words which Jehovah addressed to Moses, "When thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain," to the first national offering, or to the covenant sacrifice.) </body></html>
