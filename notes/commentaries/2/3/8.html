That this was not understood literally, even by the Jews, appears from such passages as <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-27.htm" title="But will God indeed dwell on the earth? behold, the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain you; how much less this house that I have built?">1Kings 8:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/137-7.htm" title="Remember, O LORD, the children of Edom in the day of Jerusalem; who said, Raze it, raze it, even to the foundation thereof.">Psalm 137:7-9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-3.htm" title="The eyes of the LORD are in every place, beholding the evil and the good.">Proverbs 15:3</a>, &c.<p><span class= "bld">A good land and a large.</span>—The land promised to Abraham (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-18.htm" title="In the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, To your seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates:">Genesis 15:18</a>) well deserves this description. Besides Philistia, and Palestine on both sides of the Jordan, it included almost the whole of Syria from Galilee on the south, to Amanus, Taurus, and the Euphrates on the north and north-east. This tract of country is 450 miles long, and from sixty to a hundred and twenty miles broad. Its area is not much less than 50,000 square miles. Although some parts are unproductive, it is, on the whole, a region of great fertility, quite capable of forming the seat of a powerful empire.<p><span class= "bld">A land flowing with milk and honey.</span>—This expression, here used for the first time, was already, it is probable, a proverbial one, denoting generally, richness and fertility.

The expression "flowing with milk and honey" is used proverbially by Greek poets.<p>The Canaanites ... - This is the first passage in this book where the enumeration, so often repeated, of the nations then in possession of Palestine, is given. Moses was to learn at once the extent of the promise, and the greatness of the enterprise. In Egypt, the forces, situation, and character of these nations were then well known. Aahmes I had invaded the south of Palestine in his pursuit of the Shasous; Tothmosis I had traversed the whole land on his campaign in Syria and Mesopotamia; representations of Canaanites, and of the Cheta, identified by most Egyptologers with the Hittites, are common on monuments of the 18th and 19th Dynasties, and give a strong impression of their civilization, riches, and especially of their knowledge of the arts of war. In this passage, the more general designations come first - Canaanites probably includes all the races; the Hittites, who had great numbers of chariots (892 were taken from them by Tothmosis III in one battle), occupied the plains; the Amorites were chiefly mountaineers, and, in Egyptian inscriptions, gave their name to the whole country; the name Perizzites probably denotes the dwellers in scattered villages, the half-nomad population; the Hivites, a comparatively unwarlike but influential people, held 4 cities in Palestine proper, but their main body dwelt in the northwestern district, from Hermon to Hamath (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/11-3.htm">Joshua 11:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-3.htm">Judges 3:3</a>); the Jebusites at that time appear to have occupied Jerusalem and the adjoining district. Soon after their expulsion by Joshua, they seem to have recovered possession of part of Jerusalem, probably Mount Zion, and to have retained it until the time of David. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/exodus/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6-8.

Moreover, the time, as well as all the circumstances of this miraculous appearance, were such as to give him an illustrious display of God's faithfulness to His promises.

Literally correct. Palestine is at a much higher level than Egypt. (Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-10.htm">Genesis 12:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/13-1.htm">Genesis 13:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/37-25.htm">Genesis 37:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/39-1.htm">Genesis 39:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/42-2.htm">Genesis 42:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/46-3.htm">Genesis 46:3, 4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/50-25.htm">Genesis 50:25</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">A good land and a large</span>. The fertility of Palestine, though not equal to that of Egypt, was still very great. Eastward of Jordan, the soil is rich and productive, the country in places wooded with fine trees, and the herbage luxuriant. Vast tracts in the spring produce enormous crops of grain, and throughout the year pasturage of every kind is abundant. "Still the countless flocks and herds may be seen, droves of cattle moving on like troops of soldiers, descending at sunset to drink of the springs-literally, in the language of; the prophet, "rams, and lambs, and goats, and bullocks, all of them fatlings of Bashan (Stanley, Jewish Church, pp. 217, 218). The western region is less productive, but by careful cultivation in terraces may be made to bear excellent crops of corn, olives, and figs. Palestine proper to a modern European seems small, being about the size of Belgium, less than Holland or Hanover, and not much larger than Wales. It contains about 11,000 square miles. To an Israelite of the age of Moses such a land would appear sufficiently "large;" for it was considerably larger than the entire Delta of Egypt, whereof his nation occupied the smaller half; and it fell but little short of the entire cultivable area of the whole land of Egypt, which was the greatest and most powerful country known to him. It may be added that the land included in the covenant which God made with Abraham (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>), and actually possessed by David and Solomon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-21.htm">1 Kings 4:21</a>), was a "good land and a large," according even to modern notions, including (as it did) besides Palestine the whole of Syria, and thus containing an area of from 50,000 to 60,000 square miles. The phrase <span class="cmt_word">flowing with milk and honey</span>, first used here, and so common in the later books (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-27.htm">Numbers 13:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-9.htm">Deuteronomy 26:9, 15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-20.htm">Deuteronomy 31:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-5.htm">Jeremiah 11:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-22.htm">Jeremiah 32:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-6.htm">Ezekiel 20:6</a>, etc.) was probably a proverbial expression for "a land of plenty," and not intended literally. See what the spies say, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-27.htm">Numbers 13:27</a> The enumeration of the nations of Palestine here made is incomplete, five only of the ten whose land was promised to Abraham (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-19.htm">Genesis 15:19-21</a>) being expressly mentioned. One, however, that of the Hivites, is added. We may suppose that they had succeeded to the Kenizzites or the Kadmonites of Abraham's time. The only important omission is that of the Girgashites, who hold their place in most other enumerations (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-16.htm">Genesis 10:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-21.htm">Genesis 15:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-1.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/3-10.htm">Joshua 3:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/24-11.htm">Joshua 24:11</a>, etc.), but seem to have been the least important of the "seven nations,"and are omitted in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-5.htm">Judges 3:5</a>.

When Moses turned aside from the road or spot where he was standing, "to look at this great sight" (&#1502;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492;), i.e., the miraculous vision of the bush that was burning and yet not burned up, Jehovah called to him out of the midst of the thorn-bush, "Moses, Moses (the reduplication as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-11.htm">Genesis 22:11</a>), draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground" (&#1488;&#1491;&#1502;&#1492;). The symbolical meaning of this miraculous vision, - that is to say, the fact that it was a figurative representation of the nature and contents of the ensuing message from God, - has long been admitted. The thorn-bush in contrast with the more noble and lofty trees (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-15.htm">Judges 9:15</a>) represented the people of Israel in their humiliation, as a people despised by the world. Fire and the flame of fire were not "symbols of the holiness of God;" for, as the Holy One, "God is light, and in Him is no darkness at all" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-5.htm">1 John 1:5</a>), He "dwells in the light which no man can approach unto" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-16.htm">1 Timothy 6:16</a>); and that not merely according to the New Testament, but according to the Old Testament view as well, as is evident from <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-17.htm">Isaiah 10:17</a>, where "the Light of Israel" and "the Holy One of Israel" are synonymous. But "the Light of Israel became fire, and the Holy One a flame, and burned and consumed its thorns and thistles." Nor is "fire, from its very nature, the source of light," according to the scriptural view. On the contrary, light, the condition of all life, is also the source of fire. The sun enlightens, warms, and burns (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-28.htm">Job 30:28</a>; Sol. Sol 1:6); the rays of the sun produce warmth, heat, and fire; and light was created before the sun. Fire, therefore, regarded as burning and consuming, is a figurative representation of refining affliction and destroying punishment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-11.htm">1 Corinthians 3:11</a>.), or a symbol of the chastening and punitive justice of the indignation and wrath of God. It is in fire that the Lord comes to judgment (<a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/7-9.htm">Daniel 7:9-10</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-13.htm">Ezekiel 1:13-14</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-27.htm">Ezekiel 1:27-28</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/1-14.htm">Revelation 1:14-15</a>). Fire sets forth the fiery indignation which devours the adversaries (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-27.htm">Hebrews 10:27</a>). He who "judges and makes war in righteousness' has eyes as a flame of fire (<a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11-12</a>). Accordingly, the burning thorn-bush represented the people of Israel as they were burning in the fire of affliction, the iron furnace of Egypt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-20.htm">Deuteronomy 4:20</a>). Yet, though the thorn-bush was burning in the fire, it was not consumed; for in the flame was Jehovah, who chastens His people, but does not give them over unto death (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/118-18.htm">Psalm 118:18</a>). The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob had come down to deliver His people out of the hand of the Egyptians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>). Although the affliction of Israel in Egypt proceeded from Pharaoh, yet was it also a fire which the Lord had kindled to purify His people and prepare it for its calling. In the flame of the burning bush the Lord manifested Himself as the "jealous God, who visits the sins of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generations of them that hate Him, and showeth mercy unto thousands of them that love Him and keep His commandments" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-9.htm">Deuteronomy 5:9-10</a>), who cannot tolerate the worship of another god (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-14.htm">Exodus 34:14</a>), and whose anger burns against idolaters, to destroy them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-15.htm">Deuteronomy 6:15</a>). The "jealous God" was a "consuming fire" in the midst of Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-24.htm">Deuteronomy 4:24</a>). These passages show that the great sight which Moses saw not only had reference to the circumstances of Israel in Egypt, but was a prelude to the manifestation of God on Sinai for the establishment of the covenant (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19.htm">Exodus 19</a> and 20), and also a representation of the relation in which Jehovah would stand to Israel through the establishment of the covenant made with the fathers. For this reason it occurred upon the spot where Jehovah intended to set up His covenant with Israel. But, as a jealous God, He also "takes vengeance upon His adversaries" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/1-2.htm">Nahum 1:2</a>.). Pharaoh, who would not let Israel go, He was about to smite with all His wonders (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-20.htm">Exodus 3:20</a>), whilst He redeemed Israel with outstretched arm and great judgments (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-6.htm">Exodus 6:6</a>). - The transition from the Angel of Jehovah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-2.htm">Exodus 3:2</a>) to Jehovah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-4.htm">Exodus 3:4</a>) proves the identity of the two; and the interchange of Jehovah and Elohim, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/3-4.htm">Exodus 3:4</a>, precludes the idea of Jehovah being merely a national God. The command of God to Moses to put off his shoes, may be accounted for from the custom in the East of wearing shoes or sandals merely as a protection from dirt. No Brahmin enters a pagoda, no Moslem a mosque, without first taking off at least his overshoes (Rosenm. Morgenl. i. 261; Robinson, Pal. ii. p. 373); and even in the Grecian temples the priests and priestesses performed the service barefooted (Justin, Apol. i. c. 62; Bhr, Symbol. ii. 96). when entering other holy places also, the Arabs and Samaritans, and even the Yezidis of Mesopotamia, take off their shoes, that the places may not be defiled by the dirt or dust upon them (vid., Robinson, Pal. iii. 100, and Layard's Nineveh and its Remains). The place of the burning bush was holy because of the presence of the holy God, and putting off the shoes was intended to express not merely respect for the place itself, but that reverence which the inward man (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-16.htm">Ephesians 3:16</a>) owes to the holy God. </body></html>
