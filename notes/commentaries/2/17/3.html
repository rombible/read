Thirst kills as surely as hunger, and more quickly. Whole armies have died of it. (Herod. iii. 26.) Ships’ crews have perished of it on the ocean, with “water, water everywhere, and not a drop to drink.” Unless a supply could somehow or other have been provided speedily, the whole people must have been exterminated.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/17.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>17:1-7 The children of Israel journeyed according to the commandment of the Lord, led by the pillar of cloud and fire, yet they came to a place where there was no water for them to drink. We may be in the way of duty, yet may meet with troubles, which Providence brings us into, for the trial of our faith, and that God may be glorified in our relief. They began to question whether God was with them or not. This is called their tempting God, which signifies distrust of him after they had received such proofs of his power and goodness. Moses mildly answered them. It is folly to answer passion with passion; that makes bad worse. God graciously appeared to help them. How wonderful the patience and forbearance of God toward provoking sinners! That he might show his power as well as his pity, and make it a miracle of mercy, he gave them water out of a rock. God can open fountains for us where we least expect them. Those who, in this wilderness, keep to God's way, may trust him to provide for them. Also, let this direct us to depend on Christ's grace. The apostle says, that Rock was Christ, 1Co 10:4, it was a type of him. While the curse of God might justly have been executed upon our guilty souls, behold the Son of God is smitten for us. Let us ask and receive. There was a constant, abundant supply of this water. Numerous as believers are, the supply of the Spirit of Christ is enough for all. The water flowed from the rock in streams to refresh the wilderness, and attended them on their way towards Canaan; and this water flows from Christ, through the ordinances, in the barren wilderness of this world, to refresh our souls, until we come to glory. A new name was given to the place, in remembrance, not of the mercy of their supply, but of the sin of their murmuring: Massah, Temptation, because they tempted God; Meribah, Strife, because they chid with Moses. Sin leaves a blot upon the name.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Tempt the Lord - It is a general characteristic of the Israelites that the miracles, which met each need as it arose, failed to produce a habit of faith: but the severity of the trial, the faintness and anguish of thirst in the burning desert, must not be overlooked in appreciating their conduct. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/exodus/17.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2, 3. the people did chide with Moses, and said, Give us water that we may drink, &c.&#8212;The want of water was a privation, the severity of which we cannot estimate, and it was a great trial to the Israelites, but their conduct on this new occasion was outrageous; it amounted even to "a tempting of the Lord."

They saw there was no water when they first came thither, and therefore chid Moses for bringing them to such a place, where they could not subsist; and having stayed some little time here, and all the water they brought with them from Alush being spent, and having none to drink, began to be very thirsty: <p>and the people murmured against Moses; became more impatient and enraged, and threw out their invectives against him with much acrimony and severity: <p>wherefore is this that thou hast brought us up out of Egypt? where it would have been much better for us to have continued: <p>to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst: which is intolerable to any, and especially to children and cattle, which require frequent drinking: they could not suppose that Moses had such a murderous view in bringing them out of Egypt, or that this was his intention in it, but that this would be the issue and event of it. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/exodus/17.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And the people thirsted there for water; and the people murmured against Moses, and said, Wherefore is this that thou hast brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst?</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/exodus/17.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">3</span>. <span class="ital">murmured</span>] see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-24.htm" title="And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we drink?">Exodus 15:24</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Wherefore</span>, &c.] cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/20-4.htm" title="And why have you brought up the congregation of the LORD into this wilderness, that we and our cattle should die there?...">Numbers 20:4-5</a>; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-11.htm" title="And they said to Moses, Because there were no graves in Egypt, have you taken us away to die in the wilderness? why have you dealt thus with us, to carry us forth out of Egypt?">Exodus 14:11</a> f., <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-3.htm" title="And the children of Israel said to them, Would to God we had died by the hand of the LORD in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the flesh pots, and when we did eat bread to the full; for you have brought us forth into this wilderness, to kill this whole assembly with hunger.">Exodus 16:3</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">brought us up</span>] into the high ground of the Sin.

His thirst was the only agony which drew from the Son of Man an acknowledgment of physical suffering, in the words "I thirst." Descriptions of thirst in open boats at sea are among the most painful of the records of afflicted humanity. Thirst in the desert can scarcely be less horrible. <span class="cmt_word">The people murmured and said</span> When the worst comes on men, if they are alone, they bear it silently; but if they can find a scapegoat, they murmur. To lay the blame of the situation on another is a huge satisfaction to the ordinary human mind, which shrinks from responsibility, and would fain shift the burthen on some one else. <span class="cmt_word">To kill us</span>.

It is interesting to see that the "cattle" still survived, and were regarded as of great importance. How far they served as a secondary head of subsistance to the people during the 40 years, is a point not yet sufficiently elaborated. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/exodus/16.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>As a constant memorial of this bread of God for succeeding generations, Jehovah commanded Moses to keep a bowl full (&#1492;&#1506;&#1502;&#1512; &#1502;&#1500;&#1488;, the filling of a bowl) of the manna. Accordingly Aaron placed a jar of manna (as it is stated in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16-34.htm">Exodus 16:34</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16-35.htm">Exodus 16:35</a>, by way of anticipation, for the purpose of summing up everything of importance relating to the manna) "before Jehovah," or speaking still more exactly, "before the testimony," i.e., the tables of the law (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-16.htm">Exodus 25:16</a>), or according to Jewish tradition, in the ark of the covenant (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-4.htm">Hebrews 9:4</a>). &#1510;&#1504;&#1510;&#1504;&#1514;, from &#1510;&#1504;&#1503; to guard round, to preserve, signifies a jar or bottle, not a basket.
