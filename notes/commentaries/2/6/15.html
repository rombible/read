Moses returns to his narrative, and repeats the charge God had given him to deliver his message to Pharaoh, and his objection against it. Those who have spoken unadvisedly with their lips ought to reflect upon it with regret, as Moses seems to do here.Uncircumcised, is used in Scripture to note the unsuitableness there may be in any thing to answer its proper purpose; as the carnal heart and depraved nature of fallen man are wholly unsuited to the services of God, and to the purposes of his glory. It is profitable to place no confidence in ourselves, all our sufficiency must be in the Lord. We never can trust ourselves too little, or our God too much. I can do nothing by myself, said the apostle, but I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>These be the heads - We have in the following verses, not a complete genealogy, but a summary account of the family of the two brothers. Moses records for the satisfaction of Hebrew readers, to whom genealogical questions were always interesting, the descent and position of the designated leaders of the nation.

The insertion of this genealogical table in this part of the narrative was intended to authenticate the descent of Moses and Aaron. Both of them were commissioned to act so important a part in the events transacted in the court of Egypt and afterwards elevated to so high offices in the government and Church of God, that it was of the utmost importance that their lineage should be accurately traced. Reuben and Simeon being the oldest of Jacob's sons, a passing notice is taken of them, and then the historian advances to the enumeration of the principal persons in the house of Levi [Ex 6:16-19].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/exodus/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/exodus/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the sons of Simeon, Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman,....

The list corresponds exactly, both in the names and in the order, with that given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/46-10.htm">Genesis 46:10</a>, but differs considerably from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-24.htm">1 Chronicles 4:24</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-12.htm">Numbers 26:12</a>. In both the latter places Jemuel appears as Nemuel, and Zohar as Zerah, while Obad is omitted. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-24.htm">1 Chronicles 4:24</a>, Jachin appears as Jarib. It would seem that the family of Obad died out and disappeared soon after the Israelites quitted Egypt. The family of Shaul, on the other hand, increased and multiplied (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-25.htm">1 Chronicles 4:25-27</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/exodus/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When Moses communicated this solemn assurance of God to the people, they did not listen to him &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492; &#1502;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1510;&#1512;, lit., "for shortness of breath;" not "from impatience" (like &#1511;&#1510;&#1512;&#1470;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-29.htm">Proverbs 14:29</a>, in contrast to &#1488;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1512;&#1498;), but from anguish, inward pressure, which prevents a man from breathing properly. Thus the early belief of the Israelites was changed into the despondency of unbelief through the increase of their oppression. This result also produced despondency in Moses' mind, so that he once more declined the commission, which followed the promise, viz., to go to Pharaoh and demand that he would let Israel go out of his land (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-11.htm">Exodus 6:11</a>). If the children of Israel would not listen to him, how should Pharaoh hear him, especially as he was uncircumcised in the lips (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-12.htm">Exodus 6:12</a>)? &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501; &#1506;&#1512;&#1500; is one whose lips are, as it were, covered with a foreskin, so that he cannot easily bring out his words; in meaning the same as "heavy of mouth" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-10.htm">Exodus 4:10</a>. The reply of God to this objection is given in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/7-1.htm">Exodus 7:1-5</a>. For, before the historian gives the decisive answer of Jehovah which removed all further hesitation on the part of Moses, and completed his mission and that of Aaron to Pharaoh, he considers it advisable to introduce the genealogy of the two men of God, for the purpose of showing clearly their genealogical relation to the people of Israel. </body></html>
