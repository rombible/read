Horses were well known in Egypt at the time, but were kept only by the kings and the great men. The Hebrews had not been in a position ever to have possessed any. Asses, on the contrary, were exceedingly common, and formed the ordinary beasts of burden in the country. In default of camels, which they seem not to have owned, the Israelites must have carried their tents and other baggage on asses.<p><span class= "bld">Thou shalt redeem.</span>—Since the ass was unclean. In Egypt he is said to have been “Typhonian;” and Set, the Evil Principle, is represented with long ears, which may be those of an ass, cropped towards the upper extremity. The redeeming of an ass with a lamb (or kid) was favourable to the owner, since the ass colt must have been of considerably more value.<p><span class= "bld">If thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break his neck.</span>—There will always be in every nation those who grudge to make any offering to God, and who will seek to evade every requisition for a gift.

It would be effectual without requiring to be put in force.<p><span class= "bld">All the firstborn of man among thy children shalt thou redeem.</span>—This was declared in anticipation of the arrangement afterwards to be made, whereby the tribe of Levi was taken in lieu of the firstborn for the service Of the sanctuary (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/3-40.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Number all the firstborn of the males of the children of Israel from a month old and upward, and take the number of their names.">Numbers 3:40-45</a>), and an obligation was imposed on Israelites of other tribes to “redeem” their sons by a payment of five shekels for each to the priests (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/18-15.htm" title="Every thing that opens the matrix in all flesh, which they bring to the LORD, whether it be of men or beasts, shall be yours: nevertheless the firstborn of man shall you surely redeem, and the firstling of unclean beasts shall you redeem.">Numbers 18:15-16</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/exodus/13.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-13.htm" title="And every firstling of an ass you shall redeem with a lamb; and if you will not redeem it, then you shall break his neck: and all the firstborn of man among your children shall you redeem.">Exodus 13:13</a></span>. <span class="ital">Every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb — </span>Or <span class="ital">kid, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-3.htm" title="Speak you to all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb, according to the house of their fathers, a lamb for an house:">Exodus 12:3</a>; and the same is to be understood of all unclean beasts in general, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-15.htm" title="Every thing that opens the matrix in all flesh, which they bring to the LORD, whether it be of men or beasts, shall be yours: nevertheless the firstborn of man shall you surely redeem, and the firstling of unclean beasts shall you redeem.">Numbers 18:15</a>.

The firstlings of clean beasts, such as lambs, kids, and calves, if males, were to be devoted to God and employed in sacrifice. Those unclean beasts, as the ass's colt, being unfit for sacrifice, were to be redeemed (Nu 18:15).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/exodus/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The <span class="ital">ass</span> was an unclean creature, and therefore this rule was to be observed in all other unclean creatures, as appears, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

Because the first-born of all beasts were appropriated to God; and because many of them were unclean, and so could not be sacrificed, there was no other way of offering them to God, but by redemption, or a price paid for them. And the single exception of the price of a dog in this case, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-18.htm" title="You shall not bring the hire of a whore, or the price of a dog, into the house of the LORD your God for any vow: for even both these are abomination to the LORD your God.">Deu 23:18</a></span>, doth sufficiently intimate that the price of all other unclean creatures was allowed and required. The ass alone is here named for all the rest, because this creature was most common, and most useful, and yet was not to be spared; whence it was easy to infer, that this course was much rather to be observed in other creatures which were of less use. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Thou shalt break his neck; </span> or, <span class="ital">cut off his neck, or head</span>, as the word is used, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-4.htm" title="And the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer to a rough valley, which is neither eared nor sown, and shall strike off the heifer's neck there in the valley:">Deu 21:4</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-3.htm" title="He that kills an ox is as if he slew a man; he that sacrifices a lamb, as if he cut off a dog's neck; he that offers an oblation, as if he offered swine's blood; he that burns incense, as if he blessed an idol.

Which was given to the priest for it; and according to the Jewish canon (f), it might be redeemed with that only;"not with a calf, nor with an animal (a goat or a ram, as Bartenora interprets it), nor with a lamb slain, or torn to pieces.''Jarchi thinks the ass only was to be redeemed, and not the firstling of any other unclean creature, but his reasons are insufficient; all unclean creatures, as horses, camels, dogs, swine, &amp;c. are included in it, as should seem from <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-15.htm">Numbers 18:15</a> and this is the rather particularly mentioned, because there was a greater plenty of them than of horses and camels, and because they were very useful creatures; and if these were to be redeemed, then much more those of less value, and less useful. Hence might arise the story and calumny, as some have thought, of the Jews worshipping an ass's head: <p>and if thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shall break its neck; cut off its head on the back of the neck with a knife or cleaver, such as butchers use, as the Misnah (g), and its commentators, interpret it, so that the owner should have no profit by it: <p>and all the firstborn of man amongst thy children shall thou redeem; with the price of five shekels of the sanctuary, and within thirty days of the birth of it, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-16.htm">Numbers 18:16</a> and these being to be redeemed as the unclean beasts were, shows that men are by nature unclean, and even the firstborn, whose names are written in heaven, the elect of God, and need redemption by the blood of the Lamb. <p>(f) Misn.
