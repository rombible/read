The Israelites marched, it is implied, some part of each day and some part of each night, which would be in accordance with modern practice, and is an arrangement introduced to get the march accomplished before the sun attains his full power. The pillar was at once a signal and a guide.

It was great satisfaction to Moses and the pious Israelites, to be sure that they were under Divine guidance. Those who make the glory of God their end, and the word of God their rule, the Spirit of God the guide of their affections, and the providence of God the guide of their affairs, may be sure that the Lord goes before them, though they cannot see it with their eyes: we must now live by faith. When Israel marched, this pillar went before, and pointed out the place of encampment, as Divine Wisdom saw fit. It sheltered by day from the heat, and gave light by night. The Bible is a light to our feet, a lantern to our paths, with which the Saviour's love has provided us. It testifies of Christ. It is to us like the pillar to the Israelites. Listen to that voice which cries, I am the Light of the world; he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the Light of life, Joh 8:12.

The fiery cloud thus formed an imposing visible symbol of the spiritual presence of God, guiding (J), protecting (P), or (E) speaking in Israel, during its journey through the wilderness. But, as in other cases, the symbolism had no doubt some natural basis; and it is thought by Di., McNeile and others that it was suggested by the variously attested custom of a brazier filled with burning wood being borne along at the head of a caravan of pilgrims, or an army (see reff. in Di. and McN.), or of a chief having a fire blazing before his tent (T. H. Weir, <span class="ital">Expositor</span>, July 1910, p. 81 f.), or carried before him (cf. Ebers, <span class="ital">Gosen</span>, 530, 2544).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 21, 22.</span> - THE PILLAR OF THE CLOUD AND OF FIRE. Having stated, in verse 17, that "God led the Israelites," and determined their route for them, the writer here proceeds to explain how this leading was accomplished. With extreme simplicity and directness he states, that the conduct was effected by means of an appearance, which in the daytime was like a column or pillar of smoke ascending from earth to heaven, and in the night was like a pillar of fire. He considers the presence of God to have been in the pillar, which moved in front of the host, and showed them the way that they were to go. When it halted, they halted when it advanced, they advanced. Their journeys being made as much in the night-time as in the day, on account of the intense heat, the pillar took in the night the appearance of a column of fire, so as to be equally visible as by day. All attempts to give a rational explanation of the phenomenon are misplaced, since the writer, from whom alone we derive our information on the subject, clearly regarded it as miraculous; and both here and elsewhere (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-19.htm">Exodus 14:19, 20, 24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-9.htm">Exodus 33:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/12-5.htm">Numbers 12:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-11.htm">Numbers 14:11</a>) speaks of it as a form under which God was pleased to show himself. There is little doubt that fire and smoke signals were already used by commanders of armies for  much the same purpose as that which God now accomplished in this way. The Egyptian documents of the period contain indications of the usage; and it is found among the Arabians, the Greeks, and the Persians. (See especially Q. Curt. <span class="accented">Vit.</span> Alex. 5:2; "Perticam, quae undique conspici posset, supra praetorium statuit, ex qua signum eminebat pariter omnibus conspicuum: observabatur ignis noctu, fiunus interdin.") The miracle was thus, in a certain sense, founded upon an existing custom, with the difference that God here gave the signals miraculously, which were wont to be given in a natural way by the human leaders of armies. He thus constituted himself the general of the host. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord went before them</span>.

The sanctification of the first-born is enforced in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-16.htm">Exodus 13:16</a> in the same terms as the keeping of the feast of Mazzoth in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/13-9.htm">Exodus 13:9</a>, with this exception, that instead of &#1500;&#1494;&#1499;&#1512;&#1493;&#1503; we have &#1500;&#1496;&#1493;&#1496;&#1508;&#1514;, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-8.htm">Deuteronomy 6:8</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-18.htm">Deuteronomy 11:18</a>. The word &#1496;&#1493;&#1496;&#1508;&#1514; signifies neither amulet nor &#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;, but "binding" or headbands, as is evident from the Chaldee &#1496;&#1493;&#1496;&#1508;&#1488; armlet (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-10.htm">2 Samuel 1:10</a>), &#1496;&#1493;&#1496;&#1508;&#1514;&#1468;&#1488; tiara (<a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/8-15.htm">Esther 8:15</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-17.htm">Ezekiel 24:17</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-23.htm">Ezekiel 24:23</a>). This command was interpreted literally by the Talmudists, and the use of tephillim, phylacteries (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-5.htm">Matthew 23:5</a>), founded upon it;<p>(Note: Possibly these scrolls were originally nothing more than a literal compliance with the figurative expression, or a change of the figure into a symbol, so that the custom did not arise from a pure misunderstanding; though at a later period the symbolical character gave place more and more to the casual misinterpretation. On the phylacteries generally, see my Archologie and Herzog's Cycl.)<p>the Caraites, on the contrary, interpreted it figuratively, as a proverbial expression for constant reflection upon, and fulfilment of, the divine commands. The correctness of the latter is obvious from the words themselves, which do not say that the commands are to be written upon scrolls, but only that they are to be to the Israelites for signs upon the hand, and for bands between the eyes, i.e., they are to be kept in view like memorials upon the forehead and the hand. The expression in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-8.htm">Deuteronomy 6:8</a>, "Thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes," does not point at all to the symbolizing of the divine commands by an outward sign to be worn upon the hand, or to bands with passages of the law inscribed upon them, to be worn on the forehead between the eyes; nor does the "advance in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-8.htm">Deuteronomy 6:8</a> from heart to word, and from word to hand or act," necessarily lead to the peculiar notion of Schultz, that "the sleeve and turban were to be used as reminders of the divine commands, the former by being fastened to the hand in a peculiar way, the latter by an end being brought down upon the forehead." The line of thought referred to merely expresses the idea, that the Israelites were not only to retain the commands of God in their hearts, and to confess them with the mouth, but to fulfil them with the hand, or in act and deed, and thus to show themselves in their whole bearing as the guardians and observers of the law. As the hand is the medium of action, and carrying in the hand represents handling, so the space between the eyes, or the forehead, is that part of the body which is generally visible, and what is worn there is worn to be seen. This figurative interpretation is confirmed and placed beyond doubt by such parallel passages as <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-3.htm">Proverbs 3:3</a>, "Bind them (the commandments) about thy neck; write them upon the tables of thine heart" (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-21.htm">Proverbs 3:21</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-22.htm">Proverbs 3:22</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-21.htm">Exodus 4:21</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/6-21.htm">Exodus 6:21-22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-3.htm">Exodus 7:3</a>). </body></html>
