Thus should we serve God, and our superiors also, in all things lawful. Thus should all who are in public trusts abhor filthy lucre, and avoid all occasions and temptations to covetousness. Where have we the representation of God's love towards us, that we by love dwell in him and he in us, save in Emmanuel? Mt 1:23. This is the sum of the ministry of reconciliation, 2Co 5:18,19. This was the design of the tabernacle of witness, a visible testimony of the love of God to the race of men, however they were fallen from their first state. And this love was shown by Christ's taking up his abode on earth; by the Word being made flesh, Joh 1:14, wherein, as the original expresses it, he did tabernacle among us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/36.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the notes to <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/26.htm">Exodus 26</a>. <p>See the notes to <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/25.htm">Exodus 25</a>. <p>For <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/38-1.htm">Exodus 38:1-7</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/38-9.htm">Exodus 38:9-20</a> see the notes to <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/27.htm">Exodus 27</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/exodus/36.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>37. made an hanging for the &#8230; door&#8212;Curtains of elaborately wrought needlework are often suspended over the entrance to tents of the great nomad sheiks, and throughout Persia, at the entrance of summer tents, mosques, and palaces.

This chapter contains an instructive narrative: it is the first instance of donations made for the worship of God, given from the wages of the people's sufferings and toils. They were acceptable to God (Php 4:18), and if the Israelites showed such liberality, how much more should those whose privilege it is to live under the Christian dispensation (1Co 6:20; 16:2).   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/exodus/36.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This <span class="ital">door</span> divided the holy place from the court. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/exodus/36.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And every wise hearted man among them that wrought the work of the tabernacle,....
