It states, in brief, that Bezaleel and Aholiab, with the skilled workmen at their disposal, proceeded to the accomplishment of the work which Moses had committed to them, and effected it “according to all that the Lord had commanded.” <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>according to the instructions given to Moses in Mount Sinai, and recorded in Exodus 25-30. The entire section is little more than a repetition of those chapters, differing from them merely in recording as done that which had in them been ordered to be done. The minute exactness of the repetition is very remarkable, and seems intended to teach the important lesson, that acceptable obedience consists in a complete and exact observance of God’s commandments in all respects down to the minutest point.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/36.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>36:1-38 The making of the tabernacle The liberality of the people restrained. - The readiness and zeal with which these builders set about their work, the exactness with which they performed it, and the faithfulness with which they objected to receive more contributions, are worthy of our imitation. Thus should we serve God, and our superiors also, in all things lawful. Thus should all who are in public trusts abhor filthy lucre, and avoid all occasions and temptations to covetousness. Where have we the representation of God's love towards us, that we by love dwell in him and he in us, save in Emmanuel? Mt 1:23. This is the sum of the ministry of reconciliation, 2Co 5:18,19. This was the design of the tabernacle of witness, a visible testimony of the love of God to the race of men, however they were fallen from their first state. And this love was shown by Christ's taking up his abode on earth; by the Word being made flesh, Joh 1:14, wherein, as the original expresses it, he did tabernacle among us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/36.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the notes to <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/26.htm">Exodus 26</a>. <p>See the notes to <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/25.htm">Exodus 25</a>. <p>For <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/38-1.htm">Exodus 38:1-7</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/38-9.htm">Exodus 38:9-20</a> see the notes to <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/27.htm">Exodus 27</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/exodus/36.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 36<p>Ex 36:1-38.

No unnecessary delay was allowed to take place; and from the moment the first pole was stuck in the ground till the final completion of the sacred edifice, he and his associates labored with all the energies both of mind and body engaged in the work. And what was the mainspring of their arduous and untiring diligence? They could be actuated by none of the ordinary motives that give impulse to human industry, by no desire for the acquisition of gain; no ambition for honor; no view of gratifying a mere love of power in directing the labors of a large body of men. They felt the stimulus&#8212;the strong irresistible impulse of higher and holier motives&#8212;obedience to the authority, zeal for the glory, and love to the service of God.Moses comitteth the work to Bezaleel and Aholiab <span class="bld"> Exo 36 1-4</span>.

Bezaleel and Aholiab felt that the time for action was now come. They at once addressed themselves to their task. Moses delivered into their hands all the various offerings which the people, rich and poor, had brought in (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/35-21.htm">Exodus 35:21-29</a>); and skilled workmen were immediately called upon to shape it for the designed uses. The fact of the work being commenced did not stop the inflow of gifts. More and yet more continued to be brought "every morning" (ver. 3). At last it became clear that the supply had exceeded the demand; and the workmen reported so to Moses (vers. 4, 5), who thereupon commanded that the offerings should cease (ver. 6). The progress of the work is then reported in detail, and in the following order: - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> The covering for the tabernacle (vers. 8-13); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> The goats' hair covering for the tent above the tabernacle (vers. 14-18); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> The outer coverings of rams' skins and seals' skins (ver. 19); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">4.</span> The boards for the walls of the tabernacle (vers. 20-30); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">5.</span> The bars for the boards (vers. 31-34); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">6.</span> The veil of the most holy place (vers. 35, 30); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">7.</span> The hanging for the entrance to the tabernacle (vers. 37, 38). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The chapter, from ver. 8, runs parallel with ch. 26, differing from it mainly in describing as made that which in ch. 26. is ordered to be made. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then wrought Bezaleel,</span> etc. This is introductory to the entire sub-section, which extends to the end of ch. 39. It means - "Then, under the direction of Bezaleel and Aholiab, began the work of constructing that place of meeting for which commandment had been given to Moses in the mount." The master-craftsmen, and those under them, "wrought," and took care that all was done <span class="cmt_word">according to all that the Lord had commanded.</span> It is to mark the exactitude of the obedience that chs. 36. - 39, follow so closely, and with such minuteness, the wording of chs. 26. - 28. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/exodus/35.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Moses then informed the people that God had called Bezaleel and Aholiab as master-builders, to complete the building and all the work connected with it, and had not only endowed them with His Spirit, that they might draw the plans for the different works and carry them out, but "had put it into his (Bezaleel's) heart to teach" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/35-34.htm">Exodus 35:34</a>), that is to say, had qualified him to instruct labourers to prepare the different articles under his supervision and guidance. "He and Aholiab" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/35-34.htm">Exodus 35:34</a>) are in apposition to "his heart:" into his and Aholiab's heart (see Ges. 121, 3; Ewald, 311 a). The concluding words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/35-35.htm">Exodus 35:35</a> are in apposition to &#1488;&#1514;&#1501; (them): "them hath He filled with wisdom...as performers of every kind of work and inventors of designs," i.e., that they may make every kind of work and may invent designs. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/36-1.htm">Exodus 36:1</a>, &#1493;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; with vav consec. is dependent upon what precedes, and signifies either, "and so will make," or, so that he will make (see Ewald, 342 b). The idea is this, "Bezaleel, Aholiab, and the other men who understand, into whom Jehovah has infused (&#1489;&#1468; &#1504;&#1514;&#1503;) wisdom and understanding, that they may know how to do, shall do every work for the holy service (worship) with regard to (&#1500; as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/28-38.htm">Exodus 28:38</a>, etc.) all that Jehovah has commanded." </body></html>
