Thus should we serve God, and our superiors also, in all things lawful. Thus should all who are in public trusts abhor filthy lucre, and avoid all occasions and temptations to covetousness. Where have we the representation of God's love towards us, that we by love dwell in him and he in us, save in Emmanuel? Mt 1:23. This is the sum of the ministry of reconciliation, 2Co 5:18,19. This was the design of the tabernacle of witness, a visible testimony of the love of God to the race of men, however they were fallen from their first state. And this love was shown by Christ's taking up his abode on earth; by the Word being made flesh, Joh 1:14, wherein, as the original expresses it, he did tabernacle among us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/36.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the notes to <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/26.htm">Exodus 26</a>. <p>See the notes to <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/25.htm">Exodus 25</a>. <p>For <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/38-1.htm">Exodus 38:1-7</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/38-9.htm">Exodus 38:9-20</a> see the notes to <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/27.htm">Exodus 27</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/exodus/36.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. they spake unto Moses, saying, The people bring much more than enough, &c.&#8212;By the calculations which the practised eyes of the workmen enabled them to make, they were unanimously of the opinion that the supply already far exceeded the demand and that no more contributions were required. Such a report reflects the highest honor on their character as men of the strictest honor and integrity, who, notwithstanding they had command of an untold amount of the most precious things and might, without any risk of human discovery, have appropriated much to their own use, were too high principled for such acts of peculation. Forthwith, a proclamation was issued to stop further contributions [Ex 36:6].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/exodus/36.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/exodus/36.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make it,....
