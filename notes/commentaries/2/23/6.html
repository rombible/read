Comparing <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-6.htm">Exodus 23:6</a> with <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/23-3.htm">Exodus 23:3</a>, it was the part of the judge to defend the poor against the oppression of the rich, and the part of the witness to take care lest his feelings of natural pity should tempt him to falsify evidence.<p>(b) To be cautious of inflicting capital punishment on one whose guilt was not clearly proved. A doubtful case was rather to be left to God Himself, who would "not justify the wicked," nor suffer him to go unpunished though he might be acquitted by an earthly tribunal. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-7.htm">Exodus 23:7</a>.<p>(c) To take no bribe or present which might in any way pervert judgment <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-8.htm">Exodus 23:8</a>; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-15.htm">Numbers 16:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-3.htm">1 Samuel 12:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-26.htm">Acts 26:26</a>.<p>(d) To vindicate the rights of the stranger <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-9.htm">Exodus 23:9</a> - rather, the foreigner.

This verse is a repetition of <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/22-21.htm">Exodus 22:21</a>, but the precept is there addressed to the people at large, while it is here addressed to the judges in reference to their official duties. The caution was perpetually necessary. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-7.htm">Ezekiel 22:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-5.htm">Malachi 3:5</a>.

As the poor man was not to be favoured when his cause was bad through an affected pity for him as a poor man, so his judgment was not to be wrested or perverted, when his cause was good, because of his poverty; which is too often the case, through the power of rich men, and the prevalence of their gifts and bribes, and to curry favour with them: the phrase, "thy poor", is very emphatic, and intended to engage judges to regard them, as being of the same flesh and blood with them, of the same nation and religion; and who were particularly committed to their care and protection under God, who is the Judge and protector of the poor, of the widow and the fatherless. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/exodus/23.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Thou shalt not wrest the judgment of thy poor in his cause.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/exodus/23.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">6</span>.
