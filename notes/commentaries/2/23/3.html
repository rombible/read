Justice must hold her scales even, and be proof equally against a paltry fear of the rich and a weak compassion for the indigent. The cause alone is to be considered, not the persons. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-15.htm" title="You shall do no unrighteousness in judgment: you shall not respect the person of the poor, nor honor the person of the mighty: but in righteousness shall you judge your neighbor.">Leviticus 19:15</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/exodus/23.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-3.htm" title="Neither shall you countenance a poor man in his cause.">Exodus 23:3</a></span>. <span class="ital">Neither shalt thou countenance — </span>Hebrew, <span class="ital">honour or favour; a poor man in his cause. </span>Thus we are properly cautioned against an opposite error which we may be also in danger of falling into, that of respecting the poor man’s cause, out of pity and compassion, when the cause of the richer man is more just. For however great the compassion of God may be for the poor, and how much soever he may recommend them to our care and protection, he would not have our tenderness for them carry us to countenance them unjustly, or give a wrong judgment for their sakes. The meaning of this and the former verse is, that there must be no respect of persons, whether rich or poor, but an impartial consideration of the cause.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/23.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>23:1-9 In the law of Moses are very plain marks of sound moral feeling, and of true political wisdom.

After the many precepts in favour of the poor, this injunction produces a sort of shock. But it is to be understood as simply forbidding any undue favouring of the poor because they are poor, and so as equivalent to the precept in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-15.htm">Leviticus 19:15</a>, "Thou shalt not respect the person of the poor." In courts of justice, strict justice is to be rendered, without any leaning either towards the rich, or towards the poor. To lean either way is to pervert judgment. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/exodus/22.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"Thou shalt not despise God, and the prince among thy people thou shalt not curse." Elohim does not mean either the gods of other nations, as Josephus, Philo, and others, in their dead and work-holy monotheism, have rendered the word; or the rulers, as Onkelos and others suppose; but simply God, deity in general, whose majesty was despised in every break of the commandments of Jehovah, and who was to be honoured in the persons of the rulers (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-21.htm">Proverbs 24:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-17.htm">1 Peter 2:17</a>). Contempt of God consists not only in blasphemies of Jehovah openly expressed, which were to be punished with death (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/24-11.htm">Leviticus 24:11</a>.), but in disregard of His threats with reference to the oppression of the poorer members of His people (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/22-22.htm">Exodus 22:22-27</a>), and in withholding from them what they ought to receive (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/22-29.htm">Exodus 22:29-31</a>). Understood in this way, the command is closely connected not only with what precedes, but also with what follows. The prince (&#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1488;, lit., the elevated one) is mentioned by the side of God, because in his exalted position he has to administer the law of God among His people, and to put a stop to what is wrong. </body></html>
