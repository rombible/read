From <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-1.htm" title="You shall not raise a false report: put not your hand with the wicked to be an unrighteous witness.">Exodus 23:1</a> to <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-9.htm" title="Also you shall not oppress a stranger: for you know the heart of a stranger, seeing you were strangers in the land of Egypt.">Exodus 23:9</a> no kind of sequence in the laws can be traced; from <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-10.htm" title="And six years you shall sow your land, and shall gather in the fruits thereof:">Exodus 23:10</a> to the first clause of <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-19.htm" title="The first of the first fruits of your land you shall bring into the house of the LORD your God. You shall not seethe a kid in his mother's milk.">Exodus 23:19</a> there is, on the contrary, a certain connection, since the laws enunciated are concerned with ceremonial observance. The closing law, however, is not ceremonial, but the prohibition of a practice considered to be cruel. On the whole, it may be said that The Book of the Covenant maintains its unsystematic character to the close. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/20-22.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Thus you shall say to the children of Israel, You have seen that I have talked with you from heaven.">Exodus 20:22-26</a>.)<p>(1) Thou shalt not raise a false report.—The LXX. and Vulg. Translate, “Thou shalt not <span class= "ital">receive </span>a false report”—<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>give it credit, accept it as true, and act upon it. This meaning accords well with the succeeding clause, which forbids our giving support to the false testimony of others. In both clauses the principle of the ninth commandment is extended from principals to accessories.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/exodus/23.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-1.htm" title="You shall not raise a false report: put not your hand with the wicked to be an unrighteous witness.">Exodus 23:1</a></span>. <span class="ital">Thou shalt not raise — </span>Or, <span class="ital">receive, </span>as the margin reads it, and as the Hebrew <span class="greekheb">תשׂא</span><span class="ital">, tissa, </span>also signifies, or, <span class="ital">give credit to a false report. </span>Sometimes the <span class="ital">receiver, </span>in this case, is as bad as the <span class="ital">thief: </span>and a backbiting tongue would not do so much mischief if it were not countenanced.

Of a neighbour, or of any man whatever, either secretly by private slanders, whispers, backbiting and tale bearing, by innuendos, detracting from his good name and credit, suggesting things false and wicked concerning him; or publicly in a court of judicature, bringing a false accusation, laying a false charge, and bearing a false testimony against him: or "thou shall not receive a false report" (p); if there were not so many, that say, Report, and we will report it, that are ready to receive every ill thing of their neighbours, there would not be so many that would raise such ill things of them; everything of this kind should be discountenanced, and especially by judges in courts of judicature, who are chiefly spoken to and of in the context; these should not easily admit every charge and accusation brought; nor bear, or endure a false report, as the word also signifies, but discourage, and even punish it: <p>put not thine hand with the wicked to be an unrighteous witness; which is not a gesture used in swearing, such as with us, of putting the hand upon a book, which did not obtain so early; nor is there any instance of this kind in Scripture; the gesture used in swearing was either putting the hand under the thigh, which yet is questionable, or lifting of it up to heaven; but here it is expressive of confederacy, of joining hand in hand to carry on a prosecution in an unrighteous way, by bearing false testimony against another; and such were to be guarded against, and not admitted to give evidence in a cause, even a man that is known to be a wicked man, or to have been an unrighteous witness before; on the one hand, a man should be careful of joining with him in a testimony that is unrighteous; and, on the other hand, judges should take care not to suffer such to be witnesses. The Jews say (q), that everyone that is condemned to be scourged, or has been scourged for some crime committed, is reckoned a wicked man, and he is not to be admitted a witness, nor his testimony taken. <p>(p)  "non suscipies", V.
