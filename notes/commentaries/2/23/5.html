If a man sees his enemy’s ass prostrate under its burthen, he is to help to raise it up. In this case he owes a double duty—(1) to his enemy, and (2) to the suffering animal. Geddes’ emendation of <span class= "ital">’azar </span>for ’<span class= "ital">azab, </span>in all the three places where the verb occurs, is the simplest and best of those suggested. The passage would then run: “If thou see the ass of him that hateth thee lying under his burthen, and wouldest forbear to help it, thou shalt surely help with him”—<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the owner.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/exodus/23.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-5.htm" title="If you see the ass of him that hates you lying under his burden, and would forbear to help him, you shall surely help with him.">Exodus 23:5</a></span>. <span class="ital">And wouldest forbear to help him — </span>The duty inculcated in this verse is inculcated also <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-4.htm" title="You shall not see your brother's ass or his ox fall down by the way, and hide yourself from them: you shall surely help him to lift them up again.">Deuteronomy 22:4</a>, although not in the same words in the original. And the intention of both verses is plain, but the marginal reading here shows that there is some difficulty in the Hebrew text in this place. The precept, however, evidently means, whatever controversy thou hast with him that hates thee, it shall not hinder thee from succouring him or his in any distress.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/23.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>23:1-9 In the law of Moses are very plain marks of sound moral feeling, and of true political wisdom.

From that use of it, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-8.htm" title="Next to him repaired Uzziel the son of Harhaiah, of the goldsmiths. Next to him also repaired Hananiah the son of one of the apothecaries, and they fortified Jerusalem to the broad wall.">Nehemiah 3:8</a> 4:2</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2.

But if the verb did signify only <span class="ital">to leave</span>, it may be thus rendered according to the Hebrew words, <span class="ital">then</span>, or <span class="ital">therefore</span>, or <span class="ital">surely</span> (for all these ways the Hebrew particle <span class="ital">vau</span> is used) thou shalt forbear to leave it, to wit, the ass groaning under his burden, or the lifting up of the ass and burden, to him alone; but if thou wilt be leaving, I will appoint thee a better object for it, thou shalt surely leave or lay aside what thou hast against him, i.e. whatsoever controversy thou hast with him, that shall not hinder thee from succouring him or his in any distress. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Hebrew preposition <span class="ital">in</span>, doth oft signify <span class="ital">against</span>, as <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/26-20.htm" title="And the herdsmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac's herdsmen, saying, The water is ours: and he called the name of the well Esek; because they strove with him.">Genesis 26:20</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/85-4.htm" title="Turn us, O God of our salvation, and cause your anger toward us to cease.">Psalm 85:4</a> 94:16 <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-8.htm" title="The watchman of Ephraim was with my God: but the prophet is a snare of a fowler in all his ways, and hatred in the house of his God.">Hosea 9:8</a></span>. And it is a concise or short way of speaking, which is very common in the Hebrew language, against him, for what thou hast against him. Or thus, and <span class="ital">wouldest forbear to leave</span>, to wit, thy business which thou art going about, <span class="ital">for him</span>, i.e. for the sake of him who is thy enemy, as the Hebrew preposition tamed is oft used, as <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-25.htm" title="And took off their chariot wheels, that they drove them heavily: so that the Egyptians said, Let us flee from the face of Israel; for the LORD fights for them against the Egyptians.">Exodus 14:25</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/25-13.htm" title="And he shall have it, and his seed after him, even the covenant of an everlasting priesthood; because he was zealous for his God, and made an atonement for the children of Israel.">Numbers 25:13</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-14.htm" title="And there was no day like that before it or after it, that the LORD listened to the voice of a man: for the LORD fought for Israel.">Joshua 10:14</a></span>, &c.; thou shalt repress those malicious desires, and <span class="ital">thou shalt surely leave</span> it to be, or to tarry, or to help <span class="ital">with him</span> to lift up the ass. So there is only an ellipsis of the verb, which is most common in the Hebrew tongue. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/exodus/23.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>If thou see the ass of him that hateth thee lying under his burden,.... Fallen down, and such a burden upon him that he cannot rise up again, but lies under it, and the owner of it is not able of himself to raise it up again: <p>and wouldst forbear to help him; show an inclination to pass on without giving him any assistance to get up his beast again; or "wouldst thou forbear to help him?" (w) as Jarchi, and others, read with an interrogation, could it be in thine heart to forbear helping him? couldest thou go on, and take no notice of him and his case, and not join him in endeavouring to get up his beast again, that he may proceed its his journey? canst thou be so cruel and hardhearted, though he is thine enemy? but if thou art, know this: <p>thou shalt surely help with him; to get up his ass again: hence the Jewish canon runs thus (x),"if an ass is unloaded and loaded four or five times, a man is bound, i.e. to help, as it is said, "in helping thou shalt help"; if he (the owner) goes away, and sets himself down, seeing the command is upon thee, if it is thy will and pleasure to unload, unload, he is free; for it is said, with him; if he is an old man, or sick, he is bound, the command of the law is to unload, but not to load.''The words may be rendered, "in leaving thou shalt leave with him" (y); either leave or forsake thine enmity to help him, as Onkelos; or leave thy business, thou art about, to lend him an hand to raise up his beast again. <p>(w)  "num desines sublevare eum?" some in Vatablus; "cessabis auxitiari ei?"

(= AV.) of the existing text is quite impossible: <span class="ital">‘âzab</span> means to <span class="ital">leave, forsake</span>, &c., but never to ‘help.’ That of the marg. is much preferable: for the uncommon sense <span class="ital">let loose or release</span>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-36.htm" title="For the LORD shall judge his people, and repent himself for his servants, when he sees that their power is gone, and there is none shut up, or left.">Deuteronomy 32:36</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-1.htm" title="My soul is weary of my life; I will leave my complaint on myself; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.">Job 10:1</a>.

The difficulty could be removed by reading in the last clause, with Bochart, Bä., <span class="ital">thou shalt</span> <span class="bld">surely help</span> <span class="ital">with him</span> (<span class="greekheb">עזר תעזר</span> for <span class="greekheb">עזב תעזב</span>). The rend. <span class="ital">thou shalt forbear</span> is perfectly grammatical: but it is in favour of RVm. that nearly everywhere else in these laws (e.g. <span class="ital">v.</span> 4) the apodosis after <span class="ital">ki</span> is introduced by a bare impf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-4.htm" title="You shall not see your brother's ass or his ox fall down by the way, and hide yourself from them: you shall surely help him to lift them up again.">Deuteronomy 22:4</a> has, ‘thou shalt surely <span class="ital">lift</span> (them) <span class="ital">up</span> with him.’<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If thou see the ass of him that</span> <span class="cmt_word">hateth thee,</span> etc. The general meaning of the passage is clear - assistance is to be given to the fallen ass of an enemy - but the <span class="accented">exact</span> sense of both the second and third clauses is doubtful. Many renderings have been suggested; but it is not clear that any one of them is an improvement on the Authorised Version. <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt surely help with him</span>. The joint participation in an act of mercy towards a fallen beast would bring the enemies into friendly contact, and soften their feelings towards each other. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/exodus/22.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"Thy fulness and thy flowing thou shalt not delay (to Me)." &#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1492; fulness, signifies the produce of corn (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-9.htm">Deuteronomy 22:9</a>); and &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1506; (lit., tear, flowing, liquor stillans), which only occurs here, is a poetical epithet for the produce of the press, both wine and oil (cf. &#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;, lxx; arborum lacrimae, Plin. 11:6).
