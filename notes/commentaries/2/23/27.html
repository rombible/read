But they are fully confuted by Bochart, who produces many instances of nations being forced to leave their country by these and such like contemptible creatures, appealing to the testimony of Herodotus, Appianus, and Strabo. And he particularly observes, that the sting of this sort of wasp, called a <span class="ital">hornet, </span>is of all others the most pernicious; for it seldom stings a man, as Pliny says, (lib. 11. c. 21,) without throwing him into the rage of a fever.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/23.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>23:20-33 It is here promised that they should be guided and kept in their way through the wilderness to the land of promise, Behold, I send an angel before thee, mine angel. The precept joined with this promise is, that they be obedient to this angel whom God would send before them. Christ is the Angel of Jehovah; this is plainly taught by St. Paul, 1Co 10:9. They should have a comfortable settlement in the land of Canaan. How reasonable are the conditions of this promise; that they should serve the only true God; not the gods of the nations, which are no gods at all. How rich are the particulars of this promise! The comfort of their food, the continuance of their health, the increase of their wealth, the prolonging their lives to old age. Thus hath godliness the promise of the life that now is. It is promised that they should subdue their enemies. Hosts of hornets made way for the hosts of Israel; such mean creatures can God use for chastising his people's enemies. In real kindness to the church, its enemies are subdued by little and little; thus we are kept on our guard, and in continual dependence on God. Corruptions are driven out of the hearts of God's people, not all at once, but by little and little. The precept with this promise is, that they should not make friendship with idolaters. Those that would keep from bad courses, must keep from bad company. It is dangerous to live in a bad neighbourhood; others' sins will be our snares. Our greatest danger is from those who would make us sin against God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Destroy - Rather, overthrow.

"Moab was sore aft-aid of the people, because they were many" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/22-3.htm">Numbers 22:3</a>). Later it is spoken of by Rahab as general (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/2-9.htm">Joshua 2:9, 11</a>). A very signal indication of the alarm felt is given in the history of the Gibeonites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/9-3.htm">Joshua 9:3, 27</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I will make all thine enemies turn their backs unto thee</span>. For the fulfilment of this promise see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-3.htm">Numbers 21:3, 24, 35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/31-7.htm">Numbers 31:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/8-20.htm">Joshua 8:20-24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-10.htm">Joshua 10:10</a>, etc. Had their obedience been more complete, the power of the Canaanitish nations would have been more thoroughly broken, and the sufferings and servitudes related in the Book of Judges would not have had to be endured. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/exodus/23.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Relation of Jehovah to Israel. - The declaration of the rights conferred by Jehovah upon His people is closed by promises, through which, on the one hand, God insured to the nation the gifts and benefits involved in their rights, and, on the other hand, sought to promote that willingness and love which were indispensable to the fulfilment of the duties incumbent upon every individual in consequence of the rights conferred upon them. These promises secured to the people not only the protection and help of God during their journey through the desert, and in the conquest of Canaan, but also preservation and prosperity when they had taken possession of the land.<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/23-20.htm">Exodus 23:20-27</a><p>Jehovah would send an angel before them, who should guard them on the way from injury and destruction, and bring them to the place prepared for them, i.e., to Canaan. The name of Jehovah was in this angel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-21.htm">Exodus 23:21</a>), that is to say, Jehovah revealed Himself in him; and hence he is called in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/33-15.htm">Exodus 33:15-16</a>, the face of Jehovah, because the essential nature of Jehovah was manifested in him. This angel was not a created spirit, therefore, but the manifestation of Jehovah Himself, who went before them in the pillar of cloud and fire, to guide and to defend them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21</a>). But because it was Jehovah who was guiding His people in the person of the angel, He demanded unconditional obedience (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-21.htm">Exodus 23:21</a>), and if they provoked Him (&#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1512; for &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1512;, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-18.htm">Exodus 13:18</a>) by disobedience, He would not pardon their transgression; but if they followed Him and hearkened to His voice, He would be an enemy to their enemies, and an adversary to their adversaries (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-22.htm">Exodus 23:22</a>). And when the angel of the Lord had brought them to the Canaanites and exterminated the latter, Israel was still to yield the same obedience, by not serving the gods of the Canaanites, or doing after their works, i.e., by not making any idolatrous images, but destroying them (these works), and smiting to pieces the pillars of their idolatrous worship (&#1502;&#1510;&#1489;&#1514; does not mean statues erected as idols, but memorial stones or columns dedicated to idols: see my Comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-23.htm">1 Kings 14:23</a>), and serving Jehovah alone. Then would He bless them in the land with bountiful provision, health, fruitfulness, and length of life (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/23-23.htm">Exodus 23:23-26</a>). "Bread and water" are named, as being the provisions which are indispensable to the maintenance of life, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-1.htm">Isaiah 3:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-20.htm">Isaiah 30:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-16.htm">Isaiah 33:16</a>. The taking away of "sickness" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-26.htm">Exodus 15:26</a>) implied the removal of everything that could endanger life. The absence of anything that miscarried, or was barren, insured the continuance and increase of the nation; and the promise that their days should be fulfilled, i.e., that they should not be liable to a premature death (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-20.htm">Isaiah 65:20</a>), was a pledge of their well-being.</body></html>
