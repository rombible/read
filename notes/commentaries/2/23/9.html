The repetition of the law indicates the strong inclination of the Hebrew people to ill-use strangers, and the anxiety of the legislator to check their inclination.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/exodus/23.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-9.htm" title="Also you shall not oppress a stranger: for you know the heart of a stranger, seeing you were strangers in the land of Egypt.">Exodus 23:9</a></span>. <span class="ital">Thou shalt not oppress the stranger — </span>Though aliens might not inherit lands among them; yet, they must have justice done them. It is an instance of the equity of our law, that if an alien be tried for any crime, except treason, the one half of his jury, if he desire it, shall be foreigners; a kind provision that strangers may not be oppressed. <span class="ital">For ye know the heart of a stranger — </span>That is, ye know by experience what a distressed, friendless condition that of a stranger is. The disposition, dejection, and distress of his heart, make him an object of pity, not of malice or injustice. Ye know his heart is easily depressed, and very unable to bear repulses. There is a great beauty in the expression.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/23.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>23:1-9 In the law of Moses are very plain marks of sound moral feeling, and of true political wisdom. Every thing in it is suited to the desired and avowed object, the worship of one only God, and the separation of Israel from the pagan world. Neither parties, friends, witnesses, nor common opinions, must move us to lessen great faults, to aggravate small ones, excuse offenders, accuse the innocent, or misrepresent any thing.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Four precepts evidently addressed to those in authority as judges:<p>(a) To do justice to the poor. Comparing <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-6.htm">Exodus 23:6</a> with <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/23-3.htm">Exodus 23:3</a>, it was the part of the judge to defend the poor against the oppression of the rich, and the part of the witness to take care lest his feelings of natural pity should tempt him to falsify evidence.<p>(b) To be cautious of inflicting capital punishment on one whose guilt was not clearly proved. A doubtful case was rather to be left to God Himself, who would "not justify the wicked," nor suffer him to go unpunished though he might be acquitted by an earthly tribunal. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-7.htm">Exodus 23:7</a>.<p>(c) To take no bribe or present which might in any way pervert judgment <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-8.htm">Exodus 23:8</a>; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-15.htm">Numbers 16:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-3.htm">1 Samuel 12:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-26.htm">Acts 26:26</a>.<p>(d) To vindicate the rights of the stranger <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-9.htm">Exodus 23:9</a> - rather, the foreigner.

This verse is a repetition of <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/22-21.htm">Exodus 22:21</a>, but the precept is there addressed to the people at large, while it is here addressed to the judges in reference to their official duties. The caution was perpetually necessary. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-7.htm">Ezekiel 22:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-5.htm">Malachi 3:5</a>.
