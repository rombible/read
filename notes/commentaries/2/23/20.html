God is “the rewarder of them that diligently seek him.” He chooses to “reward men after their works,” and to set before them “the recompense of the reward.” He “knows whereof we are made,” and by what motives we are influenced. Self-interest, the desire of our own good, is one of the strongest of them. If Israel will keep His covenant, they will enjoy the following blessings :—(1) The guidance and protection of His angel till Canaan is reached; (2) God’s help against their adversaries, who will, little by little, be driven out; (3) the ultimate possession of the entire country between the Mediterranean and the Red Sea on the one hand, the Desert and the Euphrates on the other; (4) a blessing upon their flocks and herds, which shall neither be barren nor cast their young; and (5) a blessing upon themselves, whereby they will escape sickness and enjoy a long term of life. All these advantages, however, are conditional upon obedience, and may be forfeited.<p>(20) <span class= "bld">I send an Angel before thee.</span>—Kalisch considers Moses to have been the “angel” or “messenger;” others understand one of the created angelic host. But most commentators see in the promise the first mention of the “Angel of the Covenant,” who is reasonably identified with the Second Person of the Holy Trinity, the Eternal Son and Word of God. When the promise is retracted on account of the sin of the golden calf, it is in the words, “<span class= "ital">I </span>will not go up with thee” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-3.htm" title="To a land flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up in the middle of you; for you are a stiff necked people: lest I consume you in the way.">Exodus 33:3</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/exodus/23.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/23-20.htm" title="Behold, I send an Angel before you, to keep you in the way, and to bring you into the place which I have prepared....">Exodus 23:20-21</a></span>. <span class="ital">Behold, I send an Angel before thee </span>— The Angel of the covenant: accordingly, the Israelites, in the wilderness, are said to <span class="ital">tempt Christ. </span>It is promised that this blessed Angel should <span class="ital">keep them in the way, </span>though it lay through a wilderness first, and afterward through their enemies’ country; and thus Christ has <span class="ital">prepared a place </span>for his followers. <span class="ital">Beware of him, and obey his voice; provoke him not — </span>It is at your peril if you do; <span class="ital">for my name </span>— My nature, my authority; <span class="ital">is in him.</span><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/23.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>23:20-33 It is here promised that they should be guided and kept in their way through the wilderness to the land of promise, Behold, I send an angel before thee, mine angel. The precept joined with this promise is, that they be obedient to this angel whom God would send before them. Christ is the Angel of Jehovah; this is plainly taught by St. Paul, 1Co 10:9. They should have a comfortable settlement in the land of Canaan. How reasonable are the conditions of this promise; that they should serve the only true God; not the gods of the nations, which are no gods at all. How rich are the particulars of this promise! The comfort of their food, the continuance of their health, the increase of their wealth, the prolonging their lives to old age. Thus hath godliness the promise of the life that now is. It is promised that they should subdue their enemies. Hosts of hornets made way for the hosts of Israel; such mean creatures can God use for chastising his people's enemies. In real kindness to the church, its enemies are subdued by little and little; thus we are kept on our guard, and in continual dependence on God. Corruptions are driven out of the hearts of God's people, not all at once, but by little and little. The precept with this promise is, that they should not make friendship with idolaters. Those that would keep from bad courses, must keep from bad company. It is dangerous to live in a bad neighbourhood; others' sins will be our snares. Our greatest danger is from those who would make us sin against God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>An Angel - See <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/3-2.htm">Exodus 3:2</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/5-13.htm">Joshua 5:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-9.htm">Isaiah 63:9</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/exodus/23.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20-25.

Not a created angel, but the uncreated one, the Angel of God's presence, that was with the Israelites at Sinai, and in the wilderness; who saved, redeemed, bore, and carried them all the days of old, whom they rebelled against and tempted in the wilderness; as appears by all the characters after given of him, which by no means agree with a created angel: Aben Ezra observes, that some say this is the book of the law, because it is said, "my name is in him", or "in the midst of it"; others say, the ark of the covenant; but he says this angel is Michael; and if indeed by Michael is intended the uncreated angel, as he always is in Scripture, he is right: Jarchi remarks, that their Rabbins say, this is Metatron, whose name is as the name of his master; Metatron, by gematry, is Shaddai, which signifies almighty or all-sufficient, and is an epithet of the divine Being; and Metatron seems to be a corruption of the word "mediator": some of the ancient Jewish writers say (k), this is the Angel that is the Redeemer of the world, and the keeper of the children of men: and Philo the Jew (l) applies the word unto the divine Logos, and says,"he (God) uses the divine Word as the guide of the way; for the oracle is, "behold, I send my Angel", &amp;c.''which agrees with what follows: <p>to keep thee in the way, and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared; to preserve the Israelites in their journey through the wilderness, from all their enemies that should set upon them, and to bring them safe at last to the land of Canaan, which he had appointed for them, and promised to them, and had prepared both in his purpose and gift for them, and would make way for their settlement in it by driving out the nations before them. <p>(k) In Zohar in Gen. fol. 124. 4.

God always places before men" the recompense of the reward." He does not require of them that they should serve him for nought. The "Book of the Covenant" appropriately ends with a number of promises, which God undertakes to perform, if Israel keeps the terms of the covenant. The promises are: - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> That he will send an angel before them to be their guide, director, and helper (vers. 20 - 23). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> That he will be the enemy of their enemies (ver. 22), striking terror into them miraculously (ver. 27), and subjecting them to other scourges also (ver. 28). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> That he will drive out their enemies "by little and little" (ver. 30), not ceasing until he has destroyed them (ver. 23). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">4.</span> That he will give them the entire country between the Red Sea and the Mediterranean on the one hand, the Desert and the Euphrates on the other (ver. 31). And <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">5.</span> That he will bless their sustenance, avert sickness from them, cause them to multiply, and prolong their days upon earth (vers. 25, 26). At the same time, all these promises - except the first - are made conditional. If they will "beware" of the angel and "obey his voice," then he will drive their enemies out (vers. 22, 23): if they will serve Jehovah, and destroy the idols of the nations, then he will multiply them, and give them health and long life (vers. 24-26), and "set their bounds from the Red Sea even unto the Sea of the Philistines, and from the desert unto the river" (ver. 31). So far as they fall short of their duties, is he entitled to fall short of his promises. A reciprocity is established. Unless they keep their engagements, he is not bound to keep his. Though the negative side is not entered upon, this is sufficiently clear. None of the promises, except  the promise to send the angel, is absolute. Their realisation depends on a strict and hearty obedience. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, I send a messenger before thee.</span> Jewish commentators regard the messenger as Moses, who, no doubt, was a specially commissioned ambassador for God, and who might, therefore, well be termed God's messenger. But the expressions - "He will not pardon your transgressions," and "My name is in him," are too high for Moses. An angel must be intended - probably "the Angel of the Covenant," - whom the best expositors identify with the Second Person of the Trinity, the Ever-Blessed Son of God. <span class="cmt_word">To keep thee in</span> <span class="cmt_word">the way</span> is not simply "to guide thee through the wilderness, and prevent thee from geographical error," but to keep thee altogether in the right path. s, to guard thy going out and thy coming m, to prevent thee from falling into any kind of wrong conduct. <span class="cmt_word">The place which I have</span> <span class="cmt_word">prepared</span> is not merely Palestine, but that place of which Palestine is the type - viz., Heaven. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-2.htm">John 14:2</a>: - "I go to prepare a place for you." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/exodus/23.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Fundamental Rights of Israel in its Religious and Theocratical Relation to Jehovah. - As the observance of the Sabbath and sabbatical year is not instituted in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/23-10.htm">Exodus 23:10-12</a>, so <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/23-14.htm">Exodus 23:14-19</a> do not contain either the original or earliest appointment of the feasts, or a complete law concerning the yearly feasts. They simply command the observance of three feasts during the year, and the appearance of the people three times in the year before the Lord; that is to say, the holding of three national assemblies to keep a feast before the Lord, or three annual pilgrimages to the sanctuary of Jehovah. The leading points are clearly set forth in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-14.htm">Exodus 23:14</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/23-17.htm">Exodus 23:17</a>, to which the other verses are subordinate. These leading points are &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;&#1497;&#1501; or rights, conferred upon the people of Israel in their relation to Jehovah; for keeping a feast to the Lord, and appearing before Him, were both of them privileges bestowed by Jehovah upon His covenant people. Even in itself the festal rejoicing was a blessing in the midst of this life of labour, toil, and trouble; but when accompanied with the right of appearing before the Lord their God and Redeemer, to whom they were indebted for everything they had and were, it was one that no other nation enjoyed. For though they had their joyous festivals, these festivals bore the same relation to those of Israel, as the dead and worthless gods of the heathen to the living and almighty God of Israel.<p>Of the three feasts at which Israel was to appear before Jehovah, the feast of Mazzoth, or unleavened bread, is referred to as already instituted, by the words "as I have commanded thee," and "at the appointed time of the earing month," which point back to chs. 12 and 13; and all that is added here is, "ye shall not appear before My face empty." "Not empty:" i.e., not with empty hands, but with sacrificial gifts, answering to the blessing given by the Lord (<a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-16.htm">Deuteronomy 16:16-17</a>). These gifts were devoted partly to the general sacrifices of the feast, and partly to the burnt and peace-offerings which were brought by different individuals to the feasts, and applied to the sacrificial meals (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/28.htm">Numbers 28</a> and 29). This command, which related to all the feasts, and therefore is mentioned at the very outset in connection with the feast of unleavened bread, did indeed impose a duty upon Israel, but such a duty as became a source of blessing to all who performed it. The gifts demanded by God were the tribute, it is true, which the Israelites paid to their God-King, just as all Eastern nations are required to bring presents when appearing in the presence of their kings; but they were only gifts from God's own blessing, a portion of that which He had bestowed in rich abundance, and they were offered to God in such a way that the offerer was thereby more and more confirmed in the rights of covenant fellowship. The other two festivals are mentioned here for the first time, and the details are more particularly determined afterwards in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-15.htm">Leviticus 23:15</a>., and <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/28-26.htm">Numbers 28:26</a>. One was called the feast of Harvest, "of the first-fruits of thy labours which thou hast sown in the field," i.e., of thy field-labour. According to the subsequent arrangements, the first of the field-produce was to be offered to God, not the first grains of the ripe corn, but the first loaves of bread of white or wheaten flour made from the new corn (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-17.htm">Leviticus 23:17</a>.). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-22.htm">Exodus 34:22</a> it is called the "feast of Weeks," because, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-15.htm">Leviticus 23:15-16</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-9.htm">Deuteronomy 16:9</a>, it was to be kept seven weeks after the feast of Mazzoth; and the "feast of the first-fruits of wheat harvest," because the loaves of first-fruits to be offered were to be made of wheaten flour. The other of these feasts, i.e., the third in the year, is called "the feast of Ingathering, at the end of the year, in the gathering in of thy labours out of the field." This general and indefinite allusion to time was quite sufficient for the preliminary institution of the feast. In the more minute directions respecting the feasts given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-34.htm">Leviticus 23:34</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/29-12.htm">Numbers 29:12</a>, it is fixed for the fifteenth day of the seventh month, and placed on an equality with the feast of Mazzoth as a seven days' festival. &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1504;&#1492; &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1488;&#1514; does not mean after the close of the year, finito anno, any more than the corresponding expression in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/34-22.htm">Exodus 34:22</a>, &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1504;&#1492; &#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1514;, signifies at the turning of the year. The year referred to here was the so-called civil year, which began with the preparation of the ground for the harvest-sowing, and ended when all the fruits of the field and garden had been gathered in. No particular day was fixed for its commencement, nor was there any new year's festival; and even after the beginning of the earing month had been fixed upon for the commencement of the year (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-2.htm">Exodus 12:2</a>), this still remained in force, so far as all civil matters connected with the sowing and harvest were concerned; though there is no evidence that a double reckoning was carried on at the same time, or that a civil reckoning existed side by side with the religious. &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1505;&#1508;&#1468;&#1498; does not mean, "when thou hast gathered," postquam collegisti; for &#1489;&#1468; does not stand for &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;, nor has the infinitive the force of the preterite. On the contrary, the expression "at thy gathering in," i.e., when thou gatherest in, is kept indefinite both here and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-39.htm">Leviticus 23:39</a>, where the month and days in which this feast was to be kept are distinctly pointed out; and also in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-13.htm">Deuteronomy 16:13</a>, in order that the time for the feast might not be made absolutely dependent upon the complete termination of the gathering in, although as a rule it would be almost over. The gathering in of "thy labours out of the field" is not to be restricted to the vintage and gathering of fruits: this is evident not only from the expression "out of the field," which points to field-produce, but also from the clause in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-13.htm">Deuteronomy 16:13</a>, "gathering of the floor and wine-press," which shows clearly that the words refer to the gathering in of the whole of the year's produce of corn, fruit, oil, and wine. </body></html>
