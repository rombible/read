The precept joined with this promise is, that they be obedient to this angel whom God would send before them. Christ is the Angel of Jehovah; this is plainly taught by St. Paul, 1Co 10:9. They should have a comfortable settlement in the land of Canaan. How reasonable are the conditions of this promise; that they should serve the only true God; not the gods of the nations, which are no gods at all. How rich are the particulars of this promise! The comfort of their food, the continuance of their health, the increase of their wealth, the prolonging their lives to old age. Thus hath godliness the promise of the life that now is. It is promised that they should subdue their enemies. Hosts of hornets made way for the hosts of Israel; such mean creatures can God use for chastising his people's enemies. In real kindness to the church, its enemies are subdued by little and little; thus we are kept on our guard, and in continual dependence on God. Corruptions are driven out of the hearts of God's people, not all at once, but by little and little. The precept with this promise is, that they should not make friendship with idolaters. Those that would keep from bad courses, must keep from bad company. It is dangerous to live in a bad neighbourhood; others' sins will be our snares. Our greatest danger is from those who would make us sin against God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Beast of the field - i. e. destructive animals. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/exodus/23.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>29, 30.

But only one is here specified&#8212;the danger lest, in the unoccupied grounds, wild beasts should inconveniently multiply; a clear proof that the promised land was more than sufficient to contain the actual population of the Israelites.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/exodus/23.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/exodus/23.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>By little and little I will drive them out from before thee,.... Not the beasts of the field, but the inhabitants of Canaan, who were left partly to keep up the cities and towns, that they might not fall to ruin, and to till the land, that it might not be desolate; and partly to be trials and exercises to the people of Israel, and to prove whether they would serve the Lord or not. Just as the corruptions of human nature remain with the people of God when converted, for the trial and exercise of their graces, and that they may have their dependence not on themselves, but on the grace of God to keep them in his ways, and to preserve them safe to eternal glory; and by completing the work of grace, which is gradually done, they might be made meet for it: <p>until thou be increased, and inherit the land; for as their enemies were driven out gradually, by little and little, so they multiplied gradually, until at length they became a sufficient number to fill all the cities and towns in all the nations of Canaan, and take an entire possession of it, as their inheritance given unto them by God. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/exodus/23.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">By little and little I will drive them out from before thee, until thou be increased, and inherit the land.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/exodus/23.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Relation of Jehovah to Israel. - The declaration of the rights conferred by Jehovah upon His people is closed by promises, through which, on the one hand, God insured to the nation the gifts and benefits involved in their rights, and, on the other hand, sought to promote that willingness and love which were indispensable to the fulfilment of the duties incumbent upon every individual in consequence of the rights conferred upon them. These promises secured to the people not only the protection and help of God during their journey through the desert, and in the conquest of Canaan, but also preservation and prosperity when they had taken possession of the land.<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/23-20.htm">Exodus 23:20-27</a><p>Jehovah would send an angel before them, who should guard them on the way from injury and destruction, and bring them to the place prepared for them, i.e., to Canaan. The name of Jehovah was in this angel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-21.htm">Exodus 23:21</a>), that is to say, Jehovah revealed Himself in him; and hence he is called in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/33-15.htm">Exodus 33:15-16</a>, the face of Jehovah, because the essential nature of Jehovah was manifested in him. This angel was not a created spirit, therefore, but the manifestation of Jehovah Himself, who went before them in the pillar of cloud and fire, to guide and to defend them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21</a>). But because it was Jehovah who was guiding His people in the person of the angel, He demanded unconditional obedience (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-21.htm">Exodus 23:21</a>), and if they provoked Him (&#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1512; for &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1512;, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-18.htm">Exodus 13:18</a>) by disobedience, He would not pardon their transgression; but if they followed Him and hearkened to His voice, He would be an enemy to their enemies, and an adversary to their adversaries (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-22.htm">Exodus 23:22</a>). And when the angel of the Lord had brought them to the Canaanites and exterminated the latter, Israel was still to yield the same obedience, by not serving the gods of the Canaanites, or doing after their works, i.e., by not making any idolatrous images, but destroying them (these works), and smiting to pieces the pillars of their idolatrous worship (&#1502;&#1510;&#1489;&#1514; does not mean statues erected as idols, but memorial stones or columns dedicated to idols: see my Comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-23.htm">1 Kings 14:23</a>), and serving Jehovah alone. Then would He bless them in the land with bountiful provision, health, fruitfulness, and length of life (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/23-23.htm">Exodus 23:23-26</a>). "Bread and water" are named, as being the provisions which are indispensable to the maintenance of life, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-1.htm">Isaiah 3:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-20.htm">Isaiah 30:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-16.htm">Isaiah 33:16</a>. The taking away of "sickness" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-26.htm">Exodus 15:26</a>) implied the removal of everything that could endanger life. The absence of anything that miscarried, or was barren, insured the continuance and increase of the nation; and the promise that their days should be fulfilled, i.e., that they should not be liable to a premature death (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-20.htm">Isaiah 65:20</a>), was a pledge of their well-being.</body></html>
