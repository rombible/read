Comparing <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-6.htm">Exodus 23:6</a> with <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/23-3.htm">Exodus 23:3</a>, it was the part of the judge to defend the poor against the oppression of the rich, and the part of the witness to take care lest his feelings of natural pity should tempt him to falsify evidence.<p>(b) To be cautious of inflicting capital punishment on one whose guilt was not clearly proved. A doubtful case was rather to be left to God Himself, who would "not justify the wicked," nor suffer him to go unpunished though he might be acquitted by an earthly tribunal. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-7.htm">Exodus 23:7</a>.<p>(c) To take no bribe or present which might in any way pervert judgment <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-8.htm">Exodus 23:8</a>; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-15.htm">Numbers 16:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-3.htm">1 Samuel 12:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-26.htm">Acts 26:26</a>.<p>(d) To vindicate the rights of the stranger <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-9.htm">Exodus 23:9</a> - rather, the foreigner.

This verse is a repetition of <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/22-21.htm">Exodus 22:21</a>, but the precept is there addressed to the people at large, while it is here addressed to the judges in reference to their official duties. The caution was perpetually necessary. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-7.htm">Ezekiel 22:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-5.htm">Malachi 3:5</a>.

"Put not thine hand with a wicked man (do not offer him thy hand, or render him assistance), to be a witness of violence." This clause is unquestionably connected with the preceding one, and implies that raising a false report furnishes the wicked man with a pretext for bringing the man, who is suspected of crime on account of this false report, before a court of law; in consequence of which the originator or propagator of the empty report becomes a witness of injustice and violence.</body></html>
