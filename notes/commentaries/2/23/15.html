At such seasons we must not “appear before God empty,” we must give Him not only “the salves of our lips,” but some substantial acknowledgment of His goodness towards us. The law here laid down with respect to the first feast is afterwards extended to the other two (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-16.htm" title="Three times in a year shall all your males appear before the LORD your God in the place which he shall choose; in the feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tabernacles: and they shall not appear before the LORD empty:">Deuteronomy 16:16</a>).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/23.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>23:10-19 Every seventh year the land was to rest. They must not plough or sow it; what the earth produced of itself, should be eaten, and not laid up. This law seems to have been intended to teach dependence on Providence, and God's faithfulness in sending the larger increase while they kept his appointments. It was also typical of the heavenly rest, when all earthly labours, cares, and interests shall cease for ever. All respect to the gods of the heathen is strictly forbidden. Since idolatry was a sin to which the Israelites leaned, they must blot out the remembrance of the gods of the heathen. Solemn religious attendance on God, in the place which he should choose, is strictly required. They must come together before the Lord. What a good Master do we serve, who has made it our duty to rejoice before him! Let us devote with pleasure to the service of God that portion of our time which he requires, and count his sabbaths and ordinances to be a feast unto our souls. They were not to come empty-handed; so now, we must not come to worship God empty-hearted; our souls must be filled with holy desires toward him, and dedications of ourselves to him; for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>On the Feast of Unleavened Bread, or the Passover, see <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-1.htm">Exodus 12:1-20</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-43.htm">Exodus 12:43-50</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/13-3.htm">Exodus 13:3-16</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/34-18.htm">Exodus 34:18-20</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-4.htm">Leviticus 23:4-14</a>.

Three times &#8230; keep a feast &#8230; in the year&#8212;This was the institution of the great religious festivals&#8212;"The feast of unleavened bread," or the passover&#8212;"the feast of harvest," or pentecost&#8212;"the feast of ingathering," or the feast of tabernacles, which was a memorial of the dwelling in booths in the wilderness, and which was observed in the seventh month (Ex 12:2). All the males were enjoined to repair to the tabernacle and afterwards the temple, and the women frequently went. The institution of this national custom was of the greatest importance in many ways: by keeping up a national sense of religion and a public uniformity in worship, by creating a bond of unity, and also by promoting internal commerce among the people. Though the absence of all the males at these three festivals left the country defenseless, a special promise was given of divine protection, and no incursion of enemies was ever permitted to happen on those occasions.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/exodus/23.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This may be either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

This feast celebrated the beginning of the barley-harvest (which begins in Palestine towards the end of April or the beginning of May, some weeks before the wheat-harvest): cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/23-10.htm" title="Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, When you be come into the land which I give to you, and shall reap the harvest thereof, then you shall bring a sheaf of the first fruits of your harvest to the priest:...">Leviticus 23:10-14</a> H (the ‘wave-sheaf’ of the first-fruits of the harvest to be presented then to Jehovah). The reason why this spring festival was observed in particular by eating unleavened cakes must remain matter of conjecture: perhaps it was simply because, at a time when men were busy with the harvest, such cakes (cf. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-8.htm" title="And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire, and unleavened bread; and with bitter herbs they shall eat it.">Exodus 12:8</a>) were most quickly and easily prepared (Wellh. <span class="ital">Hist.</span> p. 87; Nowack, <span class="ital">Arch.</span> ii. 146; <span class="ital">EB.</span> iii. 3591). Eerdmans (<span class="ital">Expositor</span>, Nov. 1909, p. 459 ff.) conjectures that it was to preserve, in accordance with a primitive conception, the ‘soul’ of the corn for the seed of the year to come.
