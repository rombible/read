As with the heathen in later times, “because they did not like to retain God in their knowledge. God gave them over to a reprobate mind” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-28.htm" title="And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;">Romans 1:28</a>), so now with Pharaoh: because he had twice hardened himself—i.e., resisted an impression made upon him, and crushed his inclination to yield to it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-15.htm" title="But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his heart, and listened not to them; as the LORD had said.">Exodus 8:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-32.htm" title="And Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also, neither would he let the people go.">Exodus 8:32</a>), God hardened him. (See the comment on <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-21.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, When you go to return into Egypt, see that you do all those wonders before Pharaoh, which I have put in your hand: but I will harden his heart, that he shall not let the people go.">Exodus 4:21</a>.)<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/exodus/9.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-12.htm" title="And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he listened not to them; as the LORD had spoken to Moses.">Exodus 9:12</a></span>. <span class="ital">And the Lord hardened Pharaoh’s heart — </span>Before he had <span class="ital">hardened his own heart, </span>and resisted the grace of God; and now God justly gave him up to his own heart’s lusts, to strong delusions, permitting Satan to blind and harden him.

If lesser judgments do not work, God will send greater. Sometimes God shows men their sin in their punishment. They had oppressed Israel in the furnaces, and now the ashes of the furnace are made a terror to them. The plague itself was very grievous. The magicians themselves were struck with these boils. Their power was restrained before; but they continued to withstand Moses, and to confirm Pharaoh in his unbelief, till they were forced to give way. Pharaoh continued obstinate. He had hardened his own heart, and now God justly gave him up to his own heart's lusts, permitting Satan to blind and harden him. If men shut their eyes against the light, it is just with God to close their eyes.

Moses took ashes from the furnace&#8212;Hebrew, "brick-kiln." The magicians, being sufferers in their own persons, could do nothing, though they had been called; and as the brick-kiln was one of the principal instruments of oppression to the Israelites [De 4:20; 1Ki 8:51; Jer 11:4], it was now converted into a means of chastisement to the Egyptians, who were made to read their sin in their punishment.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/exodus/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div>Ver. 12 No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/exodus/9.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh,.... He having often, and so long hardened his own heart, God gave him up to judicial hardness of heart, to his own corruptions, the temptations of Satan, and the lying magicians about him, to make an ill use of everything that offered to him, and put a wrong construction on all that befell him, so that whatever was said to him, or inflicted on him, made no impression to any purpose: <p>and he hearkened not unto them; to Moses and Aaron, and to the Lord by them: <p>as the Lord had spoken to Moses; both that he would harden his heart, and he should not hearken to them; all this was no other than what the Lord had said should be, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-21.htm">Exodus 4:21</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/exodus/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had spoken unto Moses.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/exodus/9.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">12</span>.
