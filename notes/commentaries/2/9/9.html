If lesser judgments do not work, God will send greater. Sometimes God shows men their sin in their punishment. They had oppressed Israel in the furnaces, and now the ashes of the furnace are made a terror to them. The plague itself was very grievous. The magicians themselves were struck with these boils. Their power was restrained before; but they continued to withstand Moses, and to confirm Pharaoh in his unbelief, till they were forced to give way. Pharaoh continued obstinate. He had hardened his own heart, and now God justly gave him up to his own heart's lusts, permitting Satan to blind and harden him. If men shut their eyes against the light, it is just with God to close their eyes. This is the sorest judgment a man can be under out of hell.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A boil - Means probably a burning tumor or carbuncle breaking out in pustulous ulcers.

Take to you handfuls of ashes, &c.&#8212;The next plague assailed the persons of the Egyptians, and it appeared in the form of ulcerous eruptions upon the skin and flesh (Le 13:20; 2Ki 20:7; Job 2:7). That this epidemic did not arise from natural causes was evident from its taking effect from the particular action of Moses done in the sight of Pharaoh. The attitude he assumed was similar to that of Eastern magicians, who, "when they pronounce an imprecation on an individual, a village, or a country, take the ashes of cows' dung (that is, from a common fire) and throw them in the air, saying to the objects of their displeasure, such a sickness or such a curse shall come upon you" [Roberts].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/exodus/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> A burning scab, which quickly raised blains and blisters; whereby they were both vehemently inclined to scratch themselves, and yet utterly disenabled from it by its great soreness. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/exodus/9.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt,....

The Heb. for ‘boil,’ as the cognate languages shew, in which the root signifies <span class="ital">to be hot</span>, means an <span class="ital">inflamed spot</span>: it is mentioned also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/13-18.htm" title="The flesh also, in which, even in the skin thereof, was a boil, and is healed,...">Leviticus 13:18-20</a> (a symptom of elephantiasis), 23 (a common ulcer), <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-27.htm" title="The LORD will smite you with the botch of Egypt, and with the tumors, and with the scab, and with the itch, whereof you can not be healed.">Deuteronomy 28:27</a> (the ‘boil of Egypt’), 35, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/20-7.htm" title="And Isaiah said, Take a lump of figs.

Cutaneous eruptions, of various kinds, are common in Egypt (cf. Dt. <span class="ital">l.c.</span>): we cannot say exactly what kind is here meant. Di. after Kn. thinks of the <span class="ital">Nilescab</span>, an irritating eruption, consisting of innumerable little red blisters, which is frequent in Egypt at about the time when the Nile begins to rise in June, and often remains for some weeks upon those whom it attacks (Seetzen was attacked in this way two years running, iii. 204 f., 209, 377): it is attributed either to the unhealthy condition of the water at the time (cf. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-23.htm" title="And Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he set his heart to this also.">Exodus 7:23</a>), or to the excessive heat. It is not known to attack animals; but that is no objection to its being intended, in what is represented by the writer as miraculous.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">It shall become small dust</span>. Rather, "It shall be as dust." No physical change is intended by the expression used, but simply that the "soot" or "ash" should be spread by the air throughout all Egypt, as dust was wont to be spread. <span class="cmt_word">And shall be a boil breaking forth with blains</span>. Literally, "an inflammation, begetting pustules." The description would apply to almost any eruptive disease. The attempts definitely to determine what exactly the malady was, seem to be futile - more especially as diseases are continually changing their forms, and a malady which belongs to the fourteenth or fifteenth century before our era is almost certain to have been different from any now prevalent. The word "blains" - now obsolete as a separate word - appears in "chilblains."  <span class="cmt_sub_title">Ver 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The furnace</span>. It is perhaps not very important what kind of "furnace" is meant. But the point has been seriously debated. Some suppose a furnace for the consumption of victims, human or other; some a baking oven, or cooking stove; others a furnace for smelting metal; others again a limekiln. The ordinary meaning of the word used, <span class="accented">kibshon</span>, is a "brick-kiln;" but bricks were not often baked in Egypt. Nor is it at all clear that any victims were ever consumed in furnaces. Probably either a brick-kiln or a furnace for the smelting of metals is meant. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/exodus/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"The hand of Jehovah will be (&#1492;&#1493;&#1497;&#1492;, which only occurs here, as the participle of &#1492;&#1497;&#1492;, generally takes its form from &#1492;&#1493;&#1492;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/6-6.htm">Nehemiah 6:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-22.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:22</a>) against thy cattle...as a very severe plague (&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; that which sweeps away, a plague), i.e., will smite them with a severe plague. A distinction was again made between the Israelites and the Egyptians. "Of all (the cattle) belonging to the children of Israel, not one (&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/9-4.htm">Exodus 9:4</a>,  equals  &#1488;&#1495;&#1491; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-6.htm">Exodus 9:6</a>) shall die." A definite time was also fixed for the coming of the plague, as in the case of the previous one (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-23.htm">Exodus 8:23</a>), in order that, whereas murrains occasionally occur in Egypt, Pharaoh might discern in his one the judgment of Jehovah. </body></html>
