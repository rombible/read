Mummies also were swathed in linen bandages (Herod. ii. 86); and soldiers wore linen corselets (Herod. ii. 182, 3:47). Barley was grown as food for horses, as an element in the manufacture of beer, and as a material for an inferior kind of bread. The flax is “bolled”—i.e., forms its seed-vessel—towards the end of January or beginning of February, and the barley comes into ear about the same time. These facts fix the date of this plague, and help to fix the dates both of the earlier and the later ones.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/exodus/9.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-31.htm" title="And the flax and the barley was smitten: for the barley was in the ear, and the flax was in bloom.">Exodus 9:31</a></span>. <span class="ital">The flax and barley were smitten — </span>Which were not so necessary for human life as the wheat and rye.

The land of Goshen was preserved. God causes rain or hail on one city and not on another, either in mercy or in judgment. Pharaoh humbled himself to Moses. No man could have spoken better: he owns himself wrong; he owns that the Lord is righteous; and God must be justified when he speaks, though he speaks in thunder and lightning. Yet his heart was hardened all this while. Moses pleads with God: though he had reason to think Pharaoh would repent of his repentance, and he told him so, yet he promises to be his friend. Moses went out of the city, notwithstanding the hail and lightning which kept Pharaoh and his servants within doors. Peace with God makes men thunder-proof. Pharaoh was frightened by the tremendous judgment; but when that was over, his fair promises were forgotten.

In the north of Egypt the barley ripens and flax blossoms about the middle of February, or at the latest early in March, and both are gathered in before April, when the wheat harvest begins.

In that country flax and barley are almost ripe when wheat and rye (spelt) are green. And hence the flax must have been "bolled"&#8212;that is, risen in stalk or podded in February, thus fixing the particular month when the event took place. Barley ripens about a month earlier than wheat.

(Kn.), if not earlier.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Flax was much cultivated in Egypt: for linen was worn constantly by men of rank, and exclusively by the priests (Hdt. ii. 37); wrappings for mummies were also made of it. There are many representations on the Egyptian monuments of the processes by which flax was converted into linen; and the linen itself was often of remarkable transparency and fineness (Erman, pp. 448, 449 f.; Wilk.-B. ii.157 f., 165 f.; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-42.htm" title="And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it on Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in clothing of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck;">Genesis 41:42</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-7.htm" title="Fine linen with broidered work from Egypt was that which you spread forth to be your sail; blue and purple from the isles of Elishah was that which covered you.">Ezekiel 27:7</a>; Hdt. ii. 81, 105).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">was bolled</span>] <span class="ital">was</span> <span class="bld">in bud.</span> The Heb. word occurs only here in the OT.; but, as Ges. shews, this is the meaning of <span class="ital">gib‘ôl</span> in the Mishna.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>‘Bolled’ is a now obsolete expression meaning <span class="ital">podded</span> (lit. <span class="ital">swollen</span>, akin to <span class="ital">bowl, bellows, billow</span>, &c.) <span class="ital">for seed</span>.

Flax was largely cultivated by the Egyptians, who preferred linen garments to any other (Herod. 2:37), and allowed the priests to wear nothing but linen. Several kinds of flax are mentioned as grown in Egypt (Plin. H. N. 19:1); and the neighbourhood of Tanis is expressly said to have been one of the places where the flax was produced. The flax is <span class="cmt_word">boiled</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> blossoms towards the end of January or beginning of February, and the barley comes into ear about the same time, being commonly cut in March. Barley was employed largely as the food of horses, and was used also for the manufacture of beer, which was a common Egyptian beverage. A certain quantity was made by the poorer classes into bread. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/exodus/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The expressions, "every herb," and "every tree," are not to be taken absolutely, just as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/9-6.htm">Exodus 9:6</a>, as we may see from <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-5.htm">Exodus 10:5</a>. Storms are not common in Lower or Middle Egypt, but they occur most frequently between the months of December and April; and hail sometimes accompanies them, though not with great severity. In themselves, therefore, thunder, lightning, and hail were not unheard of. They also came at the time of year when they usually occur, namely, when the cattle were in the field, i.e., between January and April, the only period in which cattle are turned out for pasture (for proofs, see Hengstenberg, Egypt and the Books of Moses). The supernatural character of this plague was manifested, not only in its being predicted by Moses, and in the exemption of the land of Goshen, but more especially in the terrible fury of the hail-storm, which made a stronger impression upon Pharaoh than all the previous plagues. For he sent for Moses and Aaron, and confessed to them, "I have sinned this time: Jehovah is righteous; I and my people are the sinners" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-27.htm">Exodus 9:27</a>.). But the very limitation "this time" showed that his repentance did not go very deep, and that his confession was far more the effect of terror caused by the majesty of God, which was manifested in the fearful thunder and lightning, than a genuine acknowledgment of his guilt. This is apparent also from the words which follow: "Pray to Jehovah for me, and let it be enough (&#1512;&#1489; satis, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/45-28.htm">Genesis 45:28</a>) of the being (&#1502;&#1492;&#1497;&#1514;) of the voices of God and of the hail;" i.e., there has been enough thunder and hail, they may cease now. </body></html>
