The land of Goshen was preserved. God causes rain or hail on one city and not on another, either in mercy or in judgment. Pharaoh humbled himself to Moses. No man could have spoken better: he owns himself wrong; he owns that the Lord is righteous; and God must be justified when he speaks, though he speaks in thunder and lightning. Yet his heart was hardened all this while. Moses pleads with God: though he had reason to think Pharaoh would repent of his repentance, and he told him so, yet he promises to be his friend. Moses went out of the city, notwithstanding the hail and lightning which kept Pharaoh and his servants within doors. Peace with God makes men thunder-proof. Pharaoh was frightened by the tremendous judgment; but when that was over, his fair promises were forgotten. Those that are not bettered by judgments and mercies, commonly become worse.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Lord - Thus, for the first time, Pharaoh explicitly recognizes Yahweh as God (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/5-2.htm">Exodus 5:2</a>).<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/exodus/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>27-35. Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said unto them, I have sinned&#8212;This awful display of divine displeasure did seriously impress the mind of Pharaoh, and, under the weight of his convictions, he humbles himself to confess he has done wrong in opposing the divine will. At the same time he calls for Moses to intercede for cessation of the calamity. Moses accedes to his earnest wishes, and this most awful visitation ended. But his repentance proved a transient feeling, and his obduracy soon became as great as before.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/exodus/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Or, <span class="ital">and</span> let it be <span class="ital">enough</span>, (let God content himself that he hath punished me so long, and that I have confessed my sin, and promised amendment,) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">that there may be</span> hereafter <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">no more.</span> <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/exodus/9.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Entreat the Lord, for it is enough,....

Literally, as in the margin, "voices of God." Thunder was regarded by many nations of antiquity as the actual voice of a god. In the Vedic theology, Indra spoke in thunder. The Egyptian view on the subject has not been ascertained. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/exodus/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The good advice to be given by Moses to the king, to secure the men and cattle that were in the field, i.e., to put them under shelter, which was followed by the God-fearing Egyptians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-21.htm">Exodus 9:21</a>), was a sign of divine mercy, which would still rescue the hardened man and save him from destruction. Even in Pharaoh's case the possibility still existed of submission to the will of God; the hardening was not yet complete. But as he paid no heed to the word of the Lord, the predicted judgment was fulfilled (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/9-22.htm">Exodus 9:22-26</a>). "Jehovah gave voices" (&#1511;&#1500;&#1514;); called "voices of God" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-28.htm">Exodus 9:28</a>. This term is applied to the thunder (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-18.htm">Exodus 20:18</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/29-3.htm">Psalm 29:3-9</a>), as being the mightiest manifestation of the omnipotence of God, which speaks therein to men (<a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/10-3.htm">Revelation 10:3-4</a>), and warns them of the terrors of judgment. These terrors were heightened by masses of fire, which came down from the sky along with the hail that smote man and beast in the field, destroyed the vegetables, and shattered the trees.
