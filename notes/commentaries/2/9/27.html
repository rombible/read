This may have been partly because it caused destruction of human life, partly on account of its extraordinary and awful character. It must be borne in mind that the storm was still continuing, and gave no sign of coming to a natural end (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-29.htm" title="And Moses said to him, As soon as I am gone out of the city, I will spread abroad my hands to the LORD; and the thunder shall cease, neither shall there be any more hail; that you may know how that the earth is the LORD's.">Exodus 9:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-33.htm" title="And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad his hands to the LORD: and the thunders and hail ceased, and the rain was not poured on the earth.">Exodus 9:33</a>).<p><span class= "bld">I have sinned this time</span>—i.e., This time I confess that I have sinned in resisting Jehovah; I do not any more maintain that I have acted right.<p><span class= "bld">The Lord is righteous.</span>—Heb., <span class= "ital">Jehovah is the Just One</span>—a form of speech implying that Jehovah, <span class= "ital">and He alone,</span> was just.<p><span class= "bld">Wicked.</span>—Heb., <span class= "ital">the sinners.</span> “I and my people” stand in contrast with God and His people. Previously Pharaoh had denounced the Israelites as idlers and hypocrites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/5-8.htm" title="And the tale of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, you shall lay on them; you shall not diminish ought thereof: for they be idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our God.">Exodus 5:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/5-17.htm" title="But he said, You are idle, you are idle: therefore you say, Let us go and do sacrifice to the LORD.">Exodus 5:17</a>); now he admits that it is only he and his people that are to blame. The confession is satisfactory, except in so far as it divides between Pharaoh and the Egyptians the blame which was almost wholly his.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/exodus/9.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-27.htm" title="And Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said to them, I have sinned this time: the LORD is righteous, and I and my people are wicked.">Exodus 9:27</a></span>. <span class="ital">Pharaoh said, I have sinned; the Lord is righteous — </span>These, professions were only produced by his fears: his heart was still untouched with any true veneration for, or humiliation before, the God of Israel, or with compunction and sorrow for his own obstinacy.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:22-35 Woful havoc this hail made: it killed both men and cattle; the corn above ground was destroyed, and that only preserved which as yet was not come up. The land of Goshen was preserved. God causes rain or hail on one city and not on another, either in mercy or in judgment. Pharaoh humbled himself to Moses. No man could have spoken better: he owns himself wrong; he owns that the Lord is righteous; and God must be justified when he speaks, though he speaks in thunder and lightning. Yet his heart was hardened all this while. Moses pleads with God: though he had reason to think Pharaoh would repent of his repentance, and he told him so, yet he promises to be his friend. Moses went out of the city, notwithstanding the hail and lightning which kept Pharaoh and his servants within doors. Peace with God makes men thunder-proof. Pharaoh was frightened by the tremendous judgment; but when that was over, his fair promises were forgotten. Those that are not bettered by judgments and mercies, commonly become worse.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Lord - Thus, for the first time, Pharaoh explicitly recognizes Yahweh as God (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/5-2.htm">Exodus 5:2</a>).<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/exodus/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>27-35.

At the same time he calls for Moses to intercede for cessation of the calamity. Moses accedes to his earnest wishes, and this most awful visitation ended. But his repentance proved a transient feeling, and his obduracy soon became as great as before.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/exodus/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> I now plainly see and freely acknowledge my sin in striving with God.

Not persons to observe whether there was any hail fell in the land of Goshen, though there are some (k) that so supply the words; but it cannot be thought that Pharaoh would send, or that any would go thither amidst such a storm of thunder and hail; but he sent messengers: <p>and called Moses and Aaron; who might be in his palace, at least not very far off: <p>and said unto them, I have sinned this time; not but that he had sinned before, and must be conscious of it, particularly in breaking his promise so often; but now he acknowledged his sin, which he had never done before: and this confession of sin did not arise from a true sense of it, from hatred of it, and sorrow for it as committed against God; but from the fright he was in, the horror of his mind, the dread of the present plague being continued; and the terror of death that seized him, the rebounding noise of the thunder in his ears, the flashes of lightning in his face, and the hailstones beating upon the top of his house, and against the windows and sides of it, frightened him exceedingly, and forced this confession from him: <p>the Lord is righteous, and I and my people are wicked; which was well spoken, had it been serious and from his heart; for God is righteous in his nature, and in all his works, and in all those judgments he had inflicted upon him; and he and his people were wicked in using the Israelites in such a cruel manner, and in detaining them when it had been promised them again and again that they should have leave to go, and especially in rebelling against God, and disobeying his commands. <p>(k) "Misisset qui observarent", Junius &amp; Tremellius. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/exodus/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said unto them, I <span class="cverse3">{g}</span> have sinned this time: the LORD <i>is</i> righteous, and I and my people <i>are</i> wicked.</span><p>(g) The wicked confess their sins to their condemnation, but they cannot believe to obtain remission.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/exodus/9.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">27</span>. The Pharaoh this time, impressed, it may be supposed, by the spectacle of the storm, confesses his fault, as he has never done before.

It was the first which had inflicted death on men. It was a most striking and terrible manifestation. It was quite unlike anything which the Egyptians had ever experienced before (vers. 18, 24). It was, by manifest miracle, made to fall on the Egyptians only (ver. 26). Pharaoh was therefore more humbled than ever previously. He acknowledged that he "had sinned" (ver. 27); he added a confession that "Jehovah [alone] was righteous, he and his people wicked" (<span class="accented">ibid.</span>). And, as twice before, he expressed his willingness to let the Israelites take their departure if the plague were removed (ver. 28). The ultimate results, however, were not any better than before. No sooner had Moses prayed to God, and procured the cessation of the plague, than the king repented of his repentance, "hardened his heart;" and, once more casting his promise to the winds, refused to permit the Israelites to depart (vers. 33-35). His people joined him in this act of obduracy (ver. 34), perhaps thinking that they had now suffered the worst that could befall them. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Pharaoh sent</span>. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-8.htm">Exodus 8:8</a>, and 25-28. Pharaoh had been driven to entreat only twice before. <span class="cmt_word">I have sinned this time</span>. The meaning is, "I acknowledge this time that I have sinned" (Kaliseh, Cook). <span class="accented">"I</span> do not any longer maintain that my conduct has been right." The confession is made for the first time, and seems to have been extorted by the terrible nature of the plague, which, instead of passing off, like most storms, continued. <span class="cmt_word">The Lord is righteous</span>, etc. Literally, "Jehovah is <span class="accented">the</span> Just One; and I and my people are <span class="accented">the</span> sinners." The confession seems, at first sight, ample and satisfactory; but there is perhaps some shifting of sin, that was all his own, upon the Egyptian "<span class="accented">people</span>," which indicates disingenuousness. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/exodus/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The good advice to be given by Moses to the king, to secure the men and cattle that were in the field, i.e., to put them under shelter, which was followed by the God-fearing Egyptians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-21.htm">Exodus 9:21</a>), was a sign of divine mercy, which would still rescue the hardened man and save him from destruction. Even in Pharaoh's case the possibility still existed of submission to the will of God; the hardening was not yet complete. But as he paid no heed to the word of the Lord, the predicted judgment was fulfilled (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/9-22.htm">Exodus 9:22-26</a>). "Jehovah gave voices" (&#1511;&#1500;&#1514;); called "voices of God" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-28.htm">Exodus 9:28</a>. This term is applied to the thunder (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-18.htm">Exodus 20:18</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/29-3.htm">Psalm 29:3-9</a>), as being the mightiest manifestation of the omnipotence of God, which speaks therein to men (<a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/10-3.htm">Revelation 10:3-4</a>), and warns them of the terrors of judgment. These terrors were heightened by masses of fire, which came down from the sky along with the hail that smote man and beast in the field, destroyed the vegetables, and shattered the trees. "And fire ran along upon the ground;" &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1500;&#1498; is a Kal, though it sounds like Hithpael, and signifies grassari, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-9.htm">Psalm 73:9</a>. </body></html>
