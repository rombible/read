The land of Goshen was preserved. God causes rain or hail on one city and not on another, either in mercy or in judgment. Pharaoh humbled himself to Moses. No man could have spoken better: he owns himself wrong; he owns that the Lord is righteous; and God must be justified when he speaks, though he speaks in thunder and lightning. Yet his heart was hardened all this while. Moses pleads with God: though he had reason to think Pharaoh would repent of his repentance, and he told him so, yet he promises to be his friend. Moses went out of the city, notwithstanding the hail and lightning which kept Pharaoh and his servants within doors. Peace with God makes men thunder-proof. Pharaoh was frightened by the tremendous judgment; but when that was over, his fair promises were forgotten. Those that are not bettered by judgments and mercies, commonly become worse.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The word of the Lord - This gives the first indication that the warnings had a salutary effect upon the Egyptians.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/exodus/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20, 21.

This storm occurring at that season, not only struck universal terror into the minds of the people, but occasioned the destruction of all&#8212;people and cattle&#8212;which, in neglect of the warning, had been left in the fields, as well as of all vegetation [Ex 9:25]. It was the more appalling because hailstones in Egypt are small and of little force; lightning also is scarcely ever known to produce fatal effects; and to enhance the wonder, not a trace of any storm was found in Goshen [Ex 9:26].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/exodus/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> i.e. Most of them; or herbs and trees of all sorts, as appears from <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-12.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Stretch out your hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up on the land of Egypt, and eat every herb of the land, even all that the hail has left.">Exodus 10:12</a>,15</span>. <span class="bld">See Poole "<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-6.htm" title="And the LORD did that thing on the morrow, and all the cattle of Egypt died: but of the cattle of the children of Israel died not one.">Exodus 9:6</a>"</span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/exodus/9.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt,....

It is to the hail  and not to the lightning that the great destruction of men and beasts is attributed. Such lightning, however, as is spoken of, would probably kill some. <span class="cmt_word">All that was in the field</span>. According to the warning given (ver. 19), the herdsmen and cattle left in the open air and not brought into the sheds were killed. <span class="cmt_word">The hail emote every herb of the field</span>. Even in our own temperate climate, which is free from all atmospheric extremes, hailstorms occasionally do so much damage to crops that it has been found desirable to organise a special insurance against loss from this cause. Such hail as that described in the text would greatly injure every crop that was many inches above the soil, and entirely destroy such as had gone to ear. (See below, ver. 31.) <span class="cmt_word">Broke every tree</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, damaged the smaller branches and twigs, thus destroying the prospect of fruit. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/exodus/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The good advice to be given by Moses to the king, to secure the men and cattle that were in the field, i.e., to put them under shelter, which was followed by the God-fearing Egyptians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-21.htm">Exodus 9:21</a>), was a sign of divine mercy, which would still rescue the hardened man and save him from destruction. Even in Pharaoh's case the possibility still existed of submission to the will of God; the hardening was not yet complete. But as he paid no heed to the word of the Lord, the predicted judgment was fulfilled (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/9-22.htm">Exodus 9:22-26</a>). "Jehovah gave voices" (&#1511;&#1500;&#1514;); called "voices of God" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-28.htm">Exodus 9:28</a>. This term is applied to the thunder (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-18.htm">Exodus 20:18</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/29-3.htm">Psalm 29:3-9</a>), as being the mightiest manifestation of the omnipotence of God, which speaks therein to men (<a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/10-3.htm">Revelation 10:3-4</a>), and warns them of the terrors of judgment. These terrors were heightened by masses of fire, which came down from the sky along with the hail that smote man and beast in the field, destroyed the vegetables, and shattered the trees.
