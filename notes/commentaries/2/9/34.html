It seems strange that the mercy of God should still have allowed him one other chance (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/10-3.htm" title="And Moses and Aaron came in to Pharaoh, and said to him, Thus said the LORD God of the Hebrews, How long will you refuse to humble yourself before me? let my people go, that they may serve me.">Exodus 10:3-6</a>).<p><span class= "bld"><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:22-35 Woful havoc this hail made: it killed both men and cattle; the corn above ground was destroyed, and that only preserved which as yet was not come up. The land of Goshen was preserved. God causes rain or hail on one city and not on another, either in mercy or in judgment. Pharaoh humbled himself to Moses. No man could have spoken better: he owns himself wrong; he owns that the Lord is righteous; and God must be justified when he speaks, though he speaks in thunder and lightning. Yet his heart was hardened all this while. Moses pleads with God: though he had reason to think Pharaoh would repent of his repentance, and he told him so, yet he promises to be his friend. Moses went out of the city, notwithstanding the hail and lightning which kept Pharaoh and his servants within doors. Peace with God makes men thunder-proof. Pharaoh was frightened by the tremendous judgment; but when that was over, his fair promises were forgotten. Those that are not bettered by judgments and mercies, commonly become worse.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Rie - Rather, "spelt," the common food of the ancient Egyptians, now called "doora" by the natives, and the only grain represented on the sculptures: the name, however, occurs on the monuments very frequently in combination with other species. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/exodus/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>31, 32. the flax and the barley was smitten, &c.&#8212;The peculiarities that are mentioned in these cereal products arise from the climate and physical constitution of Egypt. In that country flax and barley are almost ripe when wheat and rye (spelt) are green. And hence the flax must have been "bolled"&#8212;that is, risen in stalk or podded in February, thus fixing the particular month when the event took place. Barley ripens about a month earlier than wheat. Flax and barley are generally ripe in March, wheat and rye (properly, spelt) in April.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/exodus/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/exodus/9.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And when Pharaoh saw that the rain, and the hail, and the thunders were ceased,....

Different travellers (see Di., or <span class="ital">DB.</span> iii. 891) speak of storms of heavy rain, hail, or thunder in Egypt occurring during the winter months; and Sayce (<span class="ital">EHH.</span> 169) states that in the spring of 1895 a violent storm of thunder and hail swept along the valley of the Nile and desolated 3000 acres of cultivated land. <span class="ital">Vv.</span> 31 f. shew that the plague took place in Jan., or thereabouts; and with this date agrees the statement in <span class="ital">v.</span> 19 that the cattle were at the time in the fields, for the cattle in Egypt are from Jan. to April on their pastures, while from May to Dec. they are commonly kept in their stalls.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He sinned yet more, and hardened his heart</span>. Altogether there are three different Hebrew verbs, which our translators have rendered by "harden," or "hardened" -  <span class="accented">kabad</span>, <span class="accented">qashah</span>, and <span class="accented">khazaq.</span> The first of these, which occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-14.htm">Exodus 7:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-15.htm">Exodus 8:15, 32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-7.htm">Exodus 9:7</a> and 34, is the weakest of the three, and means to be "dull" or "heavy," rather than "to be hard." The second, which appears in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-3.htm">Exodus 7:3</a>, and Exodus 13:15, is a stronger term, and means "to be hard," or, in the Hiphil, "to make hard." But the third has the most intensive sense, implying fixed and stubborn resolution. It occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-21.htm">Exodus 4:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-22.htm">Exodus 7:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-19.htm">Exodus 8:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-35.htm">Exodus 9:35</a>; and elsewhere. He and his servants. Pharaoh's "servants," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the officers of his court, still, it would seem, upheld the king in his impious and mad course, either out of complaisance, or because they were really not yet convinced of the resistless might of Jehovah. After the eighth plague, we shall find their tone change (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-7.htm">Exodus 10:7</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Ver 35.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As the Lord had spoken by Moses</span>. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-19.htm">Exodus 3:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-21.htm">Exodus 4:21</a>; and Exodus 7:3, 4 <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/exodus/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The expressions, "every herb," and "every tree," are not to be taken absolutely, just as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/9-6.htm">Exodus 9:6</a>, as we may see from <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-5.htm">Exodus 10:5</a>. Storms are not common in Lower or Middle Egypt, but they occur most frequently between the months of December and April; and hail sometimes accompanies them, though not with great severity. In themselves, therefore, thunder, lightning, and hail were not unheard of. They also came at the time of year when they usually occur, namely, when the cattle were in the field, i.e., between January and April, the only period in which cattle are turned out for pasture (for proofs, see Hengstenberg, Egypt and the Books of Moses). The supernatural character of this plague was manifested, not only in its being predicted by Moses, and in the exemption of the land of Goshen, but more especially in the terrible fury of the hail-storm, which made a stronger impression upon Pharaoh than all the previous plagues. For he sent for Moses and Aaron, and confessed to them, "I have sinned this time: Jehovah is righteous; I and my people are the sinners" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-27.htm">Exodus 9:27</a>.). But the very limitation "this time" showed that his repentance did not go very deep, and that his confession was far more the effect of terror caused by the majesty of God, which was manifested in the fearful thunder and lightning, than a genuine acknowledgment of his guilt. This is apparent also from the words which follow: "Pray to Jehovah for me, and let it be enough (&#1512;&#1489; satis, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/45-28.htm">Genesis 45:28</a>) of the being (&#1502;&#1492;&#1497;&#1514;) of the voices of God and of the hail;" i.e., there has been enough thunder and hail, they may cease now. </body></html>
