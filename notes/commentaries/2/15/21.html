It is a holy song, to the honour of God, to exalt his name, and celebrate his praise, and his only, not in the least to magnify any man. Holiness to the Lord is in every part of it. It may be considered as typical, and prophetical of the final destruction of the enemies of the church. Happy the people whose God is the Lord. They have work to do, temptations to grapple with, and afflictions to bear, and are weak in themselves; but his grace is their strength. They are often in sorrow, but in him they have comfort; he is their song. Sin, and death, and hell threaten them, but he is, and will be their salvation. The Lord is a God of almighty power, and woe to those that strive with their Maker! He is a God of matchless perfection; he is glorious in holiness; his holiness is his glory. His holiness appears in the hatred of sin, and his wrath against obstinate sinners. It appears in the deliverance of Israel, and his faithfulness to his own promise. He is fearful in praises; that which is matter of praise to the servants of God, is very dreadful to his enemies. He is doing wonders, things out of the common course of nature; wondrous to those in whose favour they are wrought, who are so unworthy, that they had no reason to expect them. There were wonders of power and wonders of grace; in both, God was to be humbly adored.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And Miriam the prophetess - The part here assigned to Miriam and the women of Israel is in accordance both with Egyptian and Hebrew customs. The men are represented as singing the hymn in chorus, under the guidance of Moses; at each interval Miriam and the women sang the refrain, marking the time with the timbrel, and with the measured rhythmical movements always associated with solemn festivities. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-34.htm">Judges 11:34</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-5.htm">2 Samuel 6:5</a>, and marginal references. The word used in this passage for the timbrel is Egyptian, and judging from its etymology and the figures which are joined with it in the inscriptions, it was probably the round instrument.<p>Miriam is called a prophetess, evidently <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/12-2.htm">Numbers 12:2</a> because she and Aaron had received divine communications. The word is used here in its proper sense of uttering words suggested by the Spirit of God. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/20-7.htm">Genesis 20:7</a>. She is called the sister of Aaron, most probably to indicate her special position as coordinate, not with Moses the leader of the nation, but with his chief aid and instrument. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/exodus/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21.

The men, for the word is masculine; that is, repeated, and sung the same song word for word after them, as they had done, of which a specimen is given by reciting the first clause of the song: <p>sing ye to the Lord; which is by way of exhortation to the women to sing with her, as Moses begins the song thus: "I will sing unto the Lord": <p>for he hath triumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea; See Gill on <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/15-1.htm">Exodus 15:1</a>, the manner of their singing, according to the Jews (z), was, Moses first said, "I will sing", and they said it after him. <p>(z) T.

While responding, the female chorus both danced and struck their tambourines. This use of dancing in a religious ceremonial, so contrary to Western ideas of decorum, is quite consonant with Oriental practice, both ancient and modern. Other examples of it in Scripture are David's dancing before the ark (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-16.htm">2 Samuel 6:16</a>), the dancing of Jephthah's daughter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-34.htm">Judges 11:34</a>), and that of the virgins of Shiloh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/21-21.htm">Judges 21:21</a>). It is also mentioned with approval in the Psalms (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/149-3.htm">Psalm 149:3</a>; el. 4). Dancing was practised as a religious ceremony in Egypt, in Phrygia, in Thrace, by the Phoenicians, by the Syrians, by the Romans, and others. In the nature of things there is clearly nothing unfitting or indecorous in a dedication to religion of what has been called "the poetry of gesture." But human infirmity has connected such terrible abuses with the practice that the purer religions have either discarded it or else denied it admission into their ceremonial. It still however lingers in Mohammedanism among those who are called "dancing dervishes," whose extraordinary performances are regarded as acts of devotion. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 15:22-27 <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/exodus/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"Then are the princes (alluphim, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/36-15.htm">Genesis 36:15</a>) of Edom confounded; the mighty men of Moab, trembling seizes them; all the inhabitants of Canaan despair." &#1488;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, like &#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-15.htm">2 Kings 24:15</a>, scriptio plena for &#1488;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, strong, powerful ones. As soon as these nations should hear of the miraculous guidance of Israel through the Red Sea, and Pharaoh's destruction, they would be thrown into despair from anxiety and alarm, and would not oppose the march of Israel through their land.</body></html>
