Literalism might argue that the statement contravened former ones (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/15-4.htm" title="Pharaoh's chariots and his host has he cast into the sea: his chosen captains also are drowned in the Red sea.">Exodus 15:4-5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-10.htm" title="You did blow with your wind, the sea covered them: they sank as lead in the mighty waters.">Exodus 15:10</a>); but the fact is otherwise. If we only allow our common sense fair play, and permit sacred writers the same latitude as profane ones, we shall find wonderfully few discrepancies, or even difficulties, in the Biblical narrative.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/exodus/15.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-12.htm" title="You stretched out your right hand, the earth swallowed them.">Exodus 15:12</a></span>. <span class="ital">The earth swallowed them up — </span>Their dead bodies sunk into the sands, on which they were thrown, which sucked them in.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/15.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>15:1-21 This song is the most ancient we know of. It is a holy song, to the honour of God, to exalt his name, and celebrate his praise, and his only, not in the least to magnify any man. Holiness to the Lord is in every part of it. It may be considered as typical, and prophetical of the final destruction of the enemies of the church. Happy the people whose God is the Lord. They have work to do, temptations to grapple with, and afflictions to bear, and are weak in themselves; but his grace is their strength. They are often in sorrow, but in him they have comfort; he is their song. Sin, and death, and hell threaten them, but he is, and will be their salvation. The Lord is a God of almighty power, and woe to those that strive with their Maker! He is a God of matchless perfection; he is glorious in holiness; his holiness is his glory. His holiness appears in the hatred of sin, and his wrath against obstinate sinners. It appears in the deliverance of Israel, and his faithfulness to his own promise. He is fearful in praises; that which is matter of praise to the servants of God, is very dreadful to his enemies. He is doing wonders, things out of the common course of nature; wondrous to those in whose favour they are wrought, who are so unworthy, that they had no reason to expect them. There were wonders of power and wonders of grace; in both, God was to be humbly adored.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Among the gods - Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/86-8.htm">Psalm 86:8</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-16.htm">Deuteronomy 32:16-17</a>.

Song of Moses.<p>1. Then sang Moses and the children of Israel&#8212;The scene of this thanksgiving song is supposed to have been at the landing place on the eastern shore of the Red Sea, at Ayoun Musa, "the fountains of Moses." They are situated somewhat farther northward along the shore than the opposite point from which the Israelites set out. But the line of the people would be extended during the passage, and one extremity of it would reach as far north as these fountains, which would supply them with water on landing. The time when it was sung is supposed to have been the morning after the passage. This song is, by some hundred years, the oldest poem in the world. There is a sublimity and beauty in the language that is unexampled. But its unrivalled superiority arises not solely from the splendor of the diction. Its poetical excellencies have often drawn forth the admiration of the best judges, while the character of the event commemorated, and its being prompted by divine inspiration, contribute to give it an interest and sublimity peculiar to itself.<p>I will sing unto the Lord, for he hath triumphed gloriously&#8212;Considering the state of servitude in which they had been born and bred, and the rude features of character which their subsequent history often displays, it cannot be supposed that the children of Israel generally were qualified to commit to memory or to appreciate the beauties of this inimitable song. But they might perfectly understand its pervading strain of sentiment; and, with the view of suitably improving the occasion, it was thought necessary that all, old and young, should join their united voices in the rehearsal of its words. As every individual had cause, so every individual gave utterance to his feelings of gratitude.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/exodus/15.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.
