The honour which comes from God, is always attended with a work to be done; to be employed for God is high honour. Those whom God calls to any service, he will find or make fit for it. The Lord gives different gifts to different persons; let each mind his proper work, diligently remembering that whatever wisdom any one possesses, the Lord put it in the heart, to do his commandments.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/31.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>To devise cunning works - Rather, to devise works of skill.

To "call by name" is to choose or appoint by name for a particular work (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-3.htm">Isaiah 45:3-4</a>). Bezaleel was a grandson of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, who is mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/17-10.htm">Exodus 17:10</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/24-14.htm">Exodus 24:14</a>, and was called to be the master-builder, to superintend the whole of the building and carry out the artistic work; consequently he is not only invariably mentioned first (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/35-30.htm">Exodus 35:30</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/36-1.htm">Exodus 36:1-2</a>), but in the accounts of the execution of the separate portions he is mentioned alone (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/37-1.htm">Exodus 37:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/38-22.htm">Exodus 38:22</a>). Filling with the Spirit of God signifies the communication of an extraordinary and supernatural endowment and qualification, "in wisdom," etc., i.e., consisting of wisdom, understanding, knowledge, and every kind of workmanship, that is to say, for the performance of every kind of work. This did not preclude either natural capacity or acquired skill, but rather presupposed them; for in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/31-6.htm">Exodus 31:6</a> it is expressly stated in relation to his assistants, that God had put wisdom into all that were wise-hearted (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-3.htm">Exodus 28:3</a>). Being thus endowed with a supernaturally exalted gift, Bezaleel was qualified "to think out inventions," i.e., ideas or artistic designs. Although everything had been minutely described by Jehovah, designs and plans were still needed in carrying out the work, so that the result should correspond to the divine instructions. </body></html>
