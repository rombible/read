These, like the cloths here spoken of (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/39-1.htm" title="And of the blue, and purple, and scarlet, they made cloths of service, to do service in the holy place, and made the holy garments for Aaron; as the LORD commanded Moses.">Exodus 39:1</a>), were to be of blue, and purple, and scarlet; and it would be natural to distinguish them from the “holy garments,” as is done both here and also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/35-19.htm" title="The cloths of service, to do service in the holy place, the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest's office.">Exodus 35:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/39-1.htm" title="And of the blue, and purple, and scarlet, they made cloths of service, to do service in the holy place, and made the holy garments for Aaron; as the LORD commanded Moses.">Exodus 39:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/39-41.htm" title="The cloths of service to do service in the holy place, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and his sons' garments, to minister in the priest's office.">Exodus 39:41</a>. They had, however, not been previously mentioned in the directions. Perhaps the true explanation is, that under the words “cloths of service” (<span class= "ital">bigdey sĕrâd, </span>or <span class= "ital">bigdeh hassĕrâd</span>) are included both the garments of Aaron and also those of his sons, the two later clauses of the verse being exegetical of the first clause.

The honour which comes from God, is always attended with a work to be done; to be employed for God is high honour. Those whom God calls to any service, he will find or make fit for it.

No root <span class="greekheb">שרד</span> occurs in Heb.: in post-Bibl.

The reference is evidently to the artistically woven garments of the priests (ch. 28). The ‘and’ before ‘the holy garments’ is better omitted, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/35-19.htm" title="The cloths of service, to do service in the holy place, the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest's office.">Exodus 35:19</a>, and (in the Heb.) <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/39-41.htm" title="The cloths of service to do service in the holy place, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and his sons' garments, to minister in the priest's office.">Exodus 39:41</a> : the garments in question <span class="ital">were</span> the ‘holy’ ones.

To "call by name" is to choose or appoint by name for a particular work (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-3.htm">Isaiah 45:3-4</a>). Bezaleel was a grandson of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, who is mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/17-10.htm">Exodus 17:10</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/24-14.htm">Exodus 24:14</a>, and was called to be the master-builder, to superintend the whole of the building and carry out the artistic work; consequently he is not only invariably mentioned first (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/35-30.htm">Exodus 35:30</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/36-1.htm">Exodus 36:1-2</a>), but in the accounts of the execution of the separate portions he is mentioned alone (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/37-1.htm">Exodus 37:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/38-22.htm">Exodus 38:22</a>). Filling with the Spirit of God signifies the communication of an extraordinary and supernatural endowment and qualification, "in wisdom," etc., i.e., consisting of wisdom, understanding, knowledge, and every kind of workmanship, that is to say, for the performance of every kind of work. This did not preclude either natural capacity or acquired skill, but rather presupposed them; for in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/31-6.htm">Exodus 31:6</a> it is expressly stated in relation to his assistants, that God had put wisdom into all that were wise-hearted (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-3.htm">Exodus 28:3</a>). Being thus endowed with a supernaturally exalted gift, Bezaleel was qualified "to think out inventions," i.e., ideas or artistic designs. Although everything had been minutely described by Jehovah, designs and plans were still needed in carrying out the work, so that the result should correspond to the divine instructions. </body></html>
