The honour which comes from God, is always attended with a work to be done; to be employed for God is high honour. Those whom God calls to any service, he will find or make fit for it.

This solemn call of Bezaleel and Aholiab is full of instruction. Their work was to be only that of handicraftsmen. Still it was Yahweh Himself who called them by name to their tasks, and the powers which they were now called upon to exercise in their respective crafts, were declared to have been given them by the Holy Spirit. Thus is every effort of skill, every sort of well-ordered labor, when directed to a right end, brought into the very highest sphere of association.<p>There appears to be sufficient reason for identifying Hur, the grandfather of Bezaleel, with the Hur who assisted Aaron in supporting the hands of Moses during the battle with Amalek at Rephidim <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/17-10.htm">Exodus 17:10</a>, and who was associated with Aaron in the charge of the people while Moses was on the mountain <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-14.htm">Exodus 24:14</a>. Josephus says that he was the husband of Miriam. It is thus probable that Bezaleel was related to Moses. He was the chief artificer in metal, stone, and wood; he had also to perform the apothecary's work in the composition of the anointing oil and the incense <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/37-29.htm">Exodus 37:29</a>.

See, I have called&#8212;Though the instructions about the tabernacle were privately communicated to Moses, it was plainly impossible that he could superintend the work in person, amid the multiplicity of his other duties. A head director or builder was selected by God Himself; and the nomination by such high authority removed all ground of jealousy or discontent on the part of any who might have thought their merits overlooked (compare Mt 18:1).<p>by name Bezaleel&#8212;signifying "in the shadow or protection of God"; and, as called to discharge a duty of great magnitude&#8212;to execute a confidential trust in the ancient Church of God, he has his family and lineage recorded with marked distinction. He belonged to the tribe of Judah, which, doubtless for wise and weighty reasons, God all along delighted to honor; and he was the grandson of Hur, a pious patriot (Ex 17:12), who was associated, by a special commission, with Aaron in the government of the people during the absence of Moses. Moreover, it may be noticed that a Jewish tradition affirms Hur to be the husband of Miriam; and if this tradition may be relied on, it affords an additional reason for the appointment of Bezaleel emanating from the direct authority of God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/exodus/31.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> He seems to be the same mentioned <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-20.htm" title="And Hur begat Uri, and Uri begat Bezaleel.">1 Chronicles 2:20</a></span> <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/exodus/31.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>See, I have called by name Bezaleel,.... Had pitched upon, chosen, and distinguished him particularly from all other men to be the architect or chief master builder of the tabernacle, and to be the director and overseer of the whole work relating to it: the Targums of Jonathan and Jerusalem paraphrase it,""I have called with a good name Bezaleel";''as if respect was to be had to his name Bezaleel, as given him by God, and very expressive and significant; whereas the phrase of calling "by name" does not signify the imposing of a name upon him, but the singular and personal choice of him to an office: indeed, his name Bezaleel is very significant, and may be rendered, "in the shadow of God"; and he was under the shadow, influence, and protection of the Lord, and was called to be concerned in making those things, which were shadows of good things to come; and he may be considered in all as a type of Christ, who is the chief and master builder of his church, has the care and oversight of it, and under whom others work; for except he built the house, they labour in vain that build it; he was called by name, or eminently chosen to this work, he took not this honour to himself, but was called of God, as Bezaleel was, and was hid and abode under the shadow of the Almighty all the while he was concerned in it, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/91-1.htm">Psalm 91:1</a>. <p>the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah; Bezaleel's father's name was Uri, which signifies, "my light"; and his grandfather's name Hur, which has the signification of liberty or freedom; the same that Moses left with Aaron to judge the people of Israel during his stay in the mount, and is thought to have been the husband of Miriam; so that his grandfather being living, he may be supposed to be but a young man: the Jews say (n) he was but thirteen years of age when he was employed in this service, but that is not probable; though indeed his antitype, when but twelve years of age, said, "wist ye not that I must be about my Father's business?" his Father, whom he calls Uri, my light, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-1.htm">Psalm 27:1</a> he being the brightness of his Father's glory, and the express image of his person; and is the Son of God that makes men free, and they are free indeed; and of whom it is evident that he sprung out of the tribe of Judah, a tribe greatly honoured of God. <p>(n) Shalshalet Hakabala, fol. 6. 2.<a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/exodus/31.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">See, I <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> have called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah:</span><p>(a) I have chosen and made meet, Ex 35:30.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/exodus/31.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">2</span>. <span class="ital">called by name</span>] i.e. specially chosen: cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/45-3.htm" title="And I will give you the treasures of darkness, and hidden riches of secret places, that you may know that I, the LORD, which call you by your name, am the God of Israel....">Isaiah 45:3-4</a> (of Cyrus).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Bĕẓal’çl</span>] i.e. ‘In the shadow (i.e. protection, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-9.htm" title="Only rebel not you against the LORD, neither fear you the people of the land; for they are bread for us: their defense is departed from them, and the LORD is with us: fear them not.">Numbers 14:9</a> RVm.) of God’; cf. the Ass. name Ina-ṣilli-Bel, ‘In the shadow of Bel’ (cited by Bä.).
