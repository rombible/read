But it was otherwise on the fourth side, towards the east. Here was to be the entrance to the court, and here consequently the line of hangings was to be broken in the middle. A curtain, similar to that at the east end of the tabernacle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/26-36.htm" title="And you shall make an hanging for the door of the tent, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, worked with needlework.">Exodus 26:36</a>), but hung on four pillars instead of five, and capable of being drawn up of down, was to give admission to the court on this side, and was to occupy twenty cubits out of the fifty which formed the entire width of the court. On either side would remain a space of fifteen cubits, which was to be occupied by “hangings,” similar to those on the other three sides of the court. Each of these lengths of fifteen cubits required three pillars for its support. Thus the pillars on the east side were ten, as on the west.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/27.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>27:9-19 The tabernacle was enclosed in a court, about sixty yards long and thirty broad, formed by curtains hung upon brazen pillars, fixed in brazen sockets. Within this enclosure the priests and Levites offered the sacrifices, and thither the Jewish people were admitted. These distinctions represented the difference between the visible nominal church, and the true spiritual church, which alone has access to God, and communion with him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/27.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The east side eastward - On the front side eastward.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/exodus/27.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9-19. the court of the tabernacle&#8212;The enclosure in which the edifice stood was a rectangular court, extending rather more than fifty yards in length and half that space in breadth, and the enclosing parapet was about three yards or half the height of the tabernacle. That parapet consisted of a connected series of curtains, made of fine twined linen yarn, woven into a kind of network, so that the people could see through; but that large curtain which overhung the entrance was of a different texture, being embroidered and dyed with variegated colors, and it was furnished with cords for pulling it up or drawing it aside when the priests had occasion to enter. The curtains of this enclosure were supported on sixty brazen pillars which stood on pedestals of the same metal, but their capitals and fillets were of silver, and the hooks on which they were suspended were of silver also.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/exodus/27.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">These fifteen cubits</span>, with the fifteen cubits <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/27-15.htm" title="And on the other side shall be hangings fifteen cubits: their pillars three, and their sockets three.">Exodus 27:15</a></span>, and the twenty cubits <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/27-16.htm" title="And for the gate of the court shall be an hanging of twenty cubits, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, worked with needlework: and their pillars shall be four, and their sockets four.">Exodus 27:16</a></span>, make up the fifty cubits mentioned. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/exodus/27.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>The hangings of one side of the gate,....

The shape thus given to the altar of burnt-offering corresponded to the other objects in the sanctuary. It could also be carried about with ease, and fixed in any place, and could be used for burning the sacrifices without the wooden walls being injured by the fire. </body></html>
