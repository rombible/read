According to one view, it reached from the middle of the altar to its base, and protected the sides of the altar from the feet of the ministering priests. According to another, it surrounded the upper part of the altar, and was intended to catch any portions of the victims that accidentally fell off. There are no sufficient data to enable us to determine between these views.<p><span class= "bld">Upon the net shalt thou make four brasen rings.</span>—The brazen altar, like the ark and the table of shewbread, was to be carried by the priests when the Israelites changed their camping-ground. It therefore required “rings,” like them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-12.htm" title="And you shall cast four rings of gold for it, and put them in the four corners thereof; and two rings shall be in the one side of it, and two rings in the other side of it.">Exodus 25:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-26.htm" title="And you shall make for it four rings of gold, and put the rings in the four corners that are on the four feet thereof.">Exodus 25:26</a>). These were, in the case of the altar, to be attached to the network, which must have been of a very solid and substantial character.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/exodus/27.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/27-4.htm" title="And you shall make for it a grate of network of brass; and on the net shall you make four brazen rings in the four corners thereof.">Exodus 27:4</a></span>. <span class="ital">Thou shalt make for it a grate of net-work — </span>This was the principal part of the altar. It was let into the hollow about the middle of it, and here the fire was kept, and the sacrifice burned. It was a broad plate of brass full of holes, like a net or sieve, and partly hollow that the fire might burn the better, and the ashes might fall through to the bottom of the altar, where there was a door on the east side to open and take out the ashes.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Now this brazen altar was a type of Christ dying to make atonement for our sins. Christ sanctified himself for his church as their altar, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-19.htm" title="And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth.">John 17:19</a>,) and by his mediation sanctifies the daily services of his people. To the horns of this altar poor sinners flee for refuge, and are safe in virtue of the sacrifice there offered.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/27.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>27:1-8 In the court before the tabernacle, where the people attended, was an altar, to which they must bring their sacrifices, and on which their priests must offer them to God. It was of wood overlaid with brass. A grate of brass was let into the hollow of the altar, about the middle of which the fire was kept, and the sacrifice burnt. It was made of net-work like a sieve, and hung hollow, that the ashes might fall through. This brazen altar was a type of Christ dying to make atonement for our sins. The wood had been consumed by the fire from heaven, if it had not been secured by the brass: nor could the human nature of Christ have borne the wrath of God, if it had not been supported by Divine power.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/27.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Pans - Rather pots as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/38-3.htm">Exodus 38:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-45.htm">1 Kings 7:45</a>.
