That parapet consisted of a connected series of curtains, made of fine twined linen yarn, woven into a kind of network, so that the people could see through; but that large curtain which overhung the entrance was of a different texture, being embroidered and dyed with variegated colors, and it was furnished with cords for pulling it up or drawing it aside when the priests had occasion to enter. The curtains of this enclosure were supported on sixty brazen pillars which stood on pedestals of the same metal, but their capitals and fillets were of silver, and the hooks on which they were suspended were of silver also.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/exodus/27.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Their hooks shall be of silver</span>, all silver, not only covered with silver, as some unduly infer from <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/38-17.htm" title="And the sockets for the pillars were of brass; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets of silver; and the overlaying of their capitals of silver; and all the pillars of the court were filleted with silver.">Exodus 38:17</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/exodus/27.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>All the pillars round about the court shall be filleted with silver,....
