Within this enclosure the priests and Levites offered the sacrifices, and thither the Jewish people were admitted.

That parapet consisted of a connected series of curtains, made of fine twined linen yarn, woven into a kind of network, so that the people could see through; but that large curtain which overhung the entrance was of a different texture, being embroidered and dyed with variegated colors, and it was furnished with cords for pulling it up or drawing it aside when the priests had occasion to enter. The curtains of this enclosure were supported on sixty brazen pillars which stood on pedestals of the same metal, but their capitals and fillets were of silver, and the hooks on which they were suspended were of silver also.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/exodus/27.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/exodus/27.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And likewise for the north side in length there shall be hangings of one hundred cubits long,....

The copper grating was below this bench, and on the outside. The bench rested upon it, or rather it hung from the outer edge of the bench and rested upon the ground, like the inner chest, which it surrounded on all four sides, and in which there were no perforations. It formed with the bench or carcob a projecting footing, which caused the lower half of the altar to look broader than the upper on every side. The priest stood upon this carcob or bench when offering sacrifice, or when placing the wood, or doing anything else upon the altar. This explains Aaron's coming down (&#1497;&#1512;&#1491;) from the altar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-22.htm">Leviticus 9:22</a>); and there is no necessity to suppose that there were steps to the altar, as Knobel does in opposition to <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-26.htm">Exodus 20:26</a>. For even if the height of the altar, viz., three cubits, would be so great that a bench half-way up would be too high for any one to step up to, the earth could be slightly raised on one side so as to make the ascent perfectly easy; and when the priest was standing upon the bench, he could perform all that was necessary upon the top of the altar without any difficulty. </body></html>
