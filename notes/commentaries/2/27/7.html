It was of wood overlaid with brass. A grate of brass was let into the hollow of the altar, about the middle of which the fire was kept, and the sacrifice burnt. It was made of net-work like a sieve, and hung hollow, that the ashes might fall through. This brazen altar was a type of Christ dying to make atonement for our sins. The wood had been consumed by the fire from heaven, if it had not been secured by the brass: nor could the human nature of Christ have borne the wrath of God, if it had not been supported by Divine power.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/27.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The compass of the altar - A shelf or projecting ledge, of convenient width, carried round the altar half way between the top and the base.

Not into the rings of the grate, as Jarchi and others: though Dr. Lightfoot (f) thinks these came out of each corner through the altar frame, and hung out of the frame, and in these the staves being put, made the frame and the grate sure together, and so they were also carried together; but it seems rather, that as the grate had rings peculiar to that, to let it down and take it up, and with which it was carried, with a purple cloth covered over it, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/4-13.htm">Numbers 4:13</a> so the altar had rings peculiar to that on the sides of it, into which these staves were put: <p>and the staves shall be upon the two sides of the altar, to bear it; and which shows that the rings into which these were put were not the rings of the grate, for they were at the four corners of it, which hung upon the four horns of it; whereas the staves were on the two sides of it, in order to bear it from place to place, which was done by the Levites; and was typical of the ministers of the Gospel bearing the name of Christ, and spreading the doctrine of his sacrifice and satisfaction, in the world, which is the main and fundamental doctrine of the Gospel. <p>(f) Works, vol. 1. p. 722. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/exodus/27.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And the staves shall be put into the rings, and the staves shall be upon the two sides of the altar, to bear it.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/exodus/27.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">7</span>.

At its four corners shall its horns be from (out of) it," i.e., not removable, but as if growing out of it. These horns were projections at the corners of the altar, formed to imitate in all probability the horns of oxen, and in these the whole force of the altar was concentrated. The blood of the sin-offering was therefore smeared upon them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-7.htm">Leviticus 4:7</a>), and those who fled to the altar to save their lives laid hold of them (vid., <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/21-14.htm">Exodus 21:14</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-50.htm">1 Kings 1:50</a>; also my commentary on the passage). The altar was to be covered with copper or brass, and all the things used in connection with it were to be made of brass. These were, - (1) the pans, to cleanse it of the ashes of the fat (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/27-3.htm">Exodus 27:3</a> : &#1491;&#1468;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1503;, a denom. verb from &#1491;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1503; the ashes of fat, that is to say, the ashes that arose from burning the flesh of the sacrifice upon the altar, has a privative meaning, and signifies "to ash away," i.e., to cleanse from ashes); (2) &#1497;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; shovels, from &#1497;&#1506;&#1492; to take away (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-17.htm">Isaiah 28:17</a>); (3) &#1502;&#1494;&#1512;&#1511;&#1493;&#1514;, things used for sprinkling the blood, from fzarq to sprinkle; (4) &#1502;&#1494;&#1500;&#1490;&#1493;&#1514; forks, flesh-hooks (cf. &#1502;&#1494;&#1500;&#1490;   <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-13.htm">1 Samuel 3:13</a>); (5) &#1502;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1514; coal-scoops     (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-38.htm">Exodus 25:38</a>). &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1500;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;: either "for all the vessels thereof thou shalt make brass," or "as for all its vessels, thou shalt make (them) of brass." </body></html>
