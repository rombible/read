The Lord God is merciful; ready to forgive the sinner, and to relieve the needy. Gracious; kind, and ready to bestow undeserved benefits. Long-suffering; slow to anger, giving time for repentance, only punishing when it is needful. He is abundant in goodness and truth; even sinners receive the riches of his bounty abundantly, though they abuse them. All he reveals is infallible truth, all he promises is in faithfulness. Keeping mercy for thousands; he continually shows mercy to sinners, and has treasures, which cannot be exhausted, to the end of time. Forgiving iniquity, and transgression, and sin; his mercy and goodness reach to the full and free forgiveness of sin. And will by no means clear the guilty; the holiness and justice of God are part of his goodness and love towards all his creatures. In Christ's sufferings, the Divine holiness and justice are fully shown, and the evil of sin is made known. God's forgiving mercy is always attended by his converting, sanctifying grace. None are pardoned but those who repent and forsake the allowed practice of every sin; nor shall any escape, who abuse, neglect, or despise this great salvation. Moses bowed down, and worshipped reverently. Every perfection in the name of God, the believer may plead with Him for the forgiveness of his sins, the making holy of his heart, and the enlargement of the Redeemer's kingdom.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/34.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This was the second revelation of the name of the God of Israel to Moses. The first revelation was of Yahweh as the self-existent One, who purposed to deliver His people with a mighty hand <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-14.htm">Exodus 3:14</a>; this was of the same Yahweh as a loving Saviour who was now forgiving their sins. The two ideas that mark these revelations are found combined, apart from their historical development, in the second commandment, where the divine unity is shown on its practical side, in its relation to human obligations (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-14.htm">Exodus 34:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-4.htm">Exodus 20:4</a>). Both in the commandment and in this passage, the divine love is associated with the divine justice; but in the former there is a transposition to serve the proper purpose of the commandments, and the justice stands before the love. This is strictly the legal arrangement, brought out in the completed system of the ceremonial law, in which the sin-offering, in acknowledgment of the sentence of justice against sin, was offered before the burnt-offering and the peace-offering. But in this place the truth appears in its essential order; the retributive justice of Yahweh is subordinated to, rather it is made a part of, His forgiving Love (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-14.htm">Exodus 32:14</a> note). The visitation of God, whatever form it may wear, is in all ages the working out purposes of Love toward His children. The diverse aspects of the divine nature, to separate which is the tendency of the unregenerate mind of man and of all paganism, are united in perfect harmony in the Lord Yahweh, of whom the saying is true in all its length and breadth, "God is love" <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-8.htm">1 John 4:8</a>. It was the sense of this, in the degree to which it was now revealed to him, that caused Moses to bow his head and worship <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-8.htm">Exodus 34:8</a>. But the perfect revelation of the harmony was reserved for the fulness of time when "the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world" <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-8.htm">Revelation 13:8</a> was made known to us in the flesh as both our Saviour and our Judge. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/exodus/34.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8-26.

See Hengstenberg, Dissertations ii. p. 319, and Kurtz on the Old Covenant iii.182ff.)<p>and thus restore the covenant record. It was also commanded, as in the former case (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-12.htm">Exodus 19:12-13</a>), that no one should go up the mountain with him, or be seen upon it, and that not even cattle should feed against the mountain, i.e., in the immediate neighbourhood (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-3.htm">Exodus 34:3</a>). The first tables of the covenant were called "tables of stone" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-12.htm">Exodus 24:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/31-18.htm">Exodus 31:18</a>); the second, on the other hand, which were hewn by Moses, are called "tables of stones" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-1.htm">Exodus 34:1</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-4.htm">Exodus 34:4</a>); and the latter expression is applied indiscriminately to both of them in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-13.htm">Deuteronomy 4:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-19.htm">Deuteronomy 5:19</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-9.htm">Deuteronomy 9:9-11</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-1.htm">Deuteronomy 10:1-4</a>. This difference does not indicate a diversity in the records, but may be explained very simply from the fact, that the tables prepared by Moses were hewn from two stones, and not both from the same block; whereas all that could be said of the former, which had been made by God Himself, was that they were of stone, since no one knew whether God had used one stone or two for the purpose. There is apparently far more importance in the following distinction, that the second tables were delivered by Moses and only written upon by God, whereas in the case of the former both the writing and the materials came from God. This cannot have been intended either as a punishment for the nation (Hengstenberg), or as "the sign of a higher stage of the covenant, inasmuch as the further the reciprocity extended, the firmer was the covenant" (Baumgarten). It is much more natural to seek for the cause, as Rashi does, in the fact, that Moses had broken the first in pieces; only we must not regard it as a sign that God disapproved of the manifestation of anger on the part of Moses, but rather as a recognition of his zealous exertions for the restoration of the covenant which had been broken by the sin of the nation. As Moses had restored the covenant through his energetic intercession, he should also provide the materials for the renewal of the covenant record, and bring them to God, for Him to complete and confirm the record by writing the covenant words upon the tables.<p>On the following morning, when Moses ascended the mountain, Jehovah granted him the promised manifestation of His glory (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-5.htm">Exodus 34:5</a>.). The description of this unparalleled occurrence is in perfect harmony with the mysterious and majestic character of the revelation. "Jehovah descended (from heaven) in the cloud, and stood by him there, and proclaimed the name of Jehovah; and Jehovah passed by in his sight, and proclaimed Jehovah, Jehovah God, merciful and gracious," etc. What Moses saw we are not told, but simply the words in which Jehovah proclaimed all the glory of His being; whilst it is recorded of Moses, that he bowed his head toward the earth and worshipped. This "sermon on the name of the Lord," as Luther calls it, disclosed to Moses the most hidden nature of Jehovah. It proclaimed that God is love, but that kind of love in which mercy, grace, long-suffering, goodness, and truth are united with holiness and justice. As the merciful One, who is great in goodness and truth, Jehovah shows mercy to the thousandth, forgiving sin and iniquity in long-suffering and grace; but He does not leave sin altogether unpunished, and in His justice visits the sin of the fathers upon the children and the children's children even unto the fourth generation. The Lord had already revealed Himself to the whole nation from Mount Sinai as visiting sin and showing mercy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>.). But whereas on that occasion the burning zeal of Jehovah which visits sin stood in the foreground, and mercy only followed afterwards, here grace, mercy, and goodness are placed in the front. And accordingly all the words which the language contained to express the idea of grace in its varied manifestations to the sinner, are crowded together here, to reveal the fact that in His inmost being God is love. But in order that grace may not be perverted by sinners into a ground of wantonness, justice is not wanting even here with its solemn threatenings, although it only follows mercy, to show that mercy is mightier than wrath, and that holy love does not punish til sinners despise the riches of the goodness, patience, and long-suffering of God. As Jehovah here proclaimed His name, so did He continue to bear witness of it to the Israelites, from their departure from Sinai till their entrance into Canaan, and from that time forward till their dispersion among the heathen, and even now in their exile showing mercy to the thousandth, when they turn to the Redeemer who has come out of Zion. </body></html>
