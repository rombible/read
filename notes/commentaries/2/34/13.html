Now, after the Israelites had displayed their idolatrous leanings, it is added that they are likewise to destroy the “altars” and the “groves.” Altars were common among all the idolatrous nations, sometimes attached to temples (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-32.htm" title="And he reared up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which he had built in Samaria.">1Kings 16:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/21-4.htm" title="And he built altars in the house of the LORD, of which the LORD said, In Jerusalem will I put my name.">2Kings 21:4-5</a>), sometimes separate from them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-1.htm" title="And Balaam said to Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven oxen and seven rams.">Numbers 23:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-29.htm" title="And Balaam said to Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams.">Numbers 23:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/16-10.htm" title="And king Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglathpileser king of Assyria, and saw an altar that was at Damascus: and king Ahaz sent to Urijah the priest the fashion of the altar, and the pattern of it, according to all the workmanship thereof.">2Kings 16:10-11</a>), and were used for much the same purposes as the Hebrew altars: <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>for sacrifices, bloody and unbloody, and for burning incense. “Groves”—here mentioned for the first time—were peculiar to a limited number of nations, as the Assyrians, Babylonians, Phœnicians, Syrians, and a few others. They appear to have been artificial constructions, either of wood or stone, or both, imitative of vegetable forms, and probably emblematic of the productive powers of nature. The worship connected with the “groves” was of a peculiarly gross and licentious character. The very name, <span class= "ital">ashêrah, </span>was a modification of Ashtoreth, or Astarte. It is remarkable that nothing is said of destroying Canaannite temples—an indication that as yet they did not exist, and a mark of the high antiquity of the book.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/34.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>34:10-17 The Israelites are commanded to destroy every monument of idolatry, however curious or costly; to refuse all alliance, friendship, or marriage with idolaters, and all idolatrous feasts; and they were reminded not with idolaters, and all idolatrous feats; and they were reminded not to repeat the crime of making molten images.

It is often supposed to have been a conventional substitute for a sacred tree; but this is not certain. We have no particulars about the precise size or shape of an Ashçrâh: the two posts, of the form of tree-trunks, resting on a wide base, and surmounted by representations of the full and crescent moon, carved upon a stone from Carthage (Nowack, <span class="ital">Arch.</span> ii. 19; Benzinger, <span class="ital">Arch.</span> 1p. 381, 2p. 326), <span class="ital">might</span> indeed be Ashçrâhs; but we have no evidence that they were. The name <span class="ital">Abd-ashirta</span> (‘servant of Ashirta’) in the Tell el-Amarna letters, and the expression ‘finger (oracle) of Ashirta,’ on a cuneiform tablet of <span class="ital">c.</span> 1350 found at Taanach (see the writer’s <span class="ital">Schweich Lectures</span>, p. 82), seem to indicate that there was an old Semitic goddess <span class="ital">Ashçrâh</span>; and if this was the case, the ‘Ashçrâh’ of the OT. was probably her emblem: but the great difference in the Heb. (<span class="greekheb">אשרה</span> and <span class="greekheb">עשתרת</span>) makes it unlikely that she was the same as the Phoen. ‘Ashtôreth, or the Ass. <span class="ital">Ishtar</span> (Benz. <span class="ital">Arch.</span>2[220] 326 f.). On account of their heathen associations, the Ashçrîm, like the <span class="ital">maẓẓçbâhs</span> (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-24.htm" title="You shall not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do after their works: but you shall utterly overthrow them, and quite break down their images.">Exodus 23:24</a>), were proscribed by the more spiritual Israelites.

They appear to have been artificial constructions, either of wood or metal, or both, more or less imitative of trees, and regarded as emblems of the Oriental nature-deities, especially Baal and Astarte or Ashtoreth. The word translated "grove" (<span class="accented">asherah</span>) is a modification of the name Ashtoreth. The well-known "sacred tree" of the Assyrians is probably an <span class="accented">asherah</span>. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/exodus/34.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When Moses had restored the covenant bond through his intercession (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-14.htm">Exodus 33:14</a>), he was directed by Jehovah to hew out two stones, like the former ones which he had broken, and to come with them the next morning up the mountain, and Jehovah would write upon them the same words as upon the first, <p>(Note: Namely, the ten words in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/20-2.htm">Exodus 20:2-17</a>, not the laws contained in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/34-12.htm">Exodus 34:12-26</a> of this chapter, as Gthe and Hitzig suppose. See Hengstenberg, Dissertations ii. p. 319, and Kurtz on the Old Covenant iii.182ff.)<p>and thus restore the covenant record. It was also commanded, as in the former case (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-12.htm">Exodus 19:12-13</a>), that no one should go up the mountain with him, or be seen upon it, and that not even cattle should feed against the mountain, i.e., in the immediate neighbourhood (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-3.htm">Exodus 34:3</a>). The first tables of the covenant were called "tables of stone" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-12.htm">Exodus 24:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/31-18.htm">Exodus 31:18</a>); the second, on the other hand, which were hewn by Moses, are called "tables of stones" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-1.htm">Exodus 34:1</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-4.htm">Exodus 34:4</a>); and the latter expression is applied indiscriminately to both of them in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-13.htm">Deuteronomy 4:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-19.htm">Deuteronomy 5:19</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-9.htm">Deuteronomy 9:9-11</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-1.htm">Deuteronomy 10:1-4</a>. This difference does not indicate a diversity in the records, but may be explained very simply from the fact, that the tables prepared by Moses were hewn from two stones, and not both from the same block; whereas all that could be said of the former, which had been made by God Himself, was that they were of stone, since no one knew whether God had used one stone or two for the purpose. There is apparently far more importance in the following distinction, that the second tables were delivered by Moses and only written upon by God, whereas in the case of the former both the writing and the materials came from God. This cannot have been intended either as a punishment for the nation (Hengstenberg), or as "the sign of a higher stage of the covenant, inasmuch as the further the reciprocity extended, the firmer was the covenant" (Baumgarten). It is much more natural to seek for the cause, as Rashi does, in the fact, that Moses had broken the first in pieces; only we must not regard it as a sign that God disapproved of the manifestation of anger on the part of Moses, but rather as a recognition of his zealous exertions for the restoration of the covenant which had been broken by the sin of the nation. As Moses had restored the covenant through his energetic intercession, he should also provide the materials for the renewal of the covenant record, and bring them to God, for Him to complete and confirm the record by writing the covenant words upon the tables.<p>On the following morning, when Moses ascended the mountain, Jehovah granted him the promised manifestation of His glory (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-5.htm">Exodus 34:5</a>.). The description of this unparalleled occurrence is in perfect harmony with the mysterious and majestic character of the revelation. "Jehovah descended (from heaven) in the cloud, and stood by him there, and proclaimed the name of Jehovah; and Jehovah passed by in his sight, and proclaimed Jehovah, Jehovah God, merciful and gracious," etc. What Moses saw we are not told, but simply the words in which Jehovah proclaimed all the glory of His being; whilst it is recorded of Moses, that he bowed his head toward the earth and worshipped. This "sermon on the name of the Lord," as Luther calls it, disclosed to Moses the most hidden nature of Jehovah. It proclaimed that God is love, but that kind of love in which mercy, grace, long-suffering, goodness, and truth are united with holiness and justice. As the merciful One, who is great in goodness and truth, Jehovah shows mercy to the thousandth, forgiving sin and iniquity in long-suffering and grace; but He does not leave sin altogether unpunished, and in His justice visits the sin of the fathers upon the children and the children's children even unto the fourth generation. The Lord had already revealed Himself to the whole nation from Mount Sinai as visiting sin and showing mercy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>.). But whereas on that occasion the burning zeal of Jehovah which visits sin stood in the foreground, and mercy only followed afterwards, here grace, mercy, and goodness are placed in the front. And accordingly all the words which the language contained to express the idea of grace in its varied manifestations to the sinner, are crowded together here, to reveal the fact that in His inmost being God is love. But in order that grace may not be perverted by sinners into a ground of wantonness, justice is not wanting even here with its solemn threatenings, although it only follows mercy, to show that mercy is mightier than wrath, and that holy love does not punish til sinners despise the riches of the goodness, patience, and long-suffering of God. As Jehovah here proclaimed His name, so did He continue to bear witness of it to the Israelites, from their departure from Sinai till their entrance into Canaan, and from that time forward till their dispersion among the heathen, and even now in their exile showing mercy to the thousandth, when they turn to the Redeemer who has come out of Zion. </body></html>
