It was so fundamental to the entire polity, that it naturally held a place in every section of the legislation. We have already found it (1) propounded at the giving of the manna (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/16-22.htm" title="And it came to pass, that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for one man: and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses.">Exodus 16:22-30</a>); (2) reasserted in the fourth commandment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/20-8.htm" title="Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.">Exodus 20:8-11</a>); (3) introduced into the “Book of the Covenant” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-12.htm" title="Six days you shall do your work, and on the seventh day you shall rest: that your ox and your ass may rest, and the son of your handmaid, and the stranger, may be refreshed.">Exodus 23:12</a>); and (4) appended to the directions given for the construction of the Tabernacle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/31-13.htm" title="Speak you also to the children of Israel, saying, Truly my sabbaths you shall keep: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that you may know that I am the LORD that does sanctify you.">Exodus 31:13-17</a>).<p><span class= "bld">In earing time and in harvest thou shalt rest.</span>—“Earing-time” is ploughing time, “to ear” being an old English verb, etymologically connected with the Greek <span class= "greekheb">ἄρω</span> and the Latin <span class= "ital">aro. </span>(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/45-6.htm" title="For these two years has the famine been in the land: and yet there are five years, in the which there shall neither be ripening nor harvest.">Genesis 45:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-4.htm" title="And the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer to a rough valley, which is neither eared nor sown, and shall strike off the heifer's neck there in the valley:">Deuteronomy 21:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/8-12.htm" title="And he will appoint him captains over thousands, and captains over fifties; and will set them to ear his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and instruments of his chariots.">1Samuel 8:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-24.htm" title="The oxen likewise and the young asses that ear the ground shall eat clean provender, which has been winnowed with the shovel and with the fan.">Isaiah 30:24</a>.) There was a special temptation to trench on the Sabbatical rest at the times most critical in respect to agricultural operations.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/exodus/34.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-21.htm" title="Six days you shall work, but on the seventh day you shall rest: in ripening time and in harvest you shall rest.">Exodus 34:21</a></span>. Here is a repetition of several appointments made before, especially relating to their solemn feasts: when they had made the calf, they proclaimed a feast in honour of it; now, that they might never do so again, they are here charged with the observance of the feasts which God had instituted. <span class="ital">Thou shalt rest, </span>even <span class="ital">in earing-time and in harvest </span>— The most busy times of the year. All worldly business must give way to that holy rest: harvest-work will prosper the better for the religious observation of the sabbath day in harvest-time. Hereby we must show that we prefer our communion with God, before either the business or the joy of harvest.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/34.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>34:18-27 Once a week they must rest, even in ploughing time, and in harvest. All worldly business must give way to that holy rest; even harvest work will prosper the better, for the religious observance of the sabbath day in harvest time. We must show that we prefer our communion with God, and our duty to him, before the business or the joy of harvest. Thrice a year they must appear before the Lord God, the God of Israel. Canaan was a desirable land, and the neighbouring nations were greedy; yet God says, They shall not desire it. Let us check all sinful desires against God and his glory, in our hearts, and then trust him to check all sinful desires in the hearts of others against us. The way of duty is the way of safety. Those who venture for him never lose by him. Three feasts are here mentioned: 1. The Passover, in remembrance of the deliverance out of Egypt. 2. The feast of weeks, or the feast of Pentecost; added to it is the law of the first-fruits. 3. The feast of in-gathering, or the feast of Tabernacles. Moses is to write these words, that the people might know them better. We can never be enough thankful to God for the written word. God would make a covenant with Israel, in Moses as a mediator. Thus the covenant of grace is made with believers through Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/34.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-9.htm">Exodus 20:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-12.htm">Exodus 23:12</a>.

To appreciate the other temptation, we require to know the peculiar circumstances of the East. It is necessary there to complete the ploughing before the spring rains are over. These last but a short time; and when they are once past no rain can be looked for till the autumn. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/exodus/34.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>To recall the duties of the covenant once more to the minds of the people, the Lord repeats from among the rights of Israel, upon the basis of which the covenant had been established (ch. 21-23), two of the leading points which determined the attitude of the nation towards Him, and which constituted, as it were, the main pillars that were to support the covenant about to be renewed. These were, first, the warning against every kind of league with the Canaanites, who were to be driven out before the Israelites (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/34-11.htm">Exodus 34:11-16</a>); and, secondly, the instructions concerning the true worship of Jehovah (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/34-17.htm">Exodus 34:17-26</a>). The warning against friendship with the idolatrous Canaanites (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/34-11.htm">Exodus 34:11-16</a>) is more fully developed and more strongly enforced than in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-23.htm">Exodus 23:23</a>. The Israelites, when received into the covenant with Jehovah, were not only to beware of forming any covenant with the inhabitants of Canaan (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/23-32.htm">Exodus 23:32-33</a>), but were to destroy all the signs of their idolatrous worship, such as altars, monuments (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-24.htm">Exodus 23:24</a>), and asherim, the idols of Astarte, the Canaanitish goddess of nature, which consisted for the most part of wooden pillars (see my Comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-23.htm">1 Kings 14:23</a>), and to worship no other god, because Jehovah was called jealous, i.e., had revealed Himself as jealous (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>), and was a jealous God. This was commanded, that the Israelites might not suffer themselves to be led astray by such an alliance; to go a whoring after their gods, and sacrifice to them, to take part in their sacrificial festivals, or to marry their sons to the daughters of the Canaanites, by whom they would be persuaded to join in the worship of idols. The use of the expression "go a whoring" in a spiritual sense, in relation to idolatry, is to be accounted for on the ground, that the religious fellowship of Israel with Jehovah was a covenant resembling the marriage tie; and we meet with it for the first time, here, immediately after the formation of this covenant between Israel and Jehovah. The phrase is all the more expressive on account of the literal prostitution that was frequently associated with the worship of Baal and Astarte (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/17-7.htm">Leviticus 17:7</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-5.htm">Leviticus 20:5-6</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-33.htm">Numbers 14:33</a>, etc.). We may see from <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/25-1.htm">Numbers 25:1</a>. how Israel was led astray by this temptation in the wilderness. </body></html>
