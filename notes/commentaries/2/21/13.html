A place is to be provided whither the man-slayer may flee, and where he may be safe, at any rate until the cause is inquired into. Hitherto, throughout the East, it had been regarded as the duty of the next of kin to avenge homicide of whatever kind, and blood had been exacted for blood, however sudden, however provoked, however excusable had been the homicide. No right of asylum, so far as we know, had ever been established before. The Sinaitic legislation for the first time interposed the “city of refuge,” between the “avenger of blood” and his victim. It was for the elders of the city to see that the privilege was not abused. Where the case was doubtful, the man-slayer had to be remitted for trial to the elders of his own town (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/35-22.htm" title="But if he thrust him suddenly without enmity, or have cast on him any thing without laying of wait,">Numbers 35:22-25</a>); where the elders considered his claim made out, he was entitled to protection.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/21.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>21:12-21 God, who by his providence gives and maintains life, by his law protects it. A wilful murderer shall be taken even from God's altar. But God provided cities of refuge to protect those whose unhappiness it was, and not their fault, to cause the death of another; for such as by accident, when a man is doing a lawful act, without intent of hurt, happens to kill another. Let children hear the sentence of God's word upon the ungrateful and disobedient; and remember that God will certainly requite it, if they have ever cursed their parents, even in their hearts, or have lifted up their hands against them, except they repent, and flee for refuge to the Saviour. And let parents hence learn to be very careful in training up their children, setting them a good example, especially in the government of their passions, and in praying for them; taking heed not to provoke them to wrath. Through poverty the Israelites sometimes sold themselves or their children; magistrates sold some persons for their crimes, and creditors were in some cases allowed to sell their debtors who could not pay. But man-stealing, the object of which is to force another into slavery, is ranked in the New Testament with the greatest crimes. Care is here taken, that satisfaction be made for hurt done to a person, though death do not follow. The gospel teaches masters to forbear, and to moderate threatenings, Eph 6:9, considering with Job, What shall I do, when God riseth up?

In the later legislation of Dt.

The technical term, ‘cities of refuge,’ first occurs in P (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/35-6.htm" title="And among the cities which you shall give to the Levites there shall be six cities for refuge, which you shall appoint for the manslayer, that he may flee thither: and to them you shall add forty and two cities.">Numbers 35:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/35-11.htm" title="Then you shall appoint you cities to be cities of refuge for you; that the slayer may flee thither, which kills any person at unawares.">Numbers 35:11</a> ff.). In ancient times ‘the right of asylum was possessed by different sanctuaries in various degrees, depending on prescription, the holiness of the place, and other circumstances; it sometimes extended to an entire city, or even to a mark beyond its walls.… In the Greek period, and later (under Roman rule), many Hellenistic cities in Syria enjoyed the privileges of asylums, the title <span class="greekheb">ἄσυλος</span> appearing on their coins’ (Moore, in <span class="ital">EB.</span> Asylum). Cf. <span class="ital">Rel. Sem.</span> 148. Moslems, adhering to the tradition of heathen times, treat tombs, esp. those of ancestors, notabilities, and saints, as asylums.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">God deliver him into his hand</span>. This does not seem to mean more than, "if he chance upon him without seeking him." God' s providence does in fact bring about the meetings which men call accidental. <span class="cmt_word">I will appoint thee a place</span>. When we first hear of the actual appointment, the number of the places was six - three on either side of Jordan. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/20-7.htm">Joshua 20:7, 8</a>; and compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/35-10.htm">Numbers 35:10-15</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-2.htm">Deuteronomy 19:2</a>.) Thus there was always a city of refuge at a reasonable distance. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/exodus/21.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The daughter of an Israelite, who had been sold by her father as a maid-servant (&#1500;&#1488;&#1502;&#1492;), i.e., as the sequel shows, as a housekeeper and concubine, stood in a different relation to her master's house. She was not to go out like the men-servants, i.e., not to be sent away as free at the end of six years of service; but the three following regulations, which are introduced by &#1488;&#1501; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-8.htm">Exodus 21:8</a>), &#1493;&#1488;&#1501; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-9.htm">Exodus 21:9</a>), and &#1493;&#1488;&#1501; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-11.htm">Exodus 21:11</a>), were to be observed with regard to her. In the first place (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-8.htm">Exodus 21:8</a>), "if she please not her master, who hath betrothed her to himself, then shall he let her be redeemed." The &#1500;&#1488; before &#1497;&#1506;&#1491;&#1492;&#1468; is one of the fifteen cases in which &#1500;&#1488; has been marked in the Masoretic text as standing for &#1500;&#1493;; and it cannot possibly signify not in the passage before us. For if it were to be taken as a negative, "that he do not appoint her," sc., as a concubine for himself, the pronoun &#1500;&#1493; would certainly not be omitted. &#1492;&#1508;&#1491;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468; (for &#1492;&#1508;&#1491;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468;, see Ges. 53, Note 6), to let her be redeemed, i.e., to allow another Israelite to buy her as a concubine; for there can hardly have been any thought of redemption on the part of the father, as it would no doubt be poverty alone that caused him to sell his daughter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-39.htm">Leviticus 25:39</a>). But "to sell her unto a strange nation (i.e., to any one but a Hebrew), he shall have no power, if he acts unfaithfully towards her," i.e., if he do not grant her the promised marriage. In the second place (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/21-9.htm">Exodus 21:9</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-10.htm">Exodus 21:10</a>), "if he appoint her as his son's wife, he shall act towards her according to the rights of daughters," i.e., treat her as a daughter; "and if he take him (the son) another (wife), - whether because the son was no longer satisfied, or because the father gave the son another wife in addition to her - "her food (&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1512; flesh as the chief article of food, instead of &#1500;&#1495;&#1501;, bread, because the lawgiver had persons of property in his mind, who were in a position to keep concubines), her raiment, and her duty of marriage he shall not diminish," i.e., the claims which she had as a daughter for support, and as his son's wife for conjugal rights, were not to be neglected; he was not to allow his son, therefore, to put her away or treat her badly. With this explanation the difficulties connected with every other are avoided. For instance, if we refer the words of <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-9.htm">Exodus 21:9</a> to the son, and understand them as meaning, "if the son should take another wife," we introduce a change of subject without anything to indicate it. If, on the other hand, we regard them as meaning, "if the father (the purchaser) should take to himself another wife," this ought to have come before <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-9.htm">Exodus 21:9</a>. In the third place (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-11.htm">Exodus 21:11</a>), "if he do not (do not grant) these three unto her, she shall go out for nothing, without money." "These three" are food, clothing, and conjugal rights, which are mentioned just before; not "si eam non desponderit sibi nec filio, nec redimi sit passus" (Rabbins and others), nor "if he did not give her to his son as a concubine, but diminished her," as Knobel explains it. </body></html>
