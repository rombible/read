If death ensues in such a case, the crime is, of course, murder or manslaughter, according to the attendant circumstances; but if death does not ensue, it is aggravated assault only. In such cases punishment could not be inflicted by retaliation—the usual penalty under the Mosaic Law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/21-24.htm" title="Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,">Exodus 21:24-25</a>)—without a risk of killing the man, which would have been an excessive punishment. The law therefore imposed a fine, which was to be fixed at such an amount as would at once compensate the sufferer for the loss of his time (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-19.htm" title="If he rise again, and walk abroad on his staff, then shall he that smote him be quit: only he shall pay for the loss of his time, and shall cause him to be thoroughly healed.">Exodus 21:19</a>), and defray the cost of his cure.<p>(18) <span class= "bld">With a stone, or with his fist.</span>—Comp.

A wilful murderer shall be taken even from God's altar. But God provided cities of refuge to protect those whose unhappiness it was, and not their fault, to cause the death of another; for such as by accident, when a man is doing a lawful act, without intent of hurt, happens to kill another. Let children hear the sentence of God's word upon the ungrateful and disobedient; and remember that God will certainly requite it, if they have ever cursed their parents, even in their hearts, or have lifted up their hands against them, except they repent, and flee for refuge to the Saviour. And let parents hence learn to be very careful in training up their children, setting them a good example, especially in the government of their passions, and in praying for them; taking heed not to provoke them to wrath. Through poverty the Israelites sometimes sold themselves or their children; magistrates sold some persons for their crimes, and creditors were in some cases allowed to sell their debtors who could not pay. But man-stealing, the object of which is to force another into slavery, is ranked in the New Testament with the greatest crimes. Care is here taken, that satisfaction be made for hurt done to a person, though death do not follow. The gospel teaches masters to forbear, and to moderate threatenings, Eph 6:9, considering with Job, What shall I do, when God riseth up?

Assault was punishable by the law in two ways. Ordinarily, the rule was that of strict retaliation' ' Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe" (vers. 24, 25; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/24-20.htm">Leviticus 24:20</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-21.htm">Deuteronomy 19:21</a>). But where the assault was severe, causing a man to take to his bed, and call in the physician' s aid, something more was needed. The Rabbinical commentators tell us that in this case he was arrested, and sent to prison until it was ascertained whether the person hurt would die or no. If he died, the man was tried for murder; if he recovered, a fine was imposed. This was axed at such a sum as would at once compensate the injured man for his loss of time and defray the expense of his cure. A similar principle is adopted under our own law in many cases of civil action. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If men strive together</span>. If there is a quarrel and a personal encounter. In our own law this would reduce this offence, if death ensued, to manslaughter. <span class="cmt_word">With a stone, or with his fist</span>. The use of either would show absence of premeditation, and of any design to kill. A weapon would have to be prepared beforehand: a stone might be readily caught up. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/exodus/21.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Still higher than personal liberty, however, is life itself, the right of existence and personality; and the infliction of injury upon this was not only prohibited, but to be followed by punishment corresponding to the crime. The principle of retribution, jus talionis, which is the only one that embodies the idea of justice, lies at the foundation of these threats.<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/21-12.htm">Exodus 21:12-13</a><p>A death-blow was to be punished with death (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-6.htm">Genesis 9:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/24-17.htm">Leviticus 24:17</a>). "He that smiteth a man and (so that) he die (whether on the spot or directly afterwards did not matter), he shall be put to death." This general rule is still further defined by a distinction being drawn between accidental and intentional killing. "But whoever has not lain in wait (for another's life), and God has caused it to come to his hand" (to kill the other); i.e., not only if he did not intend to kill him, but did not even cherish the intention of smiting him, or of doing him harm from hatred and enmity (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/35-16.htm">Numbers 35:16-23</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-4.htm">Deuteronomy 19:4-5</a>), and therefore did so quite unawares, according to a dispensation of God, which is generally called an accident because it is above our comprehension. For such a man God would appoint places of refuge, where he should be protected against the avenger of blood. (On this point, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/35-9.htm">Numbers 35:9</a>.).</body></html>
