The latter reading avoids this difficulty. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">To sell her unto a strange nation he shall have no power:</span> this was in general prohibited for all Hebrew servants, but it is particularly mentioned here, because there was special reason for it; both because there was more danger of her corruption in chastity and religion in regard of her sex, and because the master in that case was under a greater temptation of selling her to a foreigner, because no Israelite would buy her, or give so much money for her as a heathen would, who would and might keep her for a perpetual servant, which the Israelites might not do. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">He hath dealt deceitfully with her, </span> viz. in breaking his promise of marriage made to her, or blasting the hopes he encouraged her to have of it. The Hebrew words are exactly rendered thus, in <span class="ital">dealing deceitfully</span> or <span class="ital">falsely with her</span> or against her; and they may be added as an aggravation of that sin of selling her to a strange nation, wherein there was a double false dealing; the one towards God, who by his law forbad this; the other towards her, whom he hired upon other terms, and not with a power to dispose of her contrary to the law and manner of the Israelites. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/exodus/21.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>If she please not her master,.... "Be evil in the eyes of her master" (p); and he has no liking of her, and love to her, not being agreeable in her person, temper, or conduct, so that he does not choose to make her his wife: <p>who hath betrothed her to him; but not completed the marriage, as he promised, when he bought her, or at least gave reason to expect that he would; for, according to the Jewish canons, a Hebrew handmaid might not be sold but to one who laid himself under obligation to espouse her to himself, or his son, when she was fit to be betrothed (q); and so Jarchi says, he ought to espouse her, and take her to be his wife, for the money of her purchase is the money of her espousals. There is a double reading of this passage, the Keri, or marginal reading we follow; the Cetib, or written text, is, "who hath not betrothed her", both may be taken in, "who hath not betrothed her to him", as he said he would, or as it was expected he should; for, had she been really betrothed, what follows could not have been done: <p>then shall he let her be redeemed; she being at age, and fit for marriage, and her master not caring to marry her, her father shall redeem her, as the Targum of Jonathan; it was incumbent on him to do that, as it was on her master to let her be redeemed, to admit of the redemption of her; or whether, as Aben Ezra says, she redeemed herself, or her father, or one of her relations, if she was near the six years (the end of them), they reckoned how many years she had served, and how many were yet to the seventh, or to the time that she is in her own power, and according to the computation was the redemption: thus, for instance, as it is by others (r) put, if she was bought for six pounds, then one pound is the service of every year; and if she redeemed herself, her master took off of the money for the years she had served; or thus (s), if she was bought for sixty pence, and had served two years, he must pay her forty pence, and so free her: <p>to sell her unto a strange nation, he shall have no power; that is, to another man, as both the Targums of Onkelos and Jonathan, even to an Israelite that was of another family, to whom the right of redemption did not belong; for to sell an Israelite, man or woman, to a Gentile, or one of another nation, was not allowed of in any case, as Josephus (t) observes; but the meaning is, he had no power to sell her to another, though of the same nation, to be his handmaid; this power neither her master nor her father had, as Jarchi asserts, she being redeemed, and in her own power: <p>seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her; in not fulfilling his promise made to her father when he sold her to him, or not answering the expectation he had raised in her; and especially he dealt thus with her, if he had corrupted her, and yet refused to betroth and marry her. <p>(p)  "mala in oculis", Montanus; "mala videbitur in oculis", Junius &amp; Tremellius; "mala fuerit in oculis", Drusius.

If however the woman’s relatives did not redeem her, her master was apparently at liberty to sell her to another Israelite; for the following clause only forbids him to sell her into <span class="ital">foreign</span> servitude. Of course, the woman is not to be supposed to have actually become her master’s concubine: in this case, if he found he did not like her, he would have to give her her freedom unconditionally (cf. <span class="ital">v.</span> 11).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">strange</span>] <span class="bld">foreign</span>, the now obsolete sense of ‘strange’ noticed on <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/2-22.htm" title="And she bore him a son, and he called his name Gershom: for he said, I have been a stranger in a strange land.">Exodus 2:22</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">deceitfully</span>] or <span class="ital">untruly</span>, <span class="bld">viz.</span> in not making her his concubine, as it was understood, when he bought her, that he would do.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If</span> <span class="cmt_word">she please not her master.</span> If he decline, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, to carry out the contract, and take her for his wife. <span class="cmt_word">Then let her be redeemed</span>.

According to <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-12.htm">Deuteronomy 15:12</a>, this rule applied to the Hebrew maid-servant as well. The predicate &#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497; limits the rule to Israelitish servants, in distinction from slaves of foreign extraction, to whom this law did not apply (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-12.htm">Deuteronomy 15:12</a>, "thy brother").<p>(Note: Saalschtz is quite wrong in his supposition, that &#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497; relates not to Israelites, but to relations of the Israelites who had come over to them from their original native land. (See my Arch&#1492;ologie, &#1431;112, Note 2.))<p>An Israelite might buy his own countryman, either when he was sold by a court of justice on account of theft (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-1.htm">Exodus 22:1</a>), or when he was poor and sold himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-39.htm">Leviticus 25:39</a>). The emancipation in the seventh year of service was intimately connected with the sabbatical year, though we are not to understand it as taking place in that particular year. "He shall go out free," sc., from his master's house, i.e., be set at liberty. &#1495;&#1504;&#1468;&#1501;: without compensation. In Deuteronomy the master is also commanded not to let him go out empty, but to load him (&#1495;&#1506;&#1504;&#1497;&#1511; to put upon his neck) from his flock, his threshing-floor, and his wine-press (i.e., with corn and wine); that is to say, to give him as much as he could carry away with him. The motive for this command is drawn from their recollection of their own deliverance by Jehovah from the bondage of Egypt. And in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-18.htm">Exodus 21:18</a> an additional reason is supplied, to incline the heart of the master to this emancipation, viz., that "he has served thee for six years the double of a labourer's wages," - that is to say, "he has served and worked so much, that it would have cost twice as much, if it had been necessary to hire a labourer in his place" (Schultz), - and "Jehovah thy God hath blessed thee in all that thou doest," sc., through his service. </body></html>
