The miscarriage might cost the woman her life, in which case the man who caused it was to suffer death (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-23.htm" title="And if any mischief follow, then you shall give life for life,">Exodus 21:23</a>); or it might have no further ill result than the loss of the child. In this latter case the penalty was to be a fine, assessed by the husband with the consent of the judge (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-22.htm" title="If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart from her, and yet no mischief follow: he shall be surely punished, according as the woman's husband will lay on him; and he shall pay as the judges determine.">Exodus 21:22</a>). The death penalty, where the woman died, is clearly excessive, and probably belongs to the pre-Mosaic legislation, which required “life for life” in every case.<p>(22) <span class= "bld">If men strive, and hurt a woman with child.</span>—It is assumed that this hurt would probably take place through the interference of a pregnant wife in some strife wherein her husband was engaged. It would almost certainly be accidental.<p><span class= "bld">And yet no mischief follow</span>—<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>no further mischief—nothing beyond the loss of the child.<p>(22, 23) <span class= "bld">Life for life, eye for eye.</span>—It is a reasonable conjecture that the law of retaliation was much older than Moses, and accepted by him as tolerable rather than devised as rightful. The law itself was very widely spread. Traces of it are found in India, in Egypt, among the Greeks, and in the laws of the Twelve Tables. Aristotle says that the Pythagoreans approved it, and that it was believed to be the rule by which Rhadamanthus administered justice in the other world. There is, <span class= "ital">primâ facie, </span>a semblance of exact rectitude and equality about it which captivates rude minds, and causes the adoption of the rule generally in an early condition of society. Theoretically, retaliation is the exactest and strictest justice; but in practice difficulties arise. How is the force of a blow to be measured? How are exactly similar burns and wounds to be inflicted? Is eye to be given for eye when the injurer is a one-eyed man? And, again, is it expedient for law to multiply the number of mutilated citizens in a community? Considerations of these kinds cause the rule to be discarded as soon as civilisation reaches a certain point, and tend generally to the substitution of a money compensation, to be paid to the injured party by the injurer. The present passage sanctioned the law of retaliation in principle, but authorised its enforcement in a single case only. In a later part of the Mosaic code the application was made universal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/24-17.htm" title="And he that kills any man shall surely be put to death.">Leviticus 24:17-21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-21.htm" title="And your eye shall not pity; but life shall go for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.">Deuteronomy 19:21</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/exodus/21.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/21-22.htm" title="If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart from her, and yet no mischief follow: he shall be surely punished, according as the woman's husband will lay on him; and he shall pay as the judges determine....">Exodus 21:22-23</a></span>. <span class="ital">And yet no mischief follow — </span>That is, if the woman die not, as appears from the next verse, or the child was not formed and alive in the womb; <span class="ital">he shall be surely punished — </span>The woman’s husband shall impose the fine, and if it be unreasonable, the judges shall have a power to moderate it. <span class="ital">If any mischief follow — </span>If the woman die, or if the child was formed and alive, the offender was to be punished with death. <span class="ital">Thou shalt give life for life </span>— By the judgment of the magistrate.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/21.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>21:22-36 The cases here mentioned give rules of justice then, and still in use, for deciding similar matters.

This law, "the jus talionis," is elsewhere repeated in substance, compare the marginal references. and <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-6.htm">Genesis 9:6</a>. It has its root in a simple conception of justice, and is found in the laws of many ancient nations. It serves in this place as a maxim for the magistrate in awarding the amount of compensation to be paid for the infliction of personal injury. The sum was to be as nearly as possible the worth in money of the power lost by the injured person. Our Lord quotes <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-24.htm">Exodus 21:24</a> as representing the form of the law, in order to illustrate the distinction between the letter and the spirit <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-38.htm">Matthew 5:38</a>. The tendency of the teaching of the Scribes and Pharisees was to confound the obligations of the conscience with the external requirements of the law. The law, in its place, was still to be "holy and just and good," <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/7-12.htm">Romans 7:12</a>, but its direct purpose was to protect the community, not to guide the heart of the believer, who was not to exact eye for eye, tooth for tooth, but to love his enemies, and to forgive all injuries. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/exodus/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Ex 21:7-36.

Retaliation</span>. Women in all countries are apt to interfere in the quarrels of men, and run the risk of suffering injuries which proceed from accident rather than design, one such injury being of a peculiar character, to which there is nothing correspondent among the injuries which may be done to man. This is abortion, or miscarriage. The Mosaic legislation sought to protect pregnant women from suffering this injury by providing, first, that if death resulted the offender should suffer death (ver. 23); and, secondly, that if there were no further ill-result than the miscarriage itself, still a fine should be paid, to be assessed by the husband of the injured woman with the consent of the judges (ver. 22). The mention of "life for life," in ver. 23, is followed by an enunciation of the general "law of retaliation," applied here (it would seem) to the special case in hand, but elsewhere (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/24-19.htm">Leviticus 24:19, 20</a>) extended so as to be a fundamental law, applicable to all cases of personal injury. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If men strive and hurt a</span> <span class="cmt_word">woman.</span> A chance hurt is clearly intended, not one done on purpose. <span class="cmt_word">So that her fruit depart from her</span>.

He was not to be wholly at the mercy of the injured father. If he thought the sum demanded was excessive, there was to be an appeal to a tribunal. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/exodus/21.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"But he who acts presumptuously against his neighbour, to slay him with guile, thou shalt take him from Mine altar that he may die." These words are not to be understood as meaning, that only intentional and treacherous killing was to be punished with death; but, without restricting the general rule in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/21-12.htm">Exodus 21:12</a>, they are to be interpreted from their antithesis to <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/21-13.htm">Exodus 21:13</a>, as signifying that even the altar of Jehovah was not to protect a man who had committed intentional murder, and carried out his purpose with treachery. (More on this point at <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/35-16.htm">Numbers 35:16</a>.) By this regulation, the idea, which was common to the Hebrews and many other nations, that the altar as God's abode afforded protection to any life that was in danger from men, was brought back to the true measure of its validity, and the place of expiation for sins of weakness (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-2.htm">Leviticus 4:2</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-15.htm">Leviticus 5:15</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-18.htm">Leviticus 5:18</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/15-27.htm">Numbers 15:27-31</a>) was prevented from being abused by being made a place of refuge for criminals who were deserving of death. Maltreatment of a father and mother through striking (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-15.htm">Exodus 21:15</a>), man-stealing (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-16.htm">Exodus 21:16</a>), and cursing parents (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/21-17.htm">Exodus 21:17</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-9.htm">Leviticus 20:9</a>), were all to be placed on a par with murder, and punished in the same way. By the "smiting" (&#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492;) of parents we are not to understand smiting to death, for in that case &#1493;&#1502;&#1514; would be added as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/21-12.htm">Exodus 21:12</a>, but any kind of maltreatment. The murder of parents is not mentioned at all, as not likely to occur and hardly conceivable. The cursing (&#1511;&#1500;&#1468;&#1500; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>) of parents is placed on a par with smiting, because it proceeds from the same disposition; and both were to be punished with death, because the majesty of God was violated in the persons of the parents (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>). Man-stealing was also no less a crime, being a sin against the dignity of man, and a violation of the image of God. For &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; "a man," we find in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-7.htm">Deuteronomy 24:7</a>, &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; "a soul," by which both man and woman are intended, and the still more definite limitation, "of his brethren of the children of Israel." The crime remained the same whether he had sold him (the stolen man), or whether he was still found in his hand. (For &#1493; - &#1493; as a sign of an alternative in the linking together of short sentences, see <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/29-9.htm">Proverbs 29:9</a>, and Ewald, 361.) This is the rendering adopted by most of the earlier translators, and we get no intelligent sense if we divide the clauses thus: "and sell him so that he is found in his hand." </body></html>
