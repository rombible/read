(1), striking a parent; (2) kidnapping; and (3) cursing a parent. The immediate sequence of these crimes upon murder, and their punishment by the same penalty, marks strongly God’s abhorrence of them. The parent is viewed as God’s representative, and to smite him is to offer God an insult in his person. To curse him implies, if possible, a greater want of reverence; and, since curses can only be effectual as appeals to God, it is an attempt to enlist God on our side against His representative. Kidnapping is a crime against the person only a very little short of murder, since it is to deprive a man of that which gives life its chief value—liberty. Many a man would prefer death to slavery; and to almost all the passing into the slave condition would be a calamity of the most terrible kind, Involving life-long misery. Its suddenness and unexpectedness, when the result of kidnapping, would augment its grievousness, and render it the most crushing of all misfortunes. Joseph’s history shows us how easy it was to sell a free man as a slave, and obtain his immediate removal into a distant country (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/37-25.htm" title="And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a company of Ishmeelites came from Gilead with their camels bearing spices and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt.">Genesis 37:25-28</a>). The Egyptian annals tell us of bloody wars carried on for kidnapping purposes (Lenormant, <span class= "ital">Histoire Ancienne, </span>vol. i., pp. 423, 424). In the classical times and countries, the slaves offered for sale in the markets had usually been obtained in this way. The stringent law of the Mosaic code (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-16.htm" title="And he that steals a man, and sells him, or if he be found in his hand, he shall surely be put to death.">Exodus 21:16</a>) was greatly needed to check an atrocious crime very widely committed.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/exodus/21.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-15.htm" title="And he that smites his father, or his mother, shall be surely put to death.">Exodus 21:15</a></span>. <span class="ital">He that smiteth his father, </span>&c. — So sacred and inviolable is that reverence which children owe to their parents, that, by the law of God, it was death not only to strike them, but even to curse or outrageously revile them, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-17.htm" title="And he that curses his father, or his mother, shall surely be put to death.">Exodus 21:17</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-4.htm" title="For God commanded, saying, Honor your father and mother: and, He that curses father or mother, let him die the death.">Matthew 15:4</a>. The reason of this law is, that such crimes are a sign of most audacious wickedness. It appears, however, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-18.htm" title="If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, which will not obey the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and that, when they have chastened him, will not listen to them:">Deuteronomy 21:18</a>, that children were not to be put to death for the first offence of this kind, but if, after repeated admonitions from their parents, they still persisted in their undutiful carriage, without hope of reformation, then, upon the accusation of their parents, they were to be put to death.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/21.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>21:12-21 God, who by his providence gives and maintains life, by his law protects it. A wilful murderer shall be taken even from God's altar. But God provided cities of refuge to protect those whose unhappiness it was, and not their fault, to cause the death of another; for such as by accident, when a man is doing a lawful act, without intent of hurt, happens to kill another. Let children hear the sentence of God's word upon the ungrateful and disobedient; and remember that God will certainly requite it, if they have ever cursed their parents, even in their hearts, or have lifted up their hands against them, except they repent, and flee for refuge to the Saviour. And let parents hence learn to be very careful in training up their children, setting them a good example, especially in the government of their passions, and in praying for them; taking heed not to provoke them to wrath. Through poverty the Israelites sometimes sold themselves or their children; magistrates sold some persons for their crimes, and creditors were in some cases allowed to sell their debtors who could not pay. But man-stealing, the object of which is to force another into slavery, is ranked in the New Testament with the greatest crimes. Care is here taken, that satisfaction be made for hurt done to a person, though death do not follow. The gospel teaches masters to forbear, and to moderate threatenings, Eph 6:9, considering with Job, What shall I do, when God riseth up?

This crime was made capital, to show the heinousness of it, how detestable it was to God, and in order to deter from it. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/exodus/21.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And he that smiteth his father, or his mother, shall be surely put to death.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/exodus/21.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">15</span>.

The severity of the penalty was in accordance with the high respect paid to both parents in ancient Israel: see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-12.htm" title="Honor your father and your mother: that your days may be long on the land which the LORD your God gives you.">Exodus 20:12</a>, and cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/21-18.htm" title="If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, which will not obey the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and that, when they have chastened him, will not listen to them:...">Deuteronomy 21:18-21</a>. Hạmmurabi (§ 195) ordained that if a son struck his father—no mention is made of his mother—his hands should be cut off. The older Sumerian laws said1[188]: ‘If a son has said to his father, Thou art not my father [i.e. repudiated him], he may brand him, lay fetters upon him, and sell him. If a son has said to his mother, Thou art not my mother, one shall brand his forehead, drive him round the city, and expel him from the house.’ At Athens <span class="greekheb">γονέων κάκωσις</span> (‘maltreatment of parents’) was actionable, and might be punished with <span class="greekheb">ἀτιμία</span>, or loss of civil rights (Andoc. <span class="ital">de Myst.</span> § 74, cf. Demosth. <span class="ital">adv. Timocr.</span> §§ 103, 105, p. 732 f.); and Plato (<span class="ital">Legg.</span> ix. 881 b–d), if any one struck a parent, would have any one who witnessed the act, and failed to interfere, severely punished, and the offender himself condemned to perpetual exile, or death if he ever returned home. Solon (Cic. <span class="ital">Rosc.</span> 25) is said to have made no mention of such a crime, on the ground that he considered its occurrence impossible (Kn.).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[188] Winckler, <span class="ital">Gesetze Hamm</span>.

The unsystematic character of the arrangement in this chapter is remarkably shown by this interruption of the consideration of different sorts of homicide, in order to introduce offences of quite a different character, and those not very closely allied to each other - <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> Striking a parent; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> Kidnapping; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> Cursing a parent<span class="cmt_word">.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that smiteth his father</span>, etc. To "smite" here is simply to "strike" - to offer the indignity of a blow - not to kill, which had already been made capital (ver. 12), not in the case of parents only, but in every case. The severity of the law is very remarkable, and strongly emphasises the dignity and authority of parents. There is no parallel to it in any other known code, though of course the <span class="accented">patria potestas</span> of the Roman father gave him the power of punishing a son who had struck him, capitally. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/exodus/21.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The daughter of an Israelite, who had been sold by her father as a maid-servant (&#1500;&#1488;&#1502;&#1492;), i.e., as the sequel shows, as a housekeeper and concubine, stood in a different relation to her master's house. She was not to go out like the men-servants, i.e., not to be sent away as free at the end of six years of service; but the three following regulations, which are introduced by &#1488;&#1501; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-8.htm">Exodus 21:8</a>), &#1493;&#1488;&#1501; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-9.htm">Exodus 21:9</a>), and &#1493;&#1488;&#1501; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-11.htm">Exodus 21:11</a>), were to be observed with regard to her. In the first place (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-8.htm">Exodus 21:8</a>), "if she please not her master, who hath betrothed her to himself, then shall he let her be redeemed." The &#1500;&#1488; before &#1497;&#1506;&#1491;&#1492;&#1468; is one of the fifteen cases in which &#1500;&#1488; has been marked in the Masoretic text as standing for &#1500;&#1493;; and it cannot possibly signify not in the passage before us. For if it were to be taken as a negative, "that he do not appoint her," sc., as a concubine for himself, the pronoun &#1500;&#1493; would certainly not be omitted. &#1492;&#1508;&#1491;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468; (for &#1492;&#1508;&#1491;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468;, see Ges. 53, Note 6), to let her be redeemed, i.e., to allow another Israelite to buy her as a concubine; for there can hardly have been any thought of redemption on the part of the father, as it would no doubt be poverty alone that caused him to sell his daughter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-39.htm">Leviticus 25:39</a>). But "to sell her unto a strange nation (i.e., to any one but a Hebrew), he shall have no power, if he acts unfaithfully towards her," i.e., if he do not grant her the promised marriage. In the second place (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/21-9.htm">Exodus 21:9</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-10.htm">Exodus 21:10</a>), "if he appoint her as his son's wife, he shall act towards her according to the rights of daughters," i.e., treat her as a daughter; "and if he take him (the son) another (wife), - whether because the son was no longer satisfied, or because the father gave the son another wife in addition to her - "her food (&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1512; flesh as the chief article of food, instead of &#1500;&#1495;&#1501;, bread, because the lawgiver had persons of property in his mind, who were in a position to keep concubines), her raiment, and her duty of marriage he shall not diminish," i.e., the claims which she had as a daughter for support, and as his son's wife for conjugal rights, were not to be neglected; he was not to allow his son, therefore, to put her away or treat her badly. With this explanation the difficulties connected with every other are avoided. For instance, if we refer the words of <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-9.htm">Exodus 21:9</a> to the son, and understand them as meaning, "if the son should take another wife," we introduce a change of subject without anything to indicate it. If, on the other hand, we regard them as meaning, "if the father (the purchaser) should take to himself another wife," this ought to have come before <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-9.htm">Exodus 21:9</a>. In the third place (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-11.htm">Exodus 21:11</a>), "if he do not (do not grant) these three unto her, she shall go out for nothing, without money." "These three" are food, clothing, and conjugal rights, which are mentioned just before; not "si eam non desponderit sibi nec filio, nec redimi sit passus" (Rabbins and others), nor "if he did not give her to his son as a concubine, but diminished her," as Knobel explains it. </body></html>
