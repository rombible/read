Protection from both was needed. The law given to Noah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-5.htm" title="And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man.">Genesis 9:5</a>) had already laid it down that whenever a beast killed a man his life was to be forfeit. This law was now re-enacted, but with a further and very important proviso. If the animal had an owner, and the owner had reason to know that it was dangerous, then not only the beast, but the owner also was to be held guilty. He was to be liable to a process for murder (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-29.htm" title="But if the ox were wont to push with his horn in time past, and it has been testified to his owner, and he has not kept him in, but that he has killed a man or a woman; the ox shall be stoned, and his owner also shall be put to death.">Exodus 21:29</a>); but, with the consent of the aggrieved family, might pay a sum of money as compensation instead (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-30.htm" title="If there be laid on him a sum of money, then he shall give for the ransom of his life whatever is laid on him.">Exodus 21:30</a>). In the case of a slave, the sum was fixed at what was regarded as the standard price of a slave (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/25-44.htm" title="Both your slaves, and your bondmaids, which you shall have, shall be of the heathen that are round about you; of them shall you buy slaves and bondmaids.">Leviticus 25:44-46</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/27-3.htm" title="And your estimation shall be of the male from twenty years old even to sixty years old, even your estimation shall be fifty shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary.">Leviticus 27:3</a>), viz., thirty silver shekels.<p>(28) <span class= "bld">The ox shall be surely stoned</span>—<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>he shall die the death of a murderer.<p><span class= "bld">His flesh shall not be eaten.</span>—An ox killed by stoning would not be bled in the usual way, and would be “unclean” food for Hebrews.

At Athens the court of the Phylobasileis (‘Tribe-kings’) in the Prytaneion, established, it was said, Draco (b.c. 624), investigated cases thus arising (Demosth. <span class="ital">adv. Aristocr</span>. § 76, p. 645, Arist. <span class="ital">Constit. of Athens</span>, 57 <span class="ital">end</span>); and so Plato (<span class="ital">Legg.</span> ix. 873 e–874 a) would have an animal or inanimate object that had killed a man tried, and, if found guilty, expelled from the country (the animal having been first slain). Pausanias (v. 27. 10; vi. 11. 6) mentions two cases of statues, one thrown into the sea, and the other ceremonially purified, for having caused a death. An interesting collection of parallels from many different nations is given by Frazer, <span class="ital">Pausanias</span>, ii. 370 ff. (cited by Cook, p. 252, who also refers to Baring-Gould, <span class="ital">Curiosities of Olden Times</span>, 1895, p. 57 ff.),—many taken from Chambers, <span class="ital">Book of Days</span>, i. 126 ff. In mediaeval Europe animals charged with causing a death were often tried in a court of law, and, if found guilty, killed: a cow was executed in this way in France as late as 1740.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">his flesh shall not be eaten</span>] Blood-guilt would be resting upon it, which would be transferred to any one partaking of it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">quit</span>] i.e. <span class="ital">pronounced innocent, acquitted</span>, as <span class="ital">v.</span> 19.

For the purpose of inculcating as strongly as possible the principle of the sanctity of human life, the legislator notices the case where mortal injury is done to a person by a domesticated animal. The ox is taken as the example, being the animal most likely to inflict such an injury. In accordance with the declaration already made to Noah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-6.htm">Genesis 9:6</a>), it is laid down that the destructive beast must be killed. Further, to mark the abhorrence in which murder ought to be held, the provision is made, that none of the creature' s flesh must be eaten. The question then arises, is the owner to suffer any punishment? This is answered in the way that natural equity points out - "If he had reason to know the savage temper of the animal, he is to he held responsible; if otherwise, he is to go free." In the former case, the Hebrew law assigned a higher degree of responsibility than accords with modern notions; but practically the result was not very different. The neglectful Hebrew owner was held to have been guilty of a capital offence, but was allowed to "redeem his life" by a fine. His modern counterpart would be held to have been guilty simply of <span class="accented">laches</span> or neglect of duty, and would be punished by fine or imprisonment <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The ox shall be surely stoned.</span> He shall suffer the same death that would have been the portion of a human murderer. <span class="cmt_word">His flesh shall not be eaten</span>. The animal was regarded as accursed, and therefore, as a matter of course, no Hebrew might eat of it. According to the Rabbinical commentators, it was not even lawful to sell the carcase to Gentiles. <span class="cmt_word">The owner shall be quit</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "shall be liable to no punishment." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/exodus/21.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>If men strove and thrust against a woman with child, who had come near or between them for the purpose of making peace, so that her children come out (come into the world), and no injury was done either to the woman or the child that was born, <p>(Note: The words &#1497;&#1500;&#1491;&#1497;&#1492; &#1493;&#1497;&#1510;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; are rendered by the lxx &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b7; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; and the corresponding clause &#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492; &#1488;&#1505;&#1493;&#1503; &#1493;&#1488;&#1501; by &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3b7;&#787;&#834;&#837;; consequently the translators have understood the words as meaning that the fruit, the premature birth of which was caused by the blow, if not yet developed into a human form, was not to be regarded as in any sense a human being, so that the giver of the blow was only required to pay a pecuniary compensation, - as Philo expresses it, "on account of the injury done to the woman, and because he prevented nature, which forms and shapes a man into the most beautiful being, from bringing him forth alive." But the arbitrary character of this explanation is apparent at once; for &#1497;&#1500;&#1491; only denotes a child, as a fully developed human being, and not the fruit of the womb before it has assumed a human form. In a manner no less arbitrary &#1488;&#1505;&#1493;&#1503; has been rendered by Onkelos and the Rabbins &#1502;&#1493;&#1514;&#1488;, death, and the clause is made to refer to the death of the mother alone, in opposition to the penal sentence in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/21-23.htm">Exodus 21:23</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/21-24.htm">Exodus 21:24</a>, which not only demands life for life, but eye for eye, etc., and therefore presupposes not death alone, but injury done to particular members. The omission of &#1500;&#1492;&#1468;, also, apparently renders it impracticable to refer the words to injury done to the woman alone.)<p>a pecuniary compensation was to be paid, such as the husband of the woman laid upon him, and he was to give it &#1489;&#1468;&#1508;&#1500;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; by (by an appeal to) arbitrators. A fine is imposed, because even if no injury had been done to the woman and the fruit of her womb, such a blow might have endangered life. (For &#1497;&#1510;&#1488; roF(  to go out of the womb, see <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/25-25.htm">Genesis 25:25-26</a>.) The plural &#1497;&#1500;&#1491;&#1497;&#1492; is employed for the purpose of speaking indefinitely, because there might possibly be more than one child in the womb. "But if injury occur (to the mother or the child), thou shalt give soul for soul, eye for eye,...wound for wound:" thus perfect retribution was to be made.</body></html>
