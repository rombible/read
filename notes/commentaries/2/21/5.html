At Rome it was common for slaves to endure the severest torture rather than betray or accuse their owners. If a man has no rights, he is thankful for small mercies, and responds with warm feeling to those who treat him kindly. As the Hebrew form of slavery was of a mild type, masters being admonished to treat their slaves “not as bondservants, but as hired servants” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/25-39.htm" title="And if your brother that dwells by you be waxen poor, and be sold to you; you shall not compel him to serve as a bondservant:">Leviticus 25:39-40</a>), and, again, “not to rule over them with rigour” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-46.htm" title="And you shall take them as an inheritance for your children after you, to inherit them for a possession; they shall be your slaves for ever: but over your brothers the children of Israel, you shall not rule one over another with rigor.">Leviticus 25:46</a>), there would naturally be frequent cases where the slave would not wish to “go out.” He might actually “love his master;” or he might value the security from want which attaches to the slave condition; or he might be unwilling to break up the family which, by his master’s favour, he had been allowed to create. For such cases some provision was necessary. It was made by the law here formulated (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/21-5.htm" title="And if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free:">Exodus 21:5-6</a>), which allowed the Hebrew slave, if he liked, to forfeit all claim to freedom, and take upon him permanently the condition of a bondman.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/21.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>21:1-11 The laws in this chapter relate to the fifth and sixth commandments; and though they differ from our times and customs, nor are they binding on us, yet they explain the moral law, and the rules of natural justice. The servant, in the state of servitude, was an emblem of that state of bondage to sin, Satan, and the law, which man is brought into by robbing God of his glory, by the transgression of his precepts. Likewise in being made free, he was an emblem of that liberty wherewith Christ, the Son of God, makes free from bondage his people, who are free indeed; and made so freely, without money and without price, of free grace.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>If a married man became a bondman, his rights in regard to his wife were respected: but if a single bondman accepted at the hand of his master a bondwoman as his wife, the master did not lose his claim to the woman or her children, at the expiration of the husband's term of service. Such wives, it may be presumed, were always foreign slaves. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/exodus/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2-6. If thou buy an Hebrew servant&#8212;Every Israelite was free-born; but slavery was permitted under certain restrictions. An Hebrew might be made a slave through poverty, debt, or crime; but at the end of six years he was entitled to freedom, and his wife, if she had voluntarily shared his state of bondage, also obtained release. Should he, however, have married a female slave, she and the children, after the husband's liberation, remained the master's property; and if, through attachment to his family, the Hebrew chose to forfeit his privilege and abide as he was, a formal process was gone through in a public court, and a brand of servitude stamped on his ear (Ps 40:6) for life, or at least till the Jubilee (De 15:17).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/exodus/21.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/exodus/21.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And if the servant shall plainly say,....

It is an attempt to represent in English the idiomatic use of the Hebrew inf. abs., which emphasizes the verb to which it is attached, and is often used in the expression of a condition (G.-K. § 113o). ‘Plainly,’ however, does not give the correct emphasis.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">I love my master</span>] A slave was no doubt often well treated, and would then naturally ‘prefer slavery with comfort to freedom with destitution’ (<span class="ital">EB.</span> iv. 4656).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">my wife, and my children</span>] The case is supposed to be the one provided for in <span class="ital">v.</span> 4, in which the slave’s wife and children would not accompany him into freedom.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">5, 6</span>.

The Hebrew form of slavery was altogether of a mild kind. Masters are admonished to treat their slaves "not as bond-servants, but as hired servants or sojourners," and again "not to rule over them with rigour" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-39.htm">Leviticus 25:39, 40, 43</a>). Even among the heathen, slaves often bore a true affection to their masters. Or, the slave might be so attached to his wife and children as to be unwilling to separate from them, and might prefer slavery with the solace of their society to freedom without it. For such cases the provision was made, which is contained in ver. 6. On the slave declaring to his master his unwillingness to go free, the master might take him before the judges, or magistrates (literally "gods") as witnesses, and perhaps registrars of the man' s declaration, and might then reconduct him to his house, and by a significant ceremony mark him as his slave "for ever." The ceremony consisted in boring through one of his ears with an awl, and driving the awl into the door or doorpost of the house, thereby attaching him physically to the dwelling of which he became thenceforth a permanent inmate. Almost all commentators assert that some such custom was common in the East in connection with slavery, and refer to Xen. Aaab. 3:1, &sect; 31; Plant. <span class="accented">Poenul</span>. 5:2, 21; Juv. Sat. 1:104; Plutarch. <span class="accented">Vit</span>. <span class="accented">Cic</span>. &sect; 26, etc. But these passages merely show that the Orientals generally - not slaves in particular - had their ears bored for the purpose of wearing earrings, and indicate no usage at all comparable  to the Hebrew practice. The Hebrew custom - probably a very ancient one - seems to have had two objects - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> The declaring by a significant act, that the man belonged to the house; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> The permanent marking of him as a slave, dis-entitled to the rights of freemen, <span class="cmt_word">he shall serve him for ever</span>. Josephus (<span class="accented">Ant. Jud.</span> 4:8, &sect; 20) and the Jewish commentators generally maintain that the law of the jubilee release overruled this enactment; but this must be regarded as very doubtful. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/exodus/20.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>For the worship of Jehovah, the God of heaven, Israel needed only an altar, on which to cause its sacrifices to ascend to God. The altar, as an elevation built up of earth or rough stones, was a symbol of the elevation of man to God, who is enthroned on high in the heaven; and because man was to raise himself to God in his sacrifices, Israel also was to make an altar, though only of earth, or if of stones, not of hewn stones. "For if thou swingest thy tool (&#1495;&#1512;&#1489; lit., sharpness, then any edge tool) over it (over the stone), thou defilest it" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-25.htm">Exodus 20:25</a>). "Of earth:" i.e., not "of comparatively simple materials, such as befitted a representation of the creature" (Schultz on <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12.htm">Deuteronomy 12</a>); for the altar was not to represent the creature, but to be the place to which God came to receive man into His fellowship there. For this reason the altar was to be made of the same material, which formed the earthly soil for the kingdom of God, either of earth or else of stones, just as they existed in their natural state; not, however, "because unpolished stones, which retain their true and native condition, appear to be endowed with a certain native purity, and therefore to be most in harmony with the sanctity of an altar" (Spencer de legg. Hebr. rit. lib. ii. c. 6), for the "native purity" of the earth does not agree with <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-17.htm">Genesis 3:17</a>; but because the altar was to set forth the nature of the simple earthly soil, unaltered by the hand of man. The earth, which has been involved in the curse of sin, is to be renewed and glorified into the kingdom of God, not by sinful men, but by the gracious hand of God alone. Moreover, Israel was not to erect the altar for its sacrifices in any place that it might choose, but only in every place in which Jehovah should bring His name to remembrance. &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; &#1492;&#1494;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512; does not mean "to make the name of the Lord remembered," i.e., to cause men to remember it; but to establish a memorial of His name, i.e., to make a glorious revelation of His divine nature, and thereby to consecrate the place into a holy soil (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-5.htm">Exodus 3:5</a>), upon which Jehovah would come to Israel and bless it. Lastly, the command not to go up to the altar by steps (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-26.htm">Exodus 20:26</a>) is followed by the words, "that thy nakedness be not discovered thereon." It was in the feeling of shame that the consciousness of sin first manifested itself, and it was in the shame that the sin was chiefly apparent (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-7.htm">Genesis 3:7</a>); hence the nakedness was a disclosure of sin, through which the altar of God would be desecrated, and for this reason it was forbidden to ascend to the altar by steps. These directions with reference to the altar to be built do not refer merely to the altar, which was built for the conclusion of the covenant, nor are they at variance with the later instructions respecting the one altar at the tabernacle, upon which all the sacrifices were to be presented (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/17-8.htm">Leviticus 17:8-9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-5.htm">Deuteronomy 12:5</a>.), nor are they merely "provisional" but they lay the foundation for the future laws with reference to the places of worship, though without restricting them to one particular locality on the one hand, or allowing an unlimited number of altars on the other. Hence "several places and altars are referred to here, because, whilst the people were wandering in the desert, there could be no fixed place for the tabernacle" (Riehm). But the erection of the altar is unquestionably limited to every place which Jehovah appointed for the purpose by a revelation. We are not to understand the words, however, as referring merely to those places in which the tabernacle and its altar were erected, and to the site of the future temple (Sinai, Shilloh, and Jerusalem), but to all those places also where altars were built and sacrifices offered on extraordinary occasions, on account of God, - appearing there such, for example, as Ebal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/8-30.htm">Joshua 8:30</a> compared with <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-5.htm">Deuteronomy 27:5</a>), the rock in Ophrah (<a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/6-25.htm">Judges 6:25-26</a>), and many other places besides. </body></html>
