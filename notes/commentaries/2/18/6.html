It is suspected that the true reading here is, "and they said," - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, some one said - "to Moses, behold thy father-in-law" (or "brother-in-law"), "Jethro, is come unto thee." So the LXX., and many moderns, as Kennicott, Geddes, Boothroyd, Canon Cook, and others. But the explanation, that Jethro, on arriving in the vicinity of Moses, sent a messenger to him, who spoke in his name (Rosenmuller, Patrick, Pool, Kalisch, Keil, etc.) is at any rate plausible, and removes all necessity of altering the text. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/exodus/17.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>To praise God for His help, Moses built an altar, which he called "Jehovah my banner," and said, when he did so, "The hand on the throne (or banner) of Jah! War to the Lord from generation to generation!" There is nothing said about sacrifices being offered upon this altar. It has been conjectured, therefore, that as a place of worship and thank-offering, the altar with its expressive name was merely to serve as a memorial to posterity of the gracious help of the Lord, and that the words which were spoken by Moses were to serve as a watchword for Israel, keeping this act of God in lively remembrance among the people in all succeeding generations. &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/17-16.htm">Exodus 17:16</a>) merely introduces the words as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/4-23.htm">Genesis 4:23</a>, etc. The expression &#1497;&#1492;&#1468; &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1499;&#1468;&#1505; &#1497;&#1491; is obscure, chiefly on account of the &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0; &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;. &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;. In the ancient versions (with the exception of the Septuagint, in which &#1497;&#1492; &#1499;&#1509; is treated as one word, and rendered &#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;) &#1499;&#1468;&#1505; is taken to be equivalent to &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1468;&#1492;   (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-19.htm">1 Kings 10:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/26-9.htm">Job 26:9</a>) for &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1468;&#1488;, and the clause is rendered "the hand upon the throne of the Lord." But whilst some understand the laying of the hand (sc., of God) upon the throne to be expressive of the attitude of swearing, others regard the hand as symbolical of power. There are others again, like Clericus, who suppose the hand to denote the hand laid by the Amalekites upon the throne of the Lord, i.e., on Israel. But if &#1499;&#1468;&#1505; signifies throng or adytum arcanum, the words can hardly be understood in any other sense than "the hand lifted up to the throne of Jehovah in heaven, war to the Lord," etc.; and thus understood, they can only contain an admonition to Israel to follow the example of Moses, and wage war against Amalek with the hands lifted up to the throne of Jehovah. Modern expositors, however, for the most part regard &#1499;&#1468;&#1505; as a corruption of &#1504;&#1505;, "the hand on the banner of the Lord." But even admitting this, though many objections may be offered to its correctness, we must not understand by "the banner of Jehovah" the staff of Moses, but only the altar with the name Jehovah-nissi, as the symbol or memorial of the victorious help afforded by God in the battle with the Amalekites. </body></html>
