(See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/1-9.htm" title="And I spoke to you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear you myself alone:">Deuteronomy 1:9-15</a>.) In one particular Moses departed from the counsel given to him. Instead of directly choosing the “able men” himself, he left the selection to the people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-13.htm" title="Take you wise men, and understanding, and known among your tribes, and I will make them rulers over you.">Deuteronomy 1:13</a>).

Having been employed to redeem Israel out of the house of bondage, he is a further type of Christ, that he is employed as a lawgiver and a judge among them. If the people were as quarrelsome one with another as they were with God, no doubt Moses had many causes brought before him. This business Moses was called to; it appears that he did it with great care and kindness. The meanest Israelite was welcome to bring his cause before him. Moses kept to his business from morning to night. Jethro thought it was too much for him to undertake alone; also it would make the administration of justice tiresome to the people. There may be over-doing even in well-doing. Wisdom is profitable to direct, that we may neither content ourselves with less than our duty, nor task ourselves beyond our strength. Jethro advised Moses to a better plan. Great men should not only study to be useful themselves, but contrive to make others useful. Care must be taken in the choice of the persons admitted into such a trust. They should be men of good sense, that understood business, and that would not be daunted by frowns or clamours, but abhorred the thought of a bribe. Men of piety and religion; such as fear God, who dare not to do a base thing, though they could do it secretly and securely. The fear of God will best fortify a man against temptations to injustice. Moses did not despise this advice.

If thou shalt do this thing, &c.&#8212;Jethro's counsel was given merely in the form of a suggestion; it was not to be adopted without the express sanction and approval of a better and higher Counsellor; and although we are not informed of it, there can be no doubt that Moses, before appointing subordinate magistrates, would ask the mind of God, as it is the duty and privilege of every Christian in like manner to supplicate the divine direction in all his ways.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/exodus/18.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This is one evidence of that meekness for which Moses is justly magnified, that he disdained not to receive advice from one so much his inferior in wisdom, and learning, and knowledge of the things of God. And God would have this wise counsel to come from Jethro, not from Moses himself, to show how variously he distributes his gifts, and to teach all men not to think too highly of themselves, nor to despise the counsels even of their inferiors. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Moses did all that he had said, </span> not immediately, but after he had received God’s approbation, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-16.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Gather to me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom you know to be the elders of the people, and officers over them; and bring them to the tabernacle of the congregation, that they may stand there with you.">Numbers 11:16</a></span>, and the people’s consent, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-14.htm" title="And you answered me, and said, The thing which you have spoken is good for us to do.">Deu 1:14</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/exodus/18.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father in law,....

Moses took the advice tendered him, not immediately, but after the law had been given at Sinai, and the journeying was about to be resumed. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-9.htm">Deuteronomy 1:9-15</a>. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/exodus/18.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The next day Jethro saw how Moses was occupied from morning till evening in judging the people, who brought all their disputes to him, that he might settle them according to the statutes of God. &#1506;&#1500; &#1506;&#1502;&#1491;: as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-8.htm">Genesis 18:8</a>. The people came to Moses "to seek or inquire of God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-15.htm">Genesis 18:15</a>), i.e., to ask for a decision from God: in most cases, this means to inquire through an oracle; here it signifies to desire a divine decision as to questions in dispute. By judging or deciding the cases brought before him, Moses made known to the people the ordinances and laws of God. For every decision was based upon some law, which, like all true justice here on earth, emanated first of all from God. This is the meaning of <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/18-16.htm">Genesis 18:16</a>, and not, as Knobel supposes, that Moses made use of the questions in dispute, at the time they were decided, as good opportunities for giving laws to the people. Jethro condemned this plan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-18.htm">Genesis 18:18</a>.) as exhausting, wearing out (&#1504;&#1489;&#1500; lit., to fade away, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-2.htm">Psalm 37:2</a>), both for Moses and the people: for the latter, inasmuch as they not only got wearied out through long waiting, but, judging from <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/18-23.htm">Genesis 18:23</a>, very often began to take the law into their own hands on account of the delay in the judicial decision, and so undermined the well-being of the community at large; and for Moses, inasmuch as the work was necessarily too great for him, and he could not continue for any length of time to sustain such a burden alone (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-18.htm">Genesis 18:18</a>). The obsolete form of the inf. const. &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; for &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1514;&#1493; is only used here, but is not without analogies in the Pentateuch. Jethro advised him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-19.htm">Genesis 18:19</a>.) to appoint judged from the people for all the smaller matters in dispute, so that in future only the more difficult cases, which really needed a superior or divine decision, would be brought to him that he might lay them before God. "I will give thee counsel, and God be with thee (i.e., help thee to carry out this advice): Be thou to the people &#1492;&#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;, towards God," i.e., lay their affairs before God, take the place of God in matters of judgment, or, as Luther expresses it, "take charge of the people before God." To this end, in the first place, he was to instruct the people in the commandments of God, and their own walk and conduct (&#1492;&#1494;&#1492;&#1497;&#1512; with a double accusative, to enlighten, instruct; &#1513;&#1491;&#1512;&#1498; the walk, the whole behaviour; &#1502;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; particular actions); secondly, he was to select able men (&#1495;&#1497;&#1500; &#1488;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; men of moral strength, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-52.htm">1 Kings 1:52</a>) as judges, men who were God-fearing, sincere, and unselfish (gain-hating), and appoint them to administer justice to the people, by deciding the simpler matters themselves, and only referring the more difficult questions to him, and so to lighten his own duties by sharing the burden with these judges. &#1502;&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1498; &#1492;&#1511;&#1500; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-22.htm">Genesis 18:22</a>) "make light of (that which lies) upon thee." If he would do this, and God would command him, he would be able to stand, and the people would come to their place, i.e., to Canaan, in good condition (&#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1501;). The apodosis cannot begin with &#1493;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1498;, "then God will establish thee," for &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492; never has this meaning; but the idea is this, "if God should preside over the execution of the plan proposed." </body></html>
