Or he may have thought that if Moses and Aaron “shewed a miracle,” his own magicians would be able to show greater ones, and he would then dismiss the brothers as charlatans and impostors. He certainly did hot intend to be influenced by any miracle which they might show, or to accept it as evidence that their message to him was a command from God.<p><span class= "bld">Thy rod.</span>—The rod is now called Aaron’s, because Moses had entrusted him with it.

For this and some other miracles were to be done, not by Moses immediately, but by Aaron, partly, perhaps, to preclude or take off the suspicion that these miracles were wrought by some magic arts of Moses, and partly for the greater honour of Moses, that he might be what God had said, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-1.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, See, I have made you a god to Pharaoh: and Aaron your brother shall be your prophet.">Exodus 7:1</a>,) <span class="ital">a god to Pharaoh, </span>who not only could work miracles himself, but also give power to others to do so. Perhaps the conjecture of Grotius upon this place may be worth mentioning here, which is, that the custom of ambassadors bearing a caduceus, or rod, in their hands, had its origin in this event, being taken up first by the neighbouring nations, and from them communicated to the Greeks and Romans. And it is remarkable that the caduceus of Mercury, the messenger of the gods of Greece and Rome, was formed of two serpents twisted round a rod.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:8-13 What men dislike, because it opposes their pride and lusts, they will not be convinced of; but it is easy to cause them to believe things they wish to be true. God always sends with his word full proofs of its Divine authority; but when men are bent to disobey, and willing to object, he often permits a snare to be laid wherein they are entangled. The magicians were cheats, trying to copy the real miracles of Moses by secret sleights or jugglings, which to a small extent they succeeded in doing, so as to deceive the bystanders, but they were at length obliged to confess they could not any longer imitate the effects of Divine power. None assist more in the destruction of sinners, than such as resist the truth by amusing men with a counterfeit resemblance of it.

When Pharaoh shall speak unto you, &c.&#8212;The king would naturally demand some evidence of their having been sent from God; and as he would expect the ministers of his own gods to do the same works, the contest, in the nature of the case, would be one of miracles. Notice has already been taken of the rod of Moses (Ex 4:2), but rods were carried also by all nobles and official persons in the court of Pharaoh. It was an Egyptian custom, and the rods were symbols of authority or rank.

It is obvious that there would have been an impropriety in Moses and Aaron offering a sign to Pharaoh until he asked for one. They claimed to be ambassadors of Jehovah, and to speak in his name (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/5-1.htm">Exodus 5:1</a>). Unless they were misdoubted, it was not for them to produce their credentials. Hence they worked no miracle at their former interview. Now, however, the time was come when their credentials would be demanded, and an express command was given them to exhibit the first "sign." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 7:10-13 <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/exodus/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Moses' last difficulty (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/6-12.htm">Exodus 6:12</a>, repeated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-30.htm">Exodus 6:30</a>) was removed by God with the words: "See, I have made thee a god to Pharaoh, and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-1.htm">Exodus 7:1</a>). According to <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/4-16.htm">Exodus 4:16</a>, Moses was to be a god to Aaron; and in harmony with that, Aaron is here called the prophet of Moses, as being the person who would announce to Pharaoh the revelations of Moses. At the same time Moses was also made a god to Pharaoh; i.e., he was promised divine authority and power over Pharaoh, so that henceforth there was no more necessity for him to be afraid of the king of Egypt, but the latter, notwithstanding all resistance, would eventually bow before him. Moses was a god to Aaron as the revealer of the divine will, and to Pharaoh as the executor of that will. - In <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/7-2.htm">Exodus 7:2-5</a> God repeats in a still more emphatic form His assurance, that notwithstanding the hardening of Pharaoh's heart, He would bring His people Israel out of Egypt. &#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1495; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-2.htm">Exodus 7:2</a>) does not mean ut dimittat or mittat (Vulg.
