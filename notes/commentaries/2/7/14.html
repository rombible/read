But the present miracle is different. (1) It is to be done on the largest possible scale; (2) in the sight of all the Egyptians; and (3) not as a sign, but as a “judgment.” All the Nile water—whether in the main river, or its branches, or the canals derived from it, or the pools formed by its inundation or by percolation through its banks, or in artificial reservoirs, including the tanks of wood or stone attached to houses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-19.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses, Say to Aaron, Take your rod, and stretch out your hand on the waters of Egypt, on their streams, on their rivers, and on their ponds, and on all their pools of water, that they may become blood; and that there may be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood, and in vessels of stone.">Exodus 7:19</a>)—is to be “turned to blood:” <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> not merely turned of a red colour, either by admixture of earthy matter or of <span class= "ital">Infusoriae,</span> but made to have all the qualities and appearance of blood, so as to become offensive, horrible, loathsome (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-18.htm" title="And the fish that is in the river shall die, and the river shall stink; and the Egyptians shall loathe to drink of the water of the river.">Exodus 7:18</a>). The judgment strikes the Egyptians two several blows. (1) It involves an insult to their religion, and brings it into discredit, since the Nile-god, Hapi, was a main object of worship, closely connected with Osiris, and even with Amnion, celebrated in hymns with the most extravagant titles of honour (<span class= "ital">Records of the Past,</span> vol. iv. pp. 108-110), and a frequent object of public adoration in festivals. (2) It is a great physical affliction. They are accustomed to use the Nile water for drinking, for ablutions, for the washing of their clothes, and for culinary purposes; they have great difficulty in procuring any other; they delight in the Nile water, regard it as the best in the world, are in the habit of drinking deep draughts of it continually. This is all put a stop to. They suffer from thirst, from enforced uncleanliness, from the horror of blood all about them, even in their cisterns. Again, their fish are killed. Fish was one of their principal foods, perhaps the main food of the common people; and the river was the chief source whence the fish supply was obtained, for even the Lake Moeris was an off-shoot from the river (Herod. ii. 149). Their fish supply is stopped. The punishment is retaliatory: for as they had made the Nile the means of destroying Hebrew infants (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/1-22.htm" title="And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born you shall cast into the river, and every daughter you shall save alive.">Exodus 1:22</a>), so that Hebrew parents had loathed to drink of it, as though stained with the blood of their children, so is it now made by means of blood undrinkable for themselves. The plague lasts seven days (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-25.htm" title="And seven days were fulfilled, after that the LORD had smitten the river.">Exodus 7:25</a>), a longer time than any other; and if not so destructive as the later ones, was perhaps of all the most nauseous and disgusting.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/exodus/7.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-14.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Pharaoh's heart is hardened, he refuses to let the people go.">Exodus 7:14</a></span>. <span class="ital">Pharaoh’s heart is hardened — </span><span class="greekheb">כבד לב</span>, <span class="ital">is made heavy.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Neither my word nor works make any impression upon him.

It was a dreadful plague. The sight of such vast rolling streams of blood could not but strike horror. Nothing is more common than water: so wisely has Providence ordered it, and so kindly, that what is so needful and serviceable to the comfort of human life, should be cheap and almost every where to be had; but now the Egyptians must either drink blood, or die for thirst. Egypt was a pleasant land, but the dead fish and blood now rendered it very unpleasant. It was a righteous plague, and justly sent upon the Egyptians; for Nile, the river of Egypt, was their idol. That creature which we idolize, God justly takes from us, or makes bitter to us. They had stained the river with the blood of the Hebrews' children, and now God made that river all blood. Never any thirsted after blood, but sooner or later they had enough of it. It was a significant plague; Egypt had great dependence upon their river, Zec 14:18; so that in smiting the river, they were warned of the destruction of all the produce of their country. The love of Christ to his disciples changes all their common mercies into spiritual blessings; the anger of God towards his enemies, renders their most valued advantages a curse and a misery to them. Aaron is to summon the plague by smiting the river with his rod. It was done in the sight of Pharaoh and his attendants, for God's true miracles were not performed as Satan's lying wonders; truth seeks no corners. See the almighty power of God. Every creature is that to us which he makes it to be water or blood. See what changes we may meet with in the things of this world; what is always vain, may soon become vexatious. See what mischievous work sin makes. If the things that have been our comforts prove our crosses, we must thank ourselves. It is sin that turns our waters into blood. The plague continued seven days; and in all that time Pharaoh's proud heart would not let him desire Moses to pray for the removal of it. Thus the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath. No wonder that God's anger is not turned away, but that his hand is stretched out still.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And he hardened - Or Pharaoh's heart was hardened.

The first miracle had been exhibited, and had failed. It had been a mere "sign," and in no respect a "judgment." Now the "judgments ' were to begin. God manifests himself again to Moses, and gives him exact directions what he is to do. He is to meet Pharaoh on the banks of the Nile, and to warn him that a plague is coming upon all Egypt on account of his obstinacy; that the waters of the Nile will be turned to blood, so that the ash will die, and the river stink, and the Egyptians loathe to drink of the water of the river (vers. 15-18). Pharaoh not yielding, making no sign, the threat is to be immediately followed by the act. In the sight of Pharaoh and his court, or at any rate of his train of attendants (ver. 20), Aaron is to stretch his rod over the Nile, and the water is at once to become blood, the fish to die, and the river in a short time to become offensive, or, in the simple and direct language of the Bible, to stink. The  commands given by God are executed, and the result is as declared beforehand by Moses (vers. 20, 21). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Pharaoh's heart is hardened</span>. Rather, "is hard, is dull."

The centre of these negotiations, or rather the main point of this lengthened section, which is closely connected throughout, and formally rounded off by <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/11-9.htm">Exodus 11:9-10</a> into an inward unity, is found in the nine plagues which the messengers of Jehovah brought upon Pharaoh and his kingdom at the command of Jehovah, to bend the defiant spirit of the king, and induce him to let Israel go out of the land and serve their God. If we carefully examine the account of these nine penal miracles, we shall find that they are arranged in three groups of three plagues each. For the first and second, the fourth and fifth, and the seventh and eighth were announced beforehand by Moses to the king (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-15.htm">Exodus 7:15</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/8-1.htm">Exodus 8:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-20.htm">Exodus 8:20</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/9-1.htm">Exodus 9:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-13.htm">Exodus 9:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-1.htm">Exodus 10:1</a>), whilst the third, sixth, and ninth were sent without any such announcement (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-16.htm">Exodus 8:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-8.htm">Exodus 9:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-21.htm">Exodus 10:21</a>). Again, the first, fourth, and seventh were announced to Pharaoh in the morning, and the first and fourth by the side of the Nile (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-15.htm">Exodus 7:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-20.htm">Exodus 8:20</a>), both of them being connected with the overflowing of the river; whilst the place of announcement is not mentioned in the case of the seventh (the hail, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-13.htm">Exodus 9:13</a>), because hail, as coming from heaven, was not connected with any particular locality. This grouping is not a merely external arrangement, adopted by the writer for the sake of greater distinctness, but is founded in the facts themselves, and the effect which God intended the plagues to produce, as we may gather from these circumstances - that the Egyptian magicians, who had imitated the first plagues, were put to shame with their arts by the third, and were compelled to see in it the finger of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-19.htm">Exodus 8:19</a>), - that they were smitten themselves by the sixth, and were unable to stand before Moses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-11.htm">Exodus 9:11</a>), - and that after the ninth, Pharaoh broke off all further negotiation with Moses and Aaron (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/10-28.htm">Exodus 10:28-29</a>). The last plague, commonly known as the tenth, which Moses also announced to the king before his departure (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/11-4.htm">Exodus 11:4</a>.), differed from the nine former ones both in purpose and form. It was the first beginning of the judgment that was coming upon the hardened king, and was inflicted directly by God Himself, for Jehovah "went out through the midst of Egypt, and smote the first-born of the Egyptians both of man and beast" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/11-4.htm">Exodus 11:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-29.htm">Exodus 12:29</a>); whereas seven of the previous plagues were brought by Moses and Aaron, and of the two that are not expressly said to have been brought by them, one, that of the dog-flies, was simply sent by Jehovah (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/8-21.htm">Exodus 8:21</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-24.htm">Exodus 8:24</a>), and the other, the murrain of beasts, simply came from His hand (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/9-3.htm">Exodus 9:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-6.htm">Exodus 9:6</a>). The last blow (&#1504;&#1490;&#1506; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/11-1.htm">Exodus 11:1</a>), which brought about the release of Israel, was also distinguished from the nine plagues, as the direct judgment of God, by the fact that it was not effected through the medium of any natural occurrence, as was the case with all the others, which were based upon the natural phenomena of Egypt, and became signs and wonders through their vast excess above the natural measure of such natural occurrences and their supernatural accumulation, blow after blow following one another in less than a year, and also through the peculiar circumstances under which they were brought about. In this respect also the triple division is unmistakeable. The first three plagues covered the whole land, and fell upon the Israelites as well as the Egyptians; with the fourth the separation commenced between Egyptians and Israelites, so that only the Egyptians suffered from the last six, the Israelites in Goshen being entirely exempted. The last three, again, were distinguished from the others by the fact, that they were far more dreadful than any of the previous ones, and bore visible marks of being the forerunners of the judgment which would inevitably fall upon Pharaoh, if he continued his opposition to the will of the Almighty God.<p>In this graduated series of plagues, the judgment of hardening was inflicted upon Pharaoh in the manner explained above. In the first three plagues God showed him, that He, the God of Israel, was Jehovah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-17.htm">Exodus 7:17</a>), i.e., that He ruled as Lord and King over the occurrences and powers of nature, which the Egyptians for the most part honoured as divine; and before His power the magicians of Egypt with their secret arts were put to shame. These three wonders made no impression upon the king. The plague of frogs, indeed, became so troublesome to him, that he begged Moses and Aaron to intercede with their God to deliver him from them, and promised to let the people go (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-8.htm">Exodus 8:8</a>). But as soon as they were taken away, he hardened his heart, and would not listen to the messengers of God. Of the three following plagues, the first (i.e., the fourth in the entire series), viz., the plague of swarming creatures or dog-flies, with which the distinction between the Egyptians and Israelites commenced, proving to Pharaoh that the God of Israel was Jehovah in the midst of the land (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-22.htm">Exodus 8:22</a>), made such an impression upon the hardened king, that he promised to allow the Israelites to sacrifice to their God, first of all in the land, and when Moses refused this condition, even outside the land, if they would not go far away, and Moses and Aaron would pray to God for him, that this plague might be taken away by God from him and from his people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-25.htm">Exodus 8:25</a>.). But this concession was only forced out of him by suffering; so that as soon as the plague ceased he withdrew it again, and his hard heart was not changed by the two following plagues. Hence still heavier plagues were sent, and he had to learn from the last three that there was no god in the whole earth like Jehovah, the God of the Hebrews (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-14.htm">Hebrews 9:14</a>). The terrible character of these last plagues so affected the proud heart of Pharaoh, that twice he acknowledged he had sinned (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-27.htm">Exodus 9:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-16.htm">Exodus 10:16</a>), and gave a promise that he would let the Israelites go, restricting his promise first of all to the men, and then including their families also (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/10-11.htm">Exodus 10:11</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-24.htm">Exodus 10:24</a>). But when this plague was withdrawn, he resumed his old sinful defiance once more (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/9-34.htm">Exodus 9:34-35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-20.htm">Exodus 10:20</a>), and finally was altogether hardened, and so enraged at Moses persisting in his demand that they should take their flocks as well, that he drove away the messengers of Jehovah and broke off all further negotiations, with the threat that he would kill them if ever they came into his presence again (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/10-28.htm">Exodus 10:28-29</a>).<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/7-8.htm">Exodus 7:8-13</a><p>Attestation of the Divine Mission of Moses and Aaron. - By Jehovah's directions Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh, and proved by a miracle (&#1502;&#1493;&#1508;&#1514; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-21.htm">Exodus 4:21</a>) that they were the messengers of the God of the Hebrews. Aaron threw down his staff before Pharaoh, and it became a serpent. Aaron's staff as no other than the wondrous staff of Moses (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/4-2.htm">Exodus 4:2-4</a>). This is perfectly obvious from a comparison of <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-15.htm">Exodus 7:15</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-17.htm">Exodus 7:17</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-19.htm">Exodus 7:19</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-20.htm">Exodus 7:20</a>. If Moses was directed, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-15.htm">Exodus 7:15</a>., to go before Pharaoh with his rod which had been turned into a serpent, and to announce to him that he would smite the water of the Nile with the staff in his hand and turn it into blood, and then, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-19.htm">Exodus 7:19</a>., this miracle was carried out by Aaron taking his staff and stretching out his hand over the waters of Egypt, the staff which Aaron held over the water cannot have been any other than the staff of Moses which had been turned into a serpent. Consequently we must also understand by the staff of Aaron, which was thrown down before Pharaoh and became a serpent, the same wondrous staff of Moses, and attribute the expression "thy (i.e., Aaron's) staff" to the brevity of the account, i.e., to the fact that the writer restricted himself to the leading facts, and passed over such subordinate incidents as that Moses gave his staff to Aaron for him to work the miracle. For the same reason he has not even mentioned that Moses spoke to Pharaoh by Aaron, or what he said, although in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-13.htm">Exodus 7:13</a> he states that Pharaoh did not hearken unto them, i.e., to their message or their words. The serpent, into which the staff was changed, is not called &#1504;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473; here, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-15.htm">Exodus 7:15</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/4-3.htm">Exodus 4:3</a>, but &#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1503; (lxx &#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;, dragon), a general term for snake-like animals. This difference does not show that there were two distinct records, but may be explained on the ground that the miracle performed before Pharaoh had a different signification from that which attested the divine mission of Moses in the presence of his people. The miraculous sign mentioned here is distinctly related to the art of snake-charming, which was carried to such an extent by the Psylli in ancient Egypt (cf. Bochart, and Hengstenberg, Egypt and Moses, pp. 98ff. transl.). It is probable that the Israelites in Egypt gave the name &#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1503; (Eng. ver. dragon), which occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-33.htm">Deuteronomy 32:33</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/91-13.htm">Psalm 91:13</a> as a parallel to &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1503; (Eng. ver. asp), to the snake with which the Egyptian charmers generally performed their tricks, the Hayeh of the Arabs. What the magi and conjurers of Egypt boasted that they could perform by their secret or magical arts, Moses was to effect in reality in Pharaoh's presence, and thus manifest himself to the king as Elohim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-1.htm">Exodus 7:1</a>), i.e., as endowed with divine authority and power. All that is related of the Psylli of modern times is, that they understand the art of turning snakes into sticks, or of compelling them to become rigid and apparently dead (for examples see Hengstenberg); but who can tell what the ancient Psylli may have been able to effect, or may have pretended to effect, at a time when the demoniacal power of heathenism existed in its unbroken force? The magicians summoned by Pharaoh also turned their sticks into snakes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-12.htm">Exodus 7:12</a>); a fact which naturally excites the suspicion that the sticks themselves were only rigid snakes, though, with our very limited acquaintance with the dark domain of heathen conjuring, the possibility of their working "lying wonders after the working of Satan," i.e., supernatural things (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-9.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:9</a>), cannot be absolutely denied. The words, "They also, the chartummim of Egypt, did in like manner with their enchantments," are undoubtedly based upon the assumption, that the conjurers of Egypt not only pretended to possess the art of turning snakes into sticks, but of turning sticks into snakes as well, so that in the persons of the conjurers Pharaoh summoned the might of the gods of Egypt to oppose the might of Jehovah, the God of the Hebrews. For these magicians, whom the Apostle Paul calls Jannes and Jambres, according to the Jewish tradition (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-8.htm">2 Timothy 3:8</a>), were not common jugglers, but &#1495;&#1499;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; "wise men," men educated in human and divine wisdom, and &#1495;&#1512;&#1496;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, &#x3b9;&#788;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2;, belonging to the priestly caste (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-8.htm">Genesis 41:8</a>); so that the power of their gods was manifested in their secret arts (&#1500;&#1492;&#1496;&#1497;&#1501; from &#1500;&#1492;&#1496; to conceal, to act secretly, like &#1500;&#1496;&#1497;&#1501; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-22.htm">Exodus 7:22</a> from &#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1496;), and in the defeat of their enchantments by Moses the gods of Egypt were overcome by Jehovah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-12.htm">Exodus 12:12</a>). The supremacy of Jehovah over the demoniacal powers of Egypt manifested itself in the very first miraculous sign, in the fact that Aaron's staff swallowed those of the magicians; though this miracle made no impression upon Pharaoh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-13.htm">Exodus 7:13</a>). </body></html>
