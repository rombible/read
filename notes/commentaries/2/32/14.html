He was pleased not to inflict upon them that punishment which he threatened, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-10.htm" title="Now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot against them, and that I may consume them: and I will make of you a great nation.">Exodus 32:10</a>,) and so acted as men do when they repent and change their minds. Though he designed to punish them, yet he would not ruin them. See here the power of prayer! God suffers himself to be prevailed with by humble, believing importunity. And see the compassion of God toward poor sinners, and how ready he is to forgive! It must, however, be well observed that such expressions as this, of the Lord’s <span class="ital">repenting, </span>must be understood as spoken after the manner of men. For that no proper change or repentance can take place in the Divine Mind, plainly follows from the perfection of the divine knowledge, which comprehends at one view all things, past, present, and to come, and can never be surprised at their happening as they do, or change his mind on that account.

Sin is the corruption of the sinner, and it is a self-corruption; every man is tempted when he is drawn aside of his own lust. They had turned aside out of the way. Sin is a departing from the way of duty into a by-path. They soon forgot God's works. He sees what they cannot discover, nor is any wickedness of the world hid from him. We could not bear to see the thousandth part of that evil which God sees every day. God expresses the greatness of his just displeasure, after the manner of men who would have prayer of Moses could save them from ruin; thus he was a type of Christ, by whose mediation alone, God would reconcile the world to himself. Moses pleads God's glory. The glorifying God's name, as it ought to be our first petition, and it is so in the Lord's prayer, so it ought to be our great plea. And God's promises are to be our pleas in prayer; for what he has promised he is able to perform. See the power of prayer. In answer to the prayers of Moses, God showed his purpose of sparing the people, as he had before seemed determined on their destruction; which change of the outward discovery of his purpose, is called repenting of the evil.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/32.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This states a fact which was not revealed to Moses until after his second intercession when he had come down from the mountain and witnessed the sin of the people <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/32-30.htm">Exodus 32:30-34</a>. He was then assured that the Lord's love to His ancient people would prevail God is said, in the language of Scripture, to "repent," when His forgiving love is seen by man to blot out the letter of His judgments against sin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-16.htm">2 Samuel 24:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-13.htm">Joel 2:13</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jonah/3-10.htm">Jonah 3:10</a>, etc.); or when the sin of man seems to human sight to have disappointed the purposes of grace (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-6.htm">Genesis 6:6</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-35.htm">1 Samuel 15:35</a>, etc.). The awakened conscience is said to "repent," when, having felt its sin, it feels also the divine forgiveness: it is at this crisis that God, according to the language of Scripture, repents toward the sinner. Thus, the repentance of God made known in and through the One true Mediator reciprocates the repentance of the returning sinner, and reveals to him atonement.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/exodus/32.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. make of thee a great nation&#8212;Care must be taken not to suppose this language as betokening any change or vacillation in the divine purpose. The covenant made with the patriarchs had been ratified in the most solemn manner; it could not and never was intended that it should be broken. But the manner in which God spoke to Moses served two important purposes&#8212;it tended to develop the faith and intercessory patriotism of the Hebrew leader, and to excite the serious alarm of the people, that God would reject them and deprive them of the privileges they had fondly fancied were so secure.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/exodus/32.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> i.e. Changed his sentence.

God is thus said to ‘repent,’ not because He really changes His purpose, but because He does so apparently, when, in consequence of a change in the character and conduct of men, He is obliged to make a corresponding change in the purpose towards them which He had previously announced, and adopt towards them a new attitude. See esp. Jeremiah 18, where it is taught that if man repents, a threat may be withdrawn (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-3.htm" title="If so be they will listen, and turn every man from his evil way, that I may repent me of the evil, which I purpose to do to them because of the evil of their doings.">Jeremiah 26:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-13.htm" title="Therefore now amend your ways and your doings, and obey the voice of the LORD your God; and the LORD will repent him of the evil that he has pronounced against you.">Jeremiah 26:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-19.htm" title="Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him at all to death? did he not fear the LORD, and sought the LORD, and the LORD repented him of the evil which he had pronounced against them? Thus might we procure great evil against our souls.">Jeremiah 26:19</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jonah/3-9.htm" title="Who can tell if God will turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce anger, that we perish not?...">Jonah 3:9-10</a>), while on the other hand if man turns to evil a promise may be revoked. Here Jehovah ‘repents,’ as a consequence of Moses’ intercession (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/7-3.htm" title="The LORD repented for this: It shall not be, said the LORD.">Amos 7:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/7-6.htm" title="The LORD repented for this: This also shall not be, said the Lord GOD.">Amos 7:6</a>). God is also said to ‘repent,’ when he stops a judgement in the midst, as it seems, of its course, through compassion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-16.htm" title="And when the angel stretched out his hand on Jerusalem to destroy it, the LORD repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed the people, It is enough: stay now your hand. And the angel of the LORD was by the threshing place of Araunah the Jebusite.">2 Samuel 24:16</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-36.htm" title="For the LORD shall judge his people, and repent himself for his servants, when he sees that their power is gone, and there is none shut up, or left.">Deuteronomy 32:36</a>). Where, however, nothing is likely to occur to cause a change in Jehovah’s declared purpose, He is said to be ‘not a man, that he should repent’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-29.htm" title="And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for he is not a man, that he should repent.">1 Samuel 15:29</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-19.htm" title="God is not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent: has he said, and shall he not do it? or has he spoken, and shall he not make it good?">Numbers 23:19</a>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord repented of the evil</span>. Changes of purpose are, of course, attributed to God by an "economy," or accommodation of the truth to human modes of speech and conception. "God is not a man that he should repent." He "knows the end from the beginning." When he threatened to destroy Israel, he knew that he would spare; but, as he communicated to Moses, first, his anger, and then, at a later period, his intention to spare, he is said to have "repented." The expression is an anthropomorphic one, like so many others, on which we have already commented.
