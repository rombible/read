In feasting therefore upon what they had offered, the Israelites did no wrong; but probably they indulged themselves in a license of feasting unsuited to a religious act, though common enough in the idol-festivals of the heathen. They “fed without fear” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-12.htm" title="These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with you, feeding themselves without fear: clouds they are without water, carried about of winds; trees whose fruit wither, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots;">Jude 1:12</a>), transgressed the bounds of moderation, and turned what should have been a religious rite into an orgy. Then, having gratified their appetites and stimulated their passions, they ceased to eat and drink, and “rose up to play.” The “play” included dancing of an indecent kind (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-19.htm" title="And it came to pass, as soon as he came near to the camp, that he saw the calf, and the dancing: and Moses' anger waxed hot, and he cast the tables out of his hands, and broke them beneath the mount.">Exodus 32:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-25.htm" title="And when Moses saw that the people were naked; (for Aaron had made them naked to their shame among their enemies:)">Exodus 32:25</a>), and would probably have terminated, as the heathen orgies too often did, in the grossest sensualism, had not the descent of Moses from Sinai, and his appearance on the scene, put a stop to the unhallowed doings.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/exodus/32.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-6.htm" title="And they rose up early on the morrow, and offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play.">Exodus 32:6</a></span>. <span class="ital">They rose up early — </span>To show their zeal they began betimes in the morning, and seem not to have stayed for Aaron; and <span class="ital">offered burnt- offerings, </span>&c. — To this new-made image of Deity. <span class="ital">And the people sat down to eat and drink — </span>Of the remainder of what was sacrificed; and then <span class="ital">rose up to play — </span>To play the fool, to play the wanton. It was strange that any of the people, especially so great a number of them, should do such a thing. Had they not, but the other day, in this very place, heard the voice of the Lord God speaking to them out of the midst of the fire, “Thou shalt not make to thyself any graven image?” Yet they made a calf in Horeb, the very place where the law was given! It was especially strange that Aaron should be so deeply concerned, should make the calf, and proclaim the feast! Is this “Aaron the saint of the Lord?” Is this he that had not only seen, but had been employed in summoning the plagues of Egypt, and the judgments executed upon the gods of the Egyptians? What! and yet himself copying out the abandoned idolatries of Egypt? How true is it, that “the law made them priests which had infirmity, and needed first to offer for their own sins!”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/32.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>32:1-6 While Moses was in the mount, receiving the law from God, the people made a tumultuous address to Aaron. This giddy multitude were weary of waiting for the return of Moses. Weariness in waiting betrays to many temptations. The Lord must be waited for till he comes, and waited for though he tarry. Let their readiness to part with their ear-rings to make an idol, shame our niggardliness in the service of the true God. They did not draw back on account of the cost of their idolatry; and shall we grudge the expenses of religion? Aaron produced the shape of an ox or calf, giving it some finish with a graving tool. They offered sacrifice to this idol. Having set up an image before them, and so changed the truth of God into a lie, their sacrifices were abomination. Had they not, only a few days before, in this very place, heard the voice of the Lord God speaking to them out of the midst of the fire, Thou shalt not make to thyself any graven image? Had they not themselves solemnly entered into covenant with God, that they would do all he had said to them, and would be obedient? ch. 24:7. Yet before they stirred from the place where this covenant had been solemnly made, they brake an express command, in defiance of an express threatening. It plainly shows, that the law was no more able to make holy, than it was to justify; by it is the knowledge of sin, but not the cure of sin. Aaron was set apart by the Divine appointment to the office of the priesthood; but he, who had once shamed himself so far as to build an altar to a golden calf, must own himself unworthy of the honour of attending at the altar of God, and indebted to free grace alone for it. Thus pride and boasting were silenced.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/32.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The sense approved by most modern critics is: and he received the gold at their hand and collected it in a bag and made it a molten calf. The Israelites must have been familiar with the ox-worship of the Egyptians; perhaps many of them had witnessed the rites of Mnevis at Heliopolis, almost; on the borders of the land of Goshen, and they could not have been unacquainted with the more famous rites of Apis at Memphis. It is expressly said that they yielded to the idolatry of Egypt while they were in bondage <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/24-14.htm">Joshua 24:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-8.htm">Ezekiel 20:8</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-3.htm">Ezekiel 23:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-8.htm">Ezekiel 23:8</a>; and this is in keeping with the earliest Jewish tradition (Philo). In the next verse, Aaron appears to speak of the calf as if it was a representative of Yahweh - "Tomorrow is a feast to the Lord." The Israelites did not, it should be noted, worship a living Mnevis, or Apis, having a proper name, but only the golden type of the animal. The mystical notions connected with the ox by the Egyptian priests may have possessed their minds, and, when expressed in this modified and less gross manner, may have been applied to the Lord, who had really delivered them out of the hand of the Egyptians. Their sin then lay, not in their adopting another god, but in their pretending to worship a visible symbol of Him whom no symbol could represent. The close connection between the calves of Jeroboam and this calf is shown by the repetition of the formula, "which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt" <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28</a>.<p>These be thy gods - This is thy god.

Aaron made proclamation, and said, To-morrow is a feast to the Lord&#8212;a remarkable circumstance, strongly confirmatory of the view that they had not renounced the worship of Jehovah, but in accordance with Egyptian notions, had formed an image with which they had been familiar, to be the visible symbol of the divine presence. But there seems to have been much of the revelry that marked the feasts of the heathen.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/exodus/32.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Brought peace-offerings</span>, but no <span class="ital">sin-offerings</span>, which they most needed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The people sat down to eat and to drink</span>; for the sacrifices were accompanied with feasting, both among the worshippers of the true God, and among idolaters.

The people were like a child with a new toy. They could scarcely sleep for thinking of it. So, as soon as it was day, they left their beds, and hastened to begin the new worship <span class="cmt_word">Burnt offerings and peace offerings</span>. It is evident that both of these were customary forms of sacrifice - neither of them first introduced by the Law, which had not - except so far as the "Book of the Covenant" was concerned - been promulgated. Compare Jethro's offerings (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/18-12.htm">Exodus 18:12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The people sat down</span> <span class="cmt_word">to eat and drink</span>.

See the comment on Exodus 18:12. <span class="cmt_word">And rose up</span> <span class="cmt_word">to play</span>. This "play" was scarcely of a harmless kind. The sensualism of idol-worship constantly led on to sensuality; and the feasts upon idol-sacrifices terminated in profligate orgies of a nature which cannot be described. See the application of the passage by St. Paul in the First Epistle to the Corinthians (1 Corinthians 10:7), and compare verse Exodus 32:25 <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 32:7-14 <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/exodus/31.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When Moses had received all the instructions respecting the sanctuary to be erected, Jehovah gave him the two tables of testimony-tables of stone, upon which the decalogue was written with the finger of God. It was to receive these tables that he had been called up the mountain (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-12.htm">Exodus 24:12</a>). According to <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/32-16.htm">Exodus 32:16</a>, the tables themselves, as well as the writing, were the work of God; and the writing was engraved upon them (&#1495;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; from &#1495;&#1512;&#1514;  equals  &#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;), and the tables were written on both their sides (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-15.htm">Exodus 32:15</a>). Both the choice of stone as the material for the tables, and the fact that the writing was engraved, were intended to indicate the imperishable duration of these words of God. The divine origin of the tables, as well as of the writing, corresponded to the direct proclamation of the ten words to the people from the summit of the mountain by the mouth of God. As this divine promulgation was a sufficient proof that they were the immediate word of God, unchanged by the mouth and speech of man, so the writing of God was intended to secure their preservation in Israel as a holy and inviolable thing. The writing itself was not a greater miracle than others, by which God has proved Himself to be the Lord of nature, to whom all things that He has created are subservient for the establishment and completion of His kingdom upon earth; and it can easily be conceived of without the anthropomorphic supposition of a material finger being possessed by God. Nothing is said about the dimensions of the tables: at the same time, we can hardly imagine them to have been as large as the inside of the ark; for stone slab 2 1/2 cubits long and 1 1/2 cubits broad, which must necessarily have been some inches in thickness to prevent their breaking in the hand, would have required the strength of Samson to enable Moses to carry them down the mountain "in his hand" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-15.htm">Exodus 32:15</a>), or even "in his two hands" (<a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-15.htm">Deuteronomy 9:15</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-17.htm">Deuteronomy 9:17</a>). But if we suppose them to have been smaller than this, say at the most a cubit and a half long and one cubit broad, there would have been plenty of room on the four sides for the 172 words contained in the decalogue, with its threats and promises (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/20-2.htm">Exodus 20:2-17</a>), without the writing being excessively small. </body></html>
