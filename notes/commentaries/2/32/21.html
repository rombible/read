How had he acquitted himself of this charge? He had allowed the people to commit a great sin. What excuse could he offer for his conduct? Had the people injured him in any way? The question is asked ironically.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/exodus/32.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-21.htm" title="And Moses said to Aaron, What did this people to you, that you have brought so great a sin on them?">Exodus 32:21</a></span>. <span class="ital">What did this people unto thee? — </span>He takes it for granted that it must needs be something more than ordinary that prevailed with Aaron to do such a thing.

We must never be drawn into sin by any thing man can say or do to us; for men can but tempt us to sin, they cannot force us. The approach of Moses turned the dancing into trembling. They were exposed to shame by their sin. The course Moses took to roll away this reproach, was, not by concealing the sin, or putting any false colour upon it, but by punishing it. The Levites were to slay the ringleaders in this wickedness; yet none were executed but those who openly stood forth. Those are marked for ruin who persist in sin: those who in the morning were shouting and dancing, before night were dying. Such sudden changes do the judgments of the Lord sometimes make with sinners that are secure and jovial in their sin.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/32.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-21.htm">Deuteronomy 9:21</a>. What is related in this verse must have occupied some time and may have followed the rebuke of Aaron. The act was symbolic, of course. The idol was brought to nothing and the people were made to swallow their own sin (compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/7-13.htm">Micah 7:13-14</a>).<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/exodus/32.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20. he took the calf which they had made, and burnt it in the fire, &c.&#8212;It has been supposed that the gold was dissolved by natron or some chemical substance.

These operations of grinding were intended to show contempt for such worthless gods, and the Israelites would be made to remember the humiliating lesson by the state of the water they had drunk for a time [Napier]. Others think that as the idolatrous festivals were usually ended with great use of sweet wine, the nauseous draught of the gold dust would be a severe punishment (compare 2Ki 23:6, 15; 2Ch 15:16; 34:7).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/exodus/32.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> What injury or mischief had they done to thee, which thou didst so severely revenge?

Having destroyed the calf, and thereby expressed his abhorrence of their idolatry, he examines the principal persons concerned, and inquires into the cause and reason of it, how it came about; and begins with Aaron, though his own brother, with whom along with Hur he had committed the government of the people during his absence; and therefore was justly accountable for such a transaction, which could not have been without his knowledge and consent: no mention is made of Hur, whether he was dead or no is not certain; the Jewish writers say he was, and that he was killed for reproving the Israelites for their wickedness; and it looks as if he was dead, since he was not in the examination, and we hear of him no more afterwards: <p>what did this people unto thee, that thou hast brought so great a sin upon them? as idolatry is, than which no sin can be greater, it being not only a breach of the first table of the law, but directly against God, against the very being of God, and his honour and glory; it is a denial of him, and setting up an idol in his room, and giving to that the glory that is only due to his name; and Aaron being the chief magistrate, whose business it was to see that the laws of God were observed, and to restrain the people from sin, and to have been a terror to evil doers; yet falling in with them, and conniving at them, he is charged with bringing sin upon them, or them into that; and is asked what the people had done to him, that he should do this to them, what offence they had given him, what injury they had done him, that he bore them a grudge for it, and took this method to be revenged? for it is suggested, had they used him ever so ill, he could not have requited it in a stronger manner than by leading them into such a sin, the consequence of which must be ruin and destruction, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/20-9.htm">Genesis 20:9</a> or else Moses inquires of Aaron what methods the people had made use of to prevail upon him to suffer them to do such a piece of wickedness; whether it was by persuasion and artful insinuations, or by threatening to take away his life if he did not comply, or in what manner they had wrought upon his weak side, to induce him to take such a step. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/exodus/32.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And Moses said unto Aaron, What did this people unto thee, that thou hast brought so great a sin upon them?</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/exodus/32.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">21–24</span>.

Having taken the needful steps for the destruction of the idol, Moses naturally turned upon Aaron. He had been left in charge of the people, to guide them, instruct them, counsel them in difficulties (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-14.htm">Exodus 24:14</a>). How had he acquitted himself of his task? He had led the people into a great sin - had at any rate connived at it - assisted in it. Moses therefore asks, "What had the people done to him, that he should so act? How had they injured him, that he should so greatly injure them?" To this he has no direct reply. But he will not acknowledge himself in fault - he must excuse himself. And his excuse is twofold: - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> It was the people's fault, not his; they were "set on mischief." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> It was a fatality - he threw the gold into the fire, and "it came out this calf." We are not surprised, after this, to read in  Deuteronomy, that "the Lord was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him," and was only hindered from his purpose by the intercession of Moses <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">What did this people unto thee?</span> Moses does not suppose that the people had really done anything to Aaron. He asks the question as a reproach - they had done nothing to thee - <span class="accented">had</span> in no way injured thee - and yet thou broughtest this evil upon them. <span class="cmt_word">So great a sin</span>. Literally, "a great sin" - the sin of idolatry. If Aaron had offered a strenuous opposition from the first, the idolatry might not have taken place - the people might have been brought to a better mind. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/exodus/32.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When Moses departed from God with the two tables of the law in his hand (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/31-18.htm">Exodus 31:18</a>), and came to Joshua on the mountain (see at ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/24-13.htm">Joshua 24:13</a>), the latter heard the shouting of the people (lit., the voice of the people in its noise, &#1512;&#1506;&#1492; for &#1512;&#1506;&#1493;, from &#1512;&#1506; noise, tumult), and took it to be the noise of war; but Moses said (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-18.htm">Exodus 32:18</a>), "It is not the sound of the answering of power, nor the sound of the answering of weakness," i.e., they are not such sounds as you hear in the heat of battle from the strong (the conquerors) and the weak (the conquered); "the sound of antiphonal songs I hear."
