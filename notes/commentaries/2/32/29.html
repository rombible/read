We must never be drawn into sin by any thing man can say or do to us; for men can but tempt us to sin, they cannot force us. The approach of Moses turned the dancing into trembling. They were exposed to shame by their sin. The course Moses took to roll away this reproach, was, not by concealing the sin, or putting any false colour upon it, but by punishing it. The Levites were to slay the ringleaders in this wickedness; yet none were executed but those who openly stood forth. Those are marked for ruin who persist in sin: those who in the morning were shouting and dancing, before night were dying. Such sudden changes do the judgments of the Lord sometimes make with sinners that are secure and jovial in their sin.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/32.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Consecrate yourselves to day to the Lord ... - The margin contains the literal rendering.

The Levites were to prove themselves in a special way the servants of Yahweh, in anticipation of their formal consecration as ministers of the sanctuary (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-8.htm">Deuteronomy 10:8</a>), by manifesting a self-sacrificing zeal in carrying out the divine command, even upon their nearest relatives.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/exodus/32.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>29.

"What has this people done to thee ("done" in a bad sense, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/27-45.htm">Genesis 27:45</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-11.htm">Exodus 13:11</a>), that thou hast brought a great sin upon it?" Even if Aaron had merely acted from weakness in carrying out the will of the people, he was the most to blame, for not having resisted the urgent entreaty of the people firmly and with strong faith, and even at the cost of his life. Consequently he could think of nothing better than the pitiful subterfuge, "Be not angry, my lord (he addresses Moses in this way on account of his office, and because of his anger, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/12-11.htm">Numbers 12:11</a>): thou knowest the people, that it is in wickedness" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-19.htm">1 John 5:19</a>), and the admission that he had been overcome by the urgency of the people, and had thrown the gold they handed him into the fire, and that this calf had come out (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/32-22.htm">Exodus 32:22-24</a>), as if the image had come out of its own accord, without his intention or will. This excuse was so contemptible that Moses did not think it worthy of a reply, at the same time, as he told the people afterwards (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-20.htm">Deuteronomy 9:20</a>), he averted the great wrath of the Lord from him through his intercession. </body></html>
