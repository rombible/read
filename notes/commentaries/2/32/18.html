Moses turned, and went down from the mount&#8212;The plain, Er-Raheh, is not visible from the top of Jebel Musa, nor can the mount be descended on the side towards that valley; hence Moses and his companion, who on duty had patiently waited his return in the hollow of the mountain's brow, heard the shouting some time before they actually saw the camp.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/exodus/32.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The voice of them that shout for mastery</span>, Heb. <span class="ital">of a cry of strength</span>, i.e. of strong men, or of the stronger and victorious party, who use to express themselves with triumphant shouts. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The voice of them that cry for being overcome</span>, Heb. of a cry of weakness, i.e. of weak, and wounded, and vanquished men, who use to break forth into doleful cries. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/exodus/32.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he said,....

The passage (Di.) ‘has a highly peculiar, almost poetical character’ (cf. <span class="ital">v.</span> 25); and there is a play on the double sense of the word ‘answer.’ For the sense of answering responsively in song, see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-21.htm" title="And Miriam answered them, Sing you to the LORD, for he has triumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider has he thrown into the sea.">Exodus 15:21</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> This verse is difficult to translate, being markedly antithetical and at the same time idiomatic. Perhaps it would be best to render - "It is not the voice of them who raise the cry of victory, nor is it the voice of them who raise the cry of defeat - the voice of them who raise a cry do I hear." The verb is the same in all the three clauses; and it would seem that Moses simply denied that there was any sound of war without making any clear suggestion as to the real character of the disturbance. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/exodus/32.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"And Moses besought the Lord his God." &#1497;&#1497; &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1495;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;, lit., to stroke the face of Jehovah, for the purpose of appeasing His anger, i.e., to entreat His mercy, either by means of sacrifices (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-12.htm">1 Samuel 13:12</a>) or by intercession.
