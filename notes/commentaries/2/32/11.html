Turn from your fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against your people.">Exodus 32:12</a>); (3) it will nullify the promises made to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-5.htm" title="And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if you be able to number them: and he said to him, So shall your seed be.">Genesis 15:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/17-2.htm" title="And I will make my covenant between me and you, and will multiply you exceedingly.">Genesis 17:2-6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/26-1.htm" title="And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went to Abimelech king of the Philistines to Gerar.">Genesis 26:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-12.htm" title="And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it.">Genesis 28:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-11.htm" title="And God said to him, I am God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of you, and kings shall come out of your loins;">Genesis 35:11</a>), causing Moses to eclipse their glory, and to be looked upon as the true patriarch and progenitor of the “peculiar people” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-13.htm" title="Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, your servants, to whom you swore by your own self, and said to them, I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of will I give to your seed, and they shall inherit it for ever.">Exodus 32:13</a>). To these arguments he adds entreaties that God will be merciful, and change His purpose (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-12.htm" title="Why should the Egyptians speak, and say, For mischief did he bring them out, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth? Turn from your fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against your people.">Exodus 32:12</a>).<p>(14) <span class= "bld">The Lord repented of the evil.</span>—Moses’ intercession was effectual. God spared the people at his desire. He is, therefore, said to have “repented”; not that He had really changed His purpose, for He had known from the beginning that Moses would intercede and that He would spare, but because He first announced a (conditional) purpose, and then announced a different one. The mode of speech is, as so frequently, anthropomorphic.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/exodus/32.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-11.htm" title="And Moses sought the LORD his God, and said, LORD, why does your wrath wax hot against your people, which you have brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power, and with a mighty hand?">Exodus 32:11</a></span>. <span class="ital">And Moses besought the Lord his God </span>— If God would not be called the God of Israel, yet he hoped he might address him as his own God.

Sin is the corruption of the sinner, and it is a self-corruption; every man is tempted when he is drawn aside of his own lust. They had turned aside out of the way. Sin is a departing from the way of duty into a by-path. They soon forgot God's works. He sees what they cannot discover, nor is any wickedness of the world hid from him. We could not bear to see the thousandth part of that evil which God sees every day. God expresses the greatness of his just displeasure, after the manner of men who would have prayer of Moses could save them from ruin; thus he was a type of Christ, by whose mediation alone, God would reconcile the world to himself. Moses pleads God's glory. The glorifying God's name, as it ought to be our first petition, and it is so in the Lord's prayer, so it ought to be our great plea. And God's promises are to be our pleas in prayer; for what he has promised he is able to perform. See the power of prayer. In answer to the prayers of Moses, God showed his purpose of sparing the people, as he had before seemed determined on their destruction; which change of the outward discovery of his purpose, is called repenting of the evil.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/32.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Let me alone - But Moses did not let the Lord alone; he wrestled, as Jacob had done, until, like Jacob, he obtained the blessing <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-24.htm">Genesis 32:24-29</a>.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/exodus/32.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. make of thee a great nation&#8212;Care must be taken not to suppose this language as betokening any change or vacillation in the divine purpose. The covenant made with the patriarchs had been ratified in the most solemn manner; it could not and never was intended that it should be broken. But the manner in which God spoke to Moses served two important purposes&#8212;it tended to develop the faith and intercessory patriotism of the Hebrew leader, and to excite the serious alarm of the people, that God would reject them and deprive them of the privileges they had fondly fancied were so secure.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/exodus/32.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The Lord his God</span>; emphatically so called: q.d.

As the Lord was the God of Moses, his covenant God, and he had an interest in him, he made use of it in favour of the people of Israel: <p>and said, why doth thy wrath wax hot against thy people? so as to think or speak of consuming them utterly; otherwise he knew there was reason for his being angry and wroth with them; but though they were deserving of his hot wrath and displeasure, and even to be dealt with in the manner proposed, yet he entreats he would consider they were his people; his special people, whom he had chose above all people, and had redeemed them from the house of bondage, had given them laws, and made a covenant with them, and many promises unto them, and therefore hoped he would not consume them in his hot displeasure; God had called them the people of Moses, and Moses retorts it, and calls them the people of God, and makes use of their relation to him as an argument with him in their favour; and which also shows that Moses did not understand that the Lord by calling them his people disowned them as his: <p>which thou hast brought out of the land of Egypt with great power, and with a mighty hand? this the Lord had ascribed to Moses, and observes it is an aggravation of their ingratitude to Moses, and here Moses retorts, and ascribes it to God, and to his mighty power; as for himself he was only a weak feeble instrument, the Lord was the efficient cause of their deliverance, in which he had shown the exceeding greatness of his power; and he argues from hence, that seeing he had exerted his mighty arm in bringing them from thence, that he would not now lift it up against them and destroy them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/exodus/32.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And Moses besought the LORD his God, and said, LORD, why doth thy wrath wax hot against thy people, which thou hast brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power, and with a mighty hand?</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/exodus/32.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">11</span>. <span class="ital">besought</span>] properly, as Arabic seems to shew, ‘<span class="ital">made sweet</span> the face of,’ fig. for, <span class="ital">entreated, sought to conciliate</span>: a frequent idiom, e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-12.htm" title="Therefore said I, The Philistines will come down now on me to Gilgal, and I have not made supplication to the LORD: I forced myself therefore, and offered a burnt offering.">1 Samuel 13:12</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-6.htm" title="And the king answered and said to the man of God, Entreat now the face of the LORD your God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored me again.

But this intimation of an Egyptian custom is no proof that the feast was not intended for Jehovah; for joyous sacrificial meals, and even sports and dances, are met with in connection with the legitimate worship of Jehovah (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/15-20.htm">Exodus 15:20-21</a>). Nevertheless the making of the calf, and the sacrificial meals and other ceremonies performed before it, were a shameful apostasy from Jehovah, a practical denial of the inimitable glory of the true God, and a culpable breach of the second commandment of the covenant words (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-4.htm">Exodus 20:4</a>), whereby Israel had broken the covenant with the Lord, and fallen back to the heathen customs of Egypt. Aaron also shared the guilt of this transgression, although it was merely out of sinful weakness that he had assented to the proposals of the people and gratified their wishes (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-20.htm">Deuteronomy 9:20</a>). He also fell with the people, and denied the God who had chosen him, though he himself was unconscious of it, to be His priest, to bear the sins of the people, and to expiate them before Jehovah. The apostasy of the nation became a temptation to him, in which the unfitness of his nature for the office was to be made manifest, in order that he might ever remember this, and not excuse himself from the office, to which the Lord had not called him because of his own worthiness, but purely as an act of unmerited grace. </body></html>
