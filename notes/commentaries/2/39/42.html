As the Most High dwelt visibly within the sanctuary, even on the ark, so did he reside in the human nature and tabernacle of his dear Son; in Christ dwelt all the fulness of the Godhead bodily, Col 2:9. The tabernacle was a symbol of every real Christian. In the soul of every true follower of the Saviour the Father dwells, the object of his worship, and the author of his blessings. The tabernacle also typified the church of the Redeemer. The meanest and the mightiest are alike dear to the Father's love, freely exercised through faith in Christ. The tabernacle was a type and emblem of the heavenly temple, Re 21:3. What, then, will be the splendour of His appearance, when the cloud shall be withdrawn, and his faithful worshippers shall see him as he is!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/39.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the notes to <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/28.htm">Exodus 28</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/exodus/39.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>34. the covering of rams' skin dyed red&#8212;(See on [35]Ex 25:5).

By "the tent," in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/39-33.htm">Exodus 39:33</a>, we are to understand the two tent-cloths, the one of purple and the other of goats' hair, by which the dwelling (&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1503;, generally rendered tabernacle) was made into a tent (&#1488;&#1500;&#1492;). From this it is perfectly obvious, that the variegated cloth formed the inner walls of the dwelling, or covered the boards on the inner side, and that the goats' hair-cloth formed the other covering. Moreover it is also obvious, that this is the way in which &#1492;&#1488;&#1492;&#1500; is to be understood, from the fact, that in the list of the things belonging to the ohel the first to be mentioned are the gold and copper hooks (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/26-6.htm">Exodus 26:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/26-11.htm">Exodus 26:11</a>) with which the two halves of the drapery that formed the tent were joined together, and then after that the boards, bolts, pillars, and sockets, as though subordinate to the tent-cloths, and only intended to answer the purpose of spreading them out into a tent of dwelling. </body></html>
