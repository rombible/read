As the Most High dwelt visibly within the sanctuary, even on the ark, so did he reside in the human nature and tabernacle of his dear Son; in Christ dwelt all the fulness of the Godhead bodily, Col 2:9. The tabernacle was a symbol of every real Christian. In the soul of every true follower of the Saviour the Father dwells, the object of his worship, and the author of his blessings. The tabernacle also typified the church of the Redeemer. The meanest and the mightiest are alike dear to the Father's love, freely exercised through faith in Christ. The tabernacle was a type and emblem of the heavenly temple, Re 21:3. What, then, will be the splendour of His appearance, when the cloud shall be withdrawn, and his faithful worshippers shall see him as he is!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/39.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the notes to <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/28.htm">Exodus 28</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/exodus/39.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>34. the covering of rams' skin dyed red&#8212;(See on [35]Ex 25:5).

The robes consisted of the ephod (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/39-2.htm">Exodus 39:2-7</a>, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/28-6.htm">Exodus 28:6-12</a>), the choshen or breastplate (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/39-8.htm">Exodus 39:8-21</a>, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/28-15.htm">Exodus 28:15-29</a>), the mel or over-coat (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/39-22.htm">Exodus 39:22-26</a>, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/28-31.htm">Exodus 28:31-34</a>); the body-coats, turbans, drawers, and girdles, for Aaron and his sons (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/39-27.htm">Exodus 39:27-29</a>, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/28-39.htm">Exodus 28:39-40</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-42.htm">Exodus 28:42</a>). The Urim and Thummim are not mentioned (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-30.htm">Exodus 28:30</a>). The head-dresses of the ordinary priests, which are simply called "bonnets" in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/28-40.htm">Exodus 28:40</a>, are called "goodly bonnets" or "ornamental caps" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/39-28.htm">Exodus 39:28</a> of this chapter (&#1502;&#1490;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1514; &#1508;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497;, from &#1508;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512; an ornament, cf. &#1508;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512; ornatus fuit). The singular, "girdle," in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/39-29.htm">Exodus 39:29</a>, with the definite article, "the girdle," might appear to refer simply to Aaron's girdle, i.e., the girdle of the high priest; but as there is no special description of the girdles of Aaron's sons (the ordinary priests) in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/29-40.htm">Exodus 29:40</a>, where they are distinctly mentioned and called by the same name (abnet) as the girdle of Aaron himself, we can only conclude that they were of the same materials and the same form and make as the latter, and that the singular, &#1492;&#1488;&#1489;&#1504;&#1496;, is used here either in the most general manner, or as a generic noun in a collective sense (see Ges. 109, 1). The last thing mentioned is the diadem upon Aaron's turban (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/39-30.htm">Exodus 39:30</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/39-31.htm">Exodus 39:31</a>, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/28-36.htm">Exodus 28:36-38</a>), so that the order in which the priests' robes are given here is analogous to the position in which the ark of the covenant and the golden altar stand to one another in the directions concerning the sacred things in ch. 25-30. "For just as all the other things are there placed between the holy ark and the golden altar as the two poles, so here all the rest of the priests' robes are included between the shoulder-dress, the principal part of the official robes of the high priest, and the golden frontlet, the inscription upon which rendered it the most striking sign of the dignity of his office" (Baumgarten). </body></html>
