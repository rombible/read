As the Most High dwelt visibly within the sanctuary, even on the ark, so did he reside in the human nature and tabernacle of his dear Son; in Christ dwelt all the fulness of the Godhead bodily, Col 2:9. The tabernacle was a symbol of every real Christian. In the soul of every true follower of the Saviour the Father dwells, the object of his worship, and the author of his blessings. The tabernacle also typified the church of the Redeemer. The meanest and the mightiest are alike dear to the Father's love, freely exercised through faith in Christ. The tabernacle was a type and emblem of the heavenly temple, Re 21:3.

Moses did look upon all the work, and, behold, they had done it as the Lord had commanded&#8212;A formal inspection was made on the completion of the tabernacle, not only with a view to have the work transferred from the charge of the workmen, but to ascertain whether it corresponded with "the pattern." The result of a careful and minute survey showed that every plank, curtain, altar, and vase had been most accurately made of the form, and in the place designed by the Divine Architect&#8212;and Moses, in accepting it of their hands, thanked God for them, and begged Him to bless them.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/exodus/39.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> i.e. Both the people for their liberal contribution, and the workmen for their great care and industry. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/exodus/39.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Moses did look upon all the work,.... Made a survey of it, and with great care and accuracy examined every particular thing, and the manner in which it was finished: <p>and, behold, they had done it as the Lord had commanded, even so had they done it; both as to matter and manner in every point, on all accounts, just as they were ordered and directed; they being throughout the whole filled by the Spirit of God with wisdom and understanding, to do everything just as it was the will and pleasure of God it should be done: <p>and Moses blessed them; commended them for what they had done, and implored the divine blessing upon them; and which may be understood both of the people who had so liberally and plentifully contributed to this good work, and of the artificers who had so carefully and punctually performed it. The form of blessing, as the Targum of Jonathan gives it, is,"may the Shechinah (or the divine Majesty) of the Lord dwell in the works of your hands;''or as Jarchi expresses it,"may it be the pleasure (of God) that the Shechinah may dwell in the works of your hands, and the beauty of the Lord our God may be upon us, &amp;c.''which last words were part of the prayer of Moses, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-17.htm">Psalm 90:17</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/exodus/39.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And Moses did look upon all the work, and, behold, they had done it as the LORD had commanded, even so had they done it: and Moses <span class="cverse3">{k}</span> blessed them.</span><p>(k) Praised God for the peoples diligence and prayed for them.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/exodus/39.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">43</span>.
