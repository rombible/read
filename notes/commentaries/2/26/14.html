This was a covering that was put over the curtains of goats' skin; but whether it went all over them, or only upon the roof of the tabernacle they covered, to keep out the rains from soaking through, is not certain, nor very evident; Jarchi thinks the roof was only covered with this covering of rams' skins; but others think it more reasonable that the whole was covered with them to preserve from dust and rain: <p>and a covering above of badgers' skins; of these skins See Gill on <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/25-5.htm">Exodus 25:5</a>, this was a fourth covering of the tabernacle; the first was of linen curtains, the second of goats' hair, the third of rams' skins, and the fourth of badgers' skins, which seems to have been thicker and courser, since shoes were made of them, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-10.htm">Ezekiel 16:10</a>, R. Judah, as quoted by Jarchi, thinks the two last were but one covering, half of it consisting of rams' skins and half of it of badgers' skins; but the text is express that the latter was a covering above and over the former: these several coverings of the tabernacle show the care that God takes of his church and people, and how sufficiently they are provided for, that they may be in safety from all their enemies, being clothed with Christ's righteousness, and under the purple covering of his blood, and surrounded by his almighty power, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/4-5.htm">Isaiah 4:5</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/exodus/26.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And thou shalt make a <span class="cverse3">{g}</span> covering for the tent <i>of</i> rams' skins dyed red, and a covering above <i>of</i> <span class="cverse3">{h}</span> badgers' skins.</span><p>(g) To be put on the covering that was made of goats hair.<p>(h) This was the third covering of the tabernacle.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/exodus/26.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">14</span>.

Two outer coverings of stronger and stouter materials, to be laid over the Tent, for protection against rain.

The Dwelling, with the coverings above it, was kept in its place by cords connecting it with pins driven into the ground, in the manner of a tent: see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/27-19.htm" title="All the vessels of the tabernacle in all the service thereof, and all the pins thereof, and all the pins of the court, shall be of brass.">Exodus 27:19</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/35-18.htm" title="The pins of the tabernacle, and the pins of the court, and their cords,">Exodus 35:18</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/38-20.htm" title="And all the pins of the tabernacle, and of the court round about, were of brass.">Exodus 38:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/38-31.htm" title="And the sockets of the court round about, and the sockets of the court gate, and all the pins of the tabernacle, and all the pins of the court round about.">Exodus 38:31</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">15–30</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/36-20.htm" title="And he made boards for the tabernacle of shittim wood, standing up....">Exodus 36:20-34</a>). The ‘boards,’ or, perhaps, <span class="bld">frames</span>, for the Dwelling. There is great difficulty in some of the details: but the general sense is clear. The ‘boards’ were to be of acacia wood, overlaid with gold, each 10 cubits (15 ft.) long, and 1½ cubits (2 ft. 3 in.) broad: they were to be placed upright, so as to form the sides and back of the Dwelling, each resting in two sockets of silver: there were to be twenty forming each side, six to form the back, and two, of special construction, at the corners, where the back and sides met: five bars, attached to the boards by rings, were to run horizontally along the two sides and the back, respectively, to hold them firmly in their place.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And thou shalt make a covering for</span> <span class="cmt_word">the tent.</span> Nothing is said of the size of this covering; but, as its object was clearly to protect the roof of the tent from penetration by wet, it seems reasonable to suppose that it extended at least as far as the boards of the tabernacle.
