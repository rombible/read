In every pair of these sockets, a strong board of shittim-wood, covered with plates of gold, was fitted by mortises and tenons. Thus walls were formed for the two sides, and for the west end. The wall was further held together by bars, which passed through rings of gold. Over this the curtains were spread. Though movable, it was strong and firm. The materials were very costly. In all this it was a type of the church of God, built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief Corner-stone, Eph 2:20,21.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Sockets - More literally, bases, or foundations. Each base weighed a talent, that is, about 94 lbs. (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/38-27.htm">Exodus 38:27</a>), and must have been a massive block. The bases formed a continuous foundation for the walls of boards, presenting a succession of sockets or mortices (each base having a single socket), into which the tenons were to fit. They served not only for ornament but also for the protection of the lower ends of the boards from the decay which would have resulted from contact with the ground.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/exodus/26.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15-30. thou shalt make boards &#8230; rear up the tabernacle according to the fashion &#8230; which was showed thee&#8212;The tabernacle, from its name as well as from its general appearance and arrangements, was a tent; but from the description given in these verses, the boards that formed its walls, the five (cross) bars that strengthened them, and the middle bar that "reached from end to end," and gave it solidity and compactness, it was evidently a more substantial fabric than a light and fragile tent, probably on account of the weight of its various coverings as well as for the protection of its precious furniture.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/exodus/26.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Forty sockets</span>, <span class="ital">or bases, or pedestals, or feet</span>, upon which the boards stood, and to which they were fastened. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/exodus/26.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And thou shall make forty sockets of silver under the twenty boards,....

Nothing is said of the shape of these "sockets." They were certainly very massive, as each contained a silver talent (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/38-27.htm">Exodus 38:27</a>), and thus weighed from eighty to ninety pounds. It has been supposed that they stood on the ground, and formed a sort of continuous base, out of which the planks rose. But this would have constituted a very unsafe structure. Kalisch is probably right in his view, that the sockets were let into the ground resembling those at the bottom of a gate, into which the bolt is pressed down. Each socket received one of the "tenons." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/exodus/26.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>This tent-cloth was two cubits longer than the inner one, as each piece was 30 cubits long instead of 28; it was also two cubits broader, as it was composed of 11 pieces, the eleventh only reckoning as two cubits, as it was to be laid double. Consequently there was an excess (&#1492;&#1506;&#1491;&#1507; that which is over) of two cubits each way; and according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/26-12.htm">Exodus 26:12</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/26-13.htm">Exodus 26:13</a> this was to be disposed of in the following manner: "As for the spreading out of the excess in the tent-cloths, the half of the cloth in excess shall spread out over the back of the dwelling; and the cubit from here and from there in the excess in the length of the tent-cloths (i.e., the cubit over in the length in each of the cloths) shall be spread out on the sides of the dwelling from here and from there to cover it." Now since, according to this, one half of the two cubits of the sixth piece which was laid double was to hang down the back of the tabernacle, there only remained one cubit for the gable of the front. It follows, therefore, that the joining of the two halves with loops and clasps would come a cubit farther back, than the place where the curtain of the holy of holies divided the dwelling. But in consequence of the cloth being a cubit longer in every direction, it nearly reached the ground on all three sides, the thickness of the wooden framework alone preventing it from reaching it altogether. </body></html>
