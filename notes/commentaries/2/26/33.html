It was hung upon pillars. This vail was for a partition between the holy place and the most holy; which forbade any to look into the holiest of all. The apostle tells what was the meaning of this vail, Heb 9:8. That the ceremonial law could not make the comers thereunto perfect, nor would the observance of it bring men to heaven; the way into the holiest of all was not made manifest, while the first tabernacle was standing. Life and immortality lay hidden till they were brought to light by the gospel; which was signified by the rending of this vail at the death of Christ, Mt 27:51. We have now boldness to enter into the holiest, in all acts of worship, by the blood of Jesus; yet such as obliges us to holy reverence. Another vail was for the outer door of the tabernacle. This vail was all the defence the tabernacle had. God takes care of his church on earth. A curtain shall be, if God please to make it so, as strong a defence to his house, as gates of brass and bars of iron. With this typical description of Christ and his church before us, what is our judgment of these matters? Do we see any glory in the person of Christ? any excellence in his character? any thing precious in his salvation? or any wisdom in the doctrine of the cross? Will our religion bear examination? and are we more careful to approve our hearts to God than our characters toward men?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Taches - Not the same as the hooks of the preceding verse, but the clasps of the tabernacle-cloth (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/26-6.htm">Exodus 26:6</a>).<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/exodus/26.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15-30. thou shalt make boards &#8230; rear up the tabernacle according to the fashion &#8230; which was showed thee&#8212;The tabernacle, from its name as well as from its general appearance and arrangements, was a tent; but from the description given in these verses, the boards that formed its walls, the five (cross) bars that strengthened them, and the middle bar that "reached from end to end," and gave it solidity and compactness, it was evidently a more substantial fabric than a light and fragile tent, probably on account of the weight of its various coverings as well as for the protection of its precious furniture.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/exodus/26.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Under the taches</span>, or, <span class="ital">in the place</span> (as the Hebrew <span class="ital">tacheth</span> oft signifies) of the taches, to wit, where the two curtains are joined together by taches, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/26-6.htm" title="And you shall make fifty clasps of gold, and couple the curtains together with the clasps: and it shall be one tabernacle.">Exodus 26:6</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/exodus/26.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And thou shall hang up the vail under the taches,....

The holy place was typical of the church on earth, where all the saints, who are priests to God, worship, and the most holy of heaven, the perfect state of bliss and happiness. <p>(y) Works, vol, 1. p. 718. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/exodus/26.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And thou shalt hang up the vail under the taches, that thou mayest bring in thither within the vail the ark of the testimony: and the vail shall divide unto you between the holy <i>place</i> and the <span class="cverse3">{l}</span> most holy.</span><p>(l) In which only the high priest entered and only once a year.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/exodus/26.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">33</span>. <span class="ital">under the clasps</span>] the clasps mentioned in <span class="ital">v.</span> 6, which must have been (<span class="ital">vv.</span> 2, 3) at a distance of 5 × 4 (= 20) cubits from the front of the Dwelling, and (as the Dwelling Isaiah 30 cubits long) 10 cubits from its back.

The length and breadth of the Dwelling are exactly half those of Solomon’s Temple (60 × 20 cubits): the Holy of holies is also half the height of that in the Temple (20 × 20 × 20 cubits), but the Holy place is only a third as high as that in the Temple (40 × 20 × 30 cubits): see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-2.htm" title="And the house which king Solomon built for the LORD, the length thereof was three score cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits.">1 Kings 6:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_kings/6-16.htm" title="And he built twenty cubits on the sides of the house, both the floor and the walls with boards of cedar: he even built them for it within, even for the oracle, even for the most holy place....">1 Kings 6:16-17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-20.htm" title="And the oracle in the forepart was twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the height thereof: and he overlaid it with pure gold; and so covered the altar which was of cedar.">1 Kings 6:20</a> [for ‘oracle,’ read <span class="ital">hindmost part</span>, or <span class="ital">shrine</span>, and for ‘temple,’ Heb. <span class="ital">hêkâl</span>, read <span class="ital">hall</span>; see p. 259].<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt hang up the veil</span>  <span class="cmt_word">under the taches.</span> If the "taches" of ver. 6 or even of ver. 11, are intended, and" under" is to be taken strictly as" immediately under," the mishkan must have been divided by the veil into two equal, or very nearly equal parts; and the tabernacle must in an important particular have completely differed from the temple. In the temple the holy place was twice the length of the holy of holies (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-16.htm">1 Kings 6:16, 17</a>).

Literally, "the holy of holies" - the inner chamber, that within the veil, which constituted the adytum, or innermost recess of the tabernacle.
