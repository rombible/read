The administration of justice was one of the chief duties of the royal office; and the crime committed by Moses was one to be punished by death. There was nothing to reduce it from murder to manslaughter. And the motives which extenuate it in the eyes of moderns—patriotic zeal and hatred of oppression—would not have commanded the sympathies of a Pharaoh.<p><span class= "bld">Moses fled.</span>—Or, <span class= "ital">had fled. </span>Moses would fly as soon as he found his act was known. He fled “at the saying” of the Israelite (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-29.htm" title="Then fled Moses at this saying, and was a stranger in the land of Madian, where he begat two sons.">Acts 7:29</a>). When Pharaoh sought for him, he was gone.<p><span class= "bld">Dwelt in the land of Midian</span>—i.e., “Was led to make Midian his home,” under circumstances about to be related.

Things were not yet ripe for Israel’s deliverance. The measure of Egypt’s iniquity was not yet full; the Hebrews were not sufficiently humbled, nor were they yet increased to such a multitude as God designed: Moses is to be further fitted for the service, and therefore is directed to withdraw for the present, “till the time to favour Israel, even the set time, come.” God guided Moses to Midian, because the Midianites were of the seed of Abraham, and retained the worship of the true God; so that he might have not only a safe, but a comfortable settlement among them; and through this country he was afterward to lead Israel, which that he might do the better, he now had opportunity of acquainting himself with it. Hither he came, and <span class="ital">sat down by a well — </span>Tired and thoughtful, waiting to see what way Providence would direct him. It was a great change with him, since he was but the other day at ease in Pharaoh’s court.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:11-15 Moses boldly owned the cause of God's people. It is plain from Heb 11. that this was done in faith, with the full purpose of leaving the honours, wealth, and pleasures of his rank among the Egyptians. By the grace of God he was a partaker of faith in Christ, which overcomes the world. He was willing, not only to risk all, but to suffer for his sake; being assured that Israel were the people of God. By special warrant from Heaven, which makes no rule for other cases, Moses slew an Egyptian, and rescued an oppressed Israelites. Also, he tried to end a dispute between two Hebrews. The reproof Moses gave, may still be of use. May we not apply it to disputants, who, by their fierce debates, divide and weaken the Christian church? They forget that they are brethren. He that did wrong quarreled with Moses. It is a sign of guilt to be angry at reproof. Men know not what they do, nor what enemies they are to themselves, when they resist and despise faithful reproofs and reprovers. Moses might have said, if this be the spirit of the Hebrews, I will go to court again, and be the son of Pharaoh's daughter. But we must take heed of being set against the ways and people of God, by the follies and peevishness of some persons that profess religion. Moses was obliged to flee into the land of Midian. God ordered this for wise and holy ends.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>No Egyptian king would have left; such an offence unpunished.

The headquarters of Jethro are supposed to have been where Dahab-Madian now stands; and from Moses coming direct to that place, he may have travelled with a caravan of merchants.

Both for his killing the Egyptian, which by the laws of Egypt (i) was death, whether bond or free; and for his taking part with the Hebrews against the Egyptians, and knowing him to be a wise and valiant man, might fear he would put himself at the head of the Hebrews, and cause a revolt of them; and if there was anything in his dream, or if he had such an one, and had the interpretation of it given by his magicians, that an Hebrew child should be born, by whom Egypt would be destroyed; see Gill on <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/1-15.htm">Exodus 1:15</a>, he might call it to mind, and be affected with it, and fear the time was coming on, and Moses was the person by whom it should be done; and he might be stirred up by his courtiers to take this step, who doubtless envied the growing interest of Moses in his court: <p>but Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh; not through want of courage, but through prudence, to avoid danger, and preserve his life for future usefulness; and no doubt under a divine impulse, and by the direction of divine Providence, the time for him to be the deliverer of Israel not being yet come: <p>and dwelt in the land of Midian: a country so called from Midian, one of Abraham's sons by Keturah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-2.htm">Genesis 25:2</a>. Jerom (k) calls it a city, and says it was on the other side of Arabia, to the south, in the desert of the Saracens, to the east of the Red sea, from whence the country was called Midian; and Philo (l) says, that Moses went into neighbouring Arabia; and which is confirmed by Artapanus (m) the Heathen historian, who says, that from Memphis, crossing the river Nile, he went into Arabia; and this country was sometimes called Cush or Ethiopia; hence Moses's wife is called an Ethiopian woman, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/12-1.htm">Numbers 12:1</a>. <p>and he sat down by a well; weary, thoughtful, and pensive. It may be observed, that it was usual with persons in such like circumstances, being strangers and not knowing well to whom to apply for assistance or direction, to place themselves at a well of water, to which there was frequent resort, both for the use of families and of flocks; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-11.htm">Genesis 24:11</a>. This well is now called, as some say, Eyoun el Kaseb, fourteen hours and a half from Magare Chouaib, or "the grot of Jethro" (n); but if this was so far from Jethro's house, his daughters had a long way to go with their flock: but some other travellers (o) speak of a very neat and pleasant village, called Hattin, where they were shown the grave of Jethro, Moses's father-in-law; and in the neighbourhood of that place is a cistern, now called Omar, and is said to be the watering place where Moses met with the daughters of the priest of Midian. A late learned man (p) thinks, that Sharma, which is about a day and a half's journey southeast from Mount Sinai, is the place where Jethro lived. The Arabic geographer (q) says, at the shore of the Red sea lies the city Madian, greater than Tabuc, and in it is a well, out of which Moses watered the flocks of Scioaib, that is, Raguel. <p>(i) Diodor.

Arabia, and E. of Canaan (<span class="ital">ib. v.</span> 6; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/22-4.htm" title="And Moab said to the elders of Midian, Now shall this company lick up all that are round about us, as the ox licks up the grass of the field. And Balak the son of Zippor was king of the Moabites at that time.">Numbers 22:4</a>), which the Hebrews reckoned to their own race, through Abraham’s second wife Ḳeṭurah, and so a step further removed than the Ishmaelites. The proper home of the Midianites appears to have been on the E. side of the Gulf of ‘Akaba, where Ptolemy (vi. 7. 2) and the Arabic geographers (cf. <span class="ital">EB.</span> iii. 3081) mention a place <span class="greekheb">Μοδίανα</span>, <span class="ital">Madyan</span>, almost exactly opposite the S. extremity of the Sin. Peninsula; but nomad branches of the tribe wandered northward along the margin of the desert, whence they made forays into Edom, for instance (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/36-35.htm" title="And Husham died, and Hadad the son of Bedad, who smote Midian in the field of Moab, reigned in his stead: and the name of his city was Avith.">Genesis 36:35</a>), and even Canaan (Judges 6-8). From <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-1.htm" title="Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father in law, the priest of Midian: and he led the flock to the backside of the desert, and came to the mountain of God, even to Horeb.">Exodus 3:1</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/18-1.htm" title="When Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses' father in law, heard of all that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people, and that the LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt;">Exodus 18:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/18-5.htm" title="And Jethro, Moses' father in law, came with his sons and his wife to Moses into the wilderness, where he encamped at the mount of God:">Exodus 18:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/18-27.htm" title="And Moses let his father in law depart; and he went his way into his own land.">Exodus 18:27</a>) it appears that ‘the land of Midian’ was not far from Sinai: if, therefore, ‘Sinai’ has been rightly located by tradition (see p. 189 ff.), there must have been a Midianite settlement in some part of what is now called the ‘Sinaitic’ Peninsula, probably in its S.E. Others, however, regard ‘the land of Midian’ as denoting more naturally the proper home of the tribe, and consider the passage to support the view that ‘Sinai’ was on the E. of the Gulf of ‘Aḳaba (cf. p. 189 f.).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In the S. or SE. of the Peninsula, Moses would be beyond Egyptian jurisdiction. It is true, in Wâdy Maghârah, and Wâdy Sarbuṭ el-Khadim, there were mines for turquoise and copper, worked by the Egyptians, and protected by military guards, which are mentioned frequently, at intervals, from the 3rd to the 20th dynasty (see full descriptions, with numerous photographs, in Petrie’s <span class="ital">Researches in Sinai</span>, 1906): but (see the Map) these were in the NW. of the Peninsula, and not necessarily on the route to the S. or SE. Sayce’s statement (<span class="ital">HCM.</span> 265 f.) that in the days of the Exodus the Sin. Peninsula was ‘an Egyptian province’ seems to be an exaggeration of the facts; for even the mining districts were not occupied by them permanently (see Petrie, p. 206).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">by</span> <span class="bld">the</span> <span class="ital">well</span>] the well of the district to which he came.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">15–22</span>.

If we have been right in supposing the Pharaoh of the original oppression to have been Seti I., the present Pharaoh, from whom Moses flies when he is "full forty years old" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-23.htm">Acts 7:23</a>), and who does not die till Moses is near eighty, must be his son, the Great Rameses, Rameses II. This prince was associated by his father at the age of ten or twelve (Brugsch, 'History of Egypt,' vol. 2. pp. 24-5), and reigned sixty-seven years, as appears from his monuments. He is the only king of the New Empire whose real reign exceeded forty years, and thus the only monarch who fulfils the conditions required by the narrative of Exodus supplemented by St. Stephen's speech in the Acts. He sought to slay Moses. We need not understand from this expression that the Pharaoh's will was thwarted or opposed by anything but the sudden disappearance of Moses. As St. Stephen says (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-29.htm">Acts 7:29</a>), "Then fled Moses <span class="accented">at this saying</span>," <span class="accented">i.e</span>. at the mere words of the aggressor, "Writ thou slay me as thou didst the Egyptian?" Moses fled, knowing what he had to expect, quitted Egypt, went to Midian; and the Egyptian monarch "sought to slay him" too late. <span class="cmt_word">The land of Midian</span> is a somewhat vague expression, for the Midianites were nomads, and at different times occupied distinct and even remote localities. Their principal settlements appear to have been on the eastern side of the Elanitic Gulf (Gulf of Akabah); but at times they extended northwards to the confines of Moab (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/36-35.htm">Genesis 36:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/22-4.htm">Numbers 22:4, 7</a>, etc.), and westward into the Sinaitic peninsula, which appears to have been "the land of Midian whereto Moses fled (see below, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-1.htm">Exodus 3:1</a>). The Midianites are not expressly mentioned in the Egyptian inscriptions. They were probably included among the Mentu, with whom the Egyptians contended in the Sinaitic region, and from whom they took the copper district north-west of Sinai. <span class="cmt_word">And he sat down by a well</span>. Rather "and he <span class="accented">dwelt</span> by <span class="accented">the</span> well." He took up his abode in the neighbourhood of the principal well belonging to the tract here called Midian. The tract was probably one of no great size, an offshoot of the greater Midian on the other side of the gulf. We cannot identify the well; but it was certainly not that near the town of Modiana, &Ntilde; spoken of by Edrisi and Abulfeda, which was in Arabia Proper, on the east of the gulf. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 2:16-22 <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/exodus/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>With the directions, "Take this child away (&#1492;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1499;&#1497; for &#1492;&#1493;&#1500;&#1497;&#1499;&#1497; used here in the sense of leading, bringing, carrying away, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/5-10.htm">Zechariah 5:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-20.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:20</a>) and suckle it for me," the king's daughter gave the child to its mother, who was unknown to her, and had been fetched as a nurse.</body></html>
