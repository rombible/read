Had he been left there long, he must have perished. But Providence brings Pharaoh's daughter to the place where this poor forlorn infant lay, and inclines her heart to pity it, which she dares do, when none else durst. God's care of us in our infancy ought to be often mentioned by us to his praise. Pharaoh cruelly sought to destroy Israel, but his own daughter had pity on a Hebrew child, and not only so, but, without knowing it, preserved Israel's deliverer, and provided Moses with a good nurse, even his own mother. That he should have a Hebrew nurse, the sister of Moses brought the mother into the place of a nurse. Moses was treated as the son of Pharoah's daughter. Many who, by their birth, are obscure and poor, by surprising events of Providence, are raised high in the world, to make men know that God rules.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>She had compassion on him - The Egyptians regarded such tenderness as a condition of acceptance on the day of reckoning. In the presence of the Lord of truth each spirit had to answer, "I have not afflicted any man, I have not made any man weep, I have not withheld milk from the mouths of sucklings" ('Funeral Ritual'). There was special ground for mentioning the feeling, since it led the princess to save and adopt the child in spite of her father's commands. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/exodus/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6-9. when she had opened it, she saw the child&#8212;The narrative is picturesque. No tale of romance ever described a plot more skilfully laid or more full of interest in the development. The expedient of the ark, the slime and pitch, the choice of the time and place, the appeal to the sensibilities of the female breast, the stationing of the sister as a watch of the proceedings, her timely suggestion of a nurse, and the engagement of the mother herself&#8212;all bespeak a more than ordinary measure of ingenuity as well as intense solicitude on the part of the parents. But the origin of the scheme was most probably owing to a divine suggestion, as its success was due to an overruling Providence, who not only preserved the child's life, but provided for his being trained in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. Hence it is said to have been done by faith (Heb 11:23), either in the general promise of deliverance, or some special revelation made to Amram and Jochebed&#8212;and in this view, the pious couple gave a beautiful example of a firm reliance on the word of God, united with an active use of the most suitable means.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/exodus/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/exodus/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Pharaoh's daughter said unto her,....

The dagesh dirim. in &#1492;&#1510;&#1468;&#1508;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493; serves to separate the consonant in which it stands from the syllable which follows (vid., Ewald, 92c; Ges. 20, 2b). &#1490;&#1468;&#1502;&#1488; &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1514; a little chest of rushes. The use of the word &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1492; (ark) is probably intended to call to mind the ark in which Noah was saved (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-14.htm">Genesis 6:14</a>). &#1490;&#1468;&#1502;&#1488;, papyrus, the paper reed: a kind of rush which was very common in ancient Egypt, but has almost entirely disappeared, or, as Pruner affirms (gypt. Naturgesch. p. 55), is nowhere to be found. It had a triangular stalk about the thickness of a finger, which grew to the height of ten feet; and from this the lighter Nile boats were made, whilst the peeling of the plant was used for sails, mattresses, mats, sandals, and other articles, but chiefly for the preparation of paper (vid., Celsii Hierobot. ii. pp. 137ff.; Hengstenberg, Egypt and the Books of Moses, pp. 85, 86, transl.). &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1502;&#1512;&#1492;, for &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1502;&#1512;&#1492;&#1468; with mappik omitted: and cemented (pitched) it with &#1495;&#1502;&#1512; bitumen, the asphalt of the Dead Sea, to fasten the papyrus stalks, and with pitch, to make it water-tight, and put it in the reeds by the bank of the Nile, at a spot, as the sequel shows, where she knew that the king's daughter was accustomed to bathe. For "the sagacity of the mother led her, no doubt, so to arrange the whole, that the issue might be just what is related in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/2-5.htm">Exodus 2:5-9</a>" (Baumgarten). The daughter stationed herself a little distance off, to see what happened to the child (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/2-4.htm">Exodus 2:4</a>). This sister of Moses was most probably the Miriam who is frequently mentioned afterwards (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-59.htm">Numbers 26:59</a>). &#1514;&#1468;&#1514;&#1510;&#1468;&#1489; for &#1514;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497;&#1510;&#1468;&#1489;.
