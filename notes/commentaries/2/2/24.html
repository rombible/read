Sometimes the Lord suffers the rod of the wicked to lie very long and very heavy on the lot of the righteous. At last they began to think of God under their troubles. It is a sign that the Lord is coming towards us with deliverance, when he inclines and enables us to cry to him for it. God heard their groaning; he made it to appear that he took notice of their complaints. He remembered his covenant, of which he is ever mindful. He considered this, and not any merit of theirs. He looked upon the children of Israel. Moses looked upon them, and pitied them; but now God looked upon them, and helped them. He had respect unto them. His eyes are now fixed upon Israel, to show himself in their behalf. God is ever thus, a very present help in trouble. Take courage then, ye who, conscious of guilt and thraldom, are looking to Him for deliverance. God in Christ Jesus is also looking upon you. A call of love is joined with a promise of the Redeemer.

The whole history of Israel is foreshadowed in these words: God heard, remembered, looked upon, and knew them. It evidently indicates the beginning of a crisis marked by a personal intervention of God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/exodus/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>23. the king of Egypt died: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage&#8212;The language seems to imply that the Israelites had experienced a partial relaxation, probably through the influence of Moses' royal patroness; but in the reign of her father's successor the persecution was renewed with increased severity.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/exodus/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/exodus/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And God heard their groaning,....

God is said to "hear" the prayers which he accepts and grants; to "be deaf" to those which he does not grant, but rejects. He now "heard" (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> accepted) the supplications of oppressed Israel; and on account of the covenant which he had made with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob - a covenant always <span class="cmt_word">remembered</span> by him - he <span class="cmt_word">looked upon</span> his people, made them the objects of his special <span class="cmt_word">regard</span>, and entered on a course, which was abnormal, irregular, miraculous, in order to carry out his purposes of mercy towards them It is observed that anthropomorphic expressions are here accumulated; but this is always the case when the love and tenderness of God towards man are spoken of, since they form the only possible phraseology in which ideas of love and tenderness can be expressed so as to be intelligible to bureau beings. <span class="cmt_word">And God regarded them</span>. Literally, "and God knew." God kept the whole in his thoughts - bore in mind the sufferings, the wrongs, the hopes, the fears, the groans, the despair, the appeal to him, the fervent supplications and prayers  - knew all, remembered all-counted every word and sigh - gathered the tears into his bottle - noted all things in his book - and for the present endured, kept silence - but was preparing for his foes a terrible vengeance - for his people a marvellous deliverance  <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/exodus/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Here Moses secured for himself a hospitable reception from a priest of Midian, and a home at his house, by doing as Jacob had formerly done (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/29-10.htm">Genesis 29:10</a>), viz., helping his daughters to water their father's sheep, and protecting them against the other shepherds. - On the form &#1497;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1503; for &#1497;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1503; vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-19.htm">Genesis 19:19</a>; and for the masculine suffixes to &#1497;&#1490;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; and &#1510;&#1488;&#1504;&#1501;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-9.htm">Genesis 31:9</a>. &#1514;&#1468;&#1491;&#1500;&#1504;&#1492; for &#1514;&#1468;&#1491;&#1500;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492;, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/5-12.htm">Job 5:12</a>, cf. Ewald, 198a. - The flock of this priest consisted of nothing but &#1510;&#1488;&#1503;, i.e., sheep and goats (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-1.htm">Exodus 3:1</a>). Even now there are no oxen reared upon the peninsula of Sinai, as there is not sufficient pasturage or water to be found. For the same reason there are no horses kept there, but only camels and asses (cf. Seetzen, R. iii. 100; Wellsted, R. in Arab. ii. p. 66). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/2-18.htm">Exodus 2:18</a> the priest is called Reguel, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-1.htm">Exodus 3:1</a> Jethro. This title, "the priest of Midian," shows that he was the spiritual head of the branch of the Midianites located there, but hardly that he was the prince or temporal head as well, like Melchizedek, as the Targumists have indicated by &#1512;&#1489;&#1488;, and as Artapanus and the poet Ezekiel distinctly affirm. The other shepherds would hardly have treated the daughters of the Emir in the manner described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/2-17.htm">Exodus 2:17</a>. The name &#1512;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1500; (Reguel, friend of God) indicates that this priest served the old Semitic God El (&#1488;&#1500;). This Reguel, who gave his daughter Zipporah to Moses, was unquestionably the same person as Jethro (&#1497;&#1514;&#1512;&#1493;) the &#1495;&#1514;&#1503; of Moses and priest of Midian (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-1.htm">Exodus 3:1</a>). Now, as Reguel's son Chobab is called Moses' &#1495;&#1514;&#1503; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/10-29.htm">Numbers 10:29</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-11.htm">Judges 4:11</a>), the Targumists and others supposed Reguel to be the grandfather of Zipporah, in which case &#1488;&#1489; would mean the grandfather in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/2-18.htm">Exodus 2:18</a>, and &#1489;&#1468;&#1514; the granddaughter in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/2-21.htm">Exodus 2:21</a>. This hypothesis would undoubtedly be admissible, if it were probable on other grounds. But as a comparison of <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/10-29.htm">Numbers 10:29</a> with <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/18.htm">Exodus 18</a> does not necessarily prove that Chobab and Jethro were the same persons, whilst <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/18-27.htm">Exodus 18:27</a> seems to lead to the very opposite conclusion, and &#1492;&#1514;&#1503;, like the Greek &#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;, may be used for both father-in-law and brother-in-law, it would probably be more correct to regard Chobab as Moses' brother-in-law, Reguel as the proper name of his father-in-law, and Jethro, for which Jether (praestantia) is substituted in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/4-18.htm">Exodus 4:18</a>, as either a title, or the surname which showed the rank of Reguel in his tribe, like the Arabic Imam, i.e., praepositus, spec. sacrorum antistes. Ranke's opinion, that Jethro and Chobab were both of them sons of Reguel and brothers-in-law of Moses, is obviously untenable, if only on the ground that according to the analogy of <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/10-29.htm">Numbers 10:29</a> the epithet "son of Reguel" would not be omitted in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-1.htm">Exodus 3:1</a>. </body></html>
