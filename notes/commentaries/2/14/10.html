The entire armed force of Egypt is reckoned by Herodotus (2:166-168) at 410,000, and it is tolerably clear that not one-half of these could have been mustered. It would imply, indeed, more facility of mobilisation than we should have expected in this early age, if Pharaoh was able to bring 100,000 men into the field upon a sudden emergency. Why, then, it is asked, should the Israelites have been “sore afraid” of a force but one-sixth of their number? Were they “arrant cowards?” The answer is that the Egyptian army, whatever its number, was composed of trained soldiers, well-armed and used to war; the 600,000 Israelites were, in the main, unarmed, ignorant of warfare, and trained very imperfectly. Above a million Persian <span class= "ital">soldiers</span> were defeated and slaughtered like sheep by 47,000 Graeco-Macedonians at Arbela. A similar result would, humanly speaking, have followed on a conflict between the Israelites and the Egyptians at Pi-hahiroth. The fear of the former was therefore perfectly legitimate.<p><span class= "bld">The children of Israel cried out unto the Lord.</span>—If Israel had been unduly timid—which we have shown not to have been the case—at any rate they knew where to make their appeal for succour.

We may be in the way of duty, following God, and hastening toward heaven, yet may be troubled on every side. Some cried out unto the Lord; their fear led them to pray, and that was well. God brings us into straits, that he may bring us to our knees. Others cried out against Moses; fear set them murmuring as if God were not still able to work miracles. They quarrel with Moses for bringing them out of Egypt; and so were angry with God for the greatest kindness ever done them; thus gross are the absurdities of unbelief. Moses says, Fear ye not. It is always our duty and interest, when we cannot get out of troubles, yet to get above our fears; let them quicken our prayers and endeavours, but not silence our faith and hope. Stand still, think not to save yourselves either by fighting or flying; wait God's orders, and observe them. Compose yourselves, by confidence in God, into peaceful thoughts of the great salvation God is about to work for you. If God brings his people into straits, he will find a way to bring them out.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And his horsemen - See <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-5.htm">Exodus 14:5</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/exodus/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes&#8212;The great consternation of the Israelites is somewhat astonishing, considering their vast superiority in numbers, but their deep dismay and absolute despair at the sight of this armed host receives a satisfactory explanation from the fact that the civilized state of Egyptian society required the absence of all arms, except when they were on service. If the Israelites were entirely unarmed at their departure, they could not think of making any resistance [Wilkinson and Hengstenberg].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/exodus/14.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Which is not strange; these being now a people of low spirits, depressed by long and grievous servitude; being also generally unarmed, wearied with their journey, and their fears aggravated by the presence and outcries of their wives and children.

It has been argued that the Israelites, if they were so numerous as stated (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-37.htm">Exodus 12:37</a>), must have been wretched cowards, if they were afraid to risk an engagement with such an army as that hastily levied one which Pharaoh had brought with him. But the difference between an army of trained soldiers, thoroughly equipped for war, with helmets, shields, breastplates, swords and spears, and an undisciplined multitude, unarmed for the most part, and wholly unaccustomed to warfare, is such, that the latter, whatever its numbers, may be excused if it does not feel able to cope with the former, and declines an engagement. Numbers, without military training and discipline, are of no avail - nay, are even a disadvantage, since the men impede one another. It is not necessary to suppose that the Israelites were debased in character by their long servitude to account for their panic on seeing the army of Pharaoh. They had good grounds for their fear. Humanly speaking, resistance would simply have led to their indiscriminate massacre. The alarm of the Hebrews, and even the reproaches with which they assail Moses, are thus quite natural under the circumstances. What is surprising is, the noble courage and confidence of Moses. Moses, though only vaguely informed, that God would "be honoured upon Pharaoh and all his host" (ver. 4), is perfectly certain that all will go well - how the result will be achieved, he knows not; but he is sure that Israel will be delivered and Egypt discomfited; his people have no reason to fear - they have but to "stand still and see the salvation of God" (ver. 13); "the Lord will fight for them;" they will have simply to "hold their peace" (ver. 14). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They were sore afraid</span>. Before the Israelites are taxed with cowardice, let it be considered - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> That they were unarmed. Egypt was so settled a government that civilians generally went unarmed; and slaves, like the Hebrews, would scarcely have been allowed to possess any arms, if the case had been otherwise. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> They had no military training. Whatever had been done to teach them order and arrangement in connection with their proposed journey, we may be sure there had been no drill or training in the use of arms, since this would have been regarded by the Egyptians as open rebellion. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> They were quite unaccustomed to warfare. The Pharaohs main-rained large garrisons of Egyptian and mercenary troops in the frontier provinces, to resist the invasions to which they were liable. The Hebrews may have had occasionally to defend themselves against a hasty raid: but in real war they had stood aloof, and left the fighting to the regular Egyptian army. <span class="cmt_word">The children of Israel cried out unto the Lord</span>. The appeal to Jehovah showed that, with all their weaknesses and imperfections, the Israelites were yet true at heart. They knew where alone help was to be obtained, and made their appeal accordingly. No cry is more sure of an answer than the despairing one - "Lord, save us; we perish." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/exodus/14.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When it was announced that Israel had fled, "the heart of Pharaoh and his servants turned against the people," and they repented that they had let them go. When and whence the information came, we are not told. The common opinion, that it was brought after the Israelites changed their route, has no foundation in the text. For the change in Pharaoh's feelings towards the Israelites, and his regret that he had let them go, were caused not by their supposed mistake, but by their flight. Now the king and his servants regarded the exodus as a flight, as soon as they recovered from the panic caused by the death of the first-born, and began to consider the consequences of the permission given to the people to leave his service. This may have occurred as early as the second day after the exodus. In that case, Pharaoh would have had time to collect chariots and horsemen, and overtake the Israelites at Hachiroth, as they could easily perform the same journey in two days, or one day and a half, to which the Israelites had taken more than three. "He yoked his chariot (had it yoked, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-14.htm">1 Kings 6:14</a>), and took his people (i.e., his warriors) with him," viz., "six hundred chosen war chariots (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-7.htm">Exodus 14:7</a>), and all the chariots of Egypt" (sc., that he could get together in the time), and "royal guards upon them all." &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501;, &#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, tristatae qui et terni statores vocantur, nomen est secundi gradus post regiam dignitatem (Jerome on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-23.htm">Ezekiel 23:23</a>), not charioteers (see my Com. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-22.htm">1 Kings 9:22</a>). According to <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/14-9.htm">Exodus 14:9</a>, the army raised by Pharaoh consisted of chariot horses (&#1512;&#1499;&#1489; &#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;), riding horses (&#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501;, lit., runners, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-6.htm">1 Kings 5:6</a>), and &#1495;&#1497;&#1500;, the men belonging to them. War chariots and cavalry were always the leading force of the Egyptians (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/31-1.htm">Isaiah 31:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-9.htm">Isaiah 36:9</a>). Three times (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/14-4.htm">Exodus 14:4</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/14-8.htm">Exodus 14:8</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-17.htm">Exodus 14:17</a>) it is stated that Jehovah hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he pursued the Israelites, to show that God had decreed this hardening, to glorify Himself in the judgment and death of the proud king, who would not honour God, the Holy One, in his life. "And the children of Israel were going out with a high hand:" <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-8.htm">Exodus 14:8</a>. is a conditional clause in the sense of, "although they went out" (Ewald, 341). &#1512;&#1502;&#1492; &#1497;&#1491;, the high hand, is the high hand of Jehovah with the might which it displayed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-11.htm">Isaiah 26:11</a>), not the armed hand of the Israelites. This is the meaning also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/33-3.htm">Numbers 33:3</a>; it is different in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/15-30.htm">Numbers 15:30</a>. The very fact that Pharaoh did not discern the lifting up of Jehovah's hand in the exodus of Israel displayed the hardening of his heart. "Beside Pihachiroth:" see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-2.htm">Exodus 14:2</a>. </body></html>
