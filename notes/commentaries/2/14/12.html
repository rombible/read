We may be in the way of duty, following God, and hastening toward heaven, yet may be troubled on every side. Some cried out unto the Lord; their fear led them to pray, and that was well. God brings us into straits, that he may bring us to our knees. Others cried out against Moses; fear set them murmuring as if God were not still able to work miracles. They quarrel with Moses for bringing them out of Egypt; and so were angry with God for the greatest kindness ever done them; thus gross are the absurdities of unbelief. Moses says, Fear ye not. It is always our duty and interest, when we cannot get out of troubles, yet to get above our fears; let them quicken our prayers and endeavours, but not silence our faith and hope. Stand still, think not to save yourselves either by fighting or flying; wait God's orders, and observe them. Compose yourselves, by confidence in God, into peaceful thoughts of the great salvation God is about to work for you. If God brings his people into straits, he will find a way to bring them out.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Let us alone - This is a gross exaggeration, yet not without a semblance of truth: for although the Israelites welcomed the message of Moses at first, they gave way completely at the first serious trial.

If the Israelites were entirely unarmed at their departure, they could not think of making any resistance [Wilkinson and Hengstenberg].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/exodus/14.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/exodus/14.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Is not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt,....

They even declare that while they were still in Egypt they had been unfavourable to Moses’ plan. This is not mentioned before: in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-31.htm" title="And the people believed: and when they heard that the LORD had visited the children of Israel, and that he had looked on their affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshipped.">Exodus 4:31</a> they listen to Moses gladly; at most, they had blamed Moses when they found increased labour imposed upon them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/5-21.htm" title="And they said to them, The LORD look on you, and judge; because you have made our smell to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to slay us.">Exodus 5:21</a>).

It was not true that they had uniformly held the same language, and desired Moses and Aaron to cease their efforts. It had been better for us to serve the Egyptians than that we should die. The spirit to prefer death to slavery, where they are the only alternatives, is not a common one; and we must not be surprised that a people which had grown up in servitude and had no traditions of national independence did not rise to the heroic height attained under other circumstances by Greeks, by Switzers. and by Poles. It would have been most extraordinary had they done so. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/exodus/14.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When it was announced that Israel had fled, "the heart of Pharaoh and his servants turned against the people," and they repented that they had let them go. When and whence the information came, we are not told. The common opinion, that it was brought after the Israelites changed their route, has no foundation in the text. For the change in Pharaoh's feelings towards the Israelites, and his regret that he had let them go, were caused not by their supposed mistake, but by their flight. Now the king and his servants regarded the exodus as a flight, as soon as they recovered from the panic caused by the death of the first-born, and began to consider the consequences of the permission given to the people to leave his service. This may have occurred as early as the second day after the exodus. In that case, Pharaoh would have had time to collect chariots and horsemen, and overtake the Israelites at Hachiroth, as they could easily perform the same journey in two days, or one day and a half, to which the Israelites had taken more than three. "He yoked his chariot (had it yoked, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-14.htm">1 Kings 6:14</a>), and took his people (i.e., his warriors) with him," viz., "six hundred chosen war chariots (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-7.htm">Exodus 14:7</a>), and all the chariots of Egypt" (sc., that he could get together in the time), and "royal guards upon them all." &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501;, &#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, tristatae qui et terni statores vocantur, nomen est secundi gradus post regiam dignitatem (Jerome on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-23.htm">Ezekiel 23:23</a>), not charioteers (see my Com. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-22.htm">1 Kings 9:22</a>). According to <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/14-9.htm">Exodus 14:9</a>, the army raised by Pharaoh consisted of chariot horses (&#1512;&#1499;&#1489; &#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;), riding horses (&#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501;, lit., runners, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-6.htm">1 Kings 5:6</a>), and &#1495;&#1497;&#1500;, the men belonging to them. War chariots and cavalry were always the leading force of the Egyptians (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/31-1.htm">Isaiah 31:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-9.htm">Isaiah 36:9</a>). Three times (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/14-4.htm">Exodus 14:4</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/14-8.htm">Exodus 14:8</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-17.htm">Exodus 14:17</a>) it is stated that Jehovah hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he pursued the Israelites, to show that God had decreed this hardening, to glorify Himself in the judgment and death of the proud king, who would not honour God, the Holy One, in his life. "And the children of Israel were going out with a high hand:" <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-8.htm">Exodus 14:8</a>. is a conditional clause in the sense of, "although they went out" (Ewald, 341). &#1512;&#1502;&#1492; &#1497;&#1491;, the high hand, is the high hand of Jehovah with the might which it displayed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-11.htm">Isaiah 26:11</a>), not the armed hand of the Israelites. This is the meaning also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/33-3.htm">Numbers 33:3</a>; it is different in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/15-30.htm">Numbers 15:30</a>. The very fact that Pharaoh did not discern the lifting up of Jehovah's hand in the exodus of Israel displayed the hardening of his heart. "Beside Pihachiroth:" see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-2.htm">Exodus 14:2</a>. </body></html>
