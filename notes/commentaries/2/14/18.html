The pillar of cloud and fire came behind them, where they needed a guard, and it was a wall between them and their enemies. The word and providence of God have a black and dark side toward sin and sinners, but a bright and pleasant side toward the people of the Lord. He, who divided between light and darkness, Ge 1:4, allotted darkness to the Egyptians, and light to the Israelites. Such a difference there will be between the inheritance of the saints in light, and that utter darkness which will be the portion of hypocrites for ever.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Wherefore criest thou unto me? - Moses does not speak of his intercession, and we only know of it from this answer to his prayer. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/exodus/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15-18. the Lord said unto Moses, Wherefore criest thou unto me? &c.&#8212;When in answer to his prayers, he received the divine command to go forward, he no longer doubted by what kind of miracle the salvation of his mighty charge was to be effected.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/exodus/14.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/exodus/14.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord,....

All Egypt would learn the destruction of the host, and the circumstances under which it occurred, whose miraculous nature could not be concealed. And the consequence would be a wide recognition of the superior might of Jehovah, the God of Israel, over that of any of the Egyptian deities. More than this the Egyptians were not likely to admit under any circumstances. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 14:19-22 <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/exodus/14.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When the Israelites saw the advancing army of the Egyptians, they were greatly alarmed; for their situation to human eyes was a very unfortunate one. Shut in on the east by the sea, on the south and west by high mountains, and with the army of the Egyptians behind them, destruction seemed inevitable, since they were neither outwardly armed nor inwardly prepared for a successful battle. Although they cried unto the Lord, they had no confidence in His help, notwithstanding all the previous manifestation so the fidelity of the true God; they therefore gave vent to the despair of their natural heart in complaints against Moses, who had brought them out of the servitude of Egypt to give them up to die in the desert. "Hast thou, because there were no graves at all (&#1488;&#1497;&#1503; &#1502;&#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;, a double negation to give emphasis) in Egypt, fetched us to die in the desert?" Their further words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-12.htm">Exodus 14:12</a> exaggerated the true state of the case from cowardly despair. For it was only when the oppression increased, after Moses' first interview with Pharaoh, that they complained of what Moses had done (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/5-21.htm">Exodus 5:21</a>), whereas at first they accepted his proposals most thankfully (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-31.htm">Exodus 4:31</a>), and even afterwards implicitly obeyed his directions. </body></html>
