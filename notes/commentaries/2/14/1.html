But God says, I will be honoured upon Pharaoh. All men being made for the honour of their Maker, those whom he is not honoured by, he will be honoured upon. What seems to tend to the church's ruin, is often overruled to the ruin of the church's enemies. While Pharaoh gratified his malice and revenge, he furthered the bringing to pass God's counsels concerning him. Though with the greatest reason he had let Israel go, yet now he was angry with himself for it. God makes the envy and rage of men against his people, a torment to themselves. Those who set their faces heavenward, and will live godly in Christ Jesus, must expect to be set upon by Satan's temptations and terrors. He will not tamely part with any out of his service.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Pillar of cloud - The Lord Himself did for the Israelites by preternatural means that which armies were obliged to do for themselves by natural agents.

Hitherto the march of the Israelites had been to the south-east. Another day's journey in this direction would have taken them beyond the limits of Egypt, into the desert region east of the Bitter Lakes, which was dry, treeless, and waterless. In this tract there would have been but scant nourishment for their flocks and herds, and absolutely no water for themselves, unless it had been obtained by miracle. God therefore changed the direction of their route from south-east to due south, and made them take a course by which they placed the Bitter Lakes on their left hand, and so remained within the limits of Egypt, in a district fairly well watered, but shut off from the wilderness by the Bitter Lakes and the northern prolongation of the Gulf of Suez, with which they were connected. This route suited the immediate convenience of the host; and, having no suspicion of any hostile movement on the part of the Egyptians, they  - not unnaturally - made no objection to it. It had, however, the disadvantage, in case of a hostile movement, of shutting them in between their assailants on the one hand, and the sea upon the other; and this circumstance seems to have led Pharaoh to make his pursuit. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/exodus/13.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Journey from Succoth to Etham. - Succoth, Israel's first place of encampment after their departure, was probably the rendezvous for the whole nation, so that it was from this point that they first proceeded in an orderly march. The shortest and most direct route from Egypt to Canaan would have been by the road to Gaza, in the land of the Philistines; but God did not lead them by this road, lest they should repent of their movement as soon as the Philistines opposed them, and so desire to return to Egypt, &#1508;&#1468;&#1503;: &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#769;, after &#1488;&#1502;&#1512; to say (to himself), i.e., to think, with the subordinate idea of anxiety. The Philistines were very warlike, and would hardly have failed to resist the entrance of the Israelites into Canaan, of which they had taken possession of a very large portion. But the Israelites were not prepared for such a conflict, as is sufficiently evident from their despair, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-10.htm">Exodus 14:10</a>. For this reason God made them turn round (&#1497;&#1505;&#1468;&#1489; for &#1497;&#1505;&#1489;, see Ges. 67) by the way of the desert of the Red Sea. Previous to the account of their onward march, it is still further stated in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/13-18.htm">Exodus 13:18</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/13-19.htm">Exodus 13:19</a>, that they went out equipped, and took Joseph's bones with them, according to his last request. &#1495;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501;, from &#1495;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473; lumbus, lit., lumbis accincti, signifies equipped, as a comparison of this word as it is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/1-14.htm">Joshua 1:14</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/4-12.htm">Joshua 4:12</a>, with &#1495;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1510;&#1497;&#1501; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/32-30.htm">Numbers 32:30</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-32.htm">Numbers 32:32</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-18.htm">Deuteronomy 3:18</a>, places beyond all doubt; that is to say, not "armed," &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; (Sym.), but prepared for the march, as contrasted with fleeing in disorder like fugitives. For this reason they were able to fulfil Joseph's request, from which fact Calvin draws the following conclusion: "In the midst of their adversity the people had never lost sight of the promised redemption. For unless the celebrated adjuration of Joseph had been a subject of common conversation among them all, Moses would never have thought of it." </body></html>
