If the “shekel of the sanctuary” weighed, as is generally supposed, about 220 grains troy, the value of the silver contributed would have been £40,000, or a little under. It was contributed by “them that were numbered of the congregation,” each of whom paid a bekah, or half a shekel. (See above, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/30-12.htm" title="When you take the sum of the children of Israel after their number, then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul to the LORD, when you number them; that there be no plague among them, when you number them.">Exodus 30:12-16</a>.)<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/38.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>38:21-31 The foundation of massy pieces of silver showed the solidity and purity of the truth upon which the church is founded. Let us regard the Lord Jesus Christ while reading of the furniture of the tabernacle. While looking at the altar of burnt-offering, let us see Jesus. In him, his righteousness, and salvation, is a full and sufficient offering for sin. In the laver of regeneration, by his Holy Spirit, let our souls be washed, and they shall be clean; and as the people offered willingly, so may our souls be made willing. Let us be ready to part with any thing, and count all but loss to win Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/38.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Of the holy place - Rather, of the sanctuary.

The shekel of the sanctuary (or, the holy shekel) would seem to denote no more than an exact shekel, "after the king's weight" <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-26.htm">2 Samuel 14:26</a>, "current money with the merchant" <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/23-16.htm">Genesis 23:16</a>.<p>In the reign of Joash, a collection similar to that here mentioned, apparently at the same rate of capitation, was made for the repairs of the temple <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-9.htm">2 Chronicles 24:9</a>. The tax of later times, called didrachma, &#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;  state&#772;r, <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/17-27.htm">Matthew 17:27</a>, was not, like this and that of Joash, a collection for a special occasion, but a yearly tax, for the support of the temple, of a whole shekel. See also <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-13.htm">Exodus 30:13</a>.<p>The talent contained 3,000 shekels, as may be gathered from <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/38-25.htm">Exodus 38:25-26</a>. According to the computation here adopted, the Hebrew talent was 94 2/7 lbs. avoirdupois. The Greek (Aeginetan) talent, from which the Septuagint and most succeeding versions have taken the name "talent," was 82 1/4 lbs. The original Hebrew word, &#1499;&#1499;&#1512;  k&#305;&#770;ka&#772;r, would denote a circular mass, and nearly the same word, kerker, was in use among the Egyptians for a mass of metal cast in the form of a massive ring with its weight stamped upon it. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/exodus/38.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>25. the silver of them that were numbered&#8212;603,550 men at half a shekel each would contribute 301,775 shekels; which at 2s. 4d. each, amounts to &pound;35,207 sterling. It may seem difficult to imagine how the Israelites should be possessed of so much wealth in the desert; but it should be remembered that they were enriched first by the spoils of the Egyptians, and afterwards by those of the Amalekites. Besides, it is highly probable that during their sojourn they traded with the neighboring nations who bordered on the wilderness [Hewlett].   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/exodus/38.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/exodus/38.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the silver of them that were numbered of the congregation,....

The silver seems to have amounted to about four times the weight of the gold; but the value of it was very much less, not exceeding &pound;40,000 of our money (Cook). It may seem surprising that this should have been so; but there are grounds for believing that both in Africa and in Asia gold was more plentiful than silver in the early ages. And it is certainly much more suitable for ornaments. <span class="cmt_word">Of them that were numbered</span>. See above, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-12.htm">Exodus 30:12-16</a>.
