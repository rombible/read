These miracles especially referred to the miracles of the Lord Jesus Christ.

In reference to what Jehovah had declared to him in the latter end of the preceding chapter: <p>but, behold, they will not believe me, nor hearken to my voice; this seems to contradict what God had said to him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-18.htm">Exodus 3:18</a> that they would hearken to his voice; but it can hardly be thought, that so good a man, and so great a prophet as Moses was, would directly fly in the face of God, and expressly contradict what he had said. To reconcile this it may be observed, that what the Lord says respects only the elders of Israel, this all the people; or Jehovah's meaning may be, and so this of Moses, that neither the one nor the other would regard his bare word, without some sign or miracle being wrought; for as his call was extraordinary, so it required something extraordinary to be done that it might be credited: <p>for they will say, the Lord hath not appeared unto me: in the bush, as he would affirm he did, and might do it with the greatest assurance; yet the thing being so marvellous, and they not eyewitnesses of it, might distrust the truth of it, or be backward to receive it on his bare word; and this Moses might rather fear would be the case, from the experience he had had of them forty years ago, when it was more likely for him to have been a deliverer of them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/exodus/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And Moses answered and said, <span class="cverse3">{a</i> But, behold, they will not believe me, nor hearken unto my voice: for they will say, The LORD hath not appeared unto thee.</span><p>(a) God bears with Moses doubting, because he was not completely without faith.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/exodus/4.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">1</span>. <span class="ital">they</span> (twice)] not the Egyptians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-22.htm" title="But every woman shall borrow of her neighbor, and of her that sojournes in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment: and you shall put them on your sons, and on your daughters; and you shall spoil the Egyptians.">Exodus 3:22</a>), but the Israelites, as <span class="ital">v.</span> 30 shews.

God had promised that he would succeed; but he did not see how he could succeed, either with the people or with Pharaoh. It was not enough for him that God had declared, "They (the people) shall hearken unto thy voice" (<span class="accented">ib.</span> 18); he does not, cannot believe this, and replies: "Behold, they will not believe, neither hearken unto my voice" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-1.htm">Exodus 4:1</a>). This was plain want of faith; but not unnatural, and not, in God's sight, inexcusable. God therefore condescended to the human weakness of his servant, and proceeded to show him how he intended that he should persuade the people of his mission. He should persuade them by producing the credentials of miracles (vers. 2-9). But the laggard heart finds yet a further objection. Moses feels that he labours under a personal defect, which (he thinks) is an absolute disqualification. He is "slow of speech and of a slow tongue" (ver. 10), has always been wanting in eloquence, and does not find himself any the more eloquent since God has been speaking with him. In vain does Jehovah promise to "be with his mouth" (ver. 12); Moses' last word indicates all the old feeling of self-distrust. "Send, I pray thee, by the hand of him whom thou wilt send" (ver. 13). Then at last the anger of the Lord is kindled against Moses, and God inflicts on him a sort of punishment - degrades him; as it were  - deposes him from the position of sole leader, and associates Aaron with him in such sort that Aaron must have appeared, both to the Israelites and to the Pharaoh, as the chief leader rather than Moses. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-30.htm">Exodus 4:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-2.htm">Exodus 7:2, 10, 19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-6.htm">Exodus 8:6, 17</a>, etc.) At this point the interview between Moses and Jehovah ends, and the action of the Exodus commences. Moses obtains leave to quit Midian, and quits it - retires to Egypt, after escaping from a dangerous sickness on the way (vers. 24-26), is met by Aaron and takes him into his counsels, summons the elders and exhibits before them his miraculous powers, persuades them, and is finally accepted as having, with Aaron, a mission from God, both by the elders and the people. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, they will not believe</span>. Attempts have been made to soften down this contradiction of God's words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-18.htm">Exodus 3:18</a>, and to represent Moses as merely saying, "What if the people will not hearken, etc. What shall I do then?" (So the LXX., Geddes, Boothroyd, and others.) But the phrase is really emphatic and peremptory. As Rosenmuller says: "Vox est negantis et detrac-tantis officium." <span class="cmt_word">The Lord hath not appeared to thee</span>. It is quite probable that the Israelites would have so spoken, if Moses had had no sign to show. There had been no appearance of Jehovah to anyone for above four hundred years. And the Israelites, who had not seen Moses for forty years, would not know whether he was a veracious person or not. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/exodus/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>With the command, "Go and gather the elders of Israel together," God then gave Moses further instructions with reference to the execution of his mission. On his arrival in Egypt he was first of all to inform the elders, as the representatives of the nation (i.e., the heads of the families, households, and tribes), of the appearance of God to him, and the revelation of His design, to deliver His people out of Egypt and bring them to the land of the Canaanites. He was then to go with them to Pharaoh, and make known to him their resolution, in consequence of this appearance of God, to go a three days' journey into the wilderness and sacrifice to their God. The words, "I have surely visited," point to the fulfilment of the last words of the dying Joseph (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/50-24.htm">Genesis 50:24</a>). &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; &#1504;&#1511;&#1512;&#1492; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-18.htm">Exodus 3:18</a>) does not mean "He is named upon us" (lxx, Onk., Jon.), nor "He has called us" (Vulg., Luth.). The latter is grammatically wrong, for the verb is Niphal, or passive; and though the former has some support in the parallel passage in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/5-3.htm">Exodus 5:3</a>, inasmuch as &#1504;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488; is the verb used there, it is only in appearance, for if the meaning really were "His name is named upon (over) us," the word &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1493; (&#1513;&#1473;&#1501;) would not be omitted (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-10.htm">Deuteronomy 28:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-14.htm">2 Chronicles 7:14</a>). The real meaning is, "He has met with us," from &#1504;&#1511;&#1512;&#1492;, obruam fieri, ordinarily construed with &#1488;&#1500;, but here with &#1506;&#1500;, because God comes down from above to meet with man. The plural us is used, although it was only to Moses that God appeared, because His appearing had reference to the whole nation, which was represented before Pharaoh by Moses and the elders. In the words &#1504;&#1500;&#1499;&#1492;&#1470;&#1504;&#1488;, "we will go, then," equivalent to "let us go," the request for Pharaoh's permission to go out is couched in such a form as to answer to the relation of Israel to Pharaoh. He had no right to detain them, but he had a right to consent to their departure, as his predecessor had formerly done to their settlement. Still less had he any good reason for refusing their request to go a three days' journey into the wilderness and sacrifice to their God, since their return at the close of the festival was then taken for granted. But the purpose of God was, that Israel should not return. Was it the case, then, that the delegates were "to deceive the king," as Knobel affirms! By no means. God knew the hard heart of Pharaoh, and therefore directed that no more should be asked at first than he must either grant, or display the hardness of his heart. Had he consented, God would then have made known to him His whole design, and demanded that His people should be allowed to depart altogether. But when Pharaoh scornfully refused the first and smaller request (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/5.htm">Exodus 5</a>), Moses was instructed to demand the entire departure of Israel from the land (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-10.htm">Exodus 6:10</a>), and to show the omnipotence of the God of the Hebrews before and upon Pharaoh by miracles and heavy judgments (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-8.htm">Hebrews 7:8</a>.). Accordingly, Moses persisted in demanding permission for the people to go and serve their God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-16.htm">Exodus 7:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-1.htm">Exodus 8:1</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/9-1.htm">Exodus 9:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-13.htm">Exodus 9:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-3.htm">Exodus 10:3</a>); and it was not till Pharaoh offered to allow them to sacrifice in the land that Moses replied, "We will go three days' journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to Jehovah our God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-27.htm">Exodus 8:27</a>); but, observe, with this proviso, "as He shall command us," which left, under the circumstances, no hope that they would return. It was an act of mercy to Pharaoh, therefore, on the one hand, that the entire departure of the Israelites was not demanded at the very first audience of Moses and the representatives of the nation; for, had this been demanded, it would have been far more difficult for him to bend his heart in obedience to the divine will, than when the request presented was as trifling as it was reasonable. And if he had rendered obedience to the will of God in the smaller, God would have given him strength to be faithful in the greater. On the other hand, as God foresaw his resistance (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-19.htm">Exodus 3:19</a>), this condescension, which demanded no more than the natural man could have performed, was also to answer the purpose of clearly displaying the justice of God. It was to prove alike to Egyptians and Israelites that Pharaoh was "without excuse," and that his eventual destruction was the well-merited punishment of his obduracy.<p>(Note: "This moderate request was made only at the period of the earlier plagues. It served to put Pharaoh to the proof. God did not come forth with His whole plan and desire at first, that his obduracy might appear so much the more glaring, and find no excuse in the greatness of the requirement. Had Pharaoh granted this request, Israel would not have gone beyond it; but had not God foreseen, what He repeatedly says (compare, for instance, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-18.htm">Exodus 3:18</a>), that he would not comply with it, He would not thus have presented it; He would from the beginning have revealed His whole design. Thus Augustine remarks (Quaest. 13 in Ex.)." Hengstenberg, Diss. on the Pentateuch. vol. ii. p. 427, Ryland's translation. Clark, 1847.)<p>&#1495;&#1494;&#1511;&#1492; &#1489;&#1497;&#1491; &#1493;&#1500;&#1488;, "not even by means of a strong hand;" "except through great power" is not the true rendering, &#1493;&#1500;&#1488; does not mean &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#768;, nisi. What follows, - viz., the statement that God would so smite the Egyptians with miracles that Pharaoh would, after all, let Israel go (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-20.htm">Exodus 3:20</a>), - is not really at variance with this, the only admissible rendering of the words. For the meaning is, that Pharaoh would not be willing to let Israel depart even when he should be smitten by the strong hand of God; but that he would be compelled to do so against his will, would be forced to do so by the plagues that were about to fall upon Egypt. Thus even after the ninth plague it is still stated (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-27.htm">Exodus 10:27</a>), that "Pharaoh would (&#1488;&#1489;&#1492;) not let them go;" and when he had given permission, in consequence of the last plague, and in fact had driven them out (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-31.htm">Exodus 12:31</a>), he speedily repented, and pursued them with his army to bring them back again (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-5.htm">Exodus 14:5</a>.); from which it is clearly to be seen that the strong hand of God had not broken his will, and yet Israel was brought out by the same strong hand of Jehovah. </body></html>
