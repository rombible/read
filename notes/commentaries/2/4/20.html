He must demand a discharge for Israel, Let my son go; not only my servant, whom thou hast no right to detain, but my son.

When Moses is said to have "set them upon" the animal, we need not understand "all of them." Probably Zipporah and her baby rode, while Gershom walked with his father. Though horses were known in Egypt before this, they could not be used in the Sinaitic peninsula, and the employment of an ass by Moses is thoroughly appropriate. <span class="cmt_word">Returned</span>. <span class="accented">I.e.</span> "set out to return." <span class="cmt_word">Took the rod of God in his hand</span>.

He is already coming to meet thee, and is glad to see thee. The statement in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/4-27.htm">Exodus 4:27</a>, where Jehovah directs Aaron to go and meet Moses, is not at variance with this. They can both be reconciled in the following simple manner: "As soon as Aaron heard that his brother had left Midian, he went to meet him of his own accord, and then God showed him by what road he must go to find him, viz., towards the desert" (R. Mose ben Nachman). - "Put the words" (sc., which I have told thee) "into his mouth;" and I will support both thee and him in speaking. "He will be mouth to thee, and thou shalt be God to him." Cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/7-1.htm">Exodus 7:1</a>, "Thy brother Aaron shall be thy prophet." Aaron would stand in the same relation to Moses, as a prophet to God: the prophet only spoke what God inspired him with, and Moses should be the inspiring God to him. The Targum softens down the word "God" into "master, teacher." Moses was called God, as being the possessor and medium of the divine word. As Luther explains it, "Whoever possesses and believes the word of God, possesses the Spirit and power of God, and also the divine wisdom, truth, heart, mind, and everything that belongs to God." In <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/4-17.htm">Exodus 4:17</a>, the plural "signs" points to the penal wonders that followed; for only one of the three signs given to Moses was performed with the rod.</body></html>
