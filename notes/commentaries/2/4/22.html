Pharaoh had hardened his own heart against the groans and cries of the oppressed Israelites; and now God, in the way of righteous judgment, hardens his heart against the teaching of the miracles, and the terror of the plagues. But whether Pharaoh will hear, or whether he will forbear, Moses must tell him, Thus saith the Lord. He must demand a discharge for Israel, Let my son go; not only my servant, whom thou hast no right to detain, but my son. It is my son that serves me, and therefore must be spared, must be pleaded for. In case of refusal I will slay thy son, even thy first-born.

None of these expressions occurs elsewhere in the Pent. The first is a formula used constantly by the prophets (e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-4.htm" title="Now therefore thus said the LORD, You shall not come down from that bed on which you are gone up, but shall surely die.

The idea of a nation or an individual being descended from a divine ancestor was common in antiquity (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-29.htm" title="Woe to you, Moab! you are undone, O people of Chemosh: he has given his sons that escaped, and his daughters, into captivity to Sihon king of the Amorites.">Numbers 21:29</a>, where the Moabites are called the ‘sons and daughters of Chĕmôsh’): but in such cases the relation was conceived as a physical one; in Israel the idea was <span class="ital">spiritualized</span>, and, in virtue of Jehovah’s ethical and spiritual character, made the expression of moral and spiritual relations.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">22–23</span>. The substance of the demand which Moses is to make of the Pharaoh, formulated with special reference to the final and severest plague, the 10th: Israel is Jehovah’s firstborn; if Pharaoh does not let Israel go, his own firstborn will be slain. The situation implied by these verses (‘have said,’ ‘hast refused’) is <span class="ital">between</span> the first nine plagues and the 10th; and so it has been conjectured, especially as this message to Pharaoh is never in the sequel actually given to him, that they originally stood before <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-28.htm" title="And Pharaoh said to him, Get you from me, take heed to yourself, see my face no more; for in that day you see my face you shall die.">Exodus 10:28</a> (or <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/11-4.htm" title="And Moses said, Thus said the LORD, About midnight will I go out into the middle of Egypt:">Exodus 11:4</a>), as J’s introduction to the 10th plague, and were removed here by the compiler, as an indication of the gist and purpose of the whole series of plagues.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, Israel is my son</span>. This would be addressing Pharaoh in language familiar to him. Each Egyptian monarch of this period was accustomed to style himself, "son of the Sun," and to claim and expect the constant favour and protection of his divine parent. It was also quite within the range of Egyptian ideas that God should declare himself by word of mouth to his special favourites, and give directions as to their actions. (See 'Records of the Past,' vol. 4. p. 43.) <span class="cmt_word">My firstborn</span>. Not only "as dear to me as to a father his firstborn" (Kalisch), but the only nation that I have adopted, and taken into covenant, so as to be unto me "a peculiar people above all the nations that are upon the earth" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-2.htm">Deuteronomy 14:2</a>). Israel's sonship is here mentioned for the first time. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/exodus/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>And Aaron is quite ready to do so. He is already coming to meet thee, and is glad to see thee. The statement in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/4-27.htm">Exodus 4:27</a>, where Jehovah directs Aaron to go and meet Moses, is not at variance with this. They can both be reconciled in the following simple manner: "As soon as Aaron heard that his brother had left Midian, he went to meet him of his own accord, and then God showed him by what road he must go to find him, viz., towards the desert" (R. Mose ben Nachman). - "Put the words" (sc., which I have told thee) "into his mouth;" and I will support both thee and him in speaking. "He will be mouth to thee, and thou shalt be God to him." Cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/7-1.htm">Exodus 7:1</a>, "Thy brother Aaron shall be thy prophet." Aaron would stand in the same relation to Moses, as a prophet to God: the prophet only spoke what God inspired him with, and Moses should be the inspiring God to him. The Targum softens down the word "God" into "master, teacher." Moses was called God, as being the possessor and medium of the divine word. As Luther explains it, "Whoever possesses and believes the word of God, possesses the Spirit and power of God, and also the divine wisdom, truth, heart, mind, and everything that belongs to God." In <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/4-17.htm">Exodus 4:17</a>, the plural "signs" points to the penal wonders that followed; for only one of the three signs given to Moses was performed with the rod.</body></html>
