The Lord threatened him with death or sent sickness upon him, as the punishment of his having neglected to circumcise his son. When God discovers to us what is amiss in our lives, we must give all diligence to amend it speedily. This is the voice of every rod; it calls us to return to Him that smites us. God sent Aaron to meet Moses. The more they saw of God's bringing them together, the more pleasant their interview was. The elders of Israel met them in faith, and were ready to obey them. It often happens, that less difficulty is found than was expected, in such undertakings as are according to the will of God, and for his glory. Let us but arise and try at our proper work, the Lord will be with us and prosper us. If Israel welcomed the tidings of their deliverance, and worshipped the Lord, how should we welcome the glad tidings of redemption, embrace it in faith, and adore the Redeemer!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>So he let him go - i. e.

Only this doth more provoke her than it seems the other did, because she was forced to do this speedily, and with her own hands, and that to a tender infant; whereas the elder peradventure was circumcised when he was more grown and strong, and able to bear the pain. Let none think it strange that Zipporah should quarrel so much at circumcision, because the Midianites were descended from Abraham, and therefore were circumcised. For if they were so, it was done when they were grown up, about the thirteenth year of their age, from the example of Ishmael, who was circumcised at that age. But indeed it is more likely that those people, being cast out of God’s covenant, as to the benefit of it, would, and did in a little time, throw off the sign of it, as having much more of pain and danger in it, than of use and privilege. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/exodus/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>So he let him go,.... That is, the Lord let Moses go; suffered him to go on his journey without any further interruption; as the Targums, "it", the angel, ceased from him, or left him; or the disease and trembling departed from him, as Aben Ezra, and he was quite well and easy; though Grotius, after Lyra, understands it of Zipporah, she departed from him, that is, from Moses, and returned to Midian again, as it seems she did; but this the grammatical construction of the words will not bear, being masculine, though sometimes the masculine is used of women, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/1-21.htm">Exodus 1:21</a>, <p>then she said, a bloody husband thou art because of the circumcision; this is repeated, partly to give the reason of her calling him a bloody husband, because of the circumcision, and partly because of her great joy on occasion of her husband's restoration to her by this means. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/exodus/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">So he let him go: then she said, A bloody husband thou art, because of the circumcision.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/exodus/4.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">26</span>. <span class="ital">let him alone</span>] Heb. <span class="ital">relaxed from him</span>: cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-37.htm" title="And she said to her father, Let this thing be done for me: let me alone two months, that I may go up and down on the mountains, and mourn my virginity, I and my fellows.">Jdg 11:37</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-14.htm" title="Let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under heaven: and I will make of you a nation mightier and greater than they.">Deuteronomy 9:14</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Then she said</span> (viz. when she spoke the words given in <span class="ital">v.</span> 25b), ‘<span class="bld"><span class="ital">A</span> blood-bridegroom,’ with regard to</span> <span class="ital">circumcisions</span>] The last word is <span class="ital">plural</span> in the Heb. ‘Blood-bridegroom’ was apparently a current expression: and the passage seems to attribute to Zipporah the new sense of it explained in the last note but one.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It seems that in this narrative an archaic stage in the history of circumcision is referred to, which is not elsewhere mentioned in the OT. Circumcision is a rite which has been, and still is, largely practised in the world: among the Hebrews (besides its religious associations) its distinctive feature was that it was performed in <span class="ital">infancy</span>. Among the Arabs it is performed upon boys of ages varying, in different places, from 3 to 15; but in many parts of the world it is performed upon youths at the approach of puberty. A practice so widely diffused must rest upon some common principle: and the idea which appears generally to underlie circumcision is that it is a rite of <span class="ital">initiation into manhood</span>; a youth, till he has been circumcised, is not reckoned a full member of the tribe, or (as in Australia, for instance) allowed to marry. Now the fact that the Heb. word for ‘father-in-law’ (<span class="ital">ḥôthçn</span>) is derived from a root which in Arabic signifies to <span class="ital">circumcise</span>, seems to shew that it meant originally <span class="ital">circumciser</span>, and to indicate that in primitive times circumcision was among the Hebrews, as among the other nations just referred to, a general preliminary to marriage, which it was the duty of the future father-in-law to see enforced. These facts throw light upon the present narrative. The reason why Moses had incurred Jehovah’s wrath was because he was not a ‘blood-bridegroom,’ i.e. because he had not, according to established custom, submitted to circumcision before marriage: Zipporah, seizing a flint, circumcises her son <span class="ital">instead of</span> her husband, and so makes the latter symbolically a ‘blood-bridegroom,’ and delivers him from the wrath of Jehovah. At the same time, the circumcision of male infants is explained as a more humane substitute for the original circumcision of young men before marriage (Wellh. <span class="ital">Hist.</span> p. 340; <span class="ital">EB.</span> ii. 830, 832; <span class="ital">DB.</span> v. 622a). On circumcision, see now very fully Hastings’ <span class="ital">Encycl. of Rel. and Ethics</span>, s.v.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So he let him go</span>. <span class="accented">i.e</span>. "God let Moses go" - allowed him to escape death, accepted Zipporah's tardy act as a removal of the cause of offence, and gave her husband back to her. Then she said, etc. This is not a second address of Zipporah to Moses, conceived in the same terms, but an explanation of her previous address. She called him "a bloody husband because of the circumcision." Literally, "of the circumcisions." The two circumcisions, of Gershom in Midian, and of Eliezer on the way to Egypt, are especially in the writer's mind. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 4:27, 28 <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/exodus/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Moses then set out upon his journey, with his wife and sons. &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493; is not to be altered into &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;, as Knobel supposes, notwithstanding the fact that the birth of only one son has hitherto been mentioned (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/2-22.htm">Exodus 2:22</a>); for neither there, nor in this passage (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-25.htm">Exodus 4:25</a>), is he described as the only son.

Poor as his outward appearance might be, he had in his hand the staff before which the pride of Pharaoh and all his might would have to bow.</body></html>
