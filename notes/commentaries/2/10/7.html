First, the magicians were impressed, and said, “This is the finger of God” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-19.htm" title="Then the magicians said to Pharaoh, This is the finger of God: and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he listened not to them; as the LORD had said.">Exodus 8:19</a>). Then a certain number of the people “feared the word of the Lord, and made their servants and their cattle flee into the houses” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-20.htm" title="He that feared the word of the LORD among the servants of Pharaoh made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses:">Exodus 9:20</a>). Now the very officers of the Court, those who were in the closest contact with the king, believed that the words of Moses would come true, and counselled the king to yield, and “let the men go.” It has been supposed that they meant “the men only” (Knobel, Cook); but this is pure conjecture. The word used, which is not that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-11.htm" title="Not so: go now you that are men, and serve the LORD; for that you did desire. And they were driven out from Pharaoh's presence.">Exodus 10:11</a>, would cover women and children.

They warn the children of men not to strive with their Maker. Pharaoh had pretended to humble himself; but no account was made of it, for he was not sincere therein. The plague of locusts is threatened. This should be much worse than any of that kind which had ever been known. Pharaoh's attendants persuade him to come to terms with Moses. Hereupon Pharaoh will allow the men to go, falsely pretending that this was all they desired. He swears that they shall not remove their little ones. Satan does all he can to hinder those that serve God themselves, from bringing their children to serve him. He is a sworn enemy to early piety. Whatever would put us from engaging our children in God's service, we have reason to suspect Satan in it. Nor should the young forget that the Lord's counsel is, Remember thy Creator in the days of thy youth; but Satan's counsel is, to keep children in a state of slavery to sin and to the world. Mark that the great foe of man wishes to retain him by the ties of affection, as Pharaoh would have taken hostages from the Israelites for their return, by holding their wives and children in captivity. Satan is willing to share our duty and our service with the Saviour, because the Saviour will not accept those terms.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For the first time the officers of Pharaoh intervene before the scourge is inflicted, showing at once their belief in the threat, and their special terror of the infliction.

Pharaoh's servants said&#8212;Many of his courtiers must have suffered serious losses from the late visitations, and the prospect of such a calamity as that which was threatened and the magnitude of which former experience enabled them to realize, led them to make a strong remonstrance with the king. Finding himself not seconded by his counsellors in his continued resistance, he recalled Moses and Aaron, and having expressed his consent to their departure, inquired who were to go. The prompt and decisive reply, "all," neither man nor beast shall remain, raised a storm of indignant fury in the breast of the proud king. He would permit the grown-up men to go away; but no other terms would be listened to.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/exodus/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> How long shall this man be a snare; an occasion of sin and destruction?

The Pharaoh’s ministers suggest to him that Moses should no longer be permitted to ruin Egypt. He accordingly makes an attempt to come to terms with Moses; but when Moses declares that the whole people must go to hold the feast to Jehovah, he replies that he can only in the men go. The ministers shew by what they say that they are prompted not by religious fear, but only by solicitude for the welfare of their country, the misfortunes of which they attribute to Moses.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Pharaoh's servants said unto him</span>. This marks quite a new phase in the proceedings. Hitherto the courtiers generally had been dumb. Once the magicians had ventured to say - "This is the finger of God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-19.htm">Exodus 8:19</a>); but otherwise the entire court had been passive, and left the king to himself. They are even said to have "hardened their hearts" like him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-34.htm">Exodus 9:34</a>). But now at last they break their silence and interfere. Having lost most of their cattle, and a large part of the year's crops, the great men became alarmed - they were large landed proprietors, and the destruction of the wheat and <span class="accented">doora</span> crops would seriously impoverish, if not actually ruin them. Moreover, it is to be noted that they interfere before the plague has begun, when it is simply threatened, which shows that they had come to believe in the power of Moses. Such a belief on the part of some had appeared, when the plague of hail was threatened (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-20.htm">Exodus 9:20</a>); now it would seem to have become general. <span class="cmt_word">A snare to us</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "a peril" - "a source of danger," the species being put for the genus. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/exodus/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The eighth plague; the Locusts. - <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/10-1.htm">Exodus 10:1-6</a>. As Pharaoh's pride still refused to bend to the will of God, Moses was directed to announce another, and in some respects a more fearful, plague. At the same time God strengthened Moses' faith, by telling him that the hardening of Pharaoh and his servants was decreed by Him, that these signs might be done among them, and that Israel might perceive by this to all generations that He was Jehovah (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/7-3.htm">Exodus 7:3-5</a>). We may learn from <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/78.htm">Psalm 78</a> and 105 in what manner the Israelites narrated these signs to their children and children's children. &#1488;&#1514;&#1514; &#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514;, to set or prepare signs (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-1.htm">Exodus 10:1</a>), is interchanged with &#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-2.htm">Exodus 10:2</a>) in the same sense (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-12.htm">Exodus 8:12</a>). The suffix in &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-1.htm">Exodus 10:1</a>) refers to Egypt as a country; and that in &#1489;&#1468;&#1501; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-2.htm">Exodus 10:2</a>) to the Egyptians. In the expression, "thou mayest tell," Moses is addressed as the representative of the nation. &#1492;&#1514;&#1506;&#1500;&#1468;&#1500;: to have to do with a person, generally in a bad sense, to do him harm (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/31-4.htm">1 Samuel 31:4</a>).
