The nature of the visitation is uncontested and incontestable—it was a terrible invasion of locusts. Locusts are an occasional, though not a frequent, scourge in Egypt. They are not bred there, and necessarily arrive from some foreign country. When they descend, their ravages are as severe as elsewhere. “In the present day,” says Mr. Stuart Poole, “locusts suddenly appear in the cultivated land, coming from the desert in a column of great length. They fly across the country, darkening the air with their compact ranks, which are undisturbed by the constant attacks of kites, crows, and vultures, and making a strange whizzing sound, like that of fire, or many distant wheels. Where they alight they devour every green thing, even stripping the trees of their leaves. Rewards are offered for their destruction; but no labour can seriously reduce their numbers” (<span class= "ital">Dict. of the Bible,</span> vol. ii., p. 887). C. Niebuhr witnessed two invasions—in 1761 and 1762; Denon witnessed another about the year 1800; and Tischendorf saw one recently. They always enter Egypt either from the south or from the east, and necessarily come with a wind, since they cannot possibly fly any considerable distance without one. It is probable that at different times different varieties of the locust visit the country; but all varieties are almost equally destructive. After the loss of their cattle by murrain and hail, and the ruin of the flax and barley crops by the latter agency, nothing was wanting to complete the desolation of the country and the impoverishment of its inhabitants but the ruin of the wheat and <span class= "ital">doora</span> crops, which the locusts speedily effected.<p>(1) <span class= "bld">I have hardened . . . the heart of his servants.</span>—They, too, had first hardened their own hearts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-34.htm" title="And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders were ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his servants.">Exodus 9:34</a>), and so deserved a penal hardening. A certain amount of responsibility rested on <span class= "ital">them.</span> Had they allowed the miracles to have their full natural effect upon their minds, they would have been convinced that resistance was useless, and would have impressed their views upon the Pharaoh. Even in the most absolute governments public opinion has weight, and the general sentiment of the Court almost always carries the sovereign with it.<p><span class= "bld">That I might shew these my signs.</span>—There is nothing derogatory to the Divine Nature in a penal hardening being, as it were, utilised to increase the glory of God, and affect for good future generations of His people. The accumulation of plague upon plague, which the obduracy of Pharaoh and his subjects brought about, was of vast importance in presenting to Israel, and even to the surrounding nations, a manifestation of the tremendous power of God, calculated to impress them as nothing else would have done.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/exodus/10.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-1.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Go in to Pharaoh: for I have hardened his heart, and the heart of his servants, that I might show these my signs before him:">Exodus 10:1</a></span>. <span class="ital">Go unto Pharaoh: for I have hardened his heart — </span>That is, either, 1st, Go and make a new address unto him, for what I have yet done has but hardened his heart: or, 2d, <span class="greekheb">כי</span>, here translated <span class="ital">for, </span>must, as is often the case, be rendered <span class="ital">although; </span>go and speak to him again, although I have suffered his heart to be hardened, and to continue obdurate, that I might more fully display my power and providence, not only to Egypt and the adjacent countries, but to generations yet unborn, and especially to the posterity of my people Israel; <span class="ital">that thou mayest tell </span>(<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-2.htm" title="And that you may tell in the ears of your son, and of your son's son, what things I have worked in Egypt, and my signs which I have done among them; that you may know how that I am the LORD.">Exodus 10:2</a>) <span class="ital">in the ears of thy son, and thy son’s son, what things I have wrought. </span>These plagues are standing monuments of the greatness of God, the happiness of the church, and the sinfulness of sin; and standing monitors to the children of men in all ages, not to <span class="ital">provoke the Lord to jealousy, </span>nor to <span class="ital">strive with their Maker. </span>The benefit of these instructions to the world doth sufficiently balance the expense.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/10.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>10:1-11 The plagues of Egypt show the sinfulness of sin. They warn the children of men not to strive with their Maker. Pharaoh had pretended to humble himself; but no account was made of it, for he was not sincere therein. The plague of locusts is threatened. This should be much worse than any of that kind which had ever been known. Pharaoh's attendants persuade him to come to terms with Moses. Hereupon Pharaoh will allow the men to go, falsely pretending that this was all they desired. He swears that they shall not remove their little ones. Satan does all he can to hinder those that serve God themselves, from bringing their children to serve him. He is a sworn enemy to early piety. Whatever would put us from engaging our children in God's service, we have reason to suspect Satan in it. Nor should the young forget that the Lord's counsel is, Remember thy Creator in the days of thy youth; but Satan's counsel is, to keep children in a state of slavery to sin and to the world. Mark that the great foe of man wishes to retain him by the ties of affection, as Pharaoh would have taken hostages from the Israelites for their return, by holding their wives and children in captivity. Satan is willing to share our duty and our service with the Saviour, because the Saviour will not accept those terms.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Hardened - Different words in the Hebrew.

From J, with short passages from E.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-20.</span> - THE EIGHTH PLAGUE. Notwithstanding his self-condemnation and acknowledgment of the righteousness of God in all the judgments that had been sent upon him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-27.htm">Exodus 9:27</a>), Pharaoh no sooner found that the seventh plague had ceased than he reverted to his old obstinacy. He both wilfully hardened his own heart (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-34.htm">Exodus 9:34</a>); and God, by the unfailing operation of his moral laws, further blunted or hardened it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-1.htm">Exodus 10:1</a>). Accordingly, it became necessary that his stubbornness should be punished by one other severe infliction. Locusts, God's "great army," as they are elsewhere called (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-25.htm">Joel 2:25</a>), were the instrument chosen, so that once more the judgment should seem to come from heaven, and that it should be exactly fitted to complete the destruction which the hail had left unaccomplished (ver. 5). Locusts, when they come in full force, are among the most terrible of all the judgments that can befall a country. "A fire devoureth before them; and behind them a flame burneth: the land is as the garden of Eden before them, and behind them a desolate wilderness" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-3.htm">Joel 2:3</a>). They destroy every atom of foliage - crops, vegetables, shrubs, trees - even the bark of the fruit-trees suffers  - the stems are injured, the smaller branches completely peeled and "made white" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-7.htm">Joel 1:7</a>). When Moses threatened this infliction, his words produced at once a great effect. The officers of the court - "Pharaoh's servants," as they are called - for the first time endeavoured to exert an influence over the king - "Let the men go," they said; "knowest thou not yet that Egypt is destroyed?" (ver. 7). And the king so far yielded that - also for the first time - he let himself be influenced by the mere threat of a judgment. He would have let the Israelites depart, before the locusts came, if only they would have left their "little ones" behind them (vers. 8-11 ). Moses, however, could not consent to this limitation; and so the plague came in fall severity the locusts covered the whole face of the earth, so that the land was darkened with them (ver. 15); and all that the hail had left, including the whole of the wheat and <span class="accented">doora</span> harvests, was destroyed. Then Pharaoh made fresh acknowledgment of his sin, and fresh appeals for intercession - with the old result <span class="accented">that</span> the plague was removed, and <span class="accented">that</span> he remained as obdurate as ever (vers. 16-20). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Go in unto Pharaoh, for I have hardened his heart</span>. The word "I" is expressed in the original and is emphatic. It is not merely that Pharaoh has hardened himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-34.htm">Exodus 9:34</a>); but I have "dulled" or "hardened" him. Therefore condescend to see him once more, and to bear my message to him. <span class="cmt_word">The heart of his servants</span>. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-34.htm">Exodus 9:34</a>. As Pharaoh's determination began to waver the influence of the court officers increased. Hence the frequent mention of them in this part of the narrative. <span class="cmt_word">That I might shew them my signs</span>. The "fierceness of man" was being "turned to God's praise." It resulted from the obstinacy of Pharaoh that more and greater miracles were wrought, more wonderful signs shown, and that by these means both the Israelites themselves, and the heathen nations in contact with them, were the more deeply impressed. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/exodus/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Moses promised that his request should be granted, that he might know "that the land belonged to Jehovah," i.e., that Jehovah ruled as Lord over Egypt (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-18.htm">Exodus 8:18</a>); at the same time he told him that the fear manifested by himself and his servants was no true fear of God. &#1497;&#1497; &#1502;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1497;&#1512;&#1488; denotes the true fear of God, which includes a voluntary subjection to the divine will.
