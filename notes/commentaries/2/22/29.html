A group of fundamental ceremonial injunctions. Jehovah’s customary due from the first annual produce of the threshing-floor and the wine-press to be promptly paid: firstborn males, both of men and animals, to be given to Him; flesh torn of beasts not to be eaten. The laws are stated here tersely and generally: more detailed, and sometimes discrepant, regulations are given in the later codes.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">29a.</span> <span class="ital">thy</span> <span class="bld">fulness</span> <span class="ital">and thy</span> <span class="bld">trickling</span> <span class="ital">thou shalt not delay</span>] A paraphrase is a necessity for English idiom: but it obliterates the characteristic curtness of the original. The two substantives are paraphrased by LXX., no doubt correctly, by ‘the firstfruits of thy threshing-floor and of thy wine-press.’ Both expressions are, however, peculiar, and no doubt archaic. ‘Fulness’ is used similarly in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-27.htm" title="And this your heave offering shall be reckoned to you, as though it were the corn of the threshing floor, and as the fullness of the wine press.">Numbers 18:27</a> (P) ‘like the <span class="ital">fulness</span> [in the parallel, <span class="ital">v.</span> 30, ‘increase,’ ‘produce’] from the wine-vat, and the corn from the threshing-floor’ (offered viz. by the Israelites as tithe): it seems to mean properly <span class="ital">full yield</span> (RVm. <span class="ital">abundance</span>)—here of the newly threshed corn, as in Nu. <span class="ital">l.c.</span> of the freshly expressed grape-juice. Naturally it does not signify here the <span class="ital">whole</span> yield of the year, but only that part of it which was offered to Jehovah as ‘firstfruits’ (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-16.htm" title="And the feast of harvest, the first fruits of your labors, which you have sown in the field: and the feast of ingathering, which is in the end of the year, when you have gathered in your labors out of the field.">Exodus 23:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-19.htm" title="The first of the first fruits of your land you shall bring into the house of the LORD your God. You shall not seethe a kid in his mother's milk.">Exodus 23:19</a>). ‘Trickling’ (the masc. of the ordinary Heb. word for ‘tear’), whatever the true explanation of the expression may be1[190], pretty clearly denotes the freshly extracted juice of the grape (<span class="ital">tirôsh</span>, ‘must’),—perhaps also (but see footnote) of the olive (<span class="ital">yiẓhâr</span>, ‘fresh oil’) as well.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[190] Lane, <span class="ital">Arab. Lex.</span> p. 913, cites the expression ‘<span class="ital">tear</span> of the vine’ for wine; and A. R. S. Kennedy (<span class="ital">EB.</span> iv. 5314, s.v. Wine and Strong Drink) refers to the Spanish <span class="ital">lagrima</span>, ‘tear,’ the name for wine made from grape-juice which has exuded from the grapes without pressure. Such wine has always been considered superior to that made from juice extracted by treading the grapes; and as this method of obtaining grape-juice is mentioned in the Mishnah, and is still practised in Syria,—the grapes being laid out for some days on a <span class="ital">mishtâḥ</span>, or ‘spreading-place,’ from which the exuding juice trickled down into the wine-vat (see <span class="ital">ibid.</span>),—it is possible that the choice juice so obtained is what is here meant. If this explanation is correct, however, ‘oil’ will not have been included in the term; and the inclusion of this in the firstfruits (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-4.htm" title="The first fruit also of your corn, of your wine, and of your oil, and the first of the fleece of your sheep, shall you give him.">Deuteronomy 18:4</a>, &c.) will not have taken place till later.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The dedication to the deity of a portion of the new produce of the year is a widely prevalent custom. ‘Primitive peoples often partake of the new corn sacramentally, because they suppose it to be instinct with a divine spirit of life. At a later age, when the fruits of the earth are conceived as created rather than as animated by divinity, the new fruits are no longer partaken of sacramentally; but a portion of them is presented as a thank-offering to the divine beings who are supposed to have produced them.… Till the firstfruits have been presented to the deity, people are not at liberty to eat of the new crops’ (Frazer, <span class="ital">The Golden</span> <span class="ital">Bough</span>,2 ii. 459, with numerous examples, pp. 318–340, 459–471, some excerpted by Dr Gray, <span class="ital">Numbers</span>, p. 225 f.). Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-14.htm" title="And you shall eat neither bread, nor parched corn, nor green ears, until the selfsame day that you have brought an offering to your God: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.">Leviticus 23:14</a> a (H), <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/26-1.htm" title="And it shall be, when you are come in to the land which the LORD your God gives you for an inheritance, and possess it, and dwell therein;...">Deuteronomy 26:1-11</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">29b, 30.</span> Like the firstfruits of the soil, the firstborn of men and animals are also to be given to Jehovah. This principle has been laid down before, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/13-1.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,...">Exodus 13:1-2</a> (P), 11–16 (J): see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/13-1.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,...">Exodus 13:1-2</a>, and p. 409.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">shalt thou give unto me</span>] <span class="ital">how</span> it is to be given is not stated: exactly the same expression is used in <span class="ital">v.</span> 30 of animals (which were sacrificed). The principle is formulated in general terms, which must have been interpreted in the light of the usage of the time: how it was understood in practice is stated by J (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-13.htm" title="And every firstling of an ass you shall redeem with a lamb; and if you will not redeem it, then you shall break his neck: and all the firstborn of man among your children shall you redeem.">Exodus 13:13</a> b = <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-20.htm" title="But the firstling of an ass you shall redeem with a lamb: and if you redeem him not, then shall you break his neck. All the firstborn of your sons you shall redeem. And none shall appear before me empty.">Exodus 34:20</a> b).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">30</span>. The firstling of a cow or sheep to be given to Jehovah on the eighth day after birth. The ‘eighth day’ agrees with the general principle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/22-27.htm" title="When a bullock, or a sheep, or a goat, is brought forth, then it shall be seven days under the dam; and from the eighth day and thereafter it shall be accepted for an offering made by fire to the LORD.">Leviticus 22:27</a> H), that no animal might be offered in sacrifice till it was of that age. The present law evidently presupposes a plurality of local sanctuaries (cf. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-24.htm" title="An altar of earth you shall make to me, and shall sacrifice thereon your burnt offerings, and your peace offerings, your sheep, and your oxen: in all places where I record my name I will come to you, and I will bless you.">Exodus 20:24</a>): a journey to Jerusalem, every time that a firstling of cow or sheep was born, would naturally be out of the question. In Dt. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-19.htm" title="All the firstling males that come of your herd and of your flock you shall sanctify to the LORD your God: you shall do no work with the firstling of your bullock, nor shear the firstling of your sheep.">Deuteronomy 15:19</a> f.) no age-limit is prescribed, but the firstlings are to be taken ‘year by year,’—i.e. no doubt mostly, as cattle in Arabia chiefly yean in spring (p. 411; <span class="ital">Rel. Sem.</span>2[191] 465), at <span class="ital">Maẓẓoth</span>,—to the central sanctuary, and eaten there at a sacred meal by the owner and his household: the older usage has thus been accommodated to the later principle of a single sanctuary. Nothing is said here about the firstlings of <span class="ital">unclean</span> animals: see in J <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-13.htm" title="And every firstling of an ass you shall redeem with a lamb; and if you will not redeem it, then you shall break his neck: and all the firstborn of man among your children shall you redeem.">Exodus 13:13</a> a = <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-20.htm" title="But the firstling of an ass you shall redeem with a lamb: and if you redeem him not, then shall you break his neck.

Originally, like all such words, it had naturally a physical sense, now completely lost both in Heb. and in the other Semitic languages, but conjectured to have been that of separation. In actual usage it expresses the idea of <span class="ital">belonging to deity</span>, whether of the character of deity itself (cf. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-11.htm" title="Who is like to you, O LORD, among the gods? who is like you, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders?">Exodus 15:11</a>), or of the character of men or things as belonging to Him: as the conception of deity became elevated and purified, the idea expressed by ‘holy’ became elevated and purified likewise, till at last it expressed the idea of most absolute purity and sanctity. Here the context shews that it must be used in one of its lower senses: it is followed by a command, not to shun and abhor every kind of evil, for instance, or to be morally pure or saintly, but by the purely <span class="ital">ceremonial</span> command not to eat flesh torn by beasts: the ‘holiness’ is thus not moral, but <span class="ital">ritual</span>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-6.htm" title="For you are an holy people to the LORD your God: the LORD your God has chosen you to be a special people to himself, above all people that are on the face of the earth.">Deuteronomy 7:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-2.htm" title="For you are an holy people to the LORD your God, and the LORD has chosen you to be a peculiar people to himself, above all the nations that are on the earth.">Deuteronomy 14:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-19.htm" title="And to make you high above all nations which he has made, in praise, and in name, and in honor; and that you may be an holy people to the LORD your God, as he has spoken.">Deuteronomy 26:19</a>, it is used in a higher sense: for it is in each case connected with some prohibition of idolatry or superstition, or an exhortation to obey Jehovah’s moral commands. See farther, on the idea of Holiness, Sanday-Headlam, <span class="ital">l.c.</span>; A. B. Davidson, <span class="ital">Theol. of OT.</span>, pp. 144–160; Skinner, art.

The phrase, "thou shalt not <span class="accented">delay</span>," implies that there would be reluctance to comply with this obligation, and that the offering would be continually put off.

The suffix in &#1488;&#1514;&#1493; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-23.htm">Exodus 22:23</a>) refers to both &#1488;&#1500;&#1502;&#1504;&#1492; and &#1497;&#1514;&#1493;&#1501;, according to the rule that when there are two or more subjects of different genders, the masculine is employed (Ges. 148, 2). The &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; before &#1488;&#1501; expresses a strong assurance: "yea, if he cries to Me, I will hearken to him" (see Ewald, 330b). "Killing with the sword" points to wars, in which men and fathers of families perish, and their wives and children are made widows and orphans. </body></html>
