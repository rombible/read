The obligation of the latter to keep intact and to return is therefore even more stringent than in the preceding case. Consequently, if the thing lent were lost or injured, however the loss was brought about, the borrower was justly called upon to make it good. The only exception was, when the lender was still in charge of what he lent, present with it, and able to keep guard over it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/exodus/22.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/22-14.htm" title="And if a man borrow ought of his neighbor, and it be hurt, or die, the owner thereof being not with it, he shall surely make it good....">Exodus 22:14-15</a></span>. If a man (suppose) lent his team to his neighbour, if the owner were with it, or were to receive profit for the loan of it, whatever harm befell the cattle the owner must stand to the loss of it; but if the owner were so kind to the borrower as to lend it him <span class="ital">gratis, </span>and put such a confidence in him as to trust it from under his own eye, then, if any harm happened, the borrower must make it good. We may learn hence to be very careful not to abuse any thing that is lent to us; it is not only unjust, but base and disingenuous: we should much rather choose to lose ourselves, than that any should sustain loss by their kindness to us.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/22.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>22; 1 - 31 Judicial laws. - The people of God should ever be ready to show mildness and mercy, according to the spirit of these laws. We must answer to God, not only for what we do maliciously, but for what we do heedlessly. Therefore, when we have done harm to our neighbour, we should make restitution, though not compelled by law. Let these scriptures lead our souls to remember, that if the grace of God has indeed appeared to us, then it has taught us, and enabled us so to conduct ourselves by its holy power, that denying ungodliness and wordly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world, Titus 2:12. And the grace of God teaches us, that as the Lord is our portion, there is enough in him to satisfy all the desires of our souls.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This law appears to relate chiefly to herdsmen employed by the owners of cattle. When an animal was stolen <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/22-12.htm">Exodus 22:12</a>, it was presumed either that the herdsman might have prevented it, or that he could find the thief and bring him to justice (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-4.htm">Exodus 22:4</a>). When an animal was killed by a wild beast, the keeper had to produce the mangled carcass, not only in proof of the fact, but to show that he had, by his vigilance and courage, deprived the wild beast of its prey. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/exodus/22.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6.

This difference causes a difference of obligation. The borrower, having borrowed solely for his own advantage, must take all the risks, and in any case return the thing borrowed, or its value, unless the owner was still, in some sort, in charge of his own property.  Things hired are not, however, to be regarded as borrowed. If harm come to them, the owner must suffer the loss. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> <span class="cmt_word">And it be hurt or die</span>. - The thing borrowed might be animate or inanimate; either might be "hurt;" the former might not only be hurt, but "die." Whatever the damage, and whatever the cause, unless in the single rare case of the owner being in charge, the law required the borrower to make good the loss to the owner. This law must have acted as a considerable check upon borrowing. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/exodus/22.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In cases of dishonesty, or the loss of property entrusted, the following was to be the recognised right: If money or articles (&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, not merely tools and furniture, but clothes and ornaments, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-5.htm">Deuteronomy 22:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/61-10.htm">Isaiah 61:10</a>) given to a neighbour to keep should be stolen out of his house, the thief was to restore double if he could be found; but if he could not be discovered, the master of the house was to go before the judicial court (&#1492;&#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1500;, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-6.htm">Exodus 21:6</a>; &#1488;&#1500; &#1504;&#1511;&#1512;&#1489; to draw near to), to see "whether he has not stretched out his hand to his neighbour's goods." &#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1499;&#1492;: lit., employment, then something earned by employment, a possession. Before the judicial court he was to cleanse himself of the suspicion of having fraudulently appropriated what had been entrusted to him; and in most cases this could probably be only done by an oath of purification. The Sept. and Vulg. both point to this by interpolating &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, et jurabit ("and he shall swear"), though we are not warranted in supplying &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1489;&#1506; in consequence. For, apart from the fact that &#1488;&#1501;&#1470;&#1500;&#1488; is not to be regarded as a particle of adjuration here, as Rosenmller supposes, since this particle signifies "truly" when employed in an oath, and therefore would make the declaration affirmative, whereas the oath was unquestionably to be taken as a release from the suspicion of fraudulent appropriation, and in case of confession an oath was not requisite at all; - apart from all this, if the lawgiver had intended to prescribe an oath for such a case, he would have introduced it here, just as he has done in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-11.htm">Exodus 22:11</a>. If the man could free himself before the court from the suspicion of unfaithfulness, he would of course not have to make compensation for what was lost, but the owner would have to bear the damage. This legal process is still further extended in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-9.htm">Exodus 22:9</a> : &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;, "upon every matter of trespass" (by which we are to understand, according to the context, unfaithfulness with regard to, or unjust appropriation of, the property of another man, not only when it had been entrusted, but also if it had been found), "for ox, for ass, etc., or for any manner of lost thing, of which one says that it is this ("this," viz., the matter of trespass), the cause of both (the parties contending about the right of possession) shall come to the judicial court; and he whom the court (Elohim) shall pronounce guilty (of unjust appropriation) shall give double compensation to his neighbour: only double as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-4.htm">Exodus 22:4</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/22-7.htm">Exodus 22:7</a>, not four or fivefold as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/22-1.htm">Exodus 22:1</a>, because the object in dispute had not been consumed. </body></html>
