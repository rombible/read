It was a warm wrapper, and has sometimes been compared to a Scotch plaid. The poor Israelite did not much want it by day; but needed it as a blanket by night—a practice known to many modern tribes of Arabs. The present passage forbids the retention of this garment as a pledge during the night, and seems to imply a continuous practice of pledging the <span class= "ital">simlah </span>by day, and being allowed to Enjoy the use of it, nevertheless, as a nocturnal covering.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/22.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>22; 1 - 31 Judicial laws. - The people of God should ever be ready to show mildness and mercy, according to the spirit of these laws. We must answer to God, not only for what we do maliciously, but for what we do heedlessly. Therefore, when we have done harm to our neighbour, we should make restitution, though not compelled by law. Let these scriptures lead our souls to remember, that if the grace of God has indeed appeared to us, then it has taught us, and enabled us so to conduct ourselves by its holy power, that denying ungodliness and wordly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world, Titus 2:12.

If thou at all take thy neighbour's raiment to pledge, &c.&#8212;From the nature of the case, this is the description of a poor man. No Orientals undress, but, merely throwing off their turbans and some of their heavy outer garments, they sleep in the clothes which they wear during the day.

But you are not to think that the creditor would every morning take, and every night redeliver his pledge; and therefore this is rather a prohibition to take any such thing for a pledge as a man hath great and daily need of, by this argument, that if he did take it, he could not keep it.

So that it seems that the lender, though he might not impose usury on the borrower, or oblige him to pay interest for what he lent him, yet for the security of his money he might take his clothes, either his bed clothes or wearing apparel, or any instruments or goods of his; but when he did, he was bound to what follows: <p>thou shalt deliver it to him by that the sun goeth down; the reason of which appears in the next verse, with respect to his bed clothes, should that be the pledge: but Jarchi interprets it, not of his nocturnal clothes, but of his apparel in the daytime, and paraphrases it thus,"all the day thou shalt restore it to him until the setting of the sun; and when the sun is set, thou shalt return and take it until the morning of the morrow comes; the Scripture speaks of the covering of the day, of which there is no need at night;''but rather night clothes are meant by what follows. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/exodus/22.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">If thou at all take thy neighbor's raiment to pledge, thou shalt deliver it unto him by that the sun goeth down:</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/exodus/22.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">26</span>. <span class="ital">garment</span>] <span class="bld">mantle</span> (Heb. <span class="ital">salmâh</span>), the large rectangular piece of cloth described in the note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-34.htm" title="And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneading troughs being bound up in their clothes on their shoulders.">Exodus 12:34</a>; perhaps the only article that a poor man would have to offer as a pledge, as well as his only covering by night (<span class="ital">v.</span> 27).

Lending upon pledge, the business of our modern pawnbrokers, was not forbidden by the Jewish law; only certain articles of primary necessity were forbidden to be taken, as the handmill for grinding flour, or either of its mill-stones (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-6.htm">Deuteronomy 24:6</a>).  Borrowing upon pledge was practised largely in the time of Nehemiah, and led to very ill results. See Nehemiah ch. 5. <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt deliver it unto him by that the sun goeth down</span>. The reason is given in the next verse. As it could not have been worth while to take the pledge at all, if it was immediately to have been given back for good, we must suppose a practice of depositing the garment during the day, and being allowed to have it out at night. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/exodus/22.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Whoever offered sacrifice to strange gods instead of to Jehovah alone, was liable to death. &#1497;&#1495;&#1512;&#1501; he shall be banned, put under the ban (cherem), i.e., put to death, and by death devoted to the Lord, to whom he would not devote himself in life (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/27-29.htm">Leviticus 27:29</a>, and my Archologie, 70). </body></html>
