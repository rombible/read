The father looked to receive a handsome sum (<span class= "greekheb">ἕδνα</span>) from the man to whom he consented to betroth his virgin daughter; and required compensation if his daughter’s eligibility as a wife was diminished. If the seducer were a person to whom he felt it a degradation to marry his daughter, he might exact from him such a sum as would be likely to induce another to wed her; if he was one whom he could accept as a son-in-law, he might compel him to re-establish his daughter’s status by marriage. It might be well if modern societies would imitate the Mosaic code on this point by some similar proviso.<p><span class= "bld">He shall surely endow her</span>—i.e., pay the customary sum to the father.

We must answer to God, not only for what we do maliciously, but for what we do heedlessly. Therefore, when we have done harm to our neighbour, we should make restitution, though not compelled by law. Let these scriptures lead our souls to remember, that if the grace of God has indeed appeared to us, then it has taught us, and enabled us so to conduct ourselves by its holy power, that denying ungodliness and wordly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world, Titus 2:12. And the grace of God teaches us, that as the Lord is our portion, there is enough in him to satisfy all the desires of our souls.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the marginal references. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/exodus/22.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6.

For one might be betrothed according to the custom of those times, and not be married, or the nuptials consummated, and so be yet a maid or virgin; but being betrothed, it made the case different, because such an one was as a wife to a man: but the case here supposed is of a maid not betrothed, and also not forced, but yielding to the solicitations of a man, as is implied by her being enticed; which signifies his gaining upon her affections, and obtaining her consent by expressing strong affection for her, and making large promises to her, and so both by words and gestures prevailing with her to yield to his desire: <p>and lie with her; in a way of carnal copulation; and such an action between two single persons, by consent, is what is called simple fornication: if this was done in a field, the maid was supposed to be forced, since there she might cry out, and not be heard; but if in a city, she is supposed to be enticed, and consent, since if she cried out she might be heard; this the Jewish writers gather from <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-23.htm">Deuteronomy 22:23</a>, though the law there respects a betrothed damsel: <p>he shall surely endow her to be his wife; give her a dowry in order to be his wife, or, however, such an one as he would or must give if she became his wife, even one suitable to her rank and dignity, whether he married her or not; for he was not obliged to it whether he would or not, and in some cases could not if he would, as follows. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/exodus/22.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And if a man entice a maid that is not betrothed, and lie with her, he shall surely endow her to be his wife.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/exodus/22.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">16</span>. <span class="ital">a</span> <span class="bld">marriage-price</span>] Heb. <span class="ital">môhar</span>, Arab, <span class="ital">mahr</span>; i.e.—not a ‘dowry,’ but—the price paid for the wife to her parents or family, according to ancient Hebrew custom (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/34-12.htm" title="Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give according as you shall say to me: but give me the damsel to wife.">Genesis 34:12</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-25.htm" title="And Saul said, Thus shall you say to David, The king desires not any dowry, but an hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged of the king's enemies.

The same custom prevailed anciently, and prevails still, in many other parts of the world (see Post, <span class="ital">Familienrecht</span>, pp. 157 ff., 173 ff.): cf., for instance, the Homeric <span class="greekheb">ἕδνα</span> or <span class="greekheb">ἔεδνα</span>, <span class="ital">Il.</span> xvi. 178; <span class="ital">Od.</span> xvi. 391 f., xxi. 160–162, &c.; and, for Arabia, W.

The amount varied naturally with the relative circumstances of the two parties; and was a subject of mutual agreement between the suitor and the girl’s family (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/34-12.htm" title="Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give according as you shall say to me: but give me the damsel to wife.">Genesis 34:12</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">16, 17</span>. Compensation for the seduction of an unbetrothed maiden The unmarried and unbetrothed daughter counts as part of her father’s property; by the loss of her virginity her value is diminished; her father consequently has a claim for compensation; and the seducer must pay the price sufficient to make the girl his wife.

The seducer was to comply with this custom, and make over to the damsel's father the sum of fifty shekels of silver (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-29.htm">Deuteronomy 22:29</a>), for his sanction of the marriage.

This case differs from the previous one, not only in the fact that the animal had either become useless to the owner or was altogether lost, but also in the fact that the keeper, if his statement were true, had not been at all to blame in the matter. The only way in which this could be decided, if there was &#1512;&#1488;&#1492; &#1488;&#1497;&#1503;, i.e., no other eye-witness present than the keeper himself at the time when the fact occurred, was by the keeper taking an oath before Jehovah, that is to say, before the judicial court. And if he took the oath, the master (owner) of it (the animal that had perished, or been lost or injured) was to accept (sc., the oath), and he (the accused) was not to make reparation. "But if it had been stolen &#1502;&#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493; from with him (i.e., from his house or stable), he was to make it good," because he might have prevented this with proper care (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-39.htm">Genesis 31:39</a>). On the other hand, if it had been torn in pieces (viz., by a beast of prey, while it was out at grass), he was not to make any compensation, but only to furnish a proof that he had not been wanting in proper care. &#1506;&#1491; &#1497;&#1489;&#1488;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; "let him bring it as a witness," viz., the animal that had been torn in pieces, or a portion of it, from which it might be seen that he had chased the wild beast to recover its prey (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-34.htm">1 Samuel 17:34-35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/3-12.htm">Amos 3:12</a>). </body></html>
