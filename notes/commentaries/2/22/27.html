We must answer to God, not only for what we do maliciously, but for what we do heedlessly. Therefore, when we have done harm to our neighbour, we should make restitution, though not compelled by law. Let these scriptures lead our souls to remember, that if the grace of God has indeed appeared to us, then it has taught us, and enabled us so to conduct ourselves by its holy power, that denying ungodliness and wordly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world, Titus 2:12. And the grace of God teaches us, that as the Lord is our portion, there is enough in him to satisfy all the desires of our souls.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The law regarding pledges is expanded, <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-6.htm">Deuteronomy 24:6</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-10.htm">Deuteronomy 24:10-13</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/exodus/22.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>26, 27. If thou at all take thy neighbour's raiment to pledge, &c.&#8212;From the nature of the case, this is the description of a poor man. No Orientals undress, but, merely throwing off their turbans and some of their heavy outer garments, they sleep in the clothes which they wear during the day.

All that he has to cover him, the only covering he has when he lies down to sleep; and therefore should be restored to him by the time of sunset, at which time he returns from his labour; and after some refreshment retires to his bed for rest, when his covering will be necessary: <p>it is his raiment for his skin; which is next to his skin, and covers his naked body, as it is when he lies down to sleep; and therefore if not returned, he must lie naked without any covering, which to deprive him of would be cruel: Jarchi interprets this covering of his shirt, but it rather means his bed clothes: the Septuagint version calls it the clothes of his shame, what cover and hide the shame of nakedness: <p>wherein shall he sleep? what shall he have to sleep in if this is detained from him? nothing at all; or it may be read without an interrogation, wherein he should sleep, or was used to sleep: <p>and it shall come to pass, when he crieth unto me; and complains of ill usage, that he has nothing to cover him in the night season, when he lies down to sleep, which is very uncomfortable, as well as unhealthful and dangerous: <p>that I will hear; his cry and complaint, take notice of it, and resent the usage of him: <p>for I am gracious; or merciful; and therefore everything cruel and uncompassionate is disagreeable, and even abominable to him, and he will take care in his providence that the injured person shall be redressed and the injurer punished. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/exodus/22.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For that <i>is</i> his covering only, it <i>is</i> his raiment for his skin: wherein shall he sleep? and it shall come to pass, when he <span class="cverse3">{i}</span> crieth unto me, that I will hear; for I <i>am</i> gracious.</span><p>(i) For cold and necessity.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/exodus/22.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">27</span>. <span class="ital">wherein</span>, &c.] i.e. wherein <span class="ital">else</span> can he sleep?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">gracious</span>] see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-6.htm" title="And the LORD passed by before him, and proclaimed, The LORD, The LORD God, merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth,">Exodus 34:6</a>; and cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-19.htm" title="And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before you, and I will proclaim the name of the LORD before you; and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show mercy on whom I will show mercy.">Exodus 33:19</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wherein shall he sleep?</span> The outer garment worn by the ancient Hebrews was like that of the modern Bedouins - a sort of large woollen shawl or blanket, in which they enveloped the greater part of their persons.

The suffix in &#1488;&#1514;&#1493; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-23.htm">Exodus 22:23</a>) refers to both &#1488;&#1500;&#1502;&#1504;&#1492; and &#1497;&#1514;&#1493;&#1501;, according to the rule that when there are two or more subjects of different genders, the masculine is employed (Ges. 148, 2). The &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; before &#1488;&#1501; expresses a strong assurance: "yea, if he cries to Me, I will hearken to him" (see Ewald, 330b). "Killing with the sword" points to wars, in which men and fathers of families perish, and their wives and children are made widows and orphans. </body></html>
