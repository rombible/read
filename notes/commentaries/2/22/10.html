We must answer to God, not only for what we do maliciously, but for what we do heedlessly. Therefore, when we have done harm to our neighbour, we should make restitution, though not compelled by law. Let these scriptures lead our souls to remember, that if the grace of God has indeed appeared to us, then it has taught us, and enabled us so to conduct ourselves by its holy power, that denying ungodliness and wordly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world, Titus 2:12. And the grace of God teaches us, that as the Lord is our portion, there is enough in him to satisfy all the desires of our souls.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This law appears to relate chiefly to herdsmen employed by the owners of cattle. When an animal was stolen <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/22-12.htm">Exodus 22:12</a>, it was presumed either that the herdsman might have prevented it, or that he could find the thief and bring him to justice (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-4.htm">Exodus 22:4</a>). When an animal was killed by a wild beast, the keeper had to produce the mangled carcass, not only in proof of the fact, but to show that he had, by his vigilance and courage, deprived the wild beast of its prey. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/exodus/22.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. If fire break out, and catch in thorns&#8212;This refers to the common practice in the East of setting fire to the dry grass before the fall of the autumnal rains, which prevents the ravages of vermin, and is considered a good preparation of the ground for the next crop. The very parched state of the herbage and the long droughts of summer, make the kindling of a fire an operation often dangerous, and always requiring caution from its liability to spread rapidly.<p>stacks&#8212;or as it is rendered "shocks" (Jud 15:5; Job 5:26), means simply a bundle of loose sheaves.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/exodus/22.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">To keep, </span> as his servant, not freely, but for wages. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/exodus/22.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>If a man deliver to his neighbour an ass, or an ox, or a sheep, or any beast to keep,....

"If the thief be found breaking in (i.e., by night according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-3.htm">Exodus 22:3</a>), and be smitten so that he die, there shall be no blood to him (the person smiting him); if the sun has risen upon him (the thief breaking in), there is blood to him:" i.e., in the latter case the person killing him drew upon himself blood-guiltiness (&#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; lit., drops of blood, blood shed), in the former case he did not. "The reason for this disparity between a thief by night and one in the day is, that the power and intention of a nightly thief are uncertain, and whether he may not have come for the purpose of committing murder; and that by night, if thieves are resisted, they often proceed to murder in their rage; and also that they can neither be recognised, nor resisted and apprehended with safety" (Calovius). In the latter case the slayer contracted blood-guiltiness, because even the life of a thief was to be spared, as he could be punished for his crime, and what was stolen be restored according to the regulations laid down in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-1.htm">Exodus 22:1</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-4.htm">Exodus 22:4</a>. But if he had not sufficient to make retribution, he was to be sold "for his stolen," i.e., for the value of what he had stolen, that he might earn by his labour the compensation to be paid. </body></html>
