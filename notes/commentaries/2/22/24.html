We must answer to God, not only for what we do maliciously, but for what we do heedlessly. Therefore, when we have done harm to our neighbour, we should make restitution, though not compelled by law. Let these scriptures lead our souls to remember, that if the grace of God has indeed appeared to us, then it has taught us, and enabled us so to conduct ourselves by its holy power, that denying ungodliness and wordly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world, Titus 2:12. And the grace of God teaches us, that as the Lord is our portion, there is enough in him to satisfy all the desires of our souls.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Afflict - A word including all cold and contemptuous treatment.

If fire break out, and catch in thorns&#8212;This refers to the common practice in the East of setting fire to the dry grass before the fall of the autumnal rains, which prevents the ravages of vermin, and is considered a good preparation of the ground for the next crop.

The transition from the former series to the present one is made by the command in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/22-18.htm">Exodus 22:18</a>, "Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live;" witchcraft being, on the one hand, "the vilest way of injuring a neighbour in his property, or even in his body and life" (Ranke), whilst, on the other hand, employment of powers of darkness for the purpose of injuring a neighbour was a practical denial of the divine vocation of Israel, as well as of Jehovah the Holy One of Israel. The witch is mentioned instead of the wizard, "not because witchcraft was not to be punished in the case of men, but because the female sex was more addicted to this crime" (Calovius). &#1514;&#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; &#1500;&#1488; (shalt not suffer to live) is chosen instead of the ordinary &#1497;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1514; &#1502;&#1493;&#1514; (shall surely die), which is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-27.htm">Leviticus 20:27</a> of wizards also, not "because the lawgiver intended that the Hebrew witch should be put to death in any case, and the foreigner only if she would not go when she was banished" (Knobel), but because every Hebrew witch was not to be put to death, but regard was to be had to the fact that witchcraft is often nothing but jugglery, and only those witches were to be put to death who would not give up their witchcraft when it was forbidden. Witchcraft is followed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-19.htm">Exodus 22:19</a> by the unnatural crime of lying with a beast; and this is also threatened with the punishment of death (see <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-23.htm">Leviticus 18:23</a>, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-15.htm">Leviticus 20:15-16</a>). </body></html>
