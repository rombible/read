We must answer to God, not only for what we do maliciously, but for what we do heedlessly. Therefore, when we have done harm to our neighbour, we should make restitution, though not compelled by law. Let these scriptures lead our souls to remember, that if the grace of God has indeed appeared to us, then it has taught us, and enabled us so to conduct ourselves by its holy power, that denying ungodliness and wordly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world, Titus 2:12. And the grace of God teaches us, that as the Lord is our portion, there is enough in him to satisfy all the desires of our souls.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live - See the marginal references. and <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-27.htm">Leviticus 20:27</a>. The witch is here named to represent the class. This is the earliest denunciation of witchcraft in the law. In every form of witchcraft there is an appeal to a power not acting in subordination to the divine law. From all such notions and tendencies true worship is designed to deliver us. The practice of witchcraft was therefore an act of rebellion against Yahweh, and, as such, was a capital crime.

The abomination here mentioned is said to have prevailed in Egypt, and even to have formed part of the Egyptian religion (Herod. 2:46; Strab. 17. p. 802; Clem. A1. Cohort. ad Gentes, p. 9; etc.). Though regarded by the Greeks and Romans as disgusting and contemptible, it does not seem to have been made a crime by any of their legislators. It was, however, condemned by the Gentoo laws and by the laws of Menu (11:17). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/exodus/22.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>If an animal entrusted to a neighbour to take care of had either died or hurt itself (&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;, broken a limb), or been driven away by robbers when out at grass (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-21.htm">1 Chronicles 5:21</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/14-14.htm">2 Chronicles 14:14</a>, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/1-15.htm">Job 1:15</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-17.htm">Job 1:17</a>), without any one (else) seeing it, an oath was to be taken before Jehovah between both (the owner and the keeper of it), "whether he had not stretched out his hand to his neighbour's property," i.e., either killed, or mutilated, or disposed of the animal. This case differs from the previous one, not only in the fact that the animal had either become useless to the owner or was altogether lost, but also in the fact that the keeper, if his statement were true, had not been at all to blame in the matter. The only way in which this could be decided, if there was &#1512;&#1488;&#1492; &#1488;&#1497;&#1503;, i.e., no other eye-witness present than the keeper himself at the time when the fact occurred, was by the keeper taking an oath before Jehovah, that is to say, before the judicial court. And if he took the oath, the master (owner) of it (the animal that had perished, or been lost or injured) was to accept (sc., the oath), and he (the accused) was not to make reparation. "But if it had been stolen &#1502;&#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493; from with him (i.e., from his house or stable), he was to make it good," because he might have prevented this with proper care (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-39.htm">Genesis 31:39</a>). On the other hand, if it had been torn in pieces (viz., by a beast of prey, while it was out at grass), he was not to make any compensation, but only to furnish a proof that he had not been wanting in proper care. &#1506;&#1491; &#1497;&#1489;&#1488;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; "let him bring it as a witness," viz., the animal that had been torn in pieces, or a portion of it, from which it might be seen that he had chased the wild beast to recover its prey (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-34.htm">1 Samuel 17:34-35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/3-12.htm">Amos 3:12</a>). </body></html>
