Whether “witches” had actual help from evil spirits, or only professed to work magical effects by their aid, the sin against God was the same. Jehovah was renounced, and a power other than His invoked and upheld. Witchcraft was as much rebellion against God as idolatry or blasphemy, and deserved the same punishment.<span class= "bld"><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/exodus/22.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-18.htm" title="You shall not suffer a witch to live.">Exodus 22:18</a></span>. Witchcraft not only gives that honour to the devil which is due to God alone, but bids defiance to the divine providence, wages war with God’s government, puts his work into the devil’s hand, expecting him to do good and evil. By our law, consulting, covenanting with, invocating, or employing any evil spirit to any intent whatever, and exercising any enchantment, charm, or sorcery, whereby hurt shall be done to any person, is made felony, without benefit of clergy; also pretending to tell where goods lost or stolen may be found, is an iniquity punishable by the judge, and the second offence with death.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/22.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>22; 1 - 31 Judicial laws. - The people of God should ever be ready to show mildness and mercy, according to the spirit of these laws. We must answer to God, not only for what we do maliciously, but for what we do heedlessly. Therefore, when we have done harm to our neighbour, we should make restitution, though not compelled by law. Let these scriptures lead our souls to remember, that if the grace of God has indeed appeared to us, then it has taught us, and enabled us so to conduct ourselves by its holy power, that denying ungodliness and wordly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world, Titus 2:12. And the grace of God teaches us, that as the Lord is our portion, there is enough in him to satisfy all the desires of our souls.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live - See the marginal references. and <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-27.htm">Leviticus 20:27</a>. The witch is here named to represent the class. This is the earliest denunciation of witchcraft in the law. In every form of witchcraft there is an appeal to a power not acting in subordination to the divine law. From all such notions and tendencies true worship is designed to deliver us. The practice of witchcraft was therefore an act of rebellion against Yahweh, and, as such, was a capital crime. The passages bearing on the subject in the Prophets, as well as those in the law, carry a lesson for all ages. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-19.htm">Isaiah 8:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-3.htm">Isaiah 19:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-25.htm">Isaiah 44:25</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/47-12.htm">Isaiah 47:12-13</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/5-12.htm">Micah 5:12</a>, etc. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/exodus/22.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6.

Such that had familiar spirits, and conversed with them, and by means thereof got knowledge of many things relating to persons, at least pretending they did; and who did or seemed to do many strange and surprising feats, as even to raise the spirits of departed persons, to converse with them and gain knowledge by them, though in reality they did not, and could not do such things, but used some juggling tricks to deceive the people, and in which they might be assisted by evil spirits; as appears from the case of the witch of Endor, who was surprised at the appearance of Samuel, it being out of the ordinary course of her art and practice really to bring up the spirit of a man deceased, whatever pretensions might be made to it; however, such being deceivers of the people, and leading them into unwarrantable practices, and off of a dependence on God and his providence, and from seeking to him, and asking counsel of him, they are by this law condemned to death, such an one was not to be suffered to live; not that it was lawful for anybody to kill her, or that any private person might or must do it that knew her, or took her to be a witch; but she was to be had before a court of judicature and tried there, and, if found guilty, to be put to death by the civil magistrate: so Jarchi's note is,"but she shall die by the house of judgment;''or the sanhedrim; for these words are spoken to Moses the chief judge, and to those that were under him, and succeeded him and them; though the Targum of Jonathan prefaces them thus:"and my people, the children of Israel, thou shalt not, &amp;c.''and though only a witch is mentioned, or this is only expressed in the feminine gender, because a multitude of this sort of people were found among women, as Ben Melech observes, and so Aben Ezra; yet wizards, or men that dealt with familiar spirits, are included; and it may be reasonably concluded from hence, that if women, who generally have more mercy and compassion shown them, yet were not suffered to live when found criminal in this way, then much less men: and this law is thought by some to follow upon the other, concerning enticing and lying with a virgin not betrothed; because such sort of persons were made use of to entice and decoy maids to gratify the lusts of men. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/exodus/22.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/exodus/22.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">18</span>. Magic and divination were practised extensively in the ancient world, as indeed they are still among uncivilised peoples and among the uneducated even in civilised countries: we have particularly abundant information respecting the practice of them in Assyria (see briefly the writer’s <span class="ital">Daniel</span>, in the <span class="ital">Camb.

Sorcery was resorted to for all kinds of purposes, to heal diseases, to ward off disasters, to bring misfortune upon a neighbour, to inspire a woman with love, &c.; it was often supposed to operate by the power obtained through incantations or other spells over spirits (the Arab. <span class="ital">jinn</span>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The law is one which, as the reader need hardly be reminded, has often been wofully misapplied, and led to the committal of great cruelties: witches were often burnt in the middle ages; and they were executed in England as late as 1716. The right feeling that sorcery is debasing and superstitious finds expression in a law which is no doubt not out of harmony with the severe punishments common in the East, even to modern times,—and even, we may add, in mediaeval Europe: but the law belongs to the older dispensation, and does not breathe the spirit of Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-55.htm" title="But he turned, and rebuked them, and said, You know not what manner of spirit you are of.">Luke 9:55</a>). The rise of a historical sense, and the recognition that the revelation contained in the OT. was progressive and that the laws given to Israel are not, simply as such, binding upon Christian nations, have taught men that an injunction such as this can have no place in a Christian law-book.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="accented">Law against witchcraft</span>. Witchcraft was professedly a league with powers in rebellion against God. How far it was delusion, how far imposture, how far a real conspiracy with the powers of evil, cannot now be known. Let the most rationalistic view be taken, and still there was in the practice an absolute renunciation of religion, and of the authority of Jehovah. Wizards (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-31.htm">Leviticus 19:31</a>) and witches were, therefore, under the Jewish theocracy, like idolaters and blasphemers, to be put to death. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/exodus/22.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>If an animal entrusted to a neighbour to take care of had either died or hurt itself (&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;, broken a limb), or been driven away by robbers when out at grass (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-21.htm">1 Chronicles 5:21</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/14-14.htm">2 Chronicles 14:14</a>, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/1-15.htm">Job 1:15</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-17.htm">Job 1:17</a>), without any one (else) seeing it, an oath was to be taken before Jehovah between both (the owner and the keeper of it), "whether he had not stretched out his hand to his neighbour's property," i.e., either killed, or mutilated, or disposed of the animal. This case differs from the previous one, not only in the fact that the animal had either become useless to the owner or was altogether lost, but also in the fact that the keeper, if his statement were true, had not been at all to blame in the matter. The only way in which this could be decided, if there was &#1512;&#1488;&#1492; &#1488;&#1497;&#1503;, i.e., no other eye-witness present than the keeper himself at the time when the fact occurred, was by the keeper taking an oath before Jehovah, that is to say, before the judicial court. And if he took the oath, the master (owner) of it (the animal that had perished, or been lost or injured) was to accept (sc., the oath), and he (the accused) was not to make reparation. "But if it had been stolen &#1502;&#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493; from with him (i.e., from his house or stable), he was to make it good," because he might have prevented this with proper care (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-39.htm">Genesis 31:39</a>). On the other hand, if it had been torn in pieces (viz., by a beast of prey, while it was out at grass), he was not to make any compensation, but only to furnish a proof that he had not been wanting in proper care. &#1506;&#1491; &#1497;&#1489;&#1488;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; "let him bring it as a witness," viz., the animal that had been torn in pieces, or a portion of it, from which it might be seen that he had chased the wild beast to recover its prey (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-34.htm">1 Samuel 17:34-35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/3-12.htm">Amos 3:12</a>). </body></html>
