We must answer to God, not only for what we do maliciously, but for what we do heedlessly. Therefore, when we have done harm to our neighbour, we should make restitution, though not compelled by law. Let these scriptures lead our souls to remember, that if the grace of God has indeed appeared to us, then it has taught us, and enabled us so to conduct ourselves by its holy power, that denying ungodliness and wordly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world, Titus 2:12. And the grace of God teaches us, that as the Lord is our portion, there is enough in him to satisfy all the desires of our souls.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This law appears to relate chiefly to herdsmen employed by the owners of cattle. When an animal was stolen <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/22-12.htm">Exodus 22:12</a>, it was presumed either that the herdsman might have prevented it, or that he could find the thief and bring him to justice (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-4.htm">Exodus 22:4</a>). When an animal was killed by a wild beast, the keeper had to produce the mangled carcass, not only in proof of the fact, but to show that he had, by his vigilance and courage, deprived the wild beast of its prey. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/exodus/22.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. If fire break out, and catch in thorns&#8212;This refers to the common practice in the East of setting fire to the dry grass before the fall of the autumnal rains, which prevents the ravages of vermin, and is considered a good preparation of the ground for the next crop. The very parched state of the herbage and the long droughts of summer, make the kindling of a fire an operation often dangerous, and always requiring caution from its liability to spread rapidly.<p>stacks&#8212;or as it is rendered "shocks" (Jud 15:5; Job 5:26), means simply a bundle of loose sheaves.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/exodus/22.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">From him, </span> Heb. <span class="ital">from with him</span>, which is an emphatical expression, and notes that this was taken away, either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.
