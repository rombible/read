The framers of Utopias, both ancient and modern, have imagined communities in which private property should not exist. But such a condition of things has never yet been realised in practice. In the laws of all known States private property has been recognised, and social order has been, in a great measure, based upon it. Here, again, law has but embodied natural instinct. The savage who hammers out a flint knife by repeated blows with a pebble, labouring long, and undergoing pain in the process, feels that the implement which he has made is his own, and that his right to it is indisputable. If he is deprived of it by force or fraud, he is wronged. The eighth commandment forbids this wrong, and requires us to respect the property of others no less than their person and their domestic peace and honour.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/exodus/20.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-15.htm" title="You shall not steal.">Exodus 20:15</a></span>. <span class="ital">Thou shalt not steal — </span>This command forbids us to rob ourselves of what we have, by sinful <span class="ital">spending, </span>or of the use and comfort of it, by sinful <span class="ital">sparing; </span>and to rob others by invading our neighbour’s rights, taking his goods, or house, or field, forcibly or clandestinely, overreaching in bargains, not restoring what is borrowed or found, withholding just debts, rents, or wages; and, which is worst of all, to rob the public in the coin or revenue, or that which is dedicated to the service of religion.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/20.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>20:12-17 The laws of the SECOND table, that is, the last six of the ten commandments, state our duty to ourselves and to one another, and explain the great commandment, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, Lu 10:27. Godliness and honesty must go together. The fifth commandment concerns the duties we owe to our relations. Honour thy father and thy mother, includes esteem of them, shown in our conduct; obedience to their lawful commands; come when they call you, go where they send you, do what they bid you, refrain from what they forbid you; and this, as children, cheerfully, and from a principle of love. Also submission to their counsels and corrections. Endeavouring, in every thing, to comfort parents, and to make their old age easy; maintaining them if they need support, which our Saviour makes to be particularly intended in this commandment, Mt 15:4-6. Careful observers have noted a peculiar blessing in temporal things on obedient, and the reverse on disobedient children. The sixth commandment requires that we regard the life and the safety of others as we do our own. Magistrates and their officers, and witnesses testifying the truth, do not break this command. Self-defence is lawful; but much which is not deemed murder by the laws of man, is such before God. Furious passions, stirred up by anger or by drunkenness, are no excuse: more guilty is murder in duels, which is a horrible effect of a haughty, revengeful spirit. All fighting, whether for wages, for renown, or out of anger and malice, breaks this command, and the bloodshed therein is murder. To tempt men to vice and crimes which shorten life, may be included. Misconduct, such as may break the heart, or shorten the lives of parents, wives, or other relatives, is a breach of this command. This command forbids all envy, malice, hatred, or anger, all provoking or insulting language. The destruction of our own lives is here forbidden. This commandment requires a spirit of kindness, longsuffering, and forgiveness. The seventh commandment concerns chastity. We should be as much afraid of that which defiles the body, as of that which destroys it. Whatever tends to pollute the imagination, or to raise the passions, falls under this law, as impure pictures, books, conversation, or any other like matters. The eighth commandment is the law of love as it respects the property of others. The portion of worldly things allotted us, as far as it is obtained in an honest way, is the bread which God hath given us; for that we ought to be thankful, to be contented with it, and, in the use of lawful means, to trust Providence for the future. Imposing upon the ignorance, easiness, or necessity of others, and many other things, break God's law, though scarcely blamed in society. Plunderers of kingdoms though above human justice, will be included in this sentence. Defrauding the public, contracting debts without prospect of paying them, or evading payment of just debts, extravagance, all living upon charity when not needful, all squeezing the poor in their wages; these, and such things, break this command; which requires industry, frugality, and content, and to do to others, about worldly property, as we would they should do to us. The ninth commandment concerns our own and our neighbour's good name. This forbids speaking falsely on any matter, lying, equivocating, and any way devising or designing to deceive our neighbour. Speaking unjustly against our neighbour, to hurt his reputation. Bearing false witness against him, or in common conversation slandering, backbiting, and tale-bearing; making what is done amiss, worse than it is, and in any way endeavouring to raise our reputation upon the ruin of our neighbour's. How much this command is every day broken among persons of all ranks! The tenth commandment strikes at the root; Thou shalt not covet. The others forbid all desire of doing what will be an injury to our neighbour; this forbids all wrong desire of having what will gratify ourselves.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/20.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The right of property is sanctioned in the eighth commandment by an external rule: its deeper meaning is involved in the tenth commandment.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/exodus/20.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. Remember the sabbath day&#8212;implying it was already known, and recognized as a season of sacred rest. The first four commandments [Ex 20:3-11] comprise our duties to God&#8212;the other six [Ex 20:12-17] our duties to our fellow men; and as interpreted by Christ, they reach to the government of the heart as well as the lip (Mt 5:17). "If a man do them he shall live in them" [Le 18:5; Ne 9:29]. But, ah! what an if for frail and fallen man. Whoever rests his hope upon the law stands debtor to it all; and in this view every one would be without hope were not "the Lord our Righteousness" [Jer 23:6; 33:16] (Joh 1:17).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/exodus/20.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> i.e. Either by deceit or violence, or without his knowledge and consent, take away another man’s goods, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-28.htm" title="Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labor, working with his hands the thing which is good, that he may have to give to him that needs.">Ephesians 4:28</a></span>; but, on the contrary, shalt preserve and increase them, as need requires, and occasion is offered. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/exodus/20.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Thou shall not steal. Which is to take away another man's property by force or fraud, without the knowledge, and against the will of the owner thereof. Thefts are of various kinds; there is private theft, picking of pockets, shoplifting, burglary, or breaking into houses in the night, and carrying off goods; public theft, or robbing upon the highways; domestic theft, as when wives take away their husbands' money or goods, and conceal them, or dispose of them without their knowledge and will, children rob their parents, and servants purloin their masters' effects; ecclesiastical theft or sacrilege, and personal theft, as stealing of men and making slaves of them, selling them against their wills; and Jarchi thinks that this is what the Scripture speaks of when it uses this phrase; but though this may be included, it may not be restrained to this particular, since, besides what have been observed, there are many other things that may be reduced to it and are breaches of it; as all overreaching and circumventing in trade and commerce, unjust contracts, not making good and performing payments, detention of servants' wages, unlawful usury, unfaithfulness with respect to anything deposited in a man's hands, advising and encouraging thieves, and receiving from them: the case of the Israelites borrowing of the Egyptians and spoiling them is not to be objected to this law, since that was by the command of God, and was only taking what was due to them for service; however, by this command God let the Israelites know that that was a peculiar case, and not to be drawn into an example, and that they were in other cases not to take away another man's property; and so the case of an hungry man's stealing to satisfy nature is not observed as lawful and laudable, but as what is connived at and indulged, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-30.htm">Proverbs 6:30</a>, this law obliges to preserve and secure every man's property to himself, as much as in men lies: this is the eighth commandment. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/exodus/20.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Thou shalt not <span class="cverse3">{l}</span> steal.</span><p>(l) But study to save his goods.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/exodus/20.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">15</span>.

By these words the right of property received formal acknowledgment, and a protest was made by anticipation against the maxim of modern socialists - "La propriete, c'est le vol." Instinctively man feels that some things become his, especially by toil expended on them, and that, by parity of reasoning, some things become his neighbour's. Our third duty towards our neighbour is to respect his rights in these. Society, in every community that has hitherto existed, has recognised private pro-petty; and social order may be said to be built upon it. Government exists mainly for the security of men's lives and properties; and anarchy would supervene if either could be with impunity attacked. Theft has always been punished in every state; and even the Spartan youth was not acquitted of blame unless he could plead that the State had stopped his supplies of food, and bid him forage for himself. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/exodus/20.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Fourth Word, "Remember the Sabbath-day, to keep it holy," presupposes an acquaintance with the Sabbath, as the expression "remember" is sufficient to show, but not that the Sabbath had been kept before this. From the history of the creation that had been handed down, Israel must have known, that after God had created the world in six days He rested the seventh day, and by His resting sanctified the day (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-3.htm">Genesis 2:3</a>). But hitherto there had been no commandment given to man to sanctify the day. This was given for the first time to Israel at Sinai, after preparation had been made for it by the fact that the manna did not fall on the seventh day of the week (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-22.htm">Exodus 16:22</a>). Here therefore the mode of sanctifying it was established for the first time. The seventh day was to be &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497; (a festival-keeper, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-23.htm">Exodus 16:23</a>), i.e., a day of rest belonging to the Lord, and to be consecrated to Him by the fact that no work was performed upon it. The command not to do any (&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;) work applied to both man and beast without exception. Those who were to rest are divided into two classes by the omission of the cop. &#1493; before &#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1468;&#1498; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-10.htm">Exodus 20:10</a>): viz., first, free Israelites ("thou") and their children ("thy son and thy daughter"); and secondly, their slaves (man-servant and maid-servant), and cattle (beasts of draught and burden), and their strangers, i.e., foreign labourers who had settled among the Israelites. "Within thy gates" is equivalent to in the cities, towns, and villages of thy land, not in thy houses (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-14.htm">Deuteronomy 5:14</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-21.htm">Deuteronomy 14:21</a>, etc.). &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512; (a gate) is only applied to the entrances to towns, or large enclosed courts and palaces, never to the entrances into ordinary houses, huts, and tents. &#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1499;&#1492; work (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-2.htm">Genesis 2:2</a>), as distinguished from &#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1492; labour, is not so much a term denoting a lighter kind of labour, as a general and comprehensive term applied to the performance of any task, whether easy or severe. &#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1492; is the execution of a definite task, whether in field labour (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-23.htm">Psalm 104:23</a>) and mechanical employment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/39-32.htm">Exodus 39:32</a>) on the one hand, or priestly service and the duties connected with worship on the other (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-25.htm">Exodus 12:25-26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/4-47.htm">Numbers 4:47</a>). On the Sabbath (and also on the day of atonement, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-28.htm">Leviticus 23:28</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-31.htm">Leviticus 23:31</a>) every occupation was to rest; on the other feast-days only laborious occupations (&#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1492; &#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1499;&#1514;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-7.htm">Leviticus 23:7</a>.), i.e., such occupations as came under the denomination of labour, business, or industrial employment. Consequently, not only were ploughing and reaping (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-21.htm">Exodus 34:21</a>), pressing wine and carrying goods (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-15.htm">Nehemiah 13:15</a>), bearing burdens (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-21.htm">Jeremiah 17:21</a>), carrying on trade (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-5.htm">Amos 8:5</a>), and holding markets (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-15.htm">Nehemiah 13:15</a>.) prohibited, but collecting manna (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-26.htm">Exodus 16:26</a>.), gathering wood (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/15-32.htm">Numbers 15:32</a>.), and kindling fire for the purpose of boiling or baking (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/35-3.htm">Exodus 35:3</a>). The intention of this resting from every occupation on the Sabbath is evident from the foundation upon which the commandment is based in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/20-11.htm">Exodus 20:11</a>, viz., that at the creation of the heaven and the earth Jehovah rested on the seventh day, and therefore blessed the Sabbath-day and hallowed it. This does not imply, however, that "Israel was to follow the Lord by keeping the Sabbath, and, in imitation of His example, to be active where the Lord was active, and rest where the Lord rested; to copy the Lord in accordance with the lofty aim of man, who was created in His likeness, and make the pulsation of the divine life in a certain sense his own" (Schultz). For although a parallel is drawn, between the creation of the world by God in six days and His resting upon the seventh day on the one hand, and the labour of man for six days and his resting upon the seventh on the other; the reason for the keeping of the Sabbath is not to be found in this parallel, but in the fact that God blessed the seventh day and hallowed it, because He rested upon it. The significance of the Sabbath, therefore, is to be found in God's blessing and sanctifying the seventh day of the week at the creation, i.e., in the fact, that after the work of creation was finished on the seventh day, God blessed and hallowed the created world, filling it with the powers of peace and good belonging to His own blessed rest, and raising it to a participation in the pure light of His holy nature (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-3.htm">Genesis 2:3</a>). For this reason His people Israel were to keep the Sabbath now, not for the purpose of imitating what God had done, and enjoying the blessing of God by thus following God Himself, but that on this day they also might rest from their work; and that all the more, because their work was no longer the work appointed to man at the first, when he was created in the likeness of God, work which did not interrupt his blessedness in God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-15.htm">Genesis 2:15</a>), but that hard labour in the sweat of his brow to which he had been condemned in consequence of the fall. In order therefore that His people might rest from toil so oppressive to both body and soul, and be refreshed, God prescribed the keeping of the Sabbath, that they might thus possess a day for the repose and elevation of their spirits, and a foretaste of the blessedness into which the people of God are at last to enter, the blessedness of the eternal &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-10.htm">Hebrews 4:10</a>), the &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-13.htm">Revelation 14:13</a>). See my Archaeologie, 77).<p>But instead of this objective ground for the sabbatical festival, which furnished the true idea of the Sabbath, when Moses recapitulated the decalogue, he adduced only the subjective aspect of rest or refreshing (<a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-14.htm">Deuteronomy 5:14-15</a>), reminding the people, just as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/23-12.htm">Exodus 23:12</a>, of their bondage in Egypt and their deliverance from it by the strong arm of Jehovah, and then adding, "therefore (that thou mightest remember this deliverance from bondage) Jehovah commanded thee to keep the Sabbath-day." This is not at variance with the reason given in the present verse, but simply gives prominence to a subjective aspect, which was peculiarly adapted to warm the hearts of the people towards the observance of the Sabbath, and to render the Sabbath rest dear to the people, since it served to keep the Israelites constantly in mind of the rest which Jehovah had procured for them from the slave labour of Egypt. For resting from every work is the basis of the observance of the Sabbath; but this observance is an institution peculiar to the Old Testament, and not to be met with in any other nation, though there are many among whom the division of weeks occurs. The observance of the Sabbath, by being adopted into the decalogue, was made the foundation of all the festal times and observances of the Israelites, as they all culminated in the Sabbath rest. At the same time, as an &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, an ingredient in the Sinaitic law, it belonged to the "shadow of (good) things to come" (<a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/2-17.htm">Colossians 2:17</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-1.htm">Hebrews 10:1</a>), which was to be done away when the "body" in Christ had come. Christ is Lord of the Sabbath (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-8.htm">Matthew 12:8</a>), and after the completion of His work, He also rested on the Sabbath. But He rose again on the Sunday; and through His resurrection, which is the pledge to the world of the fruits of His redeeming work, He has made this day the &#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1; (Lord's day) for His Church, to be observed by it till the Captain of its salvation shall return, and having finished the judgment upon all His foes to the very last shall lead it to the rest of that eternal Sabbath, which God prepared for the whole creation through His own resting after the completion of the heaven and the earth. </body></html>
