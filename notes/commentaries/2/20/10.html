Some exceptions were allowed, as the work of the Priests and Levites in the Temple on the Sabbath, attendance on and care of the sick, rescue of a beast that was in peril of its life, &c. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-5.htm" title="Or have you not read in the law, how that on the sabbath days the priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are blameless?">Matthew 12:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-11.htm" title="And he said to them, What man shall there be among you, that shall have one sheep, and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out?">Matthew 12:11</a>.) But the tendency was to press the negative aspect to an extreme, and to ignore the positive one. By the time of the Maccabees it had come to be considered unlawful to defend oneself against the attack of an enemy on the Sabbath (<a href="http://apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/2-32.htm" title="They pursued after them a great number, and having overtaken them, they camped against them, and made war against them on the sabbath day.">1 Maccabees 2:32-38</a> :<a href="http://apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/5-25.htm" title="Who coming to Jerusalem, and pretending peace, did forbear till the holy day of the sabbath, when taking the Jews keeping holy day, he commanded his men to arm themselves.">2 Maccabees 5:25-26</a>; <a href="http://apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/6-11.htm" title="And others, that had run together into caves near by, to keep the sabbath day secretly, being discovered by Philip, were all burnt together, because they made a conscience to help themselves for the honour of the most sacred day.">2 Maccabees 6:11</a>; <a href="http://apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/15-1.htm" title="But Nicanor, hearing that Judas and his company were in the strong places about Samaria, resolved without any danger to set upon them on the sabbath day.">2 Maccabees 15:1</a>); and, though this extravagant view did not maintain its ground, yet at the time of our Lord’s ministry a rigour of observance was in vogue upon other points which exceeded the limits of reasonable exegesis. Our Lord’s practice was pointedly directed against the overstrained theory of Sabbath observance which was current in His day, and was clearly intended to vindicate for His disciples a liberty which ecclesiastical authority was disposed to deny them. There are parts of Christendom in which, even at the present day, a similar spirit prevails, and a similar vindication is needed.<p><span class= "bld">Nor thy son, nor thy daughter.</span>—The whole family was to partake in the Sabbatical rest. Labour was to cease, not to be devolved by the stronger on weaker members.<p><span class= "bld">Thy manservant, nor thy maidservant.</span>—The rest was to extend also to the domestics, who specially required it, since the heavier labours of the household had to be performed by them.<p><span class= "bld">Thy cattle.</span>—Labour can scarcely be exacted from cattle without man being also called upon to work. God, however, “careth for cattle,” even for their own sakes, and wills that the Sabbath rest be extended to them. “His mercy is over all His works,” and embraces the dumb unreasoning animals no less than His human creatures. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/8-1.htm" title="And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the cattle that was with him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters assuaged;">Genesis 8:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/9-9.htm" title="And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you;">Genesis 9:9-11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-19.htm" title="Send therefore now, and gather your cattle, and all that you have in the field; for on every man and beast which shall be found in the field, and shall not be brought home, the hail shall come down on them, and they shall die.">Exodus 9:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/25-4.htm" title="You shall not muzzle the ox when he treads out the corn.">Deuteronomy 25:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/4-11.htm" title="And should not I spare Nineveh, that great city, wherein are more then six score thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand; and also much cattle?">Jonah 4:11</a>.)<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/20.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>20:3-11 The first four of the ten commandments, commonly called the FIRST table, tell our duty to God. It was fit that those should be put first, because man had a Maker to love, before he had a neighbour to love. It cannot be expected that he should be true to his brother, who is false to his God. The first commandment concerns the object of worship, JEHOVAH, and him only. The worship of creatures is here forbidden. Whatever comes short of perfect love, gratitude, reverence, or worship, breaks this commandment. Whatsoever ye do, do all the glory of God. The second commandment refers to the worship we are to render to the Lord our God. It is forbidden to make any image or picture of the Deity, in any form, or for any purpose; or to worship any creature, image, or picture. But the spiritual import of this command extends much further. All kinds of superstition are here forbidden, and the using of mere human inventions in the worship of God. The third commandment concerns the manner of worship, that it be with all possible reverence and seriousness. All false oaths are forbidden. All light appealing to God, all profane cursing, is a horrid breach of this command. It matters not whether the word of God, or sacred things, all such-like things break this commandment, and there is no profit, honour, or pleasure in them. The Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain. The form of the fourth commandment, Remember, shows that it was not now first given, but was known by the people before. One day in seven is to be kept holy. Six days are allotted to worldly business, but not so as to neglect the service of God, and the care of our souls. On those days we must do all our work, and leave none to be done on the sabbath day. Christ allowed works of necessity, charity, and piety; for the sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath, Mr 2:27; but all works of luxury, vanity, or self-indulgence in any form, are forbidden. Trading, paying wages, settling accounts, writing letters of business, worldly studies, trifling visits, journeys, or light conversation, are not keeping this day holy to the Lord. Sloth and indolence may be a carnal, but not a holy rest. The sabbath of the Lord should be a day of rest from worldly labour, and a rest in the service of God. The advantages from the due keeping of this holy day, were it only to the health and happiness of mankind, with the time it affords for taking care of the soul, show the excellency of this commandment. The day is blessed; men are blessed by it, and in it. The blessing and direction to keep holy are not limited to the seventh day, but are spoken of the sabbath day.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/20.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The sabbath ... - a Sabbath to Yahweh thy God. The proper meaning of "sabbath" is, "rest after labor." Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-26.htm">Exodus 16:26</a>.<p>Thy stranger that is within thy gates - Not a "stranger," as is an unknown person, but a "lodger," or "sojourner." In this place it denotes one who had come from another people to take up his permanent abode among the Israelites, and who might have been well known to his neighbors. That the word did not primarily refer to foreign domestic servants (though all such were included under it) is to be inferred from the term used for "gates," signifying not the doors of a private dwelling, but the gates of a town or camp.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/exodus/20.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. Remember the sabbath day&#8212;implying it was already known, and recognized as a season of sacred rest. The first four commandments [Ex 20:3-11] comprise our duties to God&#8212;the other six [Ex 20:12-17] our duties to our fellow men; and as interpreted by Christ, they reach to the government of the heart as well as the lip (Mt 5:17). "If a man do them he shall live in them" [Le 18:5; Ne 9:29]. But, ah! what an if for frail and fallen man. Whoever rests his hope upon the law stands debtor to it all; and in this view every one would be without hope were not "the Lord our Righteousness" [Jer 23:6; 33:16] (Joh 1:17).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/exodus/20.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The sabbath of the Lord, </span> or, <span class="ital">to the Lord</span>, i.e. consecrated to his use, honour, and service.

Not which he rested on, and ceased from the works of creation in, though he did rest on the seventh day of the creation, and so on every other day since, as well as that; nor does it appear, nor can it be proved, that this day appointed to the Jews as a sabbath was the seventh day of the week from the creation of the world; but was either the seventh day of the week from their coming out of Egypt, or from the raining of the manna: but this is called the Lord's sabbath, or rest, because enjoined by him to the people of Israel, and not to them until they were separated from other people, and were a distinct body of men under a certain meridian; for it is impossible that one and the same day, be it the seventh, or any other, should be kept to exactness of time by all the inhabitants of the earth; it being night with one part, when it is day with another, and not the same day to them all: <p>in it thou shall not do any work; of a servile nature, exercise any trade or any hand labour, or any kind of work for pleasure or profit, only works of mercy and necessity. No labour or handicraft was to be exercised, according to the Jewish canons (f), until the going out of it, or the appearance of the stars: <p>thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter; neither a man nor his children, male and female, such as were under age, and under the tuition, direction, and care of their parents, who were to instruct them in this kind, and not suffer them to work on this day, and much less oblige them to it; for as for those that were grown up, and no longer under the inspection of parents, and were heads of families themselves, they are included in the word "thou", and are in the first place charged in this command: <p>thy manservant, nor thy maidservant; this is to be understood, according to the Jews, not of hired servants, concerning whose rest from labour a man was not bound (g), but of such as were born in their house, and bought with their money; and of such menservants as were circumcised, and in all things professed to be proselytes to the Jewish religion, and to conform to it; for as for one that only received the commands of the sons of Noah, and was not circumcised, he might do work for himself on the sabbath day, but not for his master; and no Israelite might bid him work on the sabbath day for the necessity of an Israelite, though he was not his master (h). If a servant does work without the knowledge of his master, and it is known to all that he does it without his knowledge, there is no need to separate him from it, or take him off of it (i): so maidservants, when they did things without the knowledge of their masters and mistresses, and without being bid to do it, they were free to do it: thus, for instance, they say (k),"a cheese which maids make of themselves, of milk that belongs to an Israelite, is lawful when he does not bid them make it:" <p>nor thy cattle, of any sort whatever that is used to labour, because if the cattle did not rest, servants could not, who are concerned in the care and use of them: in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-14.htm">Deuteronomy 5:14</a>, the ox and the ass are particularly mentioned, because laborious creatures; the one were used in ploughing, and treading out the corn, and the other to ride upon, and carry burdens; and concerning the latter the Jews have this canon (l),"he who is going in the way, (or on a journey,) and has sanctified for himself the day, and has money with him, and has an ass; and though he has with him an idolater, he may not put his bag upon his ass; because he is commanded concerning its rest; but he may give his bag to the idolater to throw it upon it; and at the going out of the sabbath he may receive it from him, and even may not give him a reward for it;''but not only those, but all sorts of cattle were exempt from labour on this day, as horses, camels, mules, &amp;c. which, according to the Jewish canons, as they were not to be employed in work by the Jews, so they were not to be let or lent out to an idolater (m): nor the stranger that is within thy gates: who was a proselyte of the gate, and not of righteousness; as for the proselyte of righteousness that was circumcised, and professed the Jewish religion, about him there could be no doubt concerning his rest on this day; but the proselyte of the gate, his case was not so clear, and therefore is particularly expressed; and by which description it should seem that he was not obliged by this law, had he not been within their gates, or a sojourner in anyone of their cities; since it was contrary to the laws and usages among whom they dwelt, and might be an offence to some, and a snare to others, and, as Grotius thinks, might be to their detriment, get their work and their gain from them, they are forbid to work; and yet, according to the Jewish writers (n), they might work for themselves, though not for an Israelite, as before observed. <p>(f) Schulchan Aruch, par. 1.

Rather - "The seventh day shall be a sabbath to the Lord thy God;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the seventh day shall be a day of holy rest dedicated to religion. All unnecessary labour shall be suspended and put aside - the law of rest and ease, so far as bodily toil is concerned, which was the law of man's existence before the fall, shall supersede for the time that law of heavy toil and continual unrest, which was laid on man as the penalty of his transgression (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-17.htm">Genesis 3:17-19</a>). Eden shall be, as it were<span class="cmt_word">,</span> restored - man shall not "go out to his toil and his labour" - even the very beasts, pressed into man's service since the fall, shall rest. <span class="cmt_word">In it thou shalt not do any work</span>. On the exceptions to this rule, which even Judaism, with its extreme formality and literalism, saw to be   necessary, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-5.htm">Matthew 12:5, 11</a>. Still in many respects, a superstitious adherence to the precept was maintained by religious Jews, who would not even defend themselves on the sabbath, if attacked by an enemy (1 Mac. 2:32-38; 2 Mac. 5:25, 26 2Mac. 6:11 2Mac. 15:1). Experience, however, taught them that the law had not been intended to extend so far, and after a time they determined, not to seek battle, but to accept if, and do their best, on the sabbath day (1 Mac. 2:41). <span class="cmt_word">Thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter</span>. The rest is to extend to the whole family. Work is not to be merely devolved by the parents upon the children. <span class="cmt_word">Thy manservant, nor thy maid servant</span>. It is to extend beyond the family proper, to the domestics of the household, who are to enjoy the respite from toil and to have the advantage of the religious refreshment, no less than their masters. <span class="cmt_word">Nor thy cattle</span>. God's care for cattle is a remarkable feature of the Old Testament dispensation. God, at the time of the flood, "remembered <span class="accented">Noah and the cattle which were with him in the ark"</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/8-1.htm">Genesis 8:1</a>). Soon after, his covenant, not to drown the earth any more, was established "with the fowl, and with the cattle, and with every beast of the earth," no less than with man (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-9.htm">Genesis 9:9-11</a>). In the Psalms he de clares that "the cattle upon a thousand hills" are <span class="accented">his</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-10.htm">Psalm 50:10</a>). In Jonah, we find that Nineveh was spared, in part because there was in it "much cattle" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/4-11.htm">Jonah 4:11</a>). The precept, "Thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out the corn" is characteristic of the Mosaic dispensation, and had no parallel in the written codes or in the actual customs of other ancient nations. Animal suffering was generally regarded as of small account in the ancient world; and the idea of protecting animals from ill usage was wholly unknown. On the contrary, as Dr. Dollinger well observes (<span class="accented">Jew and Gentile</span>, vol. 2. pp. 346-7): "The law was specially careful about the welfare of animals; they were to be treated with compassion and kindness. Domestic animals were to be well fed, and to enjoy the rest of the sabbath. The Israelites were to help to lift up the ass which had fallen beneath its burden, and to bring back the beast that had gone astray (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-5.htm">Exodus 23:5, 12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/25-4.htm">Deuteronomy 25:4</a>)... The young was not to be taken from its mother before the seventh day... From these and similar ordinances - such, for instance, as about the least painful method of killing animals - it is plain that the law tried to subdue that coarse turn of mind and unfeeling cruelty, which are engendered by the maltreatment of animals." <span class="cmt_word">Nor the stranger that is within thy gates</span>. The "strangers within the gates" of Israel are those foreigners who voluntarily sojourned with them in their camps or (afterwards) in their towns. A "mixed multitude" had gone up out of Egypt with them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-38.htm">Exodus 12:38</a>), and accompanied them in their wilderness wanderings. The command that these too should rest, was at once a restriction upon their liberty, requiring them to conform to the habits of those among whom they dwelt, and an admission of them into participation in some portion of the privileges of Israel. The sacred rest of the sabbath prefigured the final peace and happiness of the blest in heaven; and they who were commanded to share in the first, were encouraged to hope that they might also participate in the second. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/exodus/20.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Second Word. - To the prohibition of idolatrous worship there is linked on, as a second word, the prohibition of the worship of images. "After declaring in the first commandment who was the true God, He commanded that He alone should be worshipped; and now He defines what is His lawful worship" (Calvin). "Thou shalt not make to thyself a likeness and any form of that which is in heaven above," etc. &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; is construed with a double accusative, so that the literal rendering would be "make, as a likeness and any form, that which is in heaven," etc. &#1508;&#1468;&#1505;&#1500;, from &#1508;&#1468;&#1505;&#1500; to carve wood or stone, is a figure made of wood or stone, and is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/17-3.htm">Judges 17:3</a>. for a figure representing Jehovah, and in other places for figures of heathen deities - of Asherah, for example, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-7.htm">2 Kings 21:7</a>. &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492; does not signify an image made by man, but a form which is seen by him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/12-8.htm">Numbers 12:8</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-12.htm">Deuteronomy 4:12</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-15.htm">Deuteronomy 4:15</a>.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-16.htm">Job 4:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/17-15.htm">Psalm 17:15</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-8.htm">Deuteronomy 5:8</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-16.htm">Exodus 4:16</a>) we find &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492; &#1508;&#1468;&#1505;&#1500; "likeness of any form:" so that in this passage also &#1493;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492; is to be taken as in apposition to &#1508;&#1468;&#1505;&#1500;, and the &#1493; as vav explic.: "and indeed any form," viz., of Jehovah, not of heathen gods. That the words should be so understood, is demanded by <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-15.htm">Deuteronomy 4:15</a>., where Moses lays stress upon the command, not to make to themselves an image (&#1508;&#1505;&#1500;) in the form of any sculpture (&#1505;&#1502;&#1500;), and gives this as the reason: "For ye saw no form in the day when Jehovah spake to you at Horeb." This authoritative exposition of the divine prohibition on the part of Moses himself proves undeniably, that &#1508;&#1505;&#1500; and &#1514;&#1502;&#1493;&#1504;&#1492; are to be understood as referring to symbolical representations of Jehovah. And the words which follow also receive their authoritative exposition from <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-17.htm">Deuteronomy 4:17</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-18.htm">Deuteronomy 4:18</a>. By "that which is in heaven" we are to understand the birds, not the angels, or at the most, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-19.htm">Deuteronomy 4:19</a>, the stars as well; by "that which is in earth," the cattle, reptiles, and the larger or smaller animals; and by "that which is in the water," fishes and water animals. "Under the earth" is appended to the "water," to express in a pictorial manner the idea of its being lower than the solid ground (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-18.htm">Deuteronomy 4:18</a>). It is not only evident from the context that the allusion is not to the making of images generally, but to the construction of figures of God as objects of religious reverence or worship, but this is expressly stated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>; so that even Calvin observes, that "there is no necessity to refute what some have foolishly imagined, that sculpture and painting of every kind are condemned here." With the same aptness he has just before observed, that "although Moses only speaks of idols, there is no doubt that by implication he condemns all the forms of false worship, which men have invented for themselves."</body></html>
