But, as civilisation advanced, more elaborate structures took the place of the primitive ones. It became usual to erect altars of hewn stone, adorned with carvings more or less rich, among which might often be introduced human and animal forms. We must understand the command here given, and that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-25.htm" title="And if you will make me an altar of stone, you shall not build it of hewn stone: for if you lift up your tool on it, you have polluted it.">Exodus 20:25</a>, as intended to forbid structures of this latter kind, which, if allowed, might have led on to idolatry.<p><span class= "bld">Thy burnt offerings and thy peace offerings.</span>—Sacrifice began soon after Paradise was quitted (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/4-3.htm" title="And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering to the LORD.">Genesis 4:3-4</a>), and shortly became a universal practice. Noah offered sacrifice on leaving the ark (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/8-20.htm" title="And Noah built an altar to the LORD; and took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.">Genesis 8:20</a>); and in the family of Abraham the rite was an established one (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-7.htm" title="And the LORD appeared to Abram, and said, To your seed will I give this land: and there built he an altar to the LORD, who appeared to him.">Genesis 12:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-9.htm" title="And he said to him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.">Genesis 15:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-7.htm" title="And Isaac spoke to Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I, my son.

Egyptians, Assyrians, Babylonians, Persians, Phœnicians, Greeks, Romans, Scythians, Celts, Germans, all equally regarded sacrifice as a main element of their religion; and if the Hebrews had not offered actual sacrifices during their oppression in Egypt, they had, at any rate, maintained the wish to offer them, and it was (primarily) for the purpose of sacrificing that they had quitted Egypt. The legislation assumes that they are acquainted with the difference between “burnt offerings and “peace offerings,” and desirous of offering both kinds.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/exodus/20.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-24.htm" title="An altar of earth you shall make to me, and shall sacrifice thereon your burnt offerings, and your peace offerings, your sheep, and your oxen: in all places where I record my name I will come to you, and I will bless you.">Exodus 20:24</a></span>. <span class="ital">An altar of earth — </span>It is meant of <span class="ital">occasional </span>altars, such as they reared in the wilderness before the tabernacle was erected, and afterward upon special emergencies, for present use.

This was a temporary precept, and only in force until the tabernacle was built, and respects occasional altars, erected while on their travels, and were to be made of turfs of earth, and so easily and quickly thrown up, as their case and circumstances required, and as easily thrown down, as it was proper they should, after they had no more use for them, lest they should be abused to superstitious uses; for afterwards the altar for burnt offerings was made of Shittim wood covered with brass, and that in the temple was wholly a brazen one, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/27-1.htm">Exodus 27:1</a> this precept seems to suggest the plainness and simplicity in which God would be worshipped, in opposition to the pomp and gaudy show of idolaters intimated in the preceding verse; though Tertullian (t) relates of the Romans in the times of Numa Pomptitus, that they had neither images, nor temples, nor capitols, only altars made of turfs of earth hastily thrown up; and this altar of earth might be, as Ainsworth observes, a figure of the earthly or human nature of Christ, who is the altar, whereof believers in him have a right to eat, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-10.htm">Hebrews 13:10</a>. <p>and shalt sacrifice thereon thy burnt offerings, and thy peace offerings, thy sheep, and thine oxen; which were the creatures offered in the said sacrifices, as also in the sin offerings and trespass offerings, which, though not mentioned, are included: <p>in all places where I record my name; or, "cause it to be mentioned", or "remembered" (u); where he manifested himself, displayed the glory of his nature and perfection; or, as the Targum of Jonathan expresses it, caused his Shechinah or divine Majesty to dwell, or gave any intimations of his presence, as at the altar now erected to him, and at the sacrifices offered up thereon, and afterwards in the tabernacle, between the cherubim over the mercy seat, and ark of the testimony; which was removed to various places before the temple was built at Jerusalem, where he took up his residence, and his name was called upon, made mention of, and recorded for many generations: but that being destroyed and worship there at an end, men may now worship God in any place, so be it they do it in spirit and in truth; and wherever the name of God is truly called upon, and the glory of his divine perfection, as displayed in the salvation of sinners by Christ, is set forth, and Christ and him crucified is preached; and mention is made of his name as the only one in which salvation is; of his glorious person and offices, of his righteousness, blood, and sacrifice, for justification, remission of sins, and atonement; and his ordinances are administered, which are memorials of his love and grace; there Jehovah grants his presence: <p>I will come unto thee: not locally or by change of place, nor by his omnipresence merely, so he is everywhere; nor in any visible way, but in a spiritual manner, by the communications of his grace and favour, see <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/14-21.htm">John 14:21</a>, and I will bless thee; with his presence, than which nothing is more desirable and delightful; with the supplies of his grace, with peace and pardon, with a justifying righteousness, with a right and title to eternal life, with enlarged views of these blessings and of interest in them. <p>(t) Apologet. c. 25.

See further on Leviticus 3.

A <span class="ital">tendency</span> towards centralization, due to the natural preeminence of the sanctuary at which the Ark was stationed, and afterwards to the prestige of Solomon’s Temple, no doubt made itself felt before the principle of the single sanctuary was finally codified in Deuteronomy 12; but it cannot be doubted that for long after the time when Israel was first settled in Canaan, numerous local sanctuaries existed, and sacrifice at them was habitually offered—both the sanctuaries and the sacrifices being justified by the present law (see further Di. <span class="ital">ll.cc.</span>; <span class="ital">DB.</span> v. 661a; or the writer’s <span class="ital">Comment. on Deut.</span> pp. xliii f., 136–8; and cf. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-29.htm" title="You shall not delay to offer the first of your ripe fruits, and of your liquors: the firstborn of your sons shall you give to me.">Exodus 22:29</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[182] W.

Altars were to be of the simplest material, of earth, or, if of stone, of unhewn stone: they might be erected wherever Jehovah gave occasion for His name to be commemorated; and any Israelite might sacrifice upon them. The passage evidently reflects an early stage of Heb. usage: in later times much more elaborate altars were constructed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/27-1.htm" title="And you shall make an altar of shittim wood, five cubits long, and five cubits broad; the altar shall be foursquare: and the height thereof shall be three cubits....">Exodus 27:1-8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-64.htm" title="The same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that was before the house of the LORD: for there he offered burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings: because the brazen altar that was before the LORD was too little to receive the burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings.">1 Kings 8:64</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/4-1.htm" title="Moreover he made an altar of brass, twenty cubits the length thereof, and twenty cubits the breadth thereof, and ten cubits the height thereof.">2 Chronicles 4:1</a>), and the right of sacrifice was ultimately restricted to the priests.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">24–26</span>.

Among the nations of antiquity altars were indispensable to Divine worship, which everywhere included sacrifice. They were often provided on the spur of the occasion, and were then "constructed of earth, sods, or stones, collected upon the spot." The patriarchal altars bad probably been of this character, and it was now provided that the same usage should continue: at any rate, elaborate structures of hewn and highly ornamented stone should not be allowed, lest thus idolatry should creep in, the images engraved upon the altars becoming the objects of worship. <span class="cmt_word">Thy burnt offerings and thy peace offerings</span>. The mode in which these are introduced implies that sacrifice was already a long-standing practice. The patriarchal sacrifices are well known (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/8-20.htm">Genesis 8:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-9.htm">Genesis 22:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-1.htm">Genesis 35:1</a>). Jethro had recently offered sacrifice in the camp of Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/18-12.htm">Exodus 18:12</a>). If the Israelites had not sacrificed to God during the sojourn in Egypt, at any rate they had kept up the idea of sacrifice; and it was for the purpose of offering sacrifices that Moses had demanded permission to go with all his nation into the wilderness. <span class="cmt_word">I will come unto thee and I will</span> <span class="cmt_word">bless thee.</span> The promise is conditional on the observance of the command. If the altars are rightly constructed, and proper victims offered, then, in all places where he allows the erection of an altar, God will accept the sacrifices offered upon it and bless the worshippers. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/exodus/20.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-19.htm">Deuteronomy 5:19-33</a>). The terrible phenomena, amidst which the Lord displayed His majesty, made the intended impression upon the people who were stationed by the mountain below, so that they desired that God would not speak to them any more, and entreated Moses through their elders to act as mediator between them, promising at the same time that they would hear him (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-9.htm">Exodus 19:9</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16-19</a>). &#1512;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501;, perceiving: &#1512;&#1488;&#1492; to see being frequently used for perceiving, as being the principle sense by which most of the impressions of the outer world are received (e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/42-1.htm">Genesis 42:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-16.htm">Isaiah 44:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-24.htm">Jeremiah 33:24</a>). &#1500;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491;&#1501;, fire-torches, are the vivid flashes of lightning (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16</a>). "They trembled and stood afar off:" not daring to come nearer to the mountain, or to ascend it. "And they said," viz., the heads of the tribes and elders: cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-20.htm">Deuteronomy 5:20</a>, where the words of the people are more fully given. "Lest we die:" cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-21.htm">Deuteronomy 5:21-23</a>. Though they had discovered that God speaks with man, and yet man lives; they felt so much that they were &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;, flesh, i.e., powerless, frail, and alienated by sin from the holy God, that they were afraid lest they should be consumed by this great fire, if they listened any longer to the voice of God. </body></html>
