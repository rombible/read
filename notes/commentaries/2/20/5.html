Lactant., </span>ii. 2).<p><span class= "bld">A jealous God.</span>—Not in the sense in which He was regarded as “jealous” by some of the Greeks, who supposed that success or eminence of any kind provoked Him (Herod. iii. 40, 125), but jealous of His own honour, one who will not see “His glory given to another” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-8.htm" title="I am the LORD: that is my name: and my glory will I not give to another, neither my praise to graven images.">Isaiah 42:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-11.htm" title="For my own sake, even for my own sake, will I do it: for how should my name be polluted? and I will not give my glory to another.">Isaiah 48:11</a>), or allow rivals to dispute His sole and absolute sovereignty. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-14.htm" title="For you shall worship no other god: for the LORD, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God:">Exodus 34:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-24.htm" title="For the LORD your God is a consuming fire, even a jealous God.">Deuteronomy 4:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-9.htm" title="You shall not bow down yourself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD your God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and fourth generation of them that hate me,">Deuteronomy 5:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-15.htm" title="(For the LORD your God is a jealous God among you) lest the anger of the LORD your God be kindled against you, and destroy you from off the face of the earth.">Deuteronomy 6:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/24-19.htm" title="And Joshua said to the people, You cannot serve the LORD: for he is an holy God; he is a jealous God; he will not forgive your transgressions nor your sins.">Joshua 24:19</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children.</span>—It is a fact that, under God’s natural government of the world, the iniquity of fathers <span class= "ital">is </span>visited upon their children. Diseases caused by vicious courses are transmitted. The parents’ extravagance leaves their children beggars. To be the son of a felon is to be heavily handicapped in the race of life. That this should be so is perhaps involved in “the nature of things”—at any rate, it is part of the scheme of Divine government by which the world is ordered. We all inherit countless disadvantages on account of our first parents’ sin. We each individually inherit special tendencies to this or that form of evil from the misconduct of our several progenitors. The knowledge that their sins will put their children at a disadvantage is calculated to check men in their evil courses more than almost anything else; and this check could not be removed without a sensible diminution of the restraints which withhold men from vice. Still, the penalty upon the children is not final or irreversible. Under whatever disadvantages they are born, they may struggle against them, and lead good lives, and place themselves, even in this world, on a level with those who were born under every favourable circumstance. It is needless to say that, as respects another world, their parents’ iniquities will not be visited on them. “Each man will bear his own burthen.” The soul that sinneth, it shall die. “The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son; the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-20.htm" title="The soul that sins, it shall die. The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son: the righteousness of the righteous shall be on him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be on him.">Ezekiel 18:20</a>).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/20.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>20:3-11 The first four of the ten commandments, commonly called the FIRST table, tell our duty to God. It was fit that those should be put first, because man had a Maker to love, before he had a neighbour to love. It cannot be expected that he should be true to his brother, who is false to his God. The first commandment concerns the object of worship, JEHOVAH, and him only. The worship of creatures is here forbidden. Whatever comes short of perfect love, gratitude, reverence, or worship, breaks this commandment. Whatsoever ye do, do all the glory of God. The second commandment refers to the worship we are to render to the Lord our God. It is forbidden to make any image or picture of the Deity, in any form, or for any purpose; or to worship any creature, image, or picture. But the spiritual import of this command extends much further. All kinds of superstition are here forbidden, and the using of mere human inventions in the worship of God. The third commandment concerns the manner of worship, that it be with all possible reverence and seriousness. All false oaths are forbidden. All light appealing to God, all profane cursing, is a horrid breach of this command. It matters not whether the word of God, or sacred things, all such-like things break this commandment, and there is no profit, honour, or pleasure in them. The Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain. The form of the fourth commandment, Remember, shows that it was not now first given, but was known by the people before. One day in seven is to be kept holy. Six days are allotted to worldly business, but not so as to neglect the service of God, and the care of our souls. On those days we must do all our work, and leave none to be done on the sabbath day. Christ allowed works of necessity, charity, and piety; for the sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath, Mr 2:27; but all works of luxury, vanity, or self-indulgence in any form, are forbidden. Trading, paying wages, settling accounts, writing letters of business, worldly studies, trifling visits, journeys, or light conversation, are not keeping this day holy to the Lord. Sloth and indolence may be a carnal, but not a holy rest. The sabbath of the Lord should be a day of rest from worldly labour, and a rest in the service of God. The advantages from the due keeping of this holy day, were it only to the health and happiness of mankind, with the time it affords for taking care of the soul, show the excellency of this commandment. The day is blessed; men are blessed by it, and in it. The blessing and direction to keep holy are not limited to the seventh day, but are spoken of the sabbath day.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/20.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Graven image - Any sort of image is here intended.<p>As the first commandment forbids the worship of any false god, seen or unseen, it is here forbidden to worship an image of any sort, whether the figure of a false deity <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/23-7.htm">Joshua 23:7</a> or one in any way symbolic of Yahweh (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-4.htm">Exodus 32:4</a>). The spiritual acts of worship were symbolized in the furniture and ritual of the tabernacle and the altar, and for this end the forms of living things might be employed as in the case of the Cherubim (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-18.htm">Exodus 25:18</a> note): but the presence of the invisible God was to be marked by no symbol of Himself, but by His words written on stones, preserved in the ark in the holy of holies and covered by the mercy-seat. The ancient Persians and the earliest legislators of Rome also agreed in repudiating images of the Deity.<p>A jealous God - <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-15.htm">Deuteronomy 6:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/24-19.htm">Joshua 24:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-8.htm">Isaiah 42:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-11.htm">Isaiah 48:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/1-2.htm">Nahum 1:2</a>. This reason applies to the First, as well as to the second commandment. The truth expressed in it was declared more fully to Moses when the name of Yahweh was proclaimed to him after he had interceded for Israel on account of the golden calf (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6-7</a>; see the note).<p>Visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children - (Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-7.htm">Exodus 34:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-18.htm">Jeremiah 32:18</a>). Sons and remote descendants inherit the consequences of their fathers' sins, in disease, poverty, captivity, with all the influences of bad example and evil communications. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-39.htm">Leviticus 26:39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/5-7.htm">Lamentations 5:7</a> following) The "inherited curse" seems to fall often most heavily on the least guilty persons; but such suffering must always be free from the sting of conscience; it is not like the visitation for sin on the individual by whom the sin has been committed. The suffering, or loss of advantages, entailed on the unoffending son, is a condition under which he has to carry on the struggle of life, and, like all other inevitable conditions imposed upon men, it cannot tend to his ultimate disadvantage, if he struggles well and perseveres to the end. The principle regulating the administration of justice by earthly tribunals <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-16.htm">Deuteronomy 24:16</a>, is carried out in spiritual matters by the Supreme Judge.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/exodus/20.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4, 5.

How can this be just? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Answ</span>. 1. All are born sinners, and are children of wrath, and therefore justly punishable for their own sins. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Answ</span>. 2. He speaks not here of eternal damnation, but of temporal punishments, in which there is no shadow of injustice; as appears, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. Because the sins of parents are oft punished in their children, even in human courts, as is manifest in traitors, which practice being acknowledged to be just, it cannot with any sense be accounted unjust in God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. Because such external punishments have more good than evil in them, and are in many, and may be so in others, if themselves do not hinder it, instruments of the greatest good, exercises of their virtues and graces, and means of their eternal happiness. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. Because children are a part and the possession of their parents, and therefore it is not unjust if they suffer with them, and for them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Answ</span>. 3. This is to be understood with an exception of repentance, and penitent children, as appears from <span class="bld"> Eze 18</span> And if any such be temporally punished for their fathers’ sins, God will abundantly recompense it to them some other way. But if children tread in their fathers’ sinful steps, it is but just that they should partake of their plagues. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Unto the third and fourth generation; </span> and further too, as appears in the ten tribes, and afterwards in the two tribes, upon whom the iniquity of their fathers hath been visited now for many generations. But he mentions them in particular, partly, because a parent may live so long, and see the dreadful effects of his sin in his children’s children; partly, because so far the memory of a father may extend, and be matter of imitation to his children; and partly, to show the difference between his exercise of justice and mercy, as appears by comparing the next verse. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Them that hate me.</span> This word is opposed to the conceit that idolaters, at least many of them, have of themselves, that they love God more than others do, because they love, and honour, and worship the creatures for his sake, and for those excellencies that he hath wrought in them; but this will no more excuse their idolatry, than it will excuse him that commits adultery with his friend’s wife, that he did it for his friend’s sake, and from the love he had to his friend, and for his relations. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/exodus/20.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Thou shall not bow down thyself to them,.... Perform any worship to them, show any reverence of them by any gesture of the body; one being mentioned, bowing the body, and put for all others, as prostration of it to the earth, bending the knee, kissing the hand, lifting up of hands or eyes to them, or by any outward action expressing a religious esteem of them, as if there was divinity in them: <p>nor serve them; in a religious manner, internally or externally, by offering sacrifice and burning incense to them; by praying to, or praising of them; by expressing love to them, faith and trust in them, hope and expectation of good things from them, and the like. The reason of this second command, relating to the making and worshipping of images, next follows: <p>for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God; jealous of his own honour and glory, and will not give it to another; even to graven images, nor suffer it to be given to them without resenting it; and jealousy is fierce and cruel, and breaks forth into great wrath, and issues in dreadful scenes oftentimes among men; as a man that has reason to be jealous of his wife, and especially if he takes her and the adulterer in the fact, it often costs them both their lives, being so enraged at such an insult upon him, and such a violation of the marriage bed; and thus the great Jehovah, the God of Israel, their head and husband, is represented, in order to deter from idolatry, or spiritual adultery, than which nothing could be more provoking to him: <p>visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children; meaning chiefly, if not solely, the iniquity of idolatry; which being such an insult on his honour, "crimen laesae majestatis", is treated by him as high treason is among men; not only he punishes the authors and perpetrators of it in their own persons, which is meant by "visiting", but upon their children also, which are parts of themselves; and whatsoever is inflicted on them is the same as on themselves, and is an addition to, and a sensible aggravation of their punishment; and especially these are visited in such a manner, when they tread in their father's steps, and fill up the measure of their iniquity. So the Targum of Jonathan,"visiting the iniquity of ungodly fathers on rebellious children: <p>unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me; as all idolaters must be thought to do, whatsoever love and affection they may pretend to God, by worshipping idols before him, besides him, along with him, or him in them: "the third and fourth generation" are mentioned, because sometimes parents lived to see these, and so with their eyes beheld the punishment inflicted upon their posterity for their sins, which must be distressing to them; or, however, these being but small removes from them, might impress their minds and affect them, to think what their sins would bring upon their descendants, who would quickly come after them, and share in the sad effects of their iniquities, and so be a means to deter them from them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/exodus/20.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Thou shalt not <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God <i>am</i> a <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth <i>generation</i> of them that hate me;</span><p>(c) By this outward gesture, all forms of service and worship to idols is forbidden.<p>(d) And will have revenge on those who condemn my honour.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/exodus/20.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">5</span>.

They were not regarded as emblems, but as actual embodiments of deity. There was a special rite in Greece (Theopoea) by means of which the gods were inducted into their statues, and made to take up their abodes in them. Seneca says of the Romans of his own day - "They pray to these images of the gods, implore them <span class="accented">on bended knee</span>, sit or stand long days before them, throw them money, and sacrifice beasts to them, so treating them with deep respect, though they despise the man who made them" (Ap.

He is not "jealous." as the Greeks thought (Herod. 7:10, &sect; 5), of mere success, or greatness; but he is very jealous of his own honour, and will not have the respect and reverence, which is his due, bestowed on other beings or on inanimate objects. Compare with the present passage <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-14.htm">Exodus 34:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-24.htm">Deuteronomy 4:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-9.htm">Deuteronomy 5:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-15.htm">Deuteronomy 6:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/24-19.htm">Joshua 24:19</a>; etc. <span class="cmt_word">Visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children</span>. Exception has been taken to the plain meaning of this passage by a multitude of writers, who dread the reproach of the sceptic, that the God of the Old Testament is a God careless of justice and bent upon revenge. But neither does society, nor does civil justice itself, regard the visiting of  parents' sins upon their children as in all cases unjust. Society by its scorn punishes for their parents' transgressions the illegitimate, the children of criminals, the children - especially the daughters - of adulteresses. Civil justice condemns to forfeiture of their titles and their estates, the innocent children of those executed for treason. God again manifestly does by the laws which obtain in his moral universe, entail on children many consequences of their parents' ill-doing - as the diseases which arise from profligacy or intemperance, the poverty which is the result of idleness or extravagance, the ignorance and evil habits which are the fruit of a neglected education. It is this sort of visitation which is intended here. The children and grandchildren of idolaters would start in life under disadvantages. The vicious lives of their parents would have sown in them the seeds both of physical and moral evil. They would commonly be brought up in wrong courses, have their moral sense early perverted, and so suffer for their parents' faults. It would be difficult for them to rise out of their unhappy condition. Still, "each would bear his own iniquity." Each would "be judged by that he had, not by that he bad not." An all-wise God would, in the final award, make allowance for the disadvantages of birth and inherited disposition, and would assign to each that position to which his own conduct - his struggles, efforts, endeavours after right - entitled him. To say that the threat "applies only to such children as follow the sins of their fathers" Kalisch) is to empty the passage of all force. It applies to all; but the visitation intended consists in temporal disadvantages, not in the final award of happiness or misery. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/exodus/19.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>After these preparations, on the morning of the third day (from the issuing of this divine command), Jehovah came down upon the top of Mount Sinai (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-20.htm">Exodus 19:20</a>), manifesting His glory in fire as the mighty, jealous God, in the midst of thunders (&#1511;&#1500;&#1514;) and lightnings, so that the mountain burned with fire (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-11.htm">Deuteronomy 4:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-20.htm">Deuteronomy 5:20</a>), and the smoke of the burning mountain ascended as the smoke (&#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1503; for &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1503;), and the whole mountain trembled (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18</a>), at the same time veiling in a thick cloud the fire of His wrath and jealousy, by which the unholy are consumed. Thunder and lightning bursting forth from the thick cloud, and fire with smoke, were the elementary substrata, which rendered the glory of the divine nature visible to men, though in such a way that the eye of mortals beheld no form of the spiritual and invisible Deity. These natural phenomena were accompanied by a loud trumpet blast, which "blew long and waxed louder and louder" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-19.htm">Exodus 19:19</a>; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/8-3.htm">Genesis 8:3</a>), and was, as it were, the herald's call, announcing to the people the appearance of the Lord, and summoning them to assemble before Him and listen to His words, as they sounded forth from the fire and cloudy darkness. The blast (&#1511;&#1493;&#1500;) of the shophar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-19.htm">Exodus 19:19</a>), i.e., the &#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3be; &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;, the trump of God, such a trumpet as is used in the service of God (in heaven, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:16</a>; see Winer's Grammar), is not "the voice of Jehovah," but a sound resembling a trumpet blast. Whether this sound was produced by natural means, or, as some of the earlier commentators supposed, by angels, of whom myriads surrounded Jehovah when He came down upon Sinai (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-2.htm">Deuteronomy 33:2</a>), it is impossible to decide. At this alarming phenomenon, "all the people that was in the camp trembled" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16</a>). For according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-20.htm">Exodus 20:20</a> (17), it was intended to inspire them with a salutary fear of the majesty of God. Then Moses conducted the people (i.e., the men) out of the camp of God, and stationed them at the foot of the mountain outside the barrier (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-17.htm">Exodus 19:17</a>); and "Moses spake" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-19.htm">Exodus 19:19</a>), i.e., asked the Lord for His commands, "and God answered loud" (&#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1493;&#1500;), and told him to come up to the top of the mountain. He then commanded him to go down again, and impress upon the people that no one was to break through to Jehovah to see, i.e., to break down the barriers that were erected around the mountain as the sacred place of God, and attempt to penetrate into the presence of Jehovah. Even the priests, who were allowed to approach God by virtue of their office, were to sanctify themselves, that Jehovah might not break forth upon them (&#1497;&#1508;&#1512;&#1509;), i.e., dash them to pieces. (On the form &#1492;&#1506;&#1491;&#1514;&#1492; for &#1492;&#1506;&#1497;&#1491;&#1514;, see Ewald, 199 a). The priests were neither "the sons of Aaron," i.e., Levitical priest, nor the first-born or principes populi, but "those who had hitherto discharged the duties of the priestly office according to natural right and custom" (Baumgarten). Even these priests were too unholy to be able to come into the presence of the holy God. This repeated enforcement of the command not to touch the mountain, and the special extension of it even to the priests, were intended to awaken in the people a consciousness of their own unholiness quite as much as of the unapproachable holiness of Jehovah. But this separation from God, which arose from the unholiness of the nation, did not extend to Moses and Aaron, who were to act as mediators, and were permitted to ascend the mountain. Moreover, the prospect of ascending the holy mountain "at the drawing of the blast" was still before the people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-13.htm">Exodus 19:13</a>). And the strict prohibition against breaking through the barrier, to come of their own accord into the presence of Jehovah, is by no means at variance with this. When God gave the sign to ascend the mountain, the people might and were to draw near to Him. This sign, viz., the long-drawn trumpet blast, was not to be given in any case till after the promulgation of the ten words of the fundamental law. But it was not given even after this promulgation; not, however, because "the development was altogether an abnormal one, and not in accordance with the divine appointment in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-13.htm">Exodus 19:13</a>, inasmuch as at the thunder, the lightning, and the sound of the trumpet, with which the giving of the law was concluded, they lost all courage, and instead of waiting for the promised signal, were overcome with fear, and ran from the spot," for there is not a word in the text about running away; but because the people were so terrified by the alarming phenomena which accompanied the coming down of Jehovah upon the mountain, that they gave up the right of speaking with God, and from a fear of death entreated Moses to undertake the intercourse with God in their behalf (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/20-18.htm">Exodus 20:18-21</a>). Moreover, we cannot speak of an "abnormal development" of the drama, for the simple reason, that God not only foresaw the course and issue of the affair, but at the very outset only promised that He would come to Moses in a thick cloud (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-9.htm">Exodus 19:9</a>), and merely announced and carried out His own descent upon Mount Sinai before the eyes of the people in the terrible glory of His sacred majesty (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-11.htm">Exodus 19:11</a>), for the purpose of proving the people, that His fear might be before their eyes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-20.htm">Exodus 20:20</a>; cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-28.htm">Deuteronomy 5:28-29</a>). Consequently, apart from the physical impossibility of 600,000 ascending the mountain, it never was intended that all the people should do so.<p>(Note: The idea of the people fleeing and running away must have been got by Kurtz from either Luther's or De Wette's translation. They have both of them rendered &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1504;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;, "they fled and went far off," instead of "they trembled and stood far off." And not only the supposed flight, but his idea that "thunder, lightning, and the trumpet blast (which were silent in any case during the utterance of the ten commandments), concluded the promulgation of the law, as they had already introduced it according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16</a>," also rests upon a misunderstanding of the text of the Bible. There is not a syllable in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-18.htm">Exodus 20:18</a> about the thunder, lightning, and trumpet blast bursting forth afresh after the proclamation of the ten commandments. There is simply an account of the impression, which the alarming phenomena, mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16-19</a> as attending the descent of Jehovah upon the mountain (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-20.htm">Exodus 19:20</a>), and preceding His speaking to Moses and the people, made upon the people, who had been brought out of the camp to meet with God.)<p>What God really intended, came to pass. After the people had been received into fellowship with Jehovah through the atoning blood of the sacrifice, they were permitted to ascend the mountain in the persons of their representatives, and there to see God (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/24-9.htm">Exodus 24:9-11</a>). </body></html>
