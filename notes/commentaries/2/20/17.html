Rightly understood, the seventh and eighth commandments contain the tenth, which strikes at covetousness and lustful desire. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/5-27.htm" title="You have heard that it was said by them of old time, You shall not commit adultery:">Matthew 5:27-28</a>.) But ancient moralists did not usually recognise this; thought, unless carried out into acts, was regarded as “free;” no responsibility was considered to attach to it, and consequently no one felt it needful to control his thoughts or regulate them. It was therefore of importance that the Divine Law should distinctly assert a control over men’s thoughts and feelings, since they are the source of all that is evil in word and act; and true godliness consists in bringing “every thought into captivity to Christ” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-5.htm" title="Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ;">2Corinthians 10:5</a>).<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/exodus/20.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-17.htm" title="You shall not covet your neighbor's house, you shall not covet your neighbor's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is your neighbor's.">Exodus 20:17</a></span>. <span class="ital">Thou shalt not covet — </span>The foregoing commands implicitly forbid all desire of <span class="ital">doing </span>that which will be an injury to our neighbour; this forbids all <span class="ital">inordinate </span>desire of <span class="ital">having </span>that which will be a gratification to ourselves. O that such a man’s house were mine! such a man’s wife mine! such a man’s estate mine! This is certainly the language of <span class="ital">discontent </span>at our own lot, and <span class="ital">envy </span>at our neighbour’s, and these are the sins principally forbidden here. God give us all to see our face in the glass of this law, and to lay our hearts under the government of it!<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/20.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>20:12-17 The laws of the SECOND table, that is, the last six of the ten commandments, state our duty to ourselves and to one another, and explain the great commandment, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, Lu 10:27. Godliness and honesty must go together. The fifth commandment concerns the duties we owe to our relations. Honour thy father and thy mother, includes esteem of them, shown in our conduct; obedience to their lawful commands; come when they call you, go where they send you, do what they bid you, refrain from what they forbid you; and this, as children, cheerfully, and from a principle of love. Also submission to their counsels and corrections. Endeavouring, in every thing, to comfort parents, and to make their old age easy; maintaining them if they need support, which our Saviour makes to be particularly intended in this commandment, Mt 15:4-6. Careful observers have noted a peculiar blessing in temporal things on obedient, and the reverse on disobedient children. The sixth commandment requires that we regard the life and the safety of others as we do our own. Magistrates and their officers, and witnesses testifying the truth, do not break this command. Self-defence is lawful; but much which is not deemed murder by the laws of man, is such before God. Furious passions, stirred up by anger or by drunkenness, are no excuse: more guilty is murder in duels, which is a horrible effect of a haughty, revengeful spirit. All fighting, whether for wages, for renown, or out of anger and malice, breaks this command, and the bloodshed therein is murder. To tempt men to vice and crimes which shorten life, may be included. Misconduct, such as may break the heart, or shorten the lives of parents, wives, or other relatives, is a breach of this command. This command forbids all envy, malice, hatred, or anger, all provoking or insulting language. The destruction of our own lives is here forbidden. This commandment requires a spirit of kindness, longsuffering, and forgiveness. The seventh commandment concerns chastity. We should be as much afraid of that which defiles the body, as of that which destroys it. Whatever tends to pollute the imagination, or to raise the passions, falls under this law, as impure pictures, books, conversation, or any other like matters. The eighth commandment is the law of love as it respects the property of others. The portion of worldly things allotted us, as far as it is obtained in an honest way, is the bread which God hath given us; for that we ought to be thankful, to be contented with it, and, in the use of lawful means, to trust Providence for the future. Imposing upon the ignorance, easiness, or necessity of others, and many other things, break God's law, though scarcely blamed in society. Plunderers of kingdoms though above human justice, will be included in this sentence. Defrauding the public, contracting debts without prospect of paying them, or evading payment of just debts, extravagance, all living upon charity when not needful, all squeezing the poor in their wages; these, and such things, break this command; which requires industry, frugality, and content, and to do to others, about worldly property, as we would they should do to us. The ninth commandment concerns our own and our neighbour's good name. This forbids speaking falsely on any matter, lying, equivocating, and any way devising or designing to deceive our neighbour. Speaking unjustly against our neighbour, to hurt his reputation. Bearing false witness against him, or in common conversation slandering, backbiting, and tale-bearing; making what is done amiss, worse than it is, and in any way endeavouring to raise our reputation upon the ruin of our neighbour's. How much this command is every day broken among persons of all ranks! The tenth commandment strikes at the root; Thou shalt not covet. The others forbid all desire of doing what will be an injury to our neighbour; this forbids all wrong desire of having what will gratify ourselves.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/20.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>As the sixth, seventh, and eighth commandments forbid us to injure our neighbor in deed, the ninth forbids us to injure him in word, and the tenth, in thought.

Remember the sabbath day&#8212;implying it was already known, and recognized as a season of sacred rest. The first four commandments [Ex 20:3-11] comprise our duties to God&#8212;the other six [Ex 20:12-17] our duties to our fellow men; and as interpreted by Christ, they reach to the government of the heart as well as the lip (Mt 5:17). "If a man do them he shall live in them" [Le 18:5; Ne 9:29]. But, ah! what an if for frail and fallen man. Whoever rests his hope upon the law stands debtor to it all; and in this view every one would be without hope were not "the Lord our Righteousness" [Jer 23:6; 33:16] (Joh 1:17).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/exodus/20.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The <span class="ital">coveting</span> here forbidden is either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. The inward and deliberate purpose and desire of a deceitful or violent taking away of another man’s goods; but this is forbidden in the eighth commandment. And it is hard to conceive that St. Paul should think that this command did not forbid such a practice, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-7.htm" title="What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. No, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, You shall not covet.">Romans 7:7</a></span>, which even the better sort of heathens esteemed a sin, whose words are, that <span class="ital">they who are withheld from incest, or whoredom, or theft, only from a principle of fear, are guilty of those crimes</span>; especially seeing the Old Testament Scriptures, which doubtless he diligently studied, do so plainly condemn evil purposes of the heart, as <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-17.htm" title="You shall not hate your brother in your heart: you shall in any wise rebuke your neighbor, and not suffer sin on him.">Leviticus 19:17</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-4.htm" title="Speak not you in your heart, after that the LORD your God has cast them out from before you, saying, For my righteousness the LORD has brought me in to possess this land: but for the wickedness of these nations the LORD does drive them out from before you.">Deu 9:4</a>,5 15:7,9</span>, &c. Or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. The greedy desire of that which is another man’s, though it be without injury to him. Thus Ahab sinned in desiring Naboth’s vineyard, though he offered him money for it, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-2.htm" title="And Ahab spoke to Naboth, saying, Give me your vineyard, that I may have it for a garden of herbs, because it is near to my house: and I will give you for it a better vineyard than it; or, if it seem good to you, I will give you the worth of it in money.">1 Kings 21:2</a></span>. Or rather, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. Those inward motions of the heart, which from the fountain of original corruption do spring up in the heart, and tickle it with some secret delight, though they do not obtain tie deliberate consent of the will.

And this is the reason why this command is added as distinct from all the rest. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/exodus/20.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Thou shall not covet thy neighbour's house,.... This is the tenth and last commandment, and is an explanation of several of the past; showing that the law of God not only forbids external acts of sin, but the inward and first motions of the mind to it, which are not known, and would not be thought to be sinful, were it not for this law; nor are they known by this law until the Spirit of God by it convinces men of them, in whose light they see them to be sinful; even not only the schemes and contrivances of sin in the mind, the imaginations of it, thoughts dwelling upon it with pleasure, but even the first risings of sin in the heart; and such motions of it which are not assented unto, and unawares spring up from the corruption of nature, and are sudden craving desires after unlawful things, even these are forbidden by this law; which shows the spirituality of the law of God, and the impossibility of its being perfectly kept by fallen men. The apostle has reference to it, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-7.htm">Romans 7:7</a>. Several particulars are here mentioned not to be coveted, as instances and examples instead of others. Thus, for instance, "a neighbour's house" is not to be coveted; "nor his field", as the Septuagint version here adds, agreeably to <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-21.htm">Deuteronomy 5:21</a>, a man is not secretly to wish and desire that such a man's house or land were his, since this arises from a discontent of mind with respect to his own habitation and possessions; and a man should be content with such things as he has, and not covet another's, which is not without sin: <p>thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife: and wish she was thine, and lust after her; this is a breach of the seventh command, and serves to explain and illustrate that. This clause stands first in the Septuagint version, as it does in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-21.htm">Deuteronomy 5:21</a>, <p>nor his manservant, nor maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbours'; which, with the first clause, serve to explain the eighth command, showing that we are not only forbid to take away what is another man's property, any of the goods here mentioned, or any other, but we are not secretly to desire them, and wish they were in our possession; since it discovers uneasiness and dissatisfaction with our own lot and portion, and is coveting another man's property, which is coveting an evil covetousness. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/exodus/20.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Thou shalt not <span class="cverse3">{n}</span> covet thy neighbour's house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that <i>is</i> thy neighbour's.</span><p>(n) You may not so much as wish his hinderance in anything.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/exodus/20.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">17</span>.

Here the Mosaic law takes a step enormously in advance of any other ancient code. Most codes stopped short at the deed; a few went on to words; not one attempted to control thoughts. "Thou shalt not covet" teaches men that there is One who sees the heart; to whose eyes "all things are naked and open;" and who cares far less for the outward act than the inward thought or motive from which the act proceeds. "Thou shalt not covet: lays it down again that we are not mere slaves of our natural desires and passions, but have a controlling power implanted within us, by means of which we can keep down passion, check desire, resist impulse. Man is lord of himself, capable, by the exercise of his free-will, of moulding his feelings, weakening or intensifying his passions, shaping his character. God, who "requires truth in the inward parts," looks that we should in all cases go to the root of the matter, and not be content with restraining ourselves from evil acts and evil words, but eradicate the evil feeling from which the acts and words proceed. <span class="cmt_word">Thy neighbour</span><span class="cmt_word">s house</span>, etc. The "house" is mentioned first as being of primary necessity, and as in some sort containing all the rest. A man does not take a wife until he has a home to bring her to, or engage domestic servants, or buy slaves, except to form part of a household. The other objects mentioned are placed in the order in which they are usually valued. The multiplication of objects is by way of emphasis. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 20:18-21 <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/exodus/20.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Fourth Word, "Remember the Sabbath-day, to keep it holy," presupposes an acquaintance with the Sabbath, as the expression "remember" is sufficient to show, but not that the Sabbath had been kept before this. From the history of the creation that had been handed down, Israel must have known, that after God had created the world in six days He rested the seventh day, and by His resting sanctified the day (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-3.htm">Genesis 2:3</a>). But hitherto there had been no commandment given to man to sanctify the day. This was given for the first time to Israel at Sinai, after preparation had been made for it by the fact that the manna did not fall on the seventh day of the week (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-22.htm">Exodus 16:22</a>). Here therefore the mode of sanctifying it was established for the first time. The seventh day was to be &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497; (a festival-keeper, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-23.htm">Exodus 16:23</a>), i.e., a day of rest belonging to the Lord, and to be consecrated to Him by the fact that no work was performed upon it. The command not to do any (&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;) work applied to both man and beast without exception. Those who were to rest are divided into two classes by the omission of the cop. &#1493; before &#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1468;&#1498; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-10.htm">Exodus 20:10</a>): viz., first, free Israelites ("thou") and their children ("thy son and thy daughter"); and secondly, their slaves (man-servant and maid-servant), and cattle (beasts of draught and burden), and their strangers, i.e., foreign labourers who had settled among the Israelites. "Within thy gates" is equivalent to in the cities, towns, and villages of thy land, not in thy houses (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-14.htm">Deuteronomy 5:14</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-21.htm">Deuteronomy 14:21</a>, etc.). &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512; (a gate) is only applied to the entrances to towns, or large enclosed courts and palaces, never to the entrances into ordinary houses, huts, and tents. &#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1499;&#1492; work (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-2.htm">Genesis 2:2</a>), as distinguished from &#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1492; labour, is not so much a term denoting a lighter kind of labour, as a general and comprehensive term applied to the performance of any task, whether easy or severe. &#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1492; is the execution of a definite task, whether in field labour (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-23.htm">Psalm 104:23</a>) and mechanical employment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/39-32.htm">Exodus 39:32</a>) on the one hand, or priestly service and the duties connected with worship on the other (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-25.htm">Exodus 12:25-26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/4-47.htm">Numbers 4:47</a>). On the Sabbath (and also on the day of atonement, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-28.htm">Leviticus 23:28</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-31.htm">Leviticus 23:31</a>) every occupation was to rest; on the other feast-days only laborious occupations (&#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1492; &#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1499;&#1514;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-7.htm">Leviticus 23:7</a>.), i.e., such occupations as came under the denomination of labour, business, or industrial employment. Consequently, not only were ploughing and reaping (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-21.htm">Exodus 34:21</a>), pressing wine and carrying goods (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-15.htm">Nehemiah 13:15</a>), bearing burdens (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-21.htm">Jeremiah 17:21</a>), carrying on trade (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-5.htm">Amos 8:5</a>), and holding markets (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-15.htm">Nehemiah 13:15</a>.) prohibited, but collecting manna (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-26.htm">Exodus 16:26</a>.), gathering wood (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/15-32.htm">Numbers 15:32</a>.), and kindling fire for the purpose of boiling or baking (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/35-3.htm">Exodus 35:3</a>). The intention of this resting from every occupation on the Sabbath is evident from the foundation upon which the commandment is based in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/20-11.htm">Exodus 20:11</a>, viz., that at the creation of the heaven and the earth Jehovah rested on the seventh day, and therefore blessed the Sabbath-day and hallowed it. This does not imply, however, that "Israel was to follow the Lord by keeping the Sabbath, and, in imitation of His example, to be active where the Lord was active, and rest where the Lord rested; to copy the Lord in accordance with the lofty aim of man, who was created in His likeness, and make the pulsation of the divine life in a certain sense his own" (Schultz). For although a parallel is drawn, between the creation of the world by God in six days and His resting upon the seventh day on the one hand, and the labour of man for six days and his resting upon the seventh on the other; the reason for the keeping of the Sabbath is not to be found in this parallel, but in the fact that God blessed the seventh day and hallowed it, because He rested upon it. The significance of the Sabbath, therefore, is to be found in God's blessing and sanctifying the seventh day of the week at the creation, i.e., in the fact, that after the work of creation was finished on the seventh day, God blessed and hallowed the created world, filling it with the powers of peace and good belonging to His own blessed rest, and raising it to a participation in the pure light of His holy nature (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-3.htm">Genesis 2:3</a>). For this reason His people Israel were to keep the Sabbath now, not for the purpose of imitating what God had done, and enjoying the blessing of God by thus following God Himself, but that on this day they also might rest from their work; and that all the more, because their work was no longer the work appointed to man at the first, when he was created in the likeness of God, work which did not interrupt his blessedness in God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-15.htm">Genesis 2:15</a>), but that hard labour in the sweat of his brow to which he had been condemned in consequence of the fall. In order therefore that His people might rest from toil so oppressive to both body and soul, and be refreshed, God prescribed the keeping of the Sabbath, that they might thus possess a day for the repose and elevation of their spirits, and a foretaste of the blessedness into which the people of God are at last to enter, the blessedness of the eternal &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-10.htm">Hebrews 4:10</a>), the &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-13.htm">Revelation 14:13</a>). See my Archaeologie, 77).<p>But instead of this objective ground for the sabbatical festival, which furnished the true idea of the Sabbath, when Moses recapitulated the decalogue, he adduced only the subjective aspect of rest or refreshing (<a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-14.htm">Deuteronomy 5:14-15</a>), reminding the people, just as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/23-12.htm">Exodus 23:12</a>, of their bondage in Egypt and their deliverance from it by the strong arm of Jehovah, and then adding, "therefore (that thou mightest remember this deliverance from bondage) Jehovah commanded thee to keep the Sabbath-day." This is not at variance with the reason given in the present verse, but simply gives prominence to a subjective aspect, which was peculiarly adapted to warm the hearts of the people towards the observance of the Sabbath, and to render the Sabbath rest dear to the people, since it served to keep the Israelites constantly in mind of the rest which Jehovah had procured for them from the slave labour of Egypt. For resting from every work is the basis of the observance of the Sabbath; but this observance is an institution peculiar to the Old Testament, and not to be met with in any other nation, though there are many among whom the division of weeks occurs. The observance of the Sabbath, by being adopted into the decalogue, was made the foundation of all the festal times and observances of the Israelites, as they all culminated in the Sabbath rest. At the same time, as an &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, an ingredient in the Sinaitic law, it belonged to the "shadow of (good) things to come" (<a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/2-17.htm">Colossians 2:17</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-1.htm">Hebrews 10:1</a>), which was to be done away when the "body" in Christ had come. Christ is Lord of the Sabbath (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-8.htm">Matthew 12:8</a>), and after the completion of His work, He also rested on the Sabbath. But He rose again on the Sunday; and through His resurrection, which is the pledge to the world of the fruits of His redeeming work, He has made this day the &#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1; (Lord's day) for His Church, to be observed by it till the Captain of its salvation shall return, and having finished the judgment upon all His foes to the very last shall lead it to the rest of that eternal Sabbath, which God prepared for the whole creation through His own resting after the completion of the heaven and the earth. </body></html>
