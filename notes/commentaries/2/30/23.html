Herodotus (iii. 107-112) mentions five “principal spices” as furnished by Arabia to other countries, whereof two at least appear to be identical with those here spoken of.<p><span class= "bld">Pure myrrh.</span>—Heb., <span class= "ital">myrrh of freedom. </span>The shrub which produces myrrh is the <span class= "ital">balsamodendron myrrha. </span>The spice is obtained from it in two ways. That which is purest and best exudes from it naturally (Theophrast. <span class= "ital">De Odoribus, </span>§ 29; Plin., <span class= "ital">H. N., xii.</span> 35), and is here called “myrrh of freedom,” or “freely flowing myrrh.” The other and inferior form is obtained from incisions made in the bark. Myrrh was very largely used in ancient times. The Egyptians employed it as a main element in their best method of embalming (Herod. ii. 86), and also burnt it in some of their sacrifices (<span class= "ital">ib. </span>40). In Persia it was highly esteemed as an odour (Athen., <span class= "ital">Deipn. 12</span>, p. 514A); the Greeks used it in unguents. And as incense; Roman courtesans scented their hair with it (Hor. <span class= "ital">Od., </span>iii. 14, 1. 22); the later Jews applied it as an antiseptic to corpses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-39.htm" title="And there came also Nicodemus, which at the first came to Jesus by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pound weight.">John 19:39</a>). This is the first mention of myrrh (Heb., <span class= "ital">môr</span>) in the Bible, the word translated “myrrh” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/37-25.htm" title="And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a company of Ishmeelites came from Gilead with their camels bearing spices and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt.">Genesis 37:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/43-11.htm" title="And their father Israel said to them, If it must be so now, do this; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carry down the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices, and myrrh, nuts, and almonds:">Genesis 43:11</a> being <span class= "ital">lôt, </span>which is properly, not myrrh, but ladanum.<p><span class= "bld">Sweet cinnamon.</span>—While myrrh was one of the commonest of spices in the ancient world, cinnamon was one of the rarest. It is the produce of the <span class= "ital">laurus cinnamomum, </span>or <span class= "ital">cinnamomum zeylanicum, </span>a tree allied to the laurel, which now grows only in Ceylon, Borneo, Sumatra, China, Cochin China, and in India on the coast of Malabar. According to Herodotus (iii. 111) and Strabo (16, p. 535), it grew anciently in Arabia; but this is doubted, and the Arabians are believed to have imported it from India or Ceylon, and passed it on to the Phœnicians, who conveyed it to Egypt and Greece. The present passage of Scripture is the first in which it is mentioned, and in the rest of the Old Testament it obtains notice only twice (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-16.htm" title="I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved works, with fine linen of Egypt.">Proverbs 7:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/4-14.htm" title="Spikenard and saffron; calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense; myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices:">Song of Solomon 4:14</a>). The word used, which is <span class= "ital">kinnĕmôn, </span>makes it tolerably certain that the true cinnamon is meant.<p><span class= "bld">Sweet calamus.</span>—There are several distinct kinds of aromatic reed in the East. One sort, according to Pliny (H. N., xii. 22), grew in Syria, near Mount Lebanon; others were found in India and Arabia. It is quite uncertain what particular species is intended, either here or in the other passages of Scripture where “sweet cane” is spoken of. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/4-14.htm" title="Spikenard and saffron; calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense; myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices:">Song of Solomon 4:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-24.htm" title="You have bought me no sweet cane with money, neither have you filled me with the fat of your sacrifices: but you have made me to serve with your sins, you have wearied me with your iniquities.">Isaiah 43:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-20.htm" title="To what purpose comes there to me incense from Sheba, and the sweet cane from a far country? your burnt offerings are not acceptable, nor your sacrifices sweet to me.">Jeremiah 6:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-17.htm" title="Judah, and the land of Israel, they were your merchants: they traded in your market wheat of Minnith, and Pannag, and honey, and oil, and balm.">Ezekiel 27:17</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/exodus/30.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-23.htm" title="Take you also to you principal spices, of pure myrrh five hundred shekels, and of sweet cinnamon half so much, even two hundred and fifty shekels, and of sweet calamus two hundred and fifty shekels,">Exodus 30:23</a></span>. Interpreters are not agreed concerning these ingredients: the spices, which were in all near half a hundred weight, were to be infused in the oil, which was to be about five or six quarts, and then strained out, leaving an admirable smell in the oil. With this oil God’s tent and all the furniture of it were to be anointed; it was to be used also in the consecration of the priests. It was to be continued throughout their generations, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-31.htm" title="And you shall speak to the children of Israel, saying, This shall be an holy anointing oil to me throughout your generations.">Exodus 30:31</a>. Solomon was anointed with it, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-39.htm" title="And Zadok the priest took an horn of oil out of the tabernacle, and anointed Solomon. And they blew the trumpet; and all the people said, God save king Solomon.">1 Kings 1:39</a>, and some other of the kings, and all the high-priests, with such a quantity of it, as that it ran down to the skirts of the garments; and we read of the making it up, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-30.htm" title="And some of the sons of the priests made the ointment of the spices.">1 Chronicles 9:30</a>. Yet all agree, that in the second temple there was none of this holy oil, which was probably owing to a notion they had, that it was not lawful to make it up; Providence overruling that want as a presage of the better unction of the Holy Ghost in gospel times, the variety of whose gifts are typified by these sweet ingredients.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/30.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>30:22-38 Directions are here given for making the holy anointing oil, and the incense to be used in the service of the tabernacle. To show the excellency of holiness, there was this spiced oil in the tabernacle, which was grateful to the sight and to the smell. Christ's name is as ointment poured forth, So 1:3, and the good name of Christians is like precious ointment, Ec 7:1. The incense burned upon the golden altar was prepared of sweet spices. When it was used, it was to be beaten very small; thus it pleased the Lord to bruise the Redeemer, when he offered himself for a sacrifice of a sweet-smelling savour. The like should not be made for any common use. Thus God would keep in the people's minds reverence for his own services, and teach us not to profane or abuse any thing whereby God makes himself known. It is a great affront to God to jest with sacred things, and to make sport with his word and ordinances. It is most dangerous and fatal to use professions of the gospel of Christ to forward wordly interests.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/30.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Principal spices - i. e. the best spices.<p>Pure myrrh - Is a gum which comes from the stem of a low, thorny, ragged tree, that grows in Arabia Felix and Eastern Africa, called by botanists Balsamodendron myrrha.

To make the anointing oil with, and are as follow: <p>of pure myrrh five hundred shekels; it is strange that Saadiah, and so Maimonides (f), should take this for musk, which comes from a beast, and is confuted by Aben Ezra from Sol 5:1 from whence it plainly appears to be what comes from a tree; and the word "mor", here used, gives the tree the name of myrrh almost in all languages. And it is justly mentioned first among the chief of spices; since, as Pliny (g) says, none is preferred unto the stacte or liquor that flows from it, that which is pure myrrh, unmixed, unadulterated; or "myrrh of freedom" (h), which flows freely, either of itself, or, when cut, which is the best; and this was fitly used as a principal ingredient in the anointing oil, since oil was made out of it itself, called oil of myrrh, <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/2-12.htm">Esther 2:12</a> and as a shekel is generally supposed to weigh half an ounce, the quantity of this to be taken was two hundred and fifty ounces: <p>and of sweet cinnamon half so much, even two hundred and fifty shekels; or one hundred twenty five ounces: it is here called sweet cinnamon, to distinguish it from that which was not sweet; so Jarchi observes,"there is one sort that has a good smell and taste, another that has not, but is as wood (common wood), therefore it was necessary to say sweet cinnamon.''So Pliny (i) speaks of two sorts of it, one whiter, and another blacker; sometimes the white is preferred, and sometimes the black is commended. The cinnamon tree grows in great plenty in the island of Zeilon in India (Ceylon or called Srilanka today, Editor), as Vartomanus (k) relates, who says it is not much unlike a bay tree, especially the leaves; it beareth berries as does the bay tree, but less and white; it is doubtless no other than the bark of a tree, and gathered in this manner; every third year they cut the branches of the tree--when it is first gathered it is not yet so sweet, but a month after, when it waxeth dry; and with this Pliny (l) agrees, who says it is not odorous while it is green. Pancirollus (m) reckons cinnamon among the things that are lost; and says, that we have no knowledge of the true cinnamon; and reports from Galen, that in his time it was so scarce, that it was rarely found but in the cabinets of emperors. Pliny (n) makes mention of it, as used in ointments: <p>and of sweet calamus two hundred and fifty shekels; or one hundred and twenty five ounces; and this is called sweet, because there is a calamus that is not sweet, as Jarchi; this is the same with the sweet cane from a far country, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-20.htm">Jeremiah 6:20</a> from India, as is generally thought; but rather perhaps from Sheba, or some part of Arabia; it must be nearer at hand than India, from whence the Israelites had these spices; and Moses is bid to take them, as if they were near indeed; and Pliny speaks of myrrh, and of sweet calamus, as growing in many places of Arabia, and of cinnamon in Syria (o); and Dionysius Periegetes (p) mentions calamus along with frankincense, myrrh, and cassia, and calls it sweet smelling calamus; and so Strabo (q) speaks of cassia and cinnamon as in Arabia Felix; and Diodorus Siculus (r) makes mention of all these in Arabia, and of cassia that follows. <p>(f) Cele Hamikdash, c. 1. sect. 3.((g) Nat.

Pliny notices an ointment which was composed of twenty-six ingredients, chiefly spices (H.N. 13:2, &sect; 18). Herodotus mentions five "principal spices" as furnished by Arabia (3:107), of which four seem to be identical with those employed in the holy oil. <span class="cmt_word">Pure myrrh</span>. Literally, "myrrh of freedom," or "freely flowing myrrh." The shrub which yields myrrh (<span class="accented">Balsamodendron myrrha</span>) produces two kinds - one, which exudes spontaneously, and is regarded as the best (Plin. II. 4:12:35; Theophrast. <span class="accented">De Odoribus</span>, &sect; 29); and another, of inferior quality, which flows from incisions made in the bark. It is the former kind which is here intended. Myrrh was among the ancients in high request as a spice. It was used by the Egyptians for embalming (Herod 2:86), in Persia as an odour (Athen. <span class="accented">Deipn</span>, 12. p. 514, A); by the Greeks for incense (Soph. Fr. 340) and in unguents (Aristoph <span class="accented">Eq</span> 1. 1332); by the later Jews in funerals (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-39.htm">John 19:39</a>); and was largely exported from Arabia and Ethiopia into various parts of Asia and Europe. <span class="cmt_word">Sweet</span> <span class="cmt_word">cinnamon</span>. Cinnamon was a far rarer spice than myrrh.

I am not aware of any trace of it in Egypt; but Herodotus says that it was obtained by the Greeks from Arabia in his day (3:111). It is the inner bark or rind of a tree allied to the laurel, and called by some <span class="accented">Laurus cinnamomum</span>, by others <span class="accented">Cinnamomum zeylanicum</span>. The tree now grows only in India on the Malabar coast, in Ceylon, Borneo, Sumatra, Cochin China, and China. If its habitat has not suffered contraction, we must regard the mention of it here as indicative of a very early commerce of a very extensive character. <span class="cmt_word">Sweet</span> <span class="cmt_word">calamus</span>. Aromatic reeds, probably of several distinct kind, seem to have been the produce anciently of Palestine, Arabia, Mesopotamia, and India. It is impossible to say what exactly was the species here intended. Calamus is mentioned as a spice in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-24.htm">Isaiah 43:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-20.htm">Jeremiah 6:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-17.htm">Ezekiel 27:17</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/4-14.htm">Song of Solomon 4:14</a>; but the term used (kaneh, "cane ") is vague; and it is not at all clear that one species only is alluded to. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/exodus/30.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/38-8.htm">Exodus 38:8</a>). The Brazen Laver, and its use. - The making of this vessel is not only mentioned in a supplementary manner, but no description is given of it because of the subordinate position which it occupied, and from the fact that it was not directly connected with the sanctuary, but was only used by the priests to cleanse themselves for the performance of their duties. &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;: a basin, a round, caldron-shaped vessel. &#1499;&#1468;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493; (its support): by this we are not to understand the pedestal of the caldron, but something separate from the basin, which was no doubt used for drawing off as much water as was required for washing the officiating priests. For although &#1499;&#1468;&#1503; belongs to &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;, the fact that it is always specially mentioned in connection with the basin necessarily leads to the conclusion, that it had a certain kind of independence (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/31-9.htm">Exodus 31:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/35-16.htm">Exodus 35:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/39-39.htm">Exodus 39:39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-11.htm">Exodus 40:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-11.htm">Leviticus 8:11</a>). These two vessels were to be made of brass or copper, like the other things in the court; and, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/38-8.htm">Exodus 38:8</a>, they were made of the brass of the mirrors of the women who served before the door of the tabernacle. &#1492;&#1510;&#1468;&#1489;&#1488;&#1514; &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1512;&#1488;&#1514; does not mean either "provided with mirrors of the women" (Bhr, i. pp. 485-6), or ornamented "with forms, figures of women, as they were accustomed to appear at the sanctuary" (Knobel). But these views are overthrown by the fact, that &#1489; never signifies with in the sense of an outward addition, but always denotes the means, "not an independent object, but something accompanying and contributing to the action referred to" (Ewald, 217, f. 3). In this case &#1489; can only apply to the material used, whether we connect it with &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474; as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/31-4.htm">Exodus 31:4</a>, or, what seems decidedly more correct, with &#1504;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514; as a more precise definition; so that &#1489; would denote that particular quality which distinguished the brass of which the basin was made (Ewald, 217f.), - apart altogether from the fact, that neither the mirrors of women, nor the figures of women, would form a fitting ornament for the basin, as the priests did not require to look at themselves when they washed their hands and feet; and there is still less ground for Knobel's fiction, that Levitical women went to the sanctuary at particular times, forming a certain procession, and taking things with them for the purpose of washing, cleaning, and polishing. The true meaning is given by the Septuagint, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;. According to <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-22.htm">1 Samuel 2:22</a>, the &#1510;&#1489;&#1488;&#1514; were women, though not washer-women, but women who dedicated their lives to the service of Jehovah, and spent them in religious exercises, in fasting and in prayer, like Anna, the daughter of Phanuel, mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-37.htm">Luke 2:37</a>.<p>(Note: Knobel's objection to this explanation, viz., that "at a time when the sanctuary was not yet erected, the author could not speak of women as coming to the door of the sanctuary, or performing religious service there," would contain its own refutation, if there were any ground for it at all. For before the sanctuary was erected, the author could not speak of Levitical women as coming at particular times to the sanctuary, and bringing things with them for the purpose of washing and cleaning. But the participle &#1510;&#1489;&#1488;&#1514; does not imply that they had served there before the erection of the sanctuary, but only that from that time forward, they did perform service there.)<p>&#1510;&#1489;&#1488; denotes spiritual warfare, and is accordingly rendered by the lxx &#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, by Onkelos, orare, with which the Rabbins agree. The mirrors of the women had been used for the purpose of earthly adorning. But now the pious Israelites renounced this earthly adorning, and offered it to the Lord as a heave-offering to make the purifying laver in front of the sanctuary, in order that "what had hitherto served as a means of procuring applause in the world might henceforth be the means of procuring the approbation of God" (Hengstenberg, Dissert. vol. ii.). - The laver was to be placed between the tabernacle, i.e., the dwelling, and the altar in the court (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-18.htm">Exodus 30:18</a>), probably not in a straight line with the door of the dwelling and the altar of burnt-offering, but more sideways, so as to be convenient for the use of the priests, whether they were going into the tabernacle, or going up to the altar for service, to kindle a firing for Jehovah, i.e., to offer sacrifice upon the altar. They were to wash their hands, with which they touched the holy things, and their feet, with which they trod the holy ground (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-5.htm">Exodus 3:5</a>), "that they might not die," as is again emphatically stated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-20.htm">Exodus 30:20</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-21.htm">Exodus 30:21</a>. For touching holy things with unclean hands, and treading upon the floor of the sanctuary with dirty feet, would have been a sin against Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel, deserving of death. These directions do not imply "that, notwithstanding all their consecration, they were regarded as still defiled by natural uncleanness" (Baumgarten), but rather that consecration did not stamp them with a character indelebilis, or protect them from the impurities of the sinful nation in the midst of which they lived, or of their own nature, which was still affected with mortal corruption and sin. </body></html>
