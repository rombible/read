Neither of the two holy compounds were to be applied to any profane use.<p><span class= "bld"><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/30.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>30:22-38 Directions are here given for making the holy anointing oil, and the incense to be used in the service of the tabernacle. To show the excellency of holiness, there was this spiced oil in the tabernacle, which was grateful to the sight and to the smell. Christ's name is as ointment poured forth, So 1:3, and the good name of Christians is like precious ointment, Ec 7:1. The incense burned upon the golden altar was prepared of sweet spices. When it was used, it was to be beaten very small; thus it pleased the Lord to bruise the Redeemer, when he offered himself for a sacrifice of a sweet-smelling savour. The like should not be made for any common use. Thus God would keep in the people's minds reverence for his own services, and teach us not to profane or abuse any thing whereby God makes himself known. It is a great affront to God to jest with sacred things, and to make sport with his word and ordinances. It is most dangerous and fatal to use professions of the gospel of Christ to forward wordly interests.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/30.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/30-32.htm">Exodus 30:32-33</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/exodus/30.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>34-38. the Lord said unto Moses, Take unto thee sweet spices&#8212;These were:<p>stacte&#8212;the finest myrrh;<p>onycha&#8212;supposed to be an odoriferous shell;<p>galbanum&#8212;a gum resin from an umbelliferous plant.<p>frankincense&#8212;a dry, resinous, aromatic gum, of a yellow color, which comes from a tree in Arabia, and is obtained by incision of the bark. This incense was placed within the sanctuary, to be at hand when the priest required to burn on the altar. The art of compounding unguents and perfumes was well known in Egypt, where sweet-scented spices were extensively used not only in common life, but in the ritual of the temples. Most of the ingredients here mentioned have been found on minute examination of mummies and other Egyptian relics; and the Israelites, therefore, would have the best opportunities of acquiring in that country the skill in pounding and mixing them which they were called to exercise in the service of the tabernacle. But the recipe for the incense as well as for the oil in the tabernacle, though it receives illustration from the customs of Egypt, was peculiar, and being prescribed by divine authority, was to be applied to no common or inferior purpose.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/exodus/30.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/exodus/30.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And as for the perfume which thou shalt make,....

This anointing oil was holy, either because it was made from the four fragrant substances according to the proportions commanded by Jehovah, or because God declared this kind of mixture and preparation holy (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-32.htm">Exodus 30:32</a>), and forbade for all time, on pain of death (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-31.htm">Exodus 30:31</a>), not only the use of ointment so prepared for any ordinary anointings, but even an imitation of it. "Upon man's flesh shall it not be poured," i.e., it is not to be used for the ordinary practice of anointing the human body (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-32.htm">Exodus 30:32</a>).
