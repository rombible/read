Thus, so long as the tabernacle stood, the precious metal paid as ransom remained in the sight of the people, and was a continual <span class= "ital">“</span>memorial,” or reminder, to them of the position into which they were brought by covenant with God.<p><span class= "bld"><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/30.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>30:11-16 The tribute was half a shekel, about fifteen pence of our money. The rich were not to give more, nor the poor less; the souls of the rich and poor are alike precious, and God is no respecter of persons, Ac 10:34; Job 34:19. In other offerings men were to give according to their wordly ability; but this, which was the ransom of the soul, must be alike for all. The souls of all are of equal value, equally in danger, and all equally need a ransom. The money raised was to be used in the service of the tabernacle. Those who have the benefit, must not grudge the necessary charges of God's public worship. Money cannot make atonement for the soul, but it may be used for the honour of Him who has made the atonement, and for the maintenance of the gospel by which the atonement is applied.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/30.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>tabernacle of the congregation - tent of meeting, here and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/30-18.htm">Exodus 30:18</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/30-20.htm">Exodus 30:20</a>,<p>A memorial unto the children of Israel - The silver used in the tabernacle was a memorial to remind each man of his position before the Lord, as one of the covenanted people. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/exodus/30.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11-16. When thou takest the sum of the children of Israel, &c.&#8212;Moses did so twice, and doubtless observed the law here prescribed. The tax was not levied from women, minors, old men (Nu 1:42, 45), and the Levites (Nu 1:47), they being not numbered. Assuming the shekel of the sanctuary to be about half an ounce troy, though nothing certain is known about it, the sum payable by each individual was two and four pence. This was not a voluntary contribution, but a ransom for the soul or lives of the people. It was required from all classes alike, and a refusal to pay implied a wilful exclusion from the privileges of the sanctuary, as well as exposure to divine judgments. It was probably the same impost that was exacted from our Lord (Mt 17:24-27), and it was usually devoted to repairs and other purposes connected with the services of the sanctuary.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/exodus/30.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">For the service of the tabernacle</span>; for the building and furniture of it, and the maintenance of God’s worship in it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">That it may be a memorial</span>; either to the people, who hereby profess God to be their Lord and Owner, and themselves his subjects and tributaries; or to God, who hereby takes occasion to remember them, and to own them for his people. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/exodus/30.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And thou shall take the atonement money of the children of Israel,....

In the second clause we have "upon it" (the altar) instead of "upon the horns of it," because the altar itself was expiated in its horns. The use of &#1502;&#1503; in &#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1501; is to be explained on the ground that only a part of the blood of the sin-offering was smeared with the finger upon the horns. (For further remarks, see at <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-18.htm">Leviticus 16:18-19</a>.) The term "most holy" is not only applied to this altar, in common with the inner division of the tabernacle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/26-33.htm">Exodus 26:33</a>), but also to the altar of burnt-offering (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-37.htm">Exodus 29:37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-10.htm">Exodus 40:10</a>), and all the vessels of the sanctuary (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-29.htm">Exodus 30:29</a>), which were anointed with holy oil; then to the whole of the tabernacle in its holiest aspect (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-10.htm">Numbers 18:10</a>); and lastly, to all the sacrifices, which were given up entirely to Jehovah (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-3.htm">Leviticus 2:3</a>); - consequently to everything which stood in so intimate a relation to Jehovah as to be altogether removed, not only from use and enjoyment on the part of man, but also from contact on the part of unsanctified men. Whoever touched a most holy thing was sanctified thereby (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-29.htm">Exodus 30:29</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-37.htm">Exodus 29:37</a>). </body></html>
