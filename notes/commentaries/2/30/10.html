This was to intimate, that the sins of the priests who ministered at this altar, and of the people for whom they ministered, put a ceremonial impurity upon it, from which it must be cleansed by the blood of atonement. This altar typified the mediation of Christ: the brazen altar in the court was a type of Christ dying on earth; the golden altar in the sanctuary was a type of Christ interceding in heaven.

When a census of the people is taken, every man is to pay half a (silver) shekel to Jehovah as a ransom for his life, that no ‘plague’ break out among the people: the proceeds of the tax to be applied to the maintenance of the daily services in the sanctuary. It must have been a popular belief, current at the time when this law was drawn up, that a census was dangerous to the lives of the persons numbered (cf. 2 Samuel 24), whether because it was likely to give rise to feelings of self-satisfaction and pride, or because it tended to bring the sins and imperfections of individuals prominently before God’s notice: every adult male of the community was therefore to pay a ‘ransom’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-30.htm" title="If there be laid on him a sum of money, then he shall give for the ransom of his life whatever is laid on him.">Exodus 21:30</a>) for his life, by which he, as it were, purchased it for himself and secured it against peril of death.

This was not making it an altar of expiation, but merely expiating it. There was, however, another use for the altar, where it seems to have served for an altar of expiation. When the high priest had sinned in his official character, and offered a sin-offering for his cleansing (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-3.htm">Leviticus 4:3-12</a>), or when the whole congregation had committed an offence through inadvertence, and did the same (<span class="accented">ib</span>, 13-21), the high priest was to put of the blood of the sacrifice on the horns of the altar of incense, "for the expiation of his own sin and the sin of the people" (Keil). In these two cases, the altar of incense served the purpose of the altar of burnt-offering, on which was put the blood of private sin-offerings (<span class="accented">ib</span>, 22-35). <span class="cmt_word">It is most holy</span>. There seems to be sufficient reason for considering the altar of incense as, next to the ark and mercy seat, the most sacred object in the furniture of the tabernacle. This precedence indicates the extreme value which God sets upon prayer. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 30:11-16 <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/exodus/30.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Altar of Incense and Incense-Offering bring the directions concerning the sanctuary to a close. What follows, from <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/30-11.htm">Exodus 30:11-31:17</a>, is shown to be merely supplementary to the larger whole by the formula "and Jehovah spake unto Moses," with which every separate command is introduced (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/30-11.htm">Exodus 30:11</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/30-17.htm">Exodus 30:17</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/30-22.htm">Exodus 30:22</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/30-24.htm">Exodus 30:24</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/31-1.htm">Exodus 31:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/31-12.htm">Exodus 31:12</a>).<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/30-1.htm">Exodus 30:1-6</a><p>(cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/37-25.htm">Exodus 37:25-28</a>). Moses was directed to make an altar of burning of incense (lit., incensing of incense), of acacia-wood, one cubit long and one broad, four-cornered, two cubits high, furnished with horns like the altar of burnt-offering (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/27-1.htm">Exodus 27:1-2</a>), and to plate it with pure gold, the roof (&#1490;&#1468;&#1490;) thereof (i.e., its upper side or surface, which was also made of wood), and its walls round about, and its horns; so that it was covered with gold quite down to the ground upon which it stood, and for this reason is often called the golden altar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/39-38.htm">Exodus 39:38</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/40-5.htm">Exodus 40:5</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-26.htm">Exodus 40:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/4-11.htm">Numbers 4:11</a>). Moreover it was to be ornamented with a golden wreath, and furnished with golden rings at the corners for the carrying-poles, as the ark of the covenant and the table of shew-bread were (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-11.htm">Exodus 25:11</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-25.htm">Exodus 25:25</a>.); and its place was to be in front of the curtain, which concealed the ark of the covenant (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/26-31.htm">Exodus 26:31</a>), "before the capporeth" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-5.htm">Exodus 40:5</a>), so that, although it really stood in the holy place between the candlestick on the south side and the table on the north (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/26-35.htm">Exodus 26:35</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/40-22.htm">Exodus 40:22</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-24.htm">Exodus 40:24</a>), it was placed in the closest relation to the capporeth, and for this reason is not only connected with the most holy place in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-22.htm">1 Kings 6:22</a>, but is reckoned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-4.htm">Hebrews 9:4</a> as part of the furniture of the most holy place (see Delitzsch on <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-4.htm">Hebrews 9:4</a>).</body></html>
