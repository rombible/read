Hitherto, nothing but a rough estimate of the number had been attempted (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-37.htm" title="And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot that were men, beside children.">Exodus 12:37</a>); now that a covenant had been made with God, an exact account of those who were within the covenant was needed. Moses, apparently, was contemplating such an exact enumeration when the command contained in this text was given him. It would be natural for one trained in Egyptian habits to desire such exact statistical knowledge. (For the minuteness and fulness of the Egyptian statistics of the time, see <span class= "ital">Records of the Past, </span>vol. ii., pp. 19-28; vol. iv. pp. 46, 47; vol. vi. pp. 35-69, &c.)<p><span class= "bld">Then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul.</span>—On being formally enrolled among the people of God, it would be brought home to every man how unworthy he was of such favour, how necessary it was that atonement should in some way or other be made for him. God therefore appointed a way—the same way for all—in order to teach strongly that all souls were of equal value in His sight, and that unworthiness, whatever its degree, required the same expiation.<p><span class= "bld">That there be no plague among them.</span>—If a man did not feel his need of “ransom,” and gladly pay the small sum at which the ransom was fixed, he would show himself so proud and presumptuous that he might well provoke a Divine “plague,” or punishment.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/maclaren/exodus/30.htm">MacLaren's Expositions</a></div>Exodus<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">RANSOM FOR SOULS-I.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-12.htm" title="When you take the sum of the children of Israel after their number, then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul to the LORD, when you number them; that there be no plague among them, when you number them.">Exodus 30:12</a></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> This remarkable provision had a religious intention. Connect it with the tax-money which Peter found in the fish’s mouth.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="bld">I. Its meaning.</span> Try to realise an Israelite’s thoughts at the census. ‘I am enrolled among the people and army of God: am I worthy? What am I, to serve so holy a God?’ The payment was meant-<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> {<span class="ital">a</span>} To excite the sense of sin. This should be present in all approach to God, in all service; accompanying the recognition of our Christian standing. Our sense of sin is far too slight and weak; this defect is at the root of much feebleness in popular religion. The sense of sin must embrace not outward acts only, but inner spirit also.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> {<span class="ital">b</span>} To suggest the possibility of expiation. It was ‘ransom’ <span class="ital">i.e.</span> ‘covering,’ something paid that guilt might be taken away and sin regarded as non-existent. This is, of course, obviously, only a symbol. No tax could satisfy God for sin. The very smallness of the amount shows that it is symbolical only. ‘Not with corruptible things as silver’ is man redeemed.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="bld">II. Its identity for all.</span> Rich or poor, high or low, all men are equal in sin. There are surface differences and degrees, but a deep identity beneath. So on the same principle all souls are of the same value. Here is the true democracy of Christianity. So there is one ransom for all, for the need of all is identical.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="bld">III. Its use.</span> It was melted down for use in the sanctuary, so as to be a ‘memorial’ permanently present to God when His people met with Him. The greater portion was made into bases for the boards of the sanctuary. That is, God’s dwelling with men and our communion with Him all rest on the basis of ransom. We are ‘brought nigh by the blood of Christ.’<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/exodus/30.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-12.htm" title="When you take the sum of the children of Israel after their number, then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul to the LORD, when you number them; that there be no plague among them, when you number them.">Exodus 30:12</a></span>. <span class="ital">Every man a ransom for his soul — </span>Some think this refers only to the first numbering of them, when the tabernacle was set up, and that this tax was to make up what was wanting in the voluntary contributions.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Others think it was to be always when the people were numbered; and that David offended in not demanding it when he numbered the people. But many of the Jewish writers are of opinion it was to be an annual tribute; only it was begun when Moses first numbered the people. This was that tribute-money which Christ paid, lest he should offend his adversaries. The tribute to be paid was <span class="ital">half a shekel, </span>about fifteen pence of our money. In other offerings men were to give according to their ability; but this, which was the <span class="ital">ransom of the soul, </span>must be alike for all; for the rich have as much need of Christ as the poor, and the poor are as welcome to him as the rich. And this was to be paid a <span class="ital">ransom of the soul, that there might be no plague among them — </span>Hereby they acknowledged that they received their lives from God, that they had forfeited their lives to him, and that they depended upon his power and patience for the continuance of them; and thus they did homage to the God of their lives, and deprecated those plagues which their sins had deserved. This money was employed in the service of the tabernacle; with it they bought sacrifices, flour, incense, wine, oil, fuel, salt, priests’ garments, and all other things which the whole congregation was interested in.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/30.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>30:11-16 The tribute was half a shekel, about fifteen pence of our money. The rich were not to give more, nor the poor less; the souls of the rich and poor are alike precious, and God is no respecter of persons, Ac 10:34; Job 34:19. In other offerings men were to give according to their wordly ability; but this, which was the ransom of the soul, must be alike for all. The souls of all are of equal value, equally in danger, and all equally need a ransom. The money raised was to be used in the service of the tabernacle. Those who have the benefit, must not grudge the necessary charges of God's public worship. Money cannot make atonement for the soul, but it may be used for the honour of Him who has made the atonement, and for the maintenance of the gospel by which the atonement is applied.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/30.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Ransom of Souls. - <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/38-25.htm">Exodus 38:25-28</a>. On comparing these words with those of <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/1-1.htm">Numbers 1:1-3</a>, we may perhaps infer that the first passage relates to a mere counting of the adult Israelites at the time when the money was taken from each, and that what the latter passage enjoins was a formal enrolment of them according to their genealogies and their order of military service.<p>A ransom for his soul - What the sincere worshipper thus paid was at once the fruit and the sign of his faith in the goodness of Yahweh, who had redeemed him and brought him into the covenant. Hence, the payment is rightly called a ransom inasmuch as it involved a personal appropriation of the fact of his redemption. On the word soul, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>.<p>That there be no plague - i. e. that they might not incur punishment for the neglect and contempt of spiritual privileges.

When thou takest the sum of the children of Israel, &c.&#8212;Moses did so twice, and doubtless observed the law here prescribed. The tax was not levied from women, minors, old men (Nu 1:42, 45), and the Levites (Nu 1:47), they being not numbered. Assuming the shekel of the sanctuary to be about half an ounce troy, though nothing certain is known about it, the sum payable by each individual was two and four pence. This was not a voluntary contribution, but a ransom for the soul or lives of the people. It was required from all classes alike, and a refusal to pay implied a wilful exclusion from the privileges of the sanctuary, as well as exposure to divine judgments. It was probably the same impost that was exacted from our Lord (Mt 17:24-27), and it was usually devoted to repairs and other purposes connected with the services of the sanctuary.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/exodus/30.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">A ransom for his soul</span>; a certain price for the redemption of their lives; whereby they acknowledge the right and power which God had over their lives, and that they had forfeited them by their sins, and that it was God’s mercy to continue their lives to them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">When thou numberest them</span>, to wit, upon any just occasion, either now in the wilderness, or afterwards.
