To show the excellency of holiness, there was this spiced oil in the tabernacle, which was grateful to the sight and to the smell. Christ's name is as ointment poured forth, So 1:3, and the good name of Christians is like precious ointment, Ec 7:1. The incense burned upon the golden altar was prepared of sweet spices. When it was used, it was to be beaten very small; thus it pleased the Lord to bruise the Redeemer, when he offered himself for a sacrifice of a sweet-smelling savour. The like should not be made for any common use. Thus God would keep in the people's minds reverence for his own services, and teach us not to profane or abuse any thing whereby God makes himself known. It is a great affront to God to jest with sacred things, and to make sport with his word and ordinances. It is most dangerous and fatal to use professions of the gospel of Christ to forward wordly interests.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/30.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Cassia - is the inner bark of an Indian tree (Cinnamomum cassia), which differs from that which produces cinnamon in the shape of its leaves and some other particulars.

The modern cassia is the inner bark of a tree distinct from the cinnamon tree, known to botanists as Cinnamo-mum cassia, which is a native of India, Java, and the Malay peninsula. In taste and scent, it "bears a strong resemblance to cinnamon, but is more pungent and of coarser texture" (Cook). It is uncertain, however, if this is the spice here indicated. The Hebrew word used is <span class="accented">kiddah</span>, not <span class="accented">ketsioth</span> (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-8.htm">Psalm 45:8</a>); and it is very doubtful whether the two are identical On the shekel of the sanctuary.  see the comment on ver. 13; and on the kin, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-40.htm">Exodus 29:40</a>. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/exodus/30.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/38-8.htm">Exodus 38:8</a>). The Brazen Laver, and its use. - The making of this vessel is not only mentioned in a supplementary manner, but no description is given of it because of the subordinate position which it occupied, and from the fact that it was not directly connected with the sanctuary, but was only used by the priests to cleanse themselves for the performance of their duties. &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;: a basin, a round, caldron-shaped vessel. &#1499;&#1468;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493; (its support): by this we are not to understand the pedestal of the caldron, but something separate from the basin, which was no doubt used for drawing off as much water as was required for washing the officiating priests. For although &#1499;&#1468;&#1503; belongs to &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;, the fact that it is always specially mentioned in connection with the basin necessarily leads to the conclusion, that it had a certain kind of independence (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/31-9.htm">Exodus 31:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/35-16.htm">Exodus 35:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/39-39.htm">Exodus 39:39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-11.htm">Exodus 40:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-11.htm">Leviticus 8:11</a>). These two vessels were to be made of brass or copper, like the other things in the court; and, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/38-8.htm">Exodus 38:8</a>, they were made of the brass of the mirrors of the women who served before the door of the tabernacle. &#1492;&#1510;&#1468;&#1489;&#1488;&#1514; &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1512;&#1488;&#1514; does not mean either "provided with mirrors of the women" (Bhr, i. pp. 485-6), or ornamented "with forms, figures of women, as they were accustomed to appear at the sanctuary" (Knobel). But these views are overthrown by the fact, that &#1489; never signifies with in the sense of an outward addition, but always denotes the means, "not an independent object, but something accompanying and contributing to the action referred to" (Ewald, 217, f. 3). In this case &#1489; can only apply to the material used, whether we connect it with &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474; as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/31-4.htm">Exodus 31:4</a>, or, what seems decidedly more correct, with &#1504;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514; as a more precise definition; so that &#1489; would denote that particular quality which distinguished the brass of which the basin was made (Ewald, 217f.), - apart altogether from the fact, that neither the mirrors of women, nor the figures of women, would form a fitting ornament for the basin, as the priests did not require to look at themselves when they washed their hands and feet; and there is still less ground for Knobel's fiction, that Levitical women went to the sanctuary at particular times, forming a certain procession, and taking things with them for the purpose of washing, cleaning, and polishing. The true meaning is given by the Septuagint, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;. According to <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-22.htm">1 Samuel 2:22</a>, the &#1510;&#1489;&#1488;&#1514; were women, though not washer-women, but women who dedicated their lives to the service of Jehovah, and spent them in religious exercises, in fasting and in prayer, like Anna, the daughter of Phanuel, mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-37.htm">Luke 2:37</a>.<p>(Note: Knobel's objection to this explanation, viz., that "at a time when the sanctuary was not yet erected, the author could not speak of women as coming to the door of the sanctuary, or performing religious service there," would contain its own refutation, if there were any ground for it at all. For before the sanctuary was erected, the author could not speak of Levitical women as coming at particular times to the sanctuary, and bringing things with them for the purpose of washing and cleaning. But the participle &#1510;&#1489;&#1488;&#1514; does not imply that they had served there before the erection of the sanctuary, but only that from that time forward, they did perform service there.)<p>&#1510;&#1489;&#1488; denotes spiritual warfare, and is accordingly rendered by the lxx &#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, by Onkelos, orare, with which the Rabbins agree. The mirrors of the women had been used for the purpose of earthly adorning. But now the pious Israelites renounced this earthly adorning, and offered it to the Lord as a heave-offering to make the purifying laver in front of the sanctuary, in order that "what had hitherto served as a means of procuring applause in the world might henceforth be the means of procuring the approbation of God" (Hengstenberg, Dissert. vol. ii.). - The laver was to be placed between the tabernacle, i.e., the dwelling, and the altar in the court (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-18.htm">Exodus 30:18</a>), probably not in a straight line with the door of the dwelling and the altar of burnt-offering, but more sideways, so as to be convenient for the use of the priests, whether they were going into the tabernacle, or going up to the altar for service, to kindle a firing for Jehovah, i.e., to offer sacrifice upon the altar. They were to wash their hands, with which they touched the holy things, and their feet, with which they trod the holy ground (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-5.htm">Exodus 3:5</a>), "that they might not die," as is again emphatically stated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-20.htm">Exodus 30:20</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-21.htm">Exodus 30:21</a>. For touching holy things with unclean hands, and treading upon the floor of the sanctuary with dirty feet, would have been a sin against Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel, deserving of death. These directions do not imply "that, notwithstanding all their consecration, they were regarded as still defiled by natural uncleanness" (Baumgarten), but rather that consecration did not stamp them with a character indelebilis, or protect them from the impurities of the sinful nation in the midst of which they lived, or of their own nature, which was still affected with mortal corruption and sin. </body></html>
