To show the excellency of holiness, there was this spiced oil in the tabernacle, which was grateful to the sight and to the smell. Christ's name is as ointment poured forth, So 1:3, and the good name of Christians is like precious ointment, Ec 7:1. The incense burned upon the golden altar was prepared of sweet spices. When it was used, it was to be beaten very small; thus it pleased the Lord to bruise the Redeemer, when he offered himself for a sacrifice of a sweet-smelling savour. The like should not be made for any common use. Thus God would keep in the people's minds reverence for his own services, and teach us not to profane or abuse any thing whereby God makes himself known. It is a great affront to God to jest with sacred things, and to make sport with his word and ordinances. It is most dangerous and fatal to use professions of the gospel of Christ to forward wordly interests.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/30.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Upon man's flesh - i. e. on the persons of those who were not priests who might employ it for such anointing as was usual on festive occasions (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-15.htm">Psalm 104:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/27-9.htm">Proverbs 27:9</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/6-17.htm">Matthew 6:17</a>, etc.).<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/exodus/30.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>24. cassia&#8212;from the same species of tree as the cinnamon&#8212;some think the outer bark of that tree.

This anointing oil was holy, either because it was made from the four fragrant substances according to the proportions commanded by Jehovah, or because God declared this kind of mixture and preparation holy (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-32.htm">Exodus 30:32</a>), and forbade for all time, on pain of death (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-31.htm">Exodus 30:31</a>), not only the use of ointment so prepared for any ordinary anointings, but even an imitation of it. "Upon man's flesh shall it not be poured," i.e., it is not to be used for the ordinary practice of anointing the human body (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-32.htm">Exodus 30:32</a>).
