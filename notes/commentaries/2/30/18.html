It was also essential that it should be near the entrance into the tabernacle, since they had likewise to wash before they entered into the holy place.

This was designed to teach them purity in all their ministrations, and to possess them with a reverence of God’s holiness, and a dread of the pollutions of sin.

The bronze for the "Laver of brass" and its foot was supplied from the bronze mirrors of the women who voluntarily gave up these articles of luxury. Bronze mirrors were much used by the ancient Egyptians. No hint is given as to the form of the laver. The brazen sea and the ten lavers that served the same purpose in the temple of Solomon, were elaborately worked in artistic designs and are minutely described <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-23.htm">1 Kings 7:23-29</a>.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/exodus/30.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18-21. Thou shalt &#8230; make a laver of brass&#8212;Though not actually forming a component part of the furniture of the tabernacle, this vase was closely connected with it; and though from standing at the entrance it would be a familiar object, it possessed great interest and importance from the baptismal purposes to which it was applied. No data are given by which its form and size can be ascertained; but it was probably a miniature pattern of Solomon's&#8212;a circular basin.<p>his foot&#8212;supposed not to be the pedestal on which it rested, but a trough or shallow receptacle below, into which the water, let out from a cock or spout, flowed; for the way in which all Eastern people wash their hands or feet is by pouring upon them the water which falls into a basin. This laver was provided for the priests alone. But in the Christian dispensation, all believers are priests, and hence the apostle exhorts them how to draw near to God (Joh 13:10; Heb 10:22).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/exodus/30.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> See the accomplishment <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/38-8.htm" title="And he made the laver of brass, and the foot of it of brass, of the mirrors of the women assembling, which assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.">Exodus 38:8</a></span>; <span class="bld">to wash</span> both the priests and the parts of the sacrifices.

For Aaron, and his sons, and the priests in succession, to wash at before their entrance on their ministry; and denotes in general the necessity of purity, in order to minister in the priestly office; and which was in its perfection in Christ, who being holy and harmless, was an high priest becoming us, and suitable to us, qualified to offer himself without spot to God, and to take away sin; of which purity his baptism in water might be a symbol, which he submitted to before he entered publicly on the execution of his office as a prophet and priest; and as this may respect the ministers of the Gospel, it shows that they should be pure and holy in their lives and conversations, and be examples in purity of conversation to others: and as this may chiefly respect all the saints who are priests unto God; it may be either typical of the laver of regeneration, in which grace, comparable to water, is given, and in which a clean heart is created; and which has an influence on purity of life and conversation, and secures from death: or rather of the blood of Christ, the laver and fountain to wash in for sin and uncleanness; which is large and capacious for all the priests of the Lord, and stands open and uncovered for all to come unto; and as this was made of brass, and that brass the looking glasses of the women, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/38-8.htm">Exodus 38:8</a> as it may respect the laver of regeneration, may denote the durableness of that grace, which is an immortal seed, a well of living water, springing up to everlasting life, and was a clear evidence of election of God, and redemption by Christ; and as it may be an emblem of the blood of Christ, it signifies the duration and continued virtue of that blood to cleanse from all sin; and that such who are washed in it, and cleansed by it, are not only beheld as clean and pure by the Lord, but in their own sight also, God having caused their iniquities to pass from them, and justified them from them by his blood: <p>and thou shalt put it between the tabernacle of the congregation and the altar; that is, the altar of burnt offering, which was by the door of the tabernacle; and between that and the tabernacle or tent of the congregation stood the laver for the priests to wash in, just as they entered into the tabernacle, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-29.htm">Exodus 40:29</a> it stood inclining to one of the sides, as Aben Ezra says; a little on the south side, as Jarchi observes: <p>and thou shall put water therein; or order it to be put in for the use next mentioned. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/exodus/30.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Thou shalt also make a laver of brass, and his foot also of brass, to wash withal: and thou shalt put it between the tabernacle of the congregation and the altar, and thou shalt put water therein.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/exodus/30.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">18</span>. <span class="ital">Thou shalt also make</span>] Heb. <span class="bld">And</span> <span class="ital">thou shalt make</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">brass</span>] <span class="bld">bronze</span> or <span class="bld">copper</span>, as always: see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-3.htm" title="And this is the offering which you shall take of them; gold, and silver, and brass,">Exodus 25:3</a>.

It is remarkable that nothing is said respecting either the shape or the size of the laver. In 1 Kings we have an elaborate description of the "molten sea," which replaced it in Solomon's temple, as well as an almost equally elaborate one of ten other layers made by Hiram, Solomon's artist, at the same time. We may perhaps assume from these examples that the brazen laver of the tabernacle was a large bronze vase or basin, standing upon a stem, which was fixed into a base. It was probably fitted up with an apparatus of taps and cocks. <span class="cmt_word">Between the tabernacle .... and the altar</span>. The Rabbinical commentators say that it was not exactly in the middle, but a little towards the south side. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/exodus/30.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"When thou takest the sum of the children of Israel according to them that are numbered, they shall give every one an expiation for his soul to the Lord at their numbering, that a plague may not strike them (happen to them) at their numbering." &#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1491;, lit., adspexit, then inspexit explorandi causa, hence to review, or number an army or a nation, for the purpose of enrolling for military service. &#1500;&#1508;&#1511;&#1491;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; with reference to the numbered, qui in censum veniunt. &#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1512; (expiation, expiation-money, from &#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1512; to expiate) is to be traced to the idea that the object for which expiation was made was thereby withdrawn from the view of the person to be won or reconciled. It is applied in two ways: (1) on the supposition that the face of the person to be won was covered by the gift (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-21.htm">Genesis 32:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-3.htm">1 Samuel 12:3</a>); and (2) on the supposition that the guilt itself was covered up (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/32-1.htm">Psalm 32:1</a>), or wiped away (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-23.htm">Jeremiah 18:23</a>), so far as the eye of God was concerned, as though it had no longer any existence, and that the sinful man was protected from the punishment of the judge in consequence of this covering. In this way &#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1512; has acquired the meaning &#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, a payment by which the guilty are redeemed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-30.htm">Exodus 21:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/35-31.htm">Numbers 35:31</a>); and this is the meaning which it has in the passage before us, where the soul is said to be protected by the copher, so as to be able to come without danger into the presence of the holy God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/8-19.htm">Numbers 8:19</a>. See Oehler in Herzog's Cycl.). Such an approach to God took place at the numbering of the people for the purpose of enrolling them in the army of Jehovah (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/1-3.htm">Numbers 1:3</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-4.htm">Exodus 7:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-41.htm">Exodus 12:41</a>). Hence "every one who passed over to those that were numbered," who was enrolled among them, i.e., in the army of Jehovah, - that is to say, every male Israelite of 20 years old and upwards (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-14.htm">Exodus 30:14</a>), - was to pay half a shekel of the sanctuary as atonement-money; the rich no more, the poor no less (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-15.htm">Exodus 30:15</a>), because all were equal in the sight of Jehovah; and this payment was to be a "heave" (terumah, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-2.htm">Exodus 25:2</a>) for Jehovah for the expiation of the souls. The shekel of the sanctuary, which contained 20 gerahs, was no doubt the original shekel of full weight, as distinguished from the lighter shekel which was current in ordinary use. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/38-26.htm">Exodus 38:26</a> the half shekel is called &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1506;, lit., the split, i.e., half, from &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1506; to split; and we find it mentioned as early as the time of the patriarchs as a weight in common use for valuing gold (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-22.htm">Genesis 24:22</a>), so that, no doubt, even at that time there were distinct silver pieces of this weight, which were probably called shekels when employed for purposes of trade, since the word shekel itself does not denote any particular weight, as we may perceive at once form a comparison of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-17.htm">1 Kings 10:17</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-16.htm">2 Chronicles 9:16</a>, at least so far as later times are concerned. The sacred shekel, to judge from the weight of Maccabean shekels, which are in existence still, and vary from 256 to 272 Parisian grains, weighed 274 grains, and therefore, according to present valuation, would be worth 26 groschen (about <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7.htm">2 Samuel 7</a>d.), so that the half-shekel of bekah would be 13 groschen (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3.htm">1 Samuel 3</a> 1/2d.).</body></html>
