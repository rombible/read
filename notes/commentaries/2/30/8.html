The continual intercession of Christ was represented by the daily burning of incense thereon, morning and evening. Once every year the blood of the atonement was to be applied to it, denoting that the intercession of Christ has all its virtue from his sufferings on earth, and that we need no other sacrifice or intercessor but Christ alone.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/30.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The lamps - See <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-37.htm">Exodus 25:37</a>.<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/30-7.htm">Exodus 30:7-8</a><p>The offering of the incense accompanied that of the morning and evening sacrifice.

What follows, from <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/30-11.htm">Exodus 30:11-31:17</a>, is shown to be merely supplementary to the larger whole by the formula "and Jehovah spake unto Moses," with which every separate command is introduced (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/30-11.htm">Exodus 30:11</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/30-17.htm">Exodus 30:17</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/30-22.htm">Exodus 30:22</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/30-24.htm">Exodus 30:24</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/31-1.htm">Exodus 31:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/31-12.htm">Exodus 31:12</a>).<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/30-1.htm">Exodus 30:1-6</a><p>(cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/37-25.htm">Exodus 37:25-28</a>). Moses was directed to make an altar of burning of incense (lit., incensing of incense), of acacia-wood, one cubit long and one broad, four-cornered, two cubits high, furnished with horns like the altar of burnt-offering (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/27-1.htm">Exodus 27:1-2</a>), and to plate it with pure gold, the roof (&#1490;&#1468;&#1490;) thereof (i.e., its upper side or surface, which was also made of wood), and its walls round about, and its horns; so that it was covered with gold quite down to the ground upon which it stood, and for this reason is often called the golden altar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/39-38.htm">Exodus 39:38</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/40-5.htm">Exodus 40:5</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-26.htm">Exodus 40:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/4-11.htm">Numbers 4:11</a>). Moreover it was to be ornamented with a golden wreath, and furnished with golden rings at the corners for the carrying-poles, as the ark of the covenant and the table of shew-bread were (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-11.htm">Exodus 25:11</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-25.htm">Exodus 25:25</a>.); and its place was to be in front of the curtain, which concealed the ark of the covenant (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/26-31.htm">Exodus 26:31</a>), "before the capporeth" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-5.htm">Exodus 40:5</a>), so that, although it really stood in the holy place between the candlestick on the south side and the table on the north (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/26-35.htm">Exodus 26:35</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/40-22.htm">Exodus 40:22</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-24.htm">Exodus 40:24</a>), it was placed in the closest relation to the capporeth, and for this reason is not only connected with the most holy place in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-22.htm">1 Kings 6:22</a>, but is reckoned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-4.htm">Hebrews 9:4</a> as part of the furniture of the most holy place (see Delitzsch on <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-4.htm">Hebrews 9:4</a>).</body></html>
