The “lords of service” were probably a small body who exercised a general superintendence, and determined the works in which the Hebrews should be employed. They were, no doubt, native Egyptians. The <span class= "ital">nogeshim,</span> or “taskmasters,” were their subordinates—Egyptians like themselves—comparatively numerous, and serving as intermediaries between the “lords” and the “officers.” These last were Hebrews, and engaged mainly in keeping the tale of the bricks, and seeing that the proper number was reached. Such an organisation is consonant with all that we know of the Egyptian governmental system, which was bureaucratic and complex, involving in every department the employment of several grades of officials.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/exodus/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:1-9 God will own his people, though poor and despised, and will find a time to plead their cause. Pharaoh treated all he had heard with contempt. He had no knowledge of Jehovah, no fear of him, no love to him, and therefore refused to obey him. Thus Pharaoh's pride, ambition, covetousness, and political knowledge, hardened him to his own destruction. What Moses and Aaron ask is very reasonable, only to go three days' journey into the desert, and that on a good errand. We will sacrifice unto the Lord our God. Pharaoh was very unreasonable, in saying that the people were idle, and therefore talked of going to sacrifice. He thus misrepresents them, that he might have a pretence to add to their burdens. To this day we find many who are more disposed to find fault with their neighbours, for spending in the service of God a few hours spared from their wordly business, than to blame others, who give twice the time to sinful pleasures. Pharaoh's command was barbarous. Moses and Aaron themselves must get to the burdens. Persecutors take pleasure in putting contempt and hardship upon ministers. The usual tale of bricks must be made, without the usual allowance of straw to mix with the clay. Thus more work was to be laid upon the men, which, if they performed, they would be broken with labour; and if not, they would be punished.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Their officers - Or scribes.

The Pharaoh commands the Egyptian ‘taskmasters’ (whom he must be supposed—see <span class="ital">v.</span> 10—to have summoned to his presence) to increase the tasks imposed upon the Israelites: they are to find their straw themselves, and yet to make the same number of bricks. Bricks in Egypt (which in the earlier periods were much larger than our bricks, generally about 15 × 7 × 4½ in.) were made (on <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/1-14.htm" title="And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in mortar, and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all their service, wherein they made them serve, was with rigor.">Exodus 1:14</a>) from the mud of the Nile, mixed usually with chopped straw or reed, to give it coherence and prevent cracks while drying, and then dried in the sun (<span class="ital">EB.</span> i. 609; cf. <span class="ital">L. and B.</span> i. 165). These bricks remained black. Burnt red brick was first introduced into Egypt by the Romans.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6-9.</span> - Rulers are not always content simply to refuse inconvenient demands. Sometimes they set to work with much ingenuity and worldly wisdom to prevent their repetition. This is especially the case where they entertain a fear of their petitioners. The Spartans removed Helots, who had earned their freedom, by the Crypteia. The massacre of St. Bartholomew was caused by the Huguenot demand for freedom of worship and the difficulty of repressing it. The Pharaoh now is not content to let things take their course, but devises a plan by which he hopes to crush altogether the aspirations of the Hebrew people, and secure himself against the recurrence of any such appeal as that which had been made to him by Moses and Aaron. The Israelites had recently been employed chiefly in brickmaking. They had had to dig the clay and temper it, to mix it with straw, and mould it into the form of bricks; but the straw had been supplied to them. The king determined that this should be no longer done; the Israelites should find the straw for themselves. It has been estimated that by this change their labour was "more than doubled." (Canon Cook.) It was a not unreasonable expectation that under this system popular meetings would cease (ver. 9); and that Moses and Aaron, not being backed up by the voice of the people, would discontinue their agitation. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The same day</span>. Pharaoh lost no time. Having conceived his idea, he issued his order at once-on the very day of the interview with the two leaders. It would be well if the children of light were as "wise" and as energetic on all occasions as the children of darkness. <span class="cmt_word">Taskmasters and officers</span>. The word translated "taskmaster" here is not the same as the expression similarly rendered in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/1-11.htm">Exodus 1:11</a>; and it is thought not to designate the same class. The <span class="accented">sarey massim</span> of the former passage are thought to be general superintendents of works, few in number and of high rank, the <span class="accented">nogeshim</span> of the present place to be subordinates, numerous and inferior in position. Both of these classes were probably Egyptians.  The "officers" (<span class="accented">shoterim</span>) were undoubtedly Hebrews. They were especially employed in keeping the tale of the bricks, and seeing that they reached the proper amount. Literally, the word <span class="accented">shoterim</span> means "<span class="accented">scribes</span>," and is so rendered in most passages. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/exodus/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>After the removal of the sin, which had excited the threatening wrath of Jehovah, Moses once more received a token of the divine favour in the arrival of Aaron, under the direction of God, to meet him at the Mount of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-1.htm">Exodus 3:1</a>). To Aaron he related all the words of Jehovah, with which He had sent (commissioned) him (&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495; with a double accusative, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-22.htm">2 Samuel 11:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/42-5.htm">Jeremiah 42:5</a>), and all the signs which He had commanded him (&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492; also with a double accusative, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-22.htm">Genesis 6:22</a>). Another proof of the favour of God consisted of the believing reception of his mission on the part of the elders and the people of Israel. "The people believed" (&#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1503;) when Aaron communicated to them the words of Jehovah to Moses, and did the signs in their presence. "And when they heard that Jehovah had visited the children of Israel, and had looked upon their affliction, they bowed and worshipped." (Knobel is wrong in proposing to alter &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468; into &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1502;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;, according to the Sept. rendering, &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;). The faith of the people, and the worship by which their faith was expressed, proved that the promise of the fathers still lived in their hearts. And although this faith did not stand the subsequent test (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/5.htm">Exodus 5</a>), yet, as the first expression of their feelings, it bore witness to the fact that Israel was willing to follow the call of God. </body></html>
