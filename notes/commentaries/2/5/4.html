Pharaoh treated all he had heard with contempt. He had no knowledge of Jehovah, no fear of him, no love to him, and therefore refused to obey him. Thus Pharaoh's pride, ambition, covetousness, and political knowledge, hardened him to his own destruction. What Moses and Aaron ask is very reasonable, only to go three days' journey into the desert, and that on a good errand. We will sacrifice unto the Lord our God. Pharaoh was very unreasonable, in saying that the people were idle, and therefore talked of going to sacrifice. He thus misrepresents them, that he might have a pretence to add to their burdens. To this day we find many who are more disposed to find fault with their neighbours, for spending in the service of God a few hours spared from their wordly business, than to blame others, who give twice the time to sinful pleasures. Pharaoh's command was barbarous. Moses and Aaron themselves must get to the burdens. Persecutors take pleasure in putting contempt and hardship upon ministers. The usual tale of bricks must be made, without the usual allowance of straw to mix with the clay. Thus more work was to be laid upon the men, which, if they performed, they would be broken with labour; and if not, they would be punished.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/exodus/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Let - i. e. hinder. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/exodus/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4.

To Aaron he related all the words of Jehovah, with which He had sent (commissioned) him (&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495; with a double accusative, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-22.htm">2 Samuel 11:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/42-5.htm">Jeremiah 42:5</a>), and all the signs which He had commanded him (&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492; also with a double accusative, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-22.htm">Genesis 6:22</a>). Another proof of the favour of God consisted of the believing reception of his mission on the part of the elders and the people of Israel. "The people believed" (&#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1503;) when Aaron communicated to them the words of Jehovah to Moses, and did the signs in their presence. "And when they heard that Jehovah had visited the children of Israel, and had looked upon their affliction, they bowed and worshipped." (Knobel is wrong in proposing to alter &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468; into &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1502;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;, according to the Sept. rendering, &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;). The faith of the people, and the worship by which their faith was expressed, proved that the promise of the fathers still lived in their hearts. And although this faith did not stand the subsequent test (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/5.htm">Exodus 5</a>), yet, as the first expression of their feelings, it bore witness to the fact that Israel was willing to follow the call of God. </body></html>
