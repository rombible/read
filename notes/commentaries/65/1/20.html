The notion is not so much that of increasing and completing an edifice as of strengthening its foundations. Faith and its object are here almost identified. To have faith as one’s foundation is the same as having Christ as one’s foundation. “<span class= "ital">Your</span> faith,” that which has been “once for all delivered” to you (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-4.htm" title2="For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness, and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ.">Jude 1:4</a>). “<span class= "ital">Most holy</span> faith,” as opposed to the most unholy quick sands of the doctrines condemned in this Epistle.<p><span class= "bld">Praying in the Holy Ghost.</span>—Only in this way can Christians make firm their foundation. The Greek admits of “in the Holy Ghost” being taken with the previous clause; but our version is better. The expression “praying in the Holy Ghost” is not found elsewhere. It means that we pray in His strength and wisdom: He moves our hearts and directs our petitions. (See Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-26.htm" title2="Likewise the Spirit also helps our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself makes intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.">Romans 8:26</a>.)<p>(21) <span class= "bld">Keep yourselves in the love of God.</span>—Not our love of God, but His love of us. Consequently it is not the case that the three great Christian virtues—Faith, Hope, and Charity—are inculcated here, although at first sight we are tempted to think so. God’s love is the region in which those who are built up on faith, and supported by prayer, may continually dwell.<p><span class= "bld">The mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span>—The mercy which He will show as Judge at the Last Day. By prayer in the Spirit we are kept in the love of the Father for the mercy of the Son.<p><span class= "bld">Unto eternal life.</span>—These words may be taken either with “keep yourselves,” or with “looking,” or with “mercy”: best with “keep yourselves.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/maclaren/jude/1.htm">MacLaren's Expositions</a></div>Jude<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">KEEPING OURSELVES IN THE LOVE OF GOD</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jude/1-20.htm" title2="And they gave Hebron to Caleb, as Moses said: and he expelled there the three sons of Anak....">Jude 1:20-21</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Jude has been, in all the former part of the letter, pouring out a fiery torrent of vehement indignation and denunciation against ‘certain men’ who had ‘crept’ into the Church, and were spreading gross immorality there. He does not speak of them so much as heretics in belief, but rather as evil-doers in practice; and after the thunderings and lightning, he turns from them with a kind of sigh of relief in this emphatic, ‘But, ye! beloved.’ The storm ends in gentle rain; and he tells the brethren who are yet faithful how they are to comport themselves in the presence of prevalent corruption, and where is their security and their peace.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>You will observe that in my text there is embedded, in the middle of it, a direct precept: ‘Keep yourselves in the love of God’; and that that is encircled by three clauses, like each other in structure, and unlike it- ‘building, ‘‘praying,’ ‘looking.’ The great diamond is surrounded by a ring of lesser jewels. Why did Jude put two of these similar clauses in front of his direct precept, and one of them behind it? I think because the two that precede indicate the ways by which the precept can be kept, and the one that follows indicates the accompaniment or issue of obedience to the precept. If that be the reason for the structure of my text, it suggests also to us the course which we had best pursue in the exposition of it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. So we hare, to begin with, the great direct precept for the Christian life.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>‘Keep yourselves in the love of God.’ Now I need not spend a moment in showing that ‘ the love of God’ here means, not ours to Him, but His to us. It is that in which, as in some charmed circle, we are to keep ourselves. Now that injunction at once raises the question of the possibility of Christian men being out of the love of God, straying away from their home, and getting out into the open. Of course there is a sense in which His ‘tender mercies are over all His works.’ Just as the sky embraces all the stars and the earth within its blue round, so that love of God encompasses every creature; and no man can stray so far away as that, in one profound sense, he gets beyond its pale. For no man can ever make God cease to love him. But whilst that is quite true, on the other side it is equally true that contrariety of will and continuance in evil deeds do so alter a man’s relation to the love of God as that he is absolutely incapable of receiving its sweetest and most select manifestations, and can only be hurt by the incidence of its beams. The sun gives life to many creatures, but it slays some. There are crawling things that live beneath a stone, and when you turn it up and let the arrows of the sunbeams smite down upon them, they squirm and die. It is possible for a man so to set himself in antagonism to that great Light as that the Light shall hurt and not bless and soothe.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is also possible for a Christian man to step out of the charmed circle, in the sense that he becomes all unconscious of that Light. Then to him it comes to the same thing that the love shall be non-existent, and that it shall be unperceived. If I choose to make my abode on the northern side of the mountain, my thermometer may be standing at ‘ freezing,’ and I may be shivering in all my limbs on Midsummer Day at noontide. And so it is possible for us Christian people to stray away out from that gracious abode, to pass from the illuminated disc into the black shadow; and though nothing is ‘ hid from the heat thereof,’ yet we may derive no warmth and no enlightening from the all-pervading beams. We have to ‘keep ourselves in the love of God.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Then that suggests the other more blessed possibility, that amidst all the distractions of daily duties, and the solicitations of carking cares, and the oppression of heavy sorrows, it is possible for us to keep ourselves perpetually in the conscious enjoyment of the love of God. I need not say how this ideal of the Christian life may be indefinitely approximated to in our daily experiences; nor need I dwell upon the sad contrast between this ideal unbrokenness of conscious sunning ourselves in the love of God, and the reality of the lives that most of us live. But, brethren, if we more fully believed that we can keep up, amidst all the dust and struggle of the arena, the calm sweet sense of God’s love, our lives would be different. Nightingales will sing in a dusty copse by the roadside, however loud the noise of traffic may be upon the highway. And we may have, all through our lives, that song, unbroken and melodious. That sub-consciousness underlying our daily work, ‘like some sweet beguiling melody, so sweet, we know not we are listening to it,’ may be ever present with each of us in our daily work, like some ‘hidden brook in the leafy month of June,’ that murmurs beneath the foliage, and yet is audible through all the wood.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And what a peaceful, restful life ours would be, if we could thus be like John, leaning on the Master’s bosom. We might have a secret fortress into the central chamber of which we could go, whither no sound of the war in the plains could ever penetrate. We might, like some dwellers in a mountainous island, take refuge in a central glen, buried deep amongst the hills, where there would be no sound of tempest, though the winds were fighting on the surface of the sea, and the spindrift was flying before them. It is possible to ‘keep ourselves in the love of God.’ And if we keep in that fortress we are safe. If we go beyond its walls we are sure to be picked off by the well-aimed shots of the enemy. So, then, that is the central commandment for the Christian life.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. Now let me turn to consider the methods by which we can thus keep ourselves in the love of God.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>These are two: one mainly bearing on the outward, the other on the inward, life. By ‘ building up yourselves on your most holy faith’: that is the one. By ‘praying in the Holy Ghost’: that is the other. Let us look at these two.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>‘Building up yourselves on your most holy faith.’ I suppose that ‘faith’ here is used in its ordinary sense. Some would rather prefer to take it in the latter, ecclesiastical sense, by which it means, not the act of belief, but the aggregate of the things believed.-’ Our most holy faith,’ as it is called by quotation-I think misquotation-of this passage. But I do not see that there is any necessity for that meaning. The words are perfectly intelligible in their ordinary meaning. What Jude says is just this: ‘Your trust in Jesus Christ has in it a tendency to produce holiness, and that is the foundation on which you are to build a great character. Build up yourselves on your most holy faith.’ For although it is not what the world’s ethics recognize, the Christian theory of morality is this, that it all rests upon trust in God manifested to us in Jesus Christ. Faith is the foundation of all supreme excellence and nobility and beauty of character; because, for one thing, it dethrones self, and enthrones God in our hearts; making Him our aim and our law and our supreme good; and because, for another thing, our trust brings us into direct union with Him, so that we receive from Him the power thus to build up a character.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Faith is the foundation. Ay! but faith is only the foundation. It is ‘the potentiality of wealth,’ but it is not the reality. ‘All things are possible to him that believeth’; but all things are not actual except on conditions. A man may have faith, as a great many professing Christians have it, only as a ‘fire-escape,’ a means of getting away from hell, or have it only as a band that is stretched out to grasp certain initial blessings of the spiritual life. But that is not its full glory nor its real aspect. It is meant to be the beginning in us of ‘all things that are lovely and of good report.’ What would you think of a man that carefully put in the foundations for a house, and had all his building materials on the ground, and let them lie there? And that is what a great many of you Christian people do, who ‘ have fled for refuge,’ as you say,’ to the hope set before you in the Gospel’; and who have never wrought out your faith into noble deeds. Remember what the Apostle says, ‘Faith which worketh ‘; and worketh ‘by love.’ It is the foundation, but only the foundation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The work of building a noble character on that firm foundation is never-ending. ‘Tis a life-long task ‘ till the lump be leavened.’ The metaphor of growth by building suggests effort, and it suggests continuity; and it suggests slow, gradual rearing up, course upon course, stone by stone. Some of us have done nothing at it for a great many years. You will pass, sometimes, in our suburbs, a row of houses begun by some builder that has become bankrupt; and there are mouldering bricks and gaping empty places for the windows, and the rafters decaying, and stagnant water down in the holes that were meant for the cellars. That is like the kind of thing that hosts of people who call themselves Christians have built. ‘But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith . . . Keep yourselves in the love.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Then the other way of building is suggested in the next clause, ‘praying in the Holy Ghost’-that is to say, prayer which is not mere utterance of my own petulant desires which a great deal of our ‘ prayer’ is, but which is breathed into us by that Divine Spirit that will brood over our chaos, and bring order out of confusion, and light and beauty out of darkness, and weltering sea:-<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">‘The prayers I make will then be sweet indeed, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>If Thou the Spirit give by which I pray.’ </span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>As Michael Angelo says, such prayer inspired and warmed by the influences of that Divine Spirit playing upon the dull flame of our desires, like air injected into a grate where the fire is half out, such prayers are our best help in building. For who is there that has honestly tried to build himself up ‘for a habitation of God but has felt that it must be ‘through a Spirit’ mightier than himself, who will overcome his weaknesses and arm him against temptation? No man who honestly endeavors to reform his character but is brought very soon to feel that he needs a higher help than his own. And perhaps some of us know how, when sore pressed by temptation, one petition for help brings a sudden gush of strength into us, and we feel that the enemy’s assault is weakened.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Brethren, the best attitude for building is on our knees; and if, like Cromwell’s men in the fight, we go into the battle singing,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">‘Let God arise, and scattered <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Let all His enemies be,’ </span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>we shall come out victorious. ‘Ye, beloved, building and praying, keep yourselves.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">III. Now, lastly, we have here in the final clause the fair prospect visible from our home, in the love of God.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">‘Looking for the mercy of the Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.’</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>After all building and praying, we need ‘the mercy.’ Jude has been speaking in his letter about the destruction of evil-doers, when Christ the Judge shall come. And I suppose that that thought of final judgment is still in his mind, coloring the language of my text, and that it explains why he speaks here of ‘ the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ’ instead of, as is usual in Scripture, the mercy of God.’ He is thinking of that last Day of Judgment and retribution, wherein Jesus Christ is to be the Judge of all men, saints as well as sinners, and therefore he speaks of mercy as bestowed by Him then on those who have ‘kept themselves in the love of God.’ Ah! we shall need it. The better we are the more we know how much wood, hay, stubble, we have built into our buildings; and the more we are conscious of that love of God as round us, the more we shall feel the unworthiness and imperfection of our response to it. The best of us, when we lie down to die, and the wisest of us, as we struggle on in life, realize most how all our good is stained and imperfect, and that after all efforts we have to cry ‘God be merciful to me a sinner.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Not only so, but our outlook and confident expectation of that mercy day by day, and in its perfect form at least, depends upon our keeping ourselves ‘in the love of God.’ We have to go high up the hill before we can see far over the plain. Our home in that love commands a fair prospect. When we stray from it, we lose sight of the blue distance. Our hope of ‘the mercy of God unto eternal life’ varies with our present consciousness and experience of His love.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>That mercy leads on to eternal life. We get many of its manifestations and gifts here, but these are but the pale blossoms of a plant not in its native habitat, nor sunned by the sunshine which can draw forth all its fragrance and colour.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>We have to look forward for the adequate expression of the mercy of God to all that fullness of perfect blessedness for all our faculties, which is summed up in the one great word-’ life everlasting.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>So our hope ought to be as continuous as the manifestation of the mercy, and, like it, should last until the eternal life has come. All our gifts here are fragmentary and imperfect. Here we drink of brooks by the way. There we shall slake our thirst at the fountainhead. Here we are given ready money for the day’s expenses. There we shall be free of the treasure house, where lie the uncoined and uncounted masses of bullion, which God has laid up in store for them that fear Him. So, brethren, let us hope perfectly for the perfect manifestation of the mercy. Let us set ourselves to build up, however slowly, the fair fabric of a life and character which shall stand when the tempest levels all houses built upon the sand. Let us open our spirits to the entrance of that Spirit who helps the infirmities of our desires as well as of our efforts. Thus let us keep ourselves in the charmed circle of the love of God, that we may be safe as a garrison in its fortress, blessed as a babe on its mother’s breast.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Jude’s words are but the echo of the tenderer words of his Master and ours, when He said, ‘As My Father hath loved Me, so have I loved you.

That is infinitely worse than to separate from any branch of the visible church on account of opinions, or modes and circumstances of outward government or worship. Sensual men have not the spirit of holiness, which whoever has not, does not belong to Christ. The grace of faith is most holy, as it works by love, purifies the heart, and overcomes the world, by which it is distinguished from a false and dead faith. Our prayers are most likely to prevail, when we pray in the Holy Ghost, under his guidance and influence, according to the rule of his word, with faith, fervency, and earnestness; this is praying in the Holy Ghost. And a believing expectation of eternal life will arm us against the snares of sin: lively faith in this blessed hope will help us to mortify our lusts. We must watch over one another; faithfully, yet prudently reprove each other, and set a good example to all about us. This must be done with compassion, making a difference between the weak and the wilful. Some we must treat with tenderness. Others save with fear; urging the terrors of the Lord. All endeavours must be joined with decided abhorrence of crimes, and care be taken to avoid whatever led to, or was connected with fellowship with them, in works of darkness, keeping far from what is, or appears to be evil.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jude/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith - Compare the notes at Jde 1:3.

Resuming Jude 17.<p>building up yourselves&#8212;the opposite to the "separate themselves" (Jude 19): as "in the Holy Ghost" is opposed to "having not the Spirit."<p>on&#8212;as on a foundation. Building on THE FAITH is equivalent to building on Christ, the object of faith.<p>praying in the Holy Ghost&#8212;(Ro 8:26; Eph 6:18). The Holy Spirit teaches what we are to pray for, and how. None can pray aright save by being in the Spirit, that is, in the element of His influence. Chrysostom states that, among the charisms bestowed at the beginning of the New Testament dispensation, was the gift of prayer, bestowed on someone who prayed in the name of the rest, and taught others to pray. Moreover, their prayers so conceived and often used, were received and preserved among Christians, and out of them forms of prayer were framed.

But this is erroneous, for <span class="greekheb">τηρεῖν ἑαυτούς</span> here mentioned depends not only on this, that one should pray, but that one should pray rightly, that is, <span class="greekheb">ἐν πν</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἁγ</span>. Wiesinger correctly observes, that the first clause gives the general presupposition; the second, on the other hand, the more precise statement how <span class="greekheb">τηρήσατε</span> has to be brought about.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τῇ ἁγιωτάτῃ ὑμῶν πίστει</span>] Both the adjective and the verb show that <span class="greekheb">πίστις</span> is here meant not in a subjective (the demeanour of faith, Schott), but in an objective sense (Wiesinger: “appropriated by them indeed as their personal possession, yet according to its contents as <span class="greekheb">παραδοθεῖσα</span>;” so similarly Hofmann).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐποικοδομοῦντες ἑαυτούς</span>] When verbs compounded with <span class="greekheb">ἐπί</span> are joined with the dative, as here, this for the most part is used for <span class="greekheb">ἐπί τι</span>, more rarely for <span class="greekheb">ἐπί τινι</span> (see Winer, p. 400 f. [E. T. 535]). If the first is here the case, then <span class="greekheb">ἐποικοδομεῖν τῇ πίστει</span> is to be interpreted, with Wiesinger: “building on <span class="greekheb">πίστις</span>, so that <span class="greekheb">πίστις</span> is the foundation which supports their whole personal life, the soul of all their thinking, willing, and doing” (so also hitherto in this commentary);[46] comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-12.htm" title2="Now if any man build on this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble;">1 Corinthians 3:12</a> : <span class="greekheb">ἐποικοδομεῖν ἐπὶ τὸν θεμέλιον τοῦτον</span>. If, on the other hand, the second is here the case, then it is to he explained, with Hofmann, “their faith is the foundation which supports their life; and accordingly, in the further development of their life it should ever be their care that their life rests upon this foundation;” comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-20.htm" title2="And are built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone;">Ephesians 2:20</a> : <span class="greekheb">ἐποικοδομηθέντες ἐπὶ τῷ θεμελίῳ τῶν ἀποστόλων</span>. The first is, however, to be preferred, because, as already remarked, with these verbs the dative mostly stands for <span class="greekheb">ἐπί τι</span>. Both explanations come essentially to the same thing.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἑαυτούς</span> is not here = <span class="greekheb">ἀλλήλους</span>; the discourse is indeed of a general, but not precisely of a mutual activity; <span class="greekheb">ἑαυτούς</span> with the second person creates no difficulty; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-12.htm" title2="Why, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.">Php 2:12</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐν πνεύματι ἁγίῳ προσευχόμενοι</span>] The expression <span class="greekheb">προσευχ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐν πν</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἁγ</span>., it is true, does not elsewhere occur, but similar combinations are not rare (<span class="greekheb">λαλεῖν ἐν πν</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἁγ</span>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-3.htm" title2="Why I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calls Jesus accursed: and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.">1 Corinthians 12:3</a>; see Meyer <span class="ital">in loc</span>.); it means so to pray that the Holy Spirit is the moving and guiding power (Jachmann, unsatisfactorily: “praying in consciousness of the Holy Ghost”); comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-26.htm" title2="Likewise the Spirit also helps our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself makes intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.">Romans 8:26</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἑαυτοὺς ἐν ἀγάπῃ Θεοῦ τηρήσατε</span>] <span class="greekheb">Θεοῦ</span> may either be the objective genitive (Vorstius: charitas Dei passiva i. e. qua nos Deum diligimus; so also Jachmann, Arnaud, Hofmann, and others), or the subjective genitive, “the love of God to us” (so de Wette, Schott, Wiesinger, Fronmüller); in the latter case the thought is the same as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/15-9.htm" title2="As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you: continue you in my love....">John 15:9-10</a>; this agreement is in favour of that interpretation, nor is the want of the article opposed to it (against Hofmann).

Here again we may recognise a side-glance at the false teachers.

One of the two counsels deals with what they should do for the protection of their own Christian position against the insidious evils of which he has written in words of passion. The other deals with what they should do for the preservation of others exposed to the same seductive perils. <span class="cmt_word">But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith.</span> The tone of pleading affection appears in the grave and earnest words by which he reminds his readers of the necessity of looking carefully to their own perseverance. As the condition of all else, he names the great duty of personal edification or up-building. They must strengthen themselves on their foundation, and that foundation is their "most holy faith." By this apparently Jude does not mean simply the subjective grace or virtue of faith. Peter, indeed, speaks of the strengthening and development of that as the secret of being neither barren nor unfruitful. But the idea and the phrase seem somewhat different here; for any spiritual gift of their own would be all too weak a security. It is rather the "faith" which has been already mentioned as "once delivered unto the saints" (verse 3), and is now conceived as possessed by the readers. In this faith, of which Christ himself is the Sum, they have a secure foundation for their renewed life, and on this faith  they are to establish themselves more and more. Praying in the Holy Ghost. These words go best together, though some attach the term, "in the Holy Ghost," to the former clause. They express a second condition which must be made good, if the readers are to be safe from the seductions which threaten them. Their Christian life, if it is to be proof against these evils, must be fed by prayer, and by prayer of the deepest and most effectual order - prayer which takes its life and power from the Holy Spirit (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-18.htm">Ephesians 6:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-26.htm">Romans 8:26</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.</span> The "love of God" must have a sense parallel to that of the "mercy of Christ." It is, therefore, not our love to God, but his love to us. The love which God is revealed in Christ to have to us is that in which they are to keep themselves. So long as they live within its grace they cannot but be secure against the corruptions of men. If they fall away from it, they become an easy prey. And keeping themselves in this love, they are to "look for mercy." They are then entitled to expect that mercy, and the attitude of expectation will itself be an aid to the keeping of themselves in the love. The mercy of the future is here spoken of as specifically the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ; Jude having in view that advent of Christ which filled the immediate horizon of the early Christians, and to which they looked with an intensity of expectation to us very partially realizable, as the event which would speedily reveal every man's work and in which mercy would triumph over judgment for the faithful. And this <span class="accented">mercy, or</span>, as it also maybe, this <span class="accented">expectation</span>, is further described as having nothing less than <span class="accented">eternal life</span> for its object and its certain end. So the central idea in this counsel is the necessity of holding by the revealed fact of God's love in Christ. The first two clauses point to the means by which this is to be made good, and the last clause expresses an attitude of soul which is at once an extension of the central duty and a help to it. <span class="cmt_word">And of some have compassion, making a difference: and others save with fear, pulling them out of the fire.</span> The readings here are so diverse, and so difficult to determine, that some of our best critics take this to be one of the passages in which we have to recognize a corruption of the primitive text now past certain correction. The Received Text is clearly in error at least in one important term. The word which it renders "making a difference," as if it referred to the readers, is in the same case with the "some," and refers to the persons who are to be dealt with. It is doubtful, too, whether we have three different classes of persons referred to in three distinct hortatory sentences, or only two such classes. The most recent and best of our English students of the text, Messrs. Westcott and Hort, adopt readings which differ in some respects from those of the Authorized, but agree with it in presenting only two classes of persons. The Revised Version, following many good authorities, both ancient and modern, prefers another form of text with a triple division. Accepting this, we have still more than one uncertainty to take account cf. In the first of the three clauses there is the difficulty of deciding between two readings, one of which gives us "on some have mercy," while the other yields the sense "some convict," that is to say, <span class="accented">bring their sin home to them</span>, or <span class="accented">refute their error.</span> The preference is to be given, on the whole, though with some hesitation, to the former of these readings, which is also the more difficult of the two. There is also the difficulty of determining the precise idea expressed by the participle in the same clause. It appears clear enough that it cannot have the sense assigned it by the Authorized Version, namely, that of "making a difference." But setting this aside, we have still to choose between two ways of taking it. It may have the sense of <span class="accented">hesitating</span> or <span class="accented">doubting</span>; in which case the class of persons referred to will be those who are not wholly gone in unbelief, but are on the way to it. Such persons are to be regarded as fit objects for anxious, considerate, pitiful treatment. This is a sense which the word undoubtedly bears in several passages of the New Testament (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-6.htm">James 1:6</a>; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-21.htm">Matthew 21:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/11-22.htm">Mark 11:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-20.htm">Romans 4:20</a>). It has also the sanction of the Revised Version, which renders it, "And on some have mercy, who are in doubt." But it may also have the sense of <span class="accented">contending</span>, and the fact that it has already been so used in the present Epistle (verse 9) is a weighty consideration in favour of this view. The rendering then might be, "Some compassionate, when they contend with you" (so Alford, etc.). In tide case the class referred to will be the <span class="accented">contentious</span>, of whom there might be different kinds, some more hopeful and reasonable, others less so. Men of this spirit are to be tried first with kindness and consideration. Even when they oppose you and draw off from you, be pitiful toward them; take a compassionate, helpful interest in them. The second clause is best rendered with the Revised Version, "And some save, snatching them out of the fire." This brings a different class of persons into view - those who have sunk into corrupt courses which will soon undo them, who are already, indeed, in the penal fires of wrong, but yet are not beyond the possibility of rescue if quick and  vigorous measures are taken with them. It is generally supposed that Jude has in view here the figure of the "brand plucked from the burning," which occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/3-2.htm">Zechariah 3:2</a>. If so, the position in which this second class stands is represented as one of the last possible peril. The terms are strong and vivid enough for this. They mean that there is no time to lose, that all depends upon the prompt use of efficient measures, however forcible and unwelcome. The third clause then runs, "And some compassionate with fear." It points to a class who are to be dealt with in the same way as the first class. Yet there is a difference between them. This third class of persons is more dangerous to those who seek their good. They too are to be tried with active, helpful pity; but this is to be done "with fear." In their case the life is so treacherous, the error so insidious, that their Christian benefactors incur grave risk in coming to close terms with them, and require to practice an anxious vigilance lest they be themselves led astray. <span class="cmt_word">Hating even the garment spotted by the flesh.</span> The idea of "filthy garments" occurs in the same passage of Zechariah already referred to, and the term" garment" (here the <span class="accented">tunic</span>, or inner robe) is elsewhere used in a figurative sense (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-4.htm">Revelation 3:4</a>). Here it points to everything that is in contact with pollution. The clause seems to be added in order to give greater emphasis to the need of "fear" in dealing with men of the kind in question. Not only are their impurities to be zealously avoided, but all the accessories of these impurities - everything, in short, that is in any way connected with them. If this is the case, then this last is the most dangerous and hopeless of the three clauses mentioned. They are those "on whom profound pity is all that we dare bestow, and that in fear and trembling, lest by contact with them we may be brought within the influence of the deadly contamination that clings to all their surroundings" (Plummet). Only the <span class="accented">pity</span> which is to be shown them is not mere feeling, but a compassion which implies some active, though anxious interest in their rescue. </body></html>
