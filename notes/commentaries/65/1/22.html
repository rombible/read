This, then, is the first and least hopeless class—those who are still in doubt, though inclined the wrong way. They may still be remonstrated with, convicted of error, and reclaimed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-15.htm" title2="Moreover if your brother shall trespass against you, go and tell him his fault between you and him alone: if he shall hear you, you have gained your brother.">Matthew 18:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-13.htm" title2="This witness is true.

Some would make this first class the worst and most hopeless—those who are to be argued down in disputation, but without much chance of success. Such interpreters make the third class the best: those who can probably be saved by gentle means. The Greek here is so ambiguous that we cannot be certain of the meaning. But the addition of “in fear” and “hating even the garment spotted by the flesh” to the directions respecting the third class, seems to indicate that that class is the worst.<p>(23) <span class= "bld">And others save with fear.</span>—“With fear” must certainly be omitted, as no part of the true text. “Save” should perhaps be <span class= "ital">try to save.</span> It is the present imperative, not the aorist.<p><span class= "bld">Pulling them out of the fire.</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">snatching them out of the fire.</span> We have here another reminiscence of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/zechariah/3-1.htm" title2="And he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him.">Zechariah 3:1-3</a> : we had one in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-9.htm" title2="Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses, dared not bring against him a railing accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke you.">Jude 1:9</a>.

The fire of the judgment to come is probably not meant; rather the imminent danger (as of one who is asleep in a burning house) in which the fire of their sins keeps them. This is the second class: those who can still be rescued, but by strong measures.<p>After the words “out of the fire” we must insert another clause omitted from the inferior Greek texts used by our translators: “and on others have compassion in fear.” Wiclif and the Rhemish version, following the Vulgate, have this clause. This is the third and worst class: those on whom profound pity is all that we dare bestow, and that in fear and trembling, lest by contact with them we may be brought within the influence of the deadly contamination that clings to all their surroundings. Abhorrence must be shown to the very externals of pollution.

This clause, which is a caution addressed to “those who snatch others out of the fire, implies that in doing them that compassionate office, they are to avoid all familiarity with them, even as they would avoid touching a garment spotted by the flesh of one who had died of the plague, lest they should be infected by their vicious conversation.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jude/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:17-23 Sensual men separate from Christ, and his church, and join themselves to the devil, the world, and the flesh, by ungodly and sinful practices. That is infinitely worse than to separate from any branch of the visible church on account of opinions, or modes and circumstances of outward government or worship. Sensual men have not the spirit of holiness, which whoever has not, does not belong to Christ. The grace of faith is most holy, as it works by love, purifies the heart, and overcomes the world, by which it is distinguished from a false and dead faith. Our prayers are most likely to prevail, when we pray in the Holy Ghost, under his guidance and influence, according to the rule of his word, with faith, fervency, and earnestness; this is praying in the Holy Ghost. And a believing expectation of eternal life will arm us against the snares of sin: lively faith in this blessed hope will help us to mortify our lusts. We must watch over one another; faithfully, yet prudently reprove each other, and set a good example to all about us. This must be done with compassion, making a difference between the weak and the wilful. Some we must treat with tenderness. Others save with fear; urging the terrors of the Lord. All endeavours must be joined with decided abhorrence of crimes, and care be taken to avoid whatever led to, or was connected with fellowship with them, in works of darkness, keeping far from what is, or appears to be evil.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jude/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And of some have compassion - This cannot be intended to teach that they were not to have compassion for all people, or to regard the salvation of all with solicitude, but that they were to have special and unusual compassion for a certain class of persons, or were to approach them with feelings appropriate to their condition. The idea is, that the special feeling to be manifest toward a certain class of persons in seeking their salvation was tender affection and kindness. They were to approach them in the gentlest manner, appealing to them by such words as "love" would prompt. Others were to be approached in a different manner, indicated by the phrase, "save with fear." The class here referred to, to whom "pity" (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;  eleate) was to be shown, and in whose conversion and salvation tender compassion was to be employed, appear to have been the timid, the gentle, the unwary; those who had not yet fallen into dangerous errors, but who might be exposed to them; those, for there are such, who would be more likely to be influenced by kind words and a gentle manner than by denunciation. The direction then amounts to this, that while we are to seek to save all, we are to adapt ourselves wisely to the character and circumstances of those whom we seek to save. See the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-19.htm">1 Corinthians 9:19-22</a>.<p>Making a difference - Making a distinction between them, not in regard to your "desires" for their salvation, or your "efforts" to save them, but to the "manner" in which it is done. To be able to do this is one of the highest qualifications to be sought by one who endeavors to save souls, and is indispensable for a good minister of the gospel. The young, the tender, the delicate, the refined, need a different kind of treatment from the rough, the uncultivated, the hardened. This wisdom was shown by the Saviour in all his preaching; it was eminent in the preaching of Paul. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jude/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22, 23.

That is, of such who have gone astray, being drawn aside; who are simple and ignorant, and out of the way; who sin through infirmity, and the force of temptation; and who are tractable and open to conviction, and whose mistakes are in lesser matters of religion; as also such who are convicted and wounded in their consciences for their sins and mistakes: and to these compassion is to be shown, by praying with them, and for them, with ardency and affection; instructing them in meekness; giving friendly and brotherly reproofs to them; expressing on all occasions a tender concern for their good; doing them all the good that can be done, both for their souls and bodies: and good reason there is why compassion should be shown them, because God is a God of compassion; Christ is a merciful high priest; a contrary spirit is grieving to the Holy Ghost; saints should consider what they themselves were, and what they now are, and that compassion has been shown to them, and they may want it again. The Alexandrian copy, and some others, and the Vulgate Latin and Ethiopic versions, read, "reprove", <p>Making a difference; between one and another; using some more tenderly, others more severely, as the nature and circumstances of their case appear to be.

The best attested text is that which codex A affords: <span class="greekheb">καὶ οὓς μὲν ἐλέγχετε διακρινομένους</span>· <span class="greekheb">οὓς δὲ σώζετε ἐκ πυρὸς ἁρπάζοντες</span>, <span class="greekheb">οὓς δὲ ἐλεεῖτε</span> (Lachmann and Tischendorf, <span class="greekheb">ἐλεᾶτε</span>) <span class="greekheb">ἐν φόβῳ</span>; see critical remarks.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">οὓς μὲν</span> … <span class="greekheb">οὓς δέ</span> instead of <span class="greekheb">τοὺς μὲν</span> … <span class="greekheb">τοὺς δέ</span>, see Winer, p. 100. According to this reading, three classes of the seduced are distinguished, and toward each a special conduct is prescribed. It is, however, asked whether, as Brückner, Wiesinger, Schott, Reiche, and others assume, there is a gradation from the curable to the incurable (a dubitantibus minusque depravatis ad … insanabiles, quibus opem ferre pro tempore ab ipsorum contumacia prohibemur: Reiche); or conversely from the incurable to the curable. In reference to the first class it is said: <span class="greekheb">οὓς μὲν ἐλέγχετε διακρινομένους</span>] The verb <span class="greekheb">ἐλέγχειν</span> denotes to <span class="ital">rebuke some one’s sins by punishing him</span>.

The explanation of Oecumenius is incorrect: <span class="greekheb">φανεροῦτε τοῖς πᾶσιν τὴν ἀσέβειαν αὐτῶν</span>. Those who are to be punished are denoted <span class="greekheb">διακρινομένους</span>. Both the translation of the Vulgate: <span class="ital">judicatos</span>, and the interpretation of Oecumenius: <span class="greekheb">κακείνους εἰ μὲν ἀποδιΐστανται ὑμῶν ἐλέγχετε</span>, are incorrect. <span class="greekheb">διακρίνεσθαι</span> signifies in the N.

For he that wavers is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.">Jam 1:6</a>. This last passage shows that, although not equivalent to <span class="greekheb">ἀπιστεῖν</span>, it denotes the condition in which <span class="greekheb">ἀπιστία</span> has the preponderance over <span class="greekheb">πίστις</span>, the latter being a vanishing point.[47] It is evident that Jude does not consider the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΙΑΚΡΙΝΌΜΕΝΟΙ</span></span></span> as <span class="ital">weak believers</span> (Schott), because, with reference to them, he will employ no other method than <span class="greekheb">ἐλέγχειν</span> (not <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΑΡΑΚΑΛΕῖΝ</span></span></span>, or something similar); those seduced are in his view such as (punishment apart) are to be left to themselves.[48] In reference to the second class it is said: <span class="greekheb">οὓς δὲ σώζετε ἐκ πυρὸς ἁρπάζοντες</span>] Their condition is not stated, but it is to be inferred from the conduct to be observed towards them. Toward those belonging to this class a <span class="greekheb">σώζειν</span> is to be employed, but of such a nature as is more precisely stated by <span class="greekheb">ἐκ πυρὸς ἁρπάζοντες</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐκ πυρός</span> is not from the fire of <span class="ital">future</span> judgment (Oecumenius, Fronmüller), but <span class="greekheb">πῦρ</span> is the present destruction, in which they already are (Brückner, Wiesinger, Schott); <span class="greekheb">ἁρπάζειν</span> denotes hasty, almost violent, snatching out, and indicates that those are already in extreme danger of perdition; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/4-11.htm" title2="I have overthrown some of you, as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, and you were as a firebrand plucked out of the burning: yet have you not returned to me, said the LORD.">Amos 4:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/3-2.htm" title2="And the LORD said to Satan, The LORD rebuke you, O Satan; even the LORD that has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you: is not this a brand plucked out of the fire?">Zechariah 3:2</a>. Distinguished from the <span class="greekheb">διακρινομένοις</span>, the second class are to be considered as those who have not yet lost the faith, but have, through fellowship with the Antinomians, been enticed to their licentious life; these are to be <span class="ital">rescued</span>. <span class="greekheb">σώζετε</span> is evidently in contrast to <span class="greekheb">ἐλέγχετε</span>, and denotes them to be such as one may certainly hope to rescue, provided one snatches them with violence, and tears them out of this fellowship. In reference to the third class, Jude prescribes <span class="greekheb">ἐλεεῖν</span> (on the form <span class="greekheb">ἐλεᾶτε</span>, see Winer, p. 32 [E. T. 104]). This verb in the N. T. <span class="ital">never</span> means only “to have compassion” (Schott), but always to <span class="ital">compassionate one with helpful love</span>, as also <span class="greekheb">ἔλεος</span> is always used only of <span class="ital">active</span> compassion; so that with <span class="greekheb">ἐλεεῖτε</span> the exact contrary is said to what Luther finds expressed, when he explains it: “let them go, avoid them, and have nothing to do with them.” By this is denoted rather the helpful and saving benevolence by which the erring are again to be brought back to the right way. As this <span class="greekheb">ἐλεεῖν</span> makes a fellowship necessary with those upon whom it is exercised, Jude defines the same more precisely by <span class="greekheb">ἐν φόβῳ</span>; accordingly, they must not be wanting in <span class="ital">foresight</span>, lest they suffer injury themselves,[49] and he adds the participial sentence as an explanation of this <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝ ΦΌΒῼ</span>: <span class="greekheb">ΜΙΣΟῦΝΤΕς ΚΑῚ Κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Λ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span>[50] This exhortation shows that Jude considers the third class as those who are indeed already involved, but who, by active compassion, may again be re-established; it is not so bad with them as with those toward whom only <span class="greekheb">ἐλέγχειν</span> is to be employed; but also it is not yet so bad as with those who can only be rescued by hastily snatching them.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[47] When Hofmann says, “that <span class="greekheb">διακρίνεσθαι</span> cannot have this meaning requires no proof,” he makes an entirely groundless assumption.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[48] In the reading of the <span class="ital">Rec.</span>: <span class="greekheb">οὓς μὲν ἐλεεῖτε διακρινόμενοι</span>, we are obliged to explain <span class="greekheb">διακρίνεσθαι</span> as = <span class="ital">distinguished</span>. Luther: “and make this distinction, that ye compassionate some;” or, more exactly, “compassionate the one, making a distinction,” namely, from others. But <span class="greekheb">διακρινόμενοι</span> must be passive, since not <span class="greekheb">διακρίνεσθαι</span>, but only <span class="greekheb">διακρίνειν</span>, has the meaning <span class="ital">to distinguish</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[49] Schott is entirely mistaken when he says that <span class="greekheb">ἐλεεῖν</span> denotes here “a compassion which has, and may have, its definite peculiarity no longer in an impulse to help, hut only in a fear of acting wrongly, and in consequence of receiving injury;” in other words, a compassion which is no compassion.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[50] According to the reading of the <span class="ital">Rec.</span> <span class="greekheb">ἐν φόβῳ</span> belongs to <span class="greekheb">σώζετε</span>. Some expositors (Grotius, Stier, and others) incorrectly explain it of the fear of the persons to he rescued; correctly Arnaud: c’est à dire, prenant garde que, tout en cherchant à les convertir, ils ne vous séduisent pas vous-memes. Reiche incorrectly, with the reading A, separates <span class="greekheb">ἐν φόβῳ</span> from <span class="greekheb">ἐλεᾶτε</span>, and joins it with <span class="greekheb">μιτοῦντες</span>, whilst it would attract to it a very superfluous addition.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Hofmann considers the reading of <span class="greekheb">א</span>: <span class="greekheb">καὶ οὕς μὲν ἐλεᾶτε διακρινομένους οὕς δὲ σώζετε ἐκ πυρὸς ἁρπάζοντες</span>, <span class="greekheb">οὓς δὲ ἐλεᾶτε ἐν φόβῳ</span>, as the correct one. In his explanation of this reading he distinguishes not three, but only two classes, assuming that only the first, but not the second <span class="greekheb">οὓς δέ</span> stands opposed to <span class="greekheb">οὓς μέν</span>; and that this latter <span class="greekheb">οὓς δέ</span> is to be considered rather as a resumption of the object mentioned in <span class="greekheb">οὓς μέν</span>. This opinion is, however, erroneous, since, according to it, the third <span class="greekheb">οὕς</span> is understood differently from the first and second <span class="greekheb">οὕς</span>, namely, as a pure relative pronoun; and since, in a highly arbitrary manner, “<span class="greekheb">ἐν φόβῳ</span> is explained as a consequence, united with an imperative <span class="greekheb">ἐλεᾶτε</span> to be taken from <span class="greekheb">οὓς ἐλεᾶτε</span>:” “whom ye compassionate, them compassionate with fear.” Also the explanation of the first member of the sentence: “the readers are to compassionate the one with distinction,” is to be rejected, since it has against it N. T. usage, according to which <span class="greekheb">διακρίνεσθαι</span> is never used as the passive of <span class="greekheb">διακρίνειν</span> in the sense of “to distinguish.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The addition <span class="greekheb">μισοῦντες καὶ τὸν ἀπὸ τῆς σαρκὸς ἐσπιλωμένον χιτῶνα</span>[51] is correctly explained by Oecumenhis: <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΡΟΣΛΑΜΒΆΝΕΣΘΕ</span> … <span class="greekheb">ΑὐΤΟῪς</span> … <span class="greekheb">ΜΕΤᾺ ΦΌΒΟΥ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ΠΕΡΙΣΚΕΠΤΌΜΕΝΟΙ ΜΉΠΩς Ἡ ΠΡΌΣΛΗΨΙς ΤΟΎΤΩΝ</span> … <span class="greekheb">ΛΎΜΗς ὙΜῖΝ ΓΈΝΗΤΑΙ ΑἸΤΊΑ</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ΚΑΊ</span></span></span>, <span class="ital">even</span>, gives greater emphasis to the thought. The expression <span class="greekheb">τὸν χιτῶνα</span> is to be understood in a literal, and not in a figurative sense (Bullinger: exuvias veteris Adami, concupiscentias et opera carnis). <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΧΙΤῶΝ</span></span></span> is the under garment worn next the skin, and which, by means of its direct contact with the flesh unclean by unchastity, etc., is itself soiled (<span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΣΠΙΛΌΩ</span></span></span> only here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/3-6.htm" title2="And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defiles the whole body, and sets on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell.">Jam 3:6</a>); comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-4.htm" title2="You have a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments; and they shall walk with me in white: for they are worthy.">Revelation 3:4</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This garment is to the author the symbol of whatever, by means of external contact, shares in the moral destruction of those men.

When this is brought before our conscience through the <span class="greekheb">ἔλεγχος</span> there arises a feeling of sin, which is always painful: thus every <span class="greekheb">ἔλεγχος</span> is a chastening, a punishment.” Compare Grote’s life-like account of the Socratic Elenchus in his <span class="ital">Hist. of Greece</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[800] Codex Angelicus (sæc. ix.), at Rome, collated by Tischendorf and others.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This verse seems to be referred to in <span class="ital">Can.

There is a tone of greater severity in the <span class="greekheb">ποιῆσαι κρίσιν καὶ ἐλέγξαι</span> of the 15th verse, but even there we need not suppose that the preacher is hopeless of good being effected. The point is of importance in deciding the mutual relations of the three cases here considered.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">διακρινομένους</span>. We should have expected a nominative here to correspond with <span class="greekheb">ἁρπάζοντες</span> and <span class="greekheb">μισοῦντες</span> in the following clauses, and so the <span class="ital">text. rec.</span> has <span class="greekheb">διακρινόμενοι</span>, wrongly translated in A.V., as if it were the active <span class="greekheb">διακρίνοντες</span>, “making a difference”. This gives such a good sense that some commentators (<span class="ital">e.g.</span> Stier) have been willing to condone the bad Greek. It would have been better to alter the reading at once. Keeping the reading of the best MSS. we may either take the accusative as complementary to <span class="greekheb">ἐλέγχετε</span> (as we find in Plato, <span class="ital">Theaet.</span> 171 D, <span class="greekheb">ἐμὲ ἐλέγξας ληροῦντα</span>, Xen. <span class="ital">Mem.</span> 1, 7, 2, <span class="greekheb">ἐλεγχθήσεται γελοῖος ὤν</span>, Jelf. § 681), or simply as descriptive of the condition of the persons referred to. There is also a question as to the meaning we should assign to <span class="greekheb">διακρ</span>. Is it to be understood in the same sense as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-6.htm" title2="But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavers is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.">Jam 1:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-4.htm" title2="Are you not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts?">Jam 2:4</a>? In that case we might translate “convict them of their want of faith,” taking the participle as complementary to the verb; or “reprove them because of their doubts”. It seems more probable, however, that the meaning here is “convince them when they dispute with you,” which we may compare with <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-15.htm" title2="But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asks you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear:">1 Peter 3:15</a>, <span class="greekheb">ἕτοιμοι ἀεὶ πρὸς ἀπολογίαν παντὶ τῷ αἰτοῦντι ὑμᾶς λόγον</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἀλλὰ μετὰ πραΰτητος καὶ φόβου</span> (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <span class="greekheb">ἐν φόβῳ</span> below). So taken, this first clause would refer to intellectual difficulties to be met by quiet reasoning; the force of <span class="greekheb">διακρινόμενος</span> being the same as that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-9.htm" title2="And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites, that dwelled in the mountain, and in the south, and in the valley.">Jude 1:9</a>, <span class="greekheb">τῷ διαβόλῳ διακρ</span>., and in Socr. <span class="ital">E.H.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-5.htm" title2="And they found Adonibezek in Bezek: and they fought against him, and they slew the Canaanites and the Perizzites.">Jude 1:5</a>, <span class="greekheb">ὅ λαὸς εἶχεν ὁμόνοιαν καὶ οὐκέτι πρὸς ἀλλήλους διεκρίνοντο</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/jude/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">22</span>. <span class="ital">And of some have compassion, making a difference</span> …] The MSS. present a strange variety of readings. Those of most authority give, <span class="ital">Some</span> <span class="bld">rebuke</span> (or <span class="bld">convict</span>, the same word as that used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-8.htm" title2="And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:">John 16:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-11.htm" title2="And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them.">Ephesians 5:11</a>) <span class="ital">when they</span> <span class="bld">debate</span> <span class="ital">with you</span> (participle in the accusative case). The Received Text rests on the evidence of later MSS., but it may be questioned whether the participle (in this case in the nominative), which is in the middle voice, can have the meaning of “making a difference,” and even if we adopt that reading it would be better to render the word <span class="bld">rebuke, as you debate with them</span>, as with an implied reference to the same word as used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-9.htm" title2="And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites, that dwelled in the mountain, and in the south, and in the valley.">Jude 1:9</a>. Internal evidence, as far as it goes, agrees with the better MSS.
