That is infinitely worse than to separate from any branch of the visible church on account of opinions, or modes and circumstances of outward government or worship. Sensual men have not the spirit of holiness, which whoever has not, does not belong to Christ. The grace of faith is most holy, as it works by love, purifies the heart, and overcomes the world, by which it is distinguished from a false and dead faith. Our prayers are most likely to prevail, when we pray in the Holy Ghost, under his guidance and influence, according to the rule of his word, with faith, fervency, and earnestness; this is praying in the Holy Ghost. And a believing expectation of eternal life will arm us against the snares of sin: lively faith in this blessed hope will help us to mortify our lusts. We must watch over one another; faithfully, yet prudently reprove each other, and set a good example to all about us. This must be done with compassion, making a difference between the weak and the wilful. Some we must treat with tenderness. Others save with fear; urging the terrors of the Lord. All endeavours must be joined with decided abhorrence of crimes, and care be taken to avoid whatever led to, or was connected with fellowship with them, in works of darkness, keeping far from what is, or appears to be evil.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jude/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>These be they who separate themselves - That is, from their brethren and from the work of benevolence and truth.

These be they&#8212;showing that their characters are such as Peter and Paul had foretold.<p>separate themselves&#8212;from Church communion in its vital, spiritual reality: for outwardly they took part in Church ordinances (Jude 12). Some oldest manuscripts omit "themselves": then understand it, "separate," cast out members of the Church by excommunication (Isa 65:5; 66:5; Lu 6:22; Joh 9:34; compare "casteth them out of the Church;" 3Jo 10). Many, however, understand "themselves," which indeed is read in some of the oldest manuscripts as English Version has it. Arrogant setting up of themselves, as having greater sanctity and a wisdom and peculiar doctrine, distinct from others, is implied.<p>sensual&#8212;literally, "animal-souled": as opposed to the spiritual, or "having the Spirit." It is translated, "the natural man," 1Co 2:14. In the threefold division of man's being, body, soul, and spirit, the due state in God's design is, that "the spirit," which is the recipient of the Holy Spirit uniting man to God, should be first, and should rule the soul, which stands intermediate between the body and spirit: but in the animal, or natural man, the spirit is sunk into subserviency to the animal soul, which is earthly in its motives and aims. The "carnal" sink somewhat lower, for in these the flesh, the lowest element and corrupt side of man's bodily nature, reigns paramount.<p>having not the Spirit&#8212;In the animal and natural man the spirit, his higher part, which ought to be the receiver of the Holy Spirit, is not so; and therefore, his spirit not being in its normal state, he is said not to have the spirit (compare Joh 3:5, 6). In the completion of redemption the parts of redeemed man shall be placed in their due relation: whereas in the ungodly, the soul severed from the spirit shall have for ever animal life without union to God and heaven&#8212;a living death.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/jude/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="ital">These be they who separate themselves; </span> viz. from the true doctrine and church of Christ, as being in love with their carnal liberties, and loth to come under the yoke of Christ’s discipline. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Sensual; </span> or carnal, or animal, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-14.htm" title2="But the natural man receives not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness to him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.">1 Corinthians 2:14</a></span>; such as are mere men, and have no higher principle in them than human nature, which, left to itself, and being destitute of the sanctifying Spirit, is generally overpowered by sense, and inclines to fleshly lusts. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Having not the Spirit; </span> the Spirit of God, by which they should be led, and to which they so much pretend; having neither the light, nor grace, nor comfort of the Spirit. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/jude/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>These be they who separate themselves,....

Neither explanation is, however, justified from the use of the word <span class="greekheb">διορίζειν</span>. It is still more arbitrary, with Schott, to explain it: “who make a distinction, namely, between the pneumatical (Pneumatikern), as what they consider themselves, and the psychical (Psychikern), as what true Christians regard them;” for there is no indication of such a distinction made by them. If we base the explanation on the significance of <span class="greekheb">διορίζειν</span>, the word may be understood as = to make definitions. But in this case what follows must be closely connected with it, by which the mode and manner of their doing so is stated, namely, that they do so as psychical men, who are without the <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span>. Hofmann gives to the verb the meaning: “to determine (define) something exactly in detail,” and then assumes that the preceding genitive <span class="greekheb">τῶν ἀσεβειῶν</span> depends on <span class="greekheb">οἱ ἀποδιοριζόμενοι</span>, which may well be the case, because a participle standing for a substantive may as well as a substantive govern the genitive. According to this explanation, Jude intends to describe those men as persons “who make impieties the object of an exercise of thought exactly defining everything, and so are the philosophers of impieties.” This explanation is condemned by the harsh and artificial construction which it requires.[44]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ψυχικοὶ</span>, <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα μὴ ἔχοντες</span>] <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span> is not man’s natural spirit,[45] for Jude could not deny this to his opponents; and to explain <span class="greekheb">μὴ ἔχοντες</span> in the sense: “I might say that they have no spirit at all” (Fronmüller), is completely arbitrary. It is rather to be understood of <span class="ital">the Holy Spirit</span> (de Wette-Brückner, Wiesinger, Hofmann); the want of the article and of an epithet, such as <span class="greekheb">ἁγίου</span> or <span class="greekheb">Θεοῦ</span>, is no objection against this interpretation, since the simple word <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span> is often used in the N. T. as a designation for the objective Holy Spirit. It is erroneous to affirm that by this interpretation the conclusion of the description is too flat, for nothing worse can be said of a man who desires to be esteemed a Christian than that he wants the Holy Spirit. Moreover, only so understood does <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα μὴ ἔχοντες</span> correspond to the preceding <span class="greekheb">ψυχικοί</span>, to which it is added as an explanation; <span class="greekheb">ψυχικοί</span> they are, inasmuch as their natural spiritual life left to itself is under the unbroken power of the <span class="greekheb">σάρξ</span>; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/2-14.htm" title2="But the natural man receives not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness to him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned....">1 Corinthians 2:14-15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/3-15.htm" title2="This wisdom descends not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish.">Jam 3:15</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[44] Certainly the dependent genitive may precede the governing substantive; but this union is here rendered impossible by the intervening <span class="greekheb">οὗτοι</span>. A participle also, taken as a substantive, may sometimes govern a genitive; but this is only found with the neuter, and then only rarely. Add to this that <span class="greekheb">οὗτοί εἰσιν</span> here corresponds to the <span class="greekheb">οὗτοί εἰσιν</span> in vv. 16 and 12, and accordingly must stand at the beginning of the sentence.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[45] Schott explains <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span> “spiritual life in <span class="ital">the</span> distinctive character of its being, that it is self-controlled in personal self-consciousness and self-determination,” and so equivalent to “free personality of the spirit”(!); but this free personality, Schott further observes, is not denied to them in the sense as “if they were actually deprived of it,” but only that it “does not attain permanence and reality in actual performance.” This distorted interpretation is contradicted by the fact that Jude simply denies to them <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα ἔχειν</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>REMARK.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Schott attempts to prove that the three verses, 12, 16, and 19, beginning with <span class="greekheb">οὗτοι</span>, refer to the threefold expression contained in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-11.htm" title2="And from there he went against the inhabitants of Debir: and the name of Debir before was Kirjathsepher:">Jude 1:11</a>, namely, in this manner: that the Antinomians, in showing themselves to be <span class="greekheb">σπιλάδες</span> in their <span class="ital">agapé</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-12.htm" title2="And Caleb said, He that smites Kirjathsepher, and takes it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife.">Jude 1:12</a>), resembled Cain; that in being <span class="greekheb">γογγυσταὶ μεμψίμοιροι</span>, and out of greed for material gain indulging in mercenary flattery (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-16.htm" title2="And the children of the Kenite, Moses' father in law, went up out of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which lies in the south of Arad; and they went and dwelled among the people.">Jude 1:16</a>), they resembled Balaam; and that in establishing a self-invented ungodly sanctity in opposition to the divinely appointed and divinely effective Christian sanctity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-19.htm" title2="And the LORD was with Judah; and he drove out the inhabitants of the mountain; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron.">Jude 1:19</a>), they resembled Korah. This juxtaposition, however, is anything but appropriate, resting, on the one hand, on incorrect explanations; and, on the other hand, on the arbitrary selection of separate points. It is incorrect to affirm that the similarity of the Antinomians with Cain consisted in this, that what he did <span class="ital">corporally</span> they did <span class="ital">spiritually</span>; there is contained in this rather a distinction than a similarity. It is arbitrary to bring forward only the last clause of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-16.htm" title2="And the children of the Kenite, Moses' father in law, went up out of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which lies in the south of Arad; and they went and dwelled among the people.">Jude 1:16</a>, which reproaches the Antinomians with flattery, and which may also be found in Balaam; whereas the other expressions in the verse do not suit in the least degree. And lastly, it is erroneous so to interpret <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-19.htm" title2="And the LORD was with Judah; and he drove out the inhabitants of the mountain; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron.">Jude 1:19</a> that the Antinomians were accused of the setting up of a false sanctity; even were this correct, yet the sanctity claimed by them is of a totally different nature from that to which Korah and his company laid claim.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/jude/1.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-19.htm" title2="And the LORD was with Judah; and he drove out the inhabitants of the mountain; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron.">Jude 1:19</a>. <span class="greekheb">οὗτοί εἰσιν οἱ ἀποδιορίζοντες</span>. “These are they that make invidious distinctions.” See Introduction on the Text.

The “sensuous” or <span class="bld">psychical</span> man is not necessarily “carnal” in the sense usually attached to that term, but the two words are closely connected with, and indeed overlap each other. The words seem specially directed against the boast of many of the Gnostic teachers, who, looking to St Paul’s words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-14.htm" title2="But the natural man receives not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness to him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.">1 Corinthians 2:14</a>, boasted that they alone were “spiritual” in that Apostle’s sense of the term, and that the members of the Church were, as the “natural” or “sensuous,” incapable of knowing the higher mysteries of God (Iren. i. 6. 2–4). St Jude retorts the charge, and says that they, who boast of their illumination, are in very deed destitute of every higher element of the religious life. The word for “Spirit” stands without the article in the Greek, and though this does not necessarily exclude the thought that the Spirit of God is spoken of, it is, perhaps, better to rest in the meaning that the false teachers were so absorbed in their lower, sensuous nature that they no longer possessed, in any real sense of the word, that element in man’s compound being, which is itself spiritual, and capable therefore of communion with the Divine Spirit.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/jude/1.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-19.htm" title2="And the LORD was with Judah; and he drove out the inhabitants of the mountain; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron.">Jude 1:19</a>. <span class="greekheb">Οὗτοι</span>) <span class="ital">these</span>.

In three bold strokes it gives a representation of them which is at once the sharpest and the broadest of all. This final description, too, at last lays bare the root of their hopeless corruption. <span class="cmt_word">These be they who separate themselves, sensual, having not the Spirit.</span> The pronoun "themselves" cannot be retained in face of the weight of documentary evidence against it. The verb (which is one of very rare occurrence) is held to be capable of more than one sense - <span class="accented">seceding, causing divisions, creating factions, making definitions</span> or <span class="accented">distinctions.</span> The most natural meaning seems to be that adopted by the Revised Version, <span class="accented">they who make separations.</span> So Tyndale; Cranmer and the Genevan have "these are makers of sects," and Luther gives "makers of factions." It may be that they caused divisions by setting themselves up as the only enlightened Christians, and, on the ground of that enlightenment, claiming to be superior to the moral laws which bound others. The term translated "sensual" has unfortunately no proper representative in English. It is "psychical," being formed from the noun <span class="accented">psyche</span>, which is rendered "life" or "soul." This <span class="accented">psyche</span> is intermediate between "body" and "spirit." It is in the first instance simply the bond or principle of the animal life, and in the second instance it is <span class="accented">embodied</span> life. Thus it is that in man which he has in common with the brute creation beneath him, But it becomes also more than this, expressing that in man which renders him capable of connection with God. For in the third instance it denotes the seat of feeling, desire, affection, and emotion; the center of the personal life - the self in man. The adjective itself occurs in the New Testament only in a few passages of marked importance - <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-14.htm">1 Corinthians 2:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-44.htm">1 Corinthians 15:44, 46</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/3-15.htm">James 3:15</a>; and the present verse. Here it designates the men as men who live only for the natural self - men who make the sensuous nature, with its appetites and passions, the law of their life; <span class="accented">natural</span> or <span class="accented">animal</span> men, as the Revised Version gives it in the margin. Wickliffe renders it "beastly;" Tyndale, Cranmer, and the Genevan, "fleshly;" the Rhemish, "sensual." The third clause admits of being rendered either "having not the spirit" (in which the Authorized is supported by Wickliffe, Tyndale, and Cranmer), or "having not the Spirit" (so the Revised Version, following the Genevan and the Rhemish). For it is in many passages difficult to decide whether the word "spirit" means the Holy Spirit of God or man's own spirit - that in him in virtue of which he can have fellowship with the Divine, and on which God specially acts; "that highest and noblest part of man," as Luther puts it, "which qualifies him to lay hold of incomprehensible, invisible things, eternal things; in short...  the house where faith and God's Word are at home." The rendering of the Revised Version is favoured by the occurrence of the term in the following verse. The Spirit of God was not in the lives or the thoughts of these men, and hence they were creators of division, and sensual. Their pretension was that they were the eminently spiritual. But in refusing the Divine Spirit they had sunk to the level of an animal life, immoral in itself, and productive of confusion to the Church. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/jude/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Separate themselves (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;)<p>Only here in New Testament.

As &#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#769; denotes life in the distinctness of individual existence, "the centre of the personal being, the I of each individual," so this adjective derived from it denotes what pertains to man as man, the natural personality as distinguished from the renewed man. So <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-14.htm">1 Corinthians 2:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-44.htm">1 Corinthians 15:44</a> :. The rendering sensual, here and <a href="http://biblehub.com/james/3-15.htm">James 3:15</a>, is inferential: sensual because natural and unrenewed In contrast with this is<p>The spirit<p>The higher spiritual life. So the adjective &#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;, spiritual, is everywhere in the New Testament opposed to &#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;, natural.
