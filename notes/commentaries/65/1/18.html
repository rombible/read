That is infinitely worse than to separate from any branch of the visible church on account of opinions, or modes and circumstances of outward government or worship. Sensual men have not the spirit of holiness, which whoever has not, does not belong to Christ. The grace of faith is most holy, as it works by love, purifies the heart, and overcomes the world, by which it is distinguished from a false and dead faith. Our prayers are most likely to prevail, when we pray in the Holy Ghost, under his guidance and influence, according to the rule of his word, with faith, fervency, and earnestness; this is praying in the Holy Ghost. And a believing expectation of eternal life will arm us against the snares of sin: lively faith in this blessed hope will help us to mortify our lusts. We must watch over one another; faithfully, yet prudently reprove each other, and set a good example to all about us. This must be done with compassion, making a difference between the weak and the wilful. Some we must treat with tenderness. Others save with fear; urging the terrors of the Lord. All endeavours must be joined with decided abhorrence of crimes, and care be taken to avoid whatever led to, or was connected with fellowship with them, in works of darkness, keeping far from what is, or appears to be evil.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jude/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But, beloved, remember ye ... - There is a striking similarity between these two verses and <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-1.htm">2 Peter 3:1-3</a>. It occurs in the same connection, following the description of the false and dangerous teachers against whom the apostle would guard them, and couched almost in the same words. See it explained in the notes at the similar passage in Peter. When Jude (Jde 1:17) entreats them to remember the words which were spoken by "the apostles," it is not necessarily to be inferred that he was not himself an apostle, for he is speaking of what was past, and there might have been a special reason why he should refer to something that they would distinctly remember which had been spoken by the "other" apostles on this point. Or it might be that he meant also to include himself among them, and to speak of the apostles collectively, without particularly specifying himself.<p>Mockers - The word rendered "mockers" here is the same which in the parallel place in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-3.htm">2 Peter 3:3</a> is rendered "scoffers." Peter has stated more fully what was the particular subject on which they scoffed, and has shown that there was no occasion for it <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-4.htm">2 Peter 3:4</a>, following. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jude/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18. mockers&#8212;In the parallel, 2Pe 3:3, the same Greek is translated, "scoffers." The word is found nowhere else in the New Testament. How Alford can deny that 2Pe 3:2, 3 is referred to (at least in part), I cannot imagine, seeing that Jude quotes the very words of Peter as the words which the apostles used to speak to his (Jude's) readers.<p>walk after their own ungodly lusts&#8212;literally, "after (according to) their own lusts of ungodliness."<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/jude/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="ital">Told you; </span> whether in their preaching or writing. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Ungodly lusts; </span> Greek, lusts of ungodliness; a Hebraism; the vilest lusts. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/jude/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>How that they told you that there should be mockers in the last time,....

An example of it in the very beginning of the Church is given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-13.htm" title2="Others mocking said, These men are full of new wine.">Acts 2:13</a>, <span class="greekheb">ἕτεροι χλευάζοντες ἔλεγον ὅτι γλεύκους μεμεστωμένοι εἰσί</span>. In the O.T. we have such examples as <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-16.htm" title2="But they mocked the messengers of God, and despised his words, and misused his prophets, until the wrath of the LORD arose against his people, till there was no remedy.">2 Chronicles 36:16</a> (the summing up of the attitude of the Jews towards the prophets) <span class="greekheb">ἦσαν μυκτηρίζοντες τοὺς ἀγγέλους αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐξουθενοῦντες τοὺς λόγους αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐμπαίζοντες ἐν τοῖς προφήταις αὐτοῦ</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-8.htm" title2="For since I spoke, I cried out, I cried violence and spoil; because the word of the LORD was made a reproach to me, and a derision, daily.">Jeremiah 20:8</a>, <span class="greekheb">ἐγενήθη λόγος Κυρίου εἰς ὀνειδισμὸν ἐμοὶ καὶ εἰς χλευασμὸν πᾶσαν ἡμέραν</span>. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> also the mockery at the crucifixion, and the declaration in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-25.htm" title2="It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the servant as his lord.

In 2 Peter the purport of this mockery is explained to be the unfulfilled promise of the Parusia. Here we must gather its meaning from the account already given of the libertines. If they turned the grace of God into licentiousness, they would naturally mock at the narrowness and want of enlightenment of those who took a strict and literal view of the divine commandments: if they made light of authority and treated spiritual things with irreverence, if they foamed out their own shame and uttered proud and impious words, if they denied God and Christ, they would naturally laugh at the idea of a judgment to come. On the form <span class="greekheb">ἐμπαίκτης</span> and its cognates, see note on 2 Peter.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τῶν ἀσεβειῶν</span>. I am rather disposed to take <span class="greekheb">τῶν ἀσεβειῶν</span> here as a subjective genitive, “lusts belonging to, or arising from their impieties,” <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-28.htm" title2="And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;">Romans 1:28</a>, <span class="greekheb">καθὼς οὐκ ἐδοκίμασαν τὸν Θεὸν ἔχειν ἐν ἐπιγνώσει</span>, <span class="greekheb">παρέδωκεν αὐτοὺς ὁ Θεὸς εἰς ἀδόκιμον νοῦν</span>. The position of the genitive is peculiar, and probably intended to give additional stress. We may compare it with <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-1.htm" title2="My brothers, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect of persons.">Jam 2:1</a>, <span class="greekheb">μὴ ἐν προσωπολημψίαις ἔχετε τὴν πίστιν τοῦ κυρίου ἡμῶν Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ</span>, <span class="greekheb">τῆς δόξης</span>, where some connect <span class="greekheb">τῆς δόξης</span> with <span class="greekheb">κυρίου</span> in a qualitative sense.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/jude/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">18</span>. <span class="ital">there should be mockers in the last time</span> …] The word for “mockers” is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-3.htm" title2="Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts,">2 Peter 3:3</a>, but the general character of those described agrees with the picture drawn in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-1.htm" title2="Now the Spirit speaks expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;">1 Timothy 4:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-1.htm" title2="This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.">2 Timothy 3:1</a>.
