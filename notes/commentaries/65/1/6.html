The destruction of the unbelieving Israelites in the wilderness, shows that none ought to presume on their privileges. They had miracles as their daily bread; yet even they perished in unbelief. A great number of the angels were not pleased with the stations God allotted to them; pride was the main and direct cause or occasion of their fall. The fallen angels are kept to the judgment of the great day; and shall fallen men escape it? Surely not. Consider this in due time.

Compare the notes, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-4.htm">2 Peter 2:4</a>. The word rendered "estate" (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd;  arche&#772;n) is, in the margin, "principality." The word properly means, "beginning, commencement;" and then that which surpasses others, which is "first," etc., in point of rank and honor; or pre-eminence, priority, precedence, princedom. Here it refers to the rank and dignity which the angels had in heaven. That rank or pre-eminence they did not keep, but fell from it. On the word used here, compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-2.htm">Ephesians 1:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-10.htm">Ephesians 3:10</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/2-10.htm">Colossians 2:10</a>, as applied to angels; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-24.htm">1 Corinthians 15:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/2-15.htm">Colossians 2:15</a>, as applied to demons.<p>But left their own habitation - To wit, according to the common interpretation, in heaven. The word rendered "habitation" (&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;  oike&#772;te&#772;rion) occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. It means here that heaven was their native abode or dwelling-place. They left it by sin; but the expression here would seem possibly to mean that they became "dissatisfied" with their abode, and voluntarily preferred to change it for another. If they did become thus dissatisfied, the cause is wholly unknown, and conjecture is useless. Some of the later Jews supposed that they relinquished heaven out of love for the daughters of men - "Robinson."<p>He hath reserved in everlasting chains - See the notes, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-4.htm">2 Peter 2:4</a>. Peter says, "chains of darkness;" that is, the darkness encompasses them "as" chains. Jude says that those chains are "everlasting," (&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b9;&#836;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;  desmois aidios. Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/1-20.htm">Romans 1:20</a>, "his eternal power and Godhead." The word does not elsewhere occur. It is an appropriate word to denote that which is eternal; and no one can doubt that if a Greek wished to express that idea, this would be a proper word to use. The sense is, that that deep darkness always endures; there is no intermission; no light; it will exist forever. This passage in itself does not prove that the punishment of the rebel angels will be eternal, but merely that they are kept in a dark prison in which there is no light, and which is to exist for ever, with reference to the final trial. The punishment of the rebel angels after the judgment is represented as an everlasting fire, which has been prepared for them and their followers, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-41.htm">Matthew 25:41</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jude/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. (2Pe 2:4.)<p>kept not their first estate&#8212;Vulgate translates, "their own principality," which the fact of angels being elsewhere called "principalities," favors: "their own" implies that, instead of being content with the dignity once for all assigned to them under the Son of God, they aspired higher. Alford thinks the narrative in Ge 6:2 is alluded to, not the fall of the devil and his angels, as he thinks "giving themselves over to fornication" (Jude 7) proves; compare Greek, "in like manner to these," namely, to the angels (Jude 6). It seems to me more natural to take "sons of God" (Ge 6:2) of the Sethites, than of angels, who, as "spirits," do not seem capable of carnal connection. The parallel, 2Pe 2:4, plainly refers to the fall of the apostate angels. And "in like manner to these," Jude 7, refers to the inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah, "the cities about them" sinning "in like manner" as "they" did [Estius and Calvin]. Even if Greek "these," Jude 7, refer to the angels, the sense of "in like manner as these" will be, not that the angels carnally fornicated with the daughters of men, but that their ambition, whereby their affections went away from God and they fell, is in God's view a sin of like kind spiritually as Sodom's going away from God's order of nature after strange flesh; the sin of the apostate angels after their kind is analogous to that of the human Sodomites after their kind. Compare the somewhat similar spiritual connection of whoremongers and covetousness. The apocryphal book of Enoch interprets Ge 6:2 as Alford. But though Jude accords with it in some particulars, it does not follow that he accords with it in all. The Hebrews name the fallen angels Aza and Azael.<p>left&#8212;on their own accord.<p>their own&#8212;Greek, "their proper."<p>habitation&#8212;heaven, all bright and glorious, as opposed to the "darkness" to which they now are doomed. Their ambitious designs seem to have had a peculiar connection with this earth, of which Satan before his fall may have been God's vicegerent, whence arises his subsequent connection with it as first the Tempter, then "the prince of this world."<p>reserved&#8212;As the Greek is the same, and there is an evident reference to their having "kept not their first estate," translate, "He hath kept." Probably what is meant is, He hath kept them in His purpose; that is their sure doom; moreover, as yet, Satan and his demons roam at large on the earth. An earnest of their doom is their having been cast out of heaven, being already restricted to "the darkness of this present world," the "air" that surrounds the earth, their peculiar element now. They lurk in places of gloom and death, looking forward with agonizing fear to their final torment in the bottomless pit. He means not literal chains and darkness, but figurative in this present world where, with restricted powers and liberties, shut out from heaven, they, like condemned prisoners, await their doom.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/jude/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="ital">Kept not their first estate; </span> in which they were created, their original excellency, truth, holiness, purity, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-44.htm" title2="You are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father you will do.

Or "principality"; that holy, honourable, and happy condition, in which they were created; for they were created in perfect holiness and righteousness, stood in the relation of sons to God, and were, for the lustre of their nature, comparable to the morning stars; they were among the thrones, dominions, principalities, and powers; were a superior rank of creatures to men, and who beheld the face, and enjoyed the presence of God; but this estate they kept not, for being mutable creatures, one of them first sinning, the rest were drawn into it by him, and so were not what they were before, nor in the same estate, or place: <p>but left their own habitation; by attempting to rise higher; or by quitting their station and posts of honour, being unwilling to be subject to God, and especially to the Son of God, who was to assume human nature, and in it be above them, which they could not bear; and by gathering together in a body, in another place, with Satan at the head of them; though this may be considered as a part of their punishment, and they may be said to do what they were forced to; for they were drove out of their native habitation, heaven; they were turned out of it, and cast down to hell; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-4.htm">2 Peter 2:4</a>. And this their habitation, which they left, or fell from, or they were cast out of, is by the Jews frequently called the place of their holiness, or their holy place (g), <p>He hath reserved in everlasting chains, under darkness; by these "everlasting chains" may be meant the power and providence of God over them, which always abide upon them; or their sins, and the guilt of them upon their consciences, under which they are continually held; or the decrees and purposes of God concerning their final punishment and destruction, which are immutable and irreversible, and from which there is no freeing themselves:, the phrase, under darkness, may refer to the chains, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-4.htm">2 Peter 2:4</a>; where they are called "chains of darkness"; either because the power, providence, and purposes of God are invisible; so the Syriac version reads, "in unknown chains"; or because horror and black despair are the effects of sin, and its guilt, with which their consciences are continually filled: or it may denote the place and state where they are, either in the darkness of the air, or in the dark parts of the earth, or in hell, where is utter darkness, even blackness of darkness; or that they are under the power of sin, which is darkness, and without the light of God's countenance, or any spiritual knowledge, or comfort: and they are "reserved" in these chains, and under this darkness; or "in prison", as the Arabic version renders it; which denotes the custody of them, and their continuance in it, in which they are kept by Jesus Christ, who can bind and loose Satan at his pleasure; and it shows that they are not as yet in full torment, but are like malefactors that are kept in prison, until the assize comes: so these are laid in chains, and kept in custody <p>unto the judgment of the great day; that is, the future and last "judgment" of men and devils, which is certain, and will be universal, and executed with the strictest justice: this is called "a day", which is fixed by God, though unknown to men and angels; and because of the evidence and quick dispatch of things, the matters judged will be as clear as the day, and finished at once; and a great one, for the Judge will appear in great glory; great things will be done, the dead will be raised, and all nations will be gathered together, and the process will be with great solemnity; the thrones will be set, the books opened, the several sentences pronounced, and, all punctually executed; the judgment of the great day is the same the Jews call  , "the day of the great judgment" (h). This account shows the imprisoned state of the devils, that they are not their own lords, and cannot do as they would; they are under restraints, and in chains, and not to be feared; which must be a great mortification to their proud and malicious spirits: and since this is the case of fallen angels, what severity may be expected from God against the opposers of the truths of the Gospel? <p>(g) Yalkut Simeoni, par. 2. fol. 73. 1.

A second example taken from the angelic world. As God spared not the people rescued from bondage, so neither did He spare the angels who left their habitation.

But by <span class="greekheb">ἀπολ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τὸ ἴδ</span>. <span class="greekheb">οἰκητ</span>., according to the Book of Enoch 12:4,[18] is meant their forsaking of heaven, and their descent to earth in order to go after the daughters of men (so also Hofmann); but not, as Hornejus and others think, the loss of the heavenly dwelling, which they drew upon themselves by conspiring against God; which would militate against the first observation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>By <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΡΧΉ</span></span></span> expositors understand either <span class="ital">the original condition</span> (origo: Calvin, Grotius, Hornejus,[19] and others), or <span class="ital">the dominion which originally belonged to them</span> (Bengel, de Wette, Wiesinger, Schott, Hofmann; Brückner thinks that the meaning <span class="ital">dominion</span> passes over into that of <span class="ital">origin</span>). According to the first explanation, the term is too indefinite, both in itself and in reference to the second parallel clause. It is in favour of the second explanation, that in the N.

By this explanation, also, the two clauses correspond; instead of administering their office as rulers, they forsook their heavenly habitation, and thus became culpable. The explanation, according to which <span class="greekheb">ἀρχὴ ἑαυτῶν</span> denotes not the dominion of the angels, but the dominion of God, to which they were subjected, is both against linguistic usage and against the context.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">εἰς κρίσιν</span> … <span class="greekheb">τετήρηκεν</span>] Statement of the punishment.

Philippi (p. 140) observes: “Jude speaks here of the original fall of the angels from pride, not of their union with earthly women.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">Ἔνθα θεοὶ Τιτῆνες ὑπὸ ζόφῳ ἠρόεντα</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">Κεκρύφαται</span>, <span class="greekheb">βουλῆσι Διὸς νεφεληγερέταο</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">Χώρῳ ἐν εὐρώεντι</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/jude/1.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-6.htm" title2="But Adonibezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes.">Jude 1:6</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἀγγέλους τε τοὺς μὴ τηρήσαντας τὴν ἐαυτῶν ἀρχὴν</span> … <span class="greekheb">εἰς κρίσιν</span> … <span class="greekheb">τετήρηκεν</span>.] <span class="ital">Cf.</span> Clem.

Looking to the fact that the term is used in the New Testament, as by Jewish writers, as describing a class of angels (the “principalities” of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-21.htm" title2="Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come:">Ephesians 1:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-10.htm" title2="To the intent that now to the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God,">Ephesians 3:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-12.htm" title2="For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.">Ephesians 6:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-16.htm" title2=" For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:">Colossians 1:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-15.htm" title2=" And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it.">Colossians 2:15</a>), the latter explanation is probably the true one. On the nature of the sin referred to, see notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-4.htm" title2="For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved to judgment;">2 Peter 2:4</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">but left their own habitation</span>] As this is named as the sin, not as the punishment, it seems to imply a descent from the region of heaven to that of earth, like that implied in the language of <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-2.htm" title2="That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.">Genesis 6:2</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">he hath reserved in everlasting chains</span> …] The words, like those of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-4.htm" title2="For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved to judgment;">2 Peter 2:4</a>, seem to indicate a distinction between the angels who were thus punished, and the “demons” or “unclean spirits” with Satan at their head, who exercise a permitted power as the tempters, accusers, and destroyers of mankind, the “world-rulers of this darkness” of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-12.htm" title2="For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.">Ephesians 6:12</a>, who even “in heavenly places” carry on their warfare against the souls of men. It is possible that St Jude recognised such a distinction. His language, like that of St Peter, follows the traditions of the Book of Enoch, which speaks of fallen angels as kept in their prison-house till the day of judgment (xxii. 4), and those which are represented by the <span class="ital">Midrasch Ruth</span> in the <span class="ital">Book of Zohar</span>, “After that the sons of God had begotten sons, God took them and brought them to the mount of darkness and bound them in chains of darkness which reach to the middle of the great abyss.” A fuller form of the Rabbinic legend relates that the angels Asa and Asael charged God with folly in having created man who so soon provoked Him, and that He answered that if they had been on earth they would have sinned as man had done. “And thereupon He allowed them to descend to earth, and they sinned with the daughters of men. And when they would have returned to Heaven they could not, for they were banished from their former habitation and brought into the dark mountains of the earth” (<span class="ital">Nischmath Chaim</span> in Nork’s <span class="ital">Rabbinische Quellen und Parallelen</span>). The resemblance between this tradition and that of the Zoroastrian legend of the fall of Ahriman and his angels, and again of the punishment of the Titans by Zeus in the mythology of Hesiod (<span class="ital">Theogon</span>. 729), shews the wide-spread currency of the belief referred to. How far this allusive reference to a tradition which the writers accepted stamps it with a Divine authority as an article of faith is a question the answer to which depends on external considerations as to the nature of the inspiration by which the writers who so referred were guided. The office of the interpreter is limited to stating what, as far as can be gathered, was actually in the thoughts of the writer.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/jude/1.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-6.htm" title2="But Adonibezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes.">Jude 1:6</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἀγγέλους</span>, <span class="ital">the angels</span>) <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-4.htm" title2="For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved to judgment;">2 Peter 2:4</a>, note.—<span class="greekheb">μὴ τηρήσαντας</span>, <span class="ital">that kept not</span>) They ought therefore to have kept it.—<span class="greekheb">ἀρχὴν</span>) <span class="ital">their dignity</span>; the state <span class="ital">once for all</span> assigned to them, under the Son of God: Colossians 1—<span class="greekheb">ἀπολιπόντας</span>, <span class="ital">who left</span>) of their own accord.—<span class="greekheb">ἴδιον</span>, <span class="ital">their own</span>) befitting them.—<span class="greekheb">οἰκητηρίον</span>, <span class="ital">habitation</span>) bright and shining, opposed to <span class="greekheb">ζόφον</span>, <span class="ital">darkness</span>.—<span class="greekheb">ἀϊδίοις</span>, <span class="ital">everlasting</span>) A dreadful epithet, as here used.

The copula connects it closely with the former, and gives it some emphasis: "angels, too," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, angels not less than the people selected by God to be a people for himself, have been examples of the terrible law of Divine retribution. The particular class of  angels are defined as <span class="cmt_word">those who kept not their first estate;</span> or better, <span class="accented">their own principality.</span> The idea conveyed by the term here is that of <span class="accented">lordship</span> rather than <span class="accented">beginning.</span> It is the term which is held by most commentators to be used as a title of angels in such passages as <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-21.htm">Ephesians 1:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-10.htm">Ephesians 3:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>, etc., where mention is made of "principalities." In the present passage Tyndale, Cranmer, the Genevan and our Authorized Version agree in rendering it "first estate." But the Rhemish gives "principality," and Wickliffe has "princehood." Those seem right, therefore, who take the reference to be to the Jewish idea of a peculiar dignity or lordship held by the angels in creation. The sin alleged as the reason for the penalty which the writer recalls to the minds of his readers is that they failed to keep this lordship, and <span class="cmt_word">left their proper habitation;</span> by which latter clause a descent to a different sphere of being is intended. The penalty itself is this - that God <span class="cmt_word">hath kept them in everlasting chains</span> (or, <span class="accented">bonds</span>, with the Revised Version) <span class="cmt_word">under darkness unto the judgment of the great day.</span> It is well to retain the rendering "kept" in this clause, instead of the "reserved" of the Authorized Version. For the verb used in describing the sin and that used in describing the penalty are the same. As they "kept not their lordship," God has <span class="accented">"kept</span> them in everlasting bonds." The word by which the idea of the <span class="accented">everlasting</span> is expressed is a peculiarly strong one, occurring only once again in the New Testament, viz. in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-20.htm">Romans 1:20</a>, where it is applied to God's <span class="accented">"eternal</span> power." It designates these bonds as bonds from which there never can be escape. The <span class="accented">place</span> of this present penal detention is declared to be "under darkness." The term selected for the <span class="accented">darkness</span>, again, is an unusual one, occurring only here, in verse 13, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-4.htm">2 Peter 2:4, 17</a>, and possibly <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-18.htm">Hebrews 12:18</a>. It means the densest, blackest darkness, and is used both in Homer and in the apocryphal literature (Wisd. 17:2) of the darkness of the nether world. This darkness, as Dean Alford observes, is "considered as brooding over them, and they under it." But this present penal detention is itself the prelude to a still more awful doom - "the judgment of the great day" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-20.htm">Acts 2:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-17.htm">Revelation 6:17</a>). There is a similar, but less definite, statement on the subject of angelic sin and penalty in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-4.htm">2 Peter 2:4</a>. But these representations differ greatly from others (<span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-2.htm">Ephesians 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>), where the air or the heavenly places appear as the scenes occupied by evil spirits, and these spirits possess freedom. In the New Testament, indeed, there are no passages, except those in Peter and Jude, which speak of fallen angels as at present in bonds. Even in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-41.htm">Matthew 25:41</a>, the statement is of a fate <span class="accented">prepared</span>, and nothing more. The difference in the two representations is due probably to a difference in the subjects. Other passages refer to the devil and his angels. But in the present passage there is nothing to indicate that the fall of Satan is in view. The sin suggested by the context is not the sin of pride, but a sin against nature. The reference, therefore, is taken to be to the Jewish idea that amatory passion is not limited to the creatures of earth, and that some angels, yielding to the spell of the beauty of the daughters of men, forsook their own kingdom, and entered unto unnatural relations with them. The Jewish belief is seen in the story of Asmodeus in the Book of Tobit; it is found by Josephus (who has been followed by not a few modern interpreters) in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-1.htm">Genesis 6:1-4</a>; and it is given with special distinctness in the Book of Enoch. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/jude/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>First estate (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd;)<p>The word originally signifies beginning, and so frequently in New Testament, mostly in the Gospels, Acts, Hebrews, Catholic Epistles, and Apocalypse. From this comes a secondary meaning of sovereignty, dominion, magistracy, as being the beginning or first place of power. So mostly by Paul, as principalities (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-38.htm">Romans 8:38</a>); rule (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-24.htm">1 Corinthians 15:24</a>).

In this passage the A. V. has adopted the first meaning, beginning, in its rendering first estate. Rev. adopts the second, rendering principality. The Jews regarded the angels as having dominion over earthly creatures; and the angels are often spoken of in the New Testament as &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;, principalities; as <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-38.htm">Romans 8:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-21.htm">Ephesians 1:21</a>; so that this term would be appropriate to designate their dignity, which they forsook.<p>Habitation (&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;)<p>Only here and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-2.htm">2 Corinthians 5:2</a>.<p>Everlasting (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b9;&#836;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;)<p>Only here and <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-20.htm">Romans 1:20</a>.
