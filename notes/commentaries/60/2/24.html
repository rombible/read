But at the same time it serves to enforce still more strongly the two points already mentioned—<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, sinlessness and suffering. So far was Christ from “doing sins,” that He actually His own self bore ours, and in so doing endured the extremity of anguish “in His own body,” so that He could sympathise with the corporal chastisements of these poor servants; and “on the tree,” too, the wicked slave’s death.<p><span class= "bld">Bare our sins . . . on the tree.</span>—This brings us face to face with a great mystery; and to add to the difficulty of the interpretation, almost each word is capable of being taken in several different ways. Most modern scholars are agreed to reject “<span class= "ital">on</span> the tree,” in favour of the marginal “to,” the proper meaning of the Greek preposition, when connected (as here) with the accusative, being what is expressed in colloquial English by the useful compound “<span class= "ital">on-to</span> the tree.” It is, however, not obligatory to see motion consciously intended in this preposition and accusative everywhere. It is used, for instance, <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/4-38.htm" title="And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow: and they awake him, and say to him, Master, care you not that we perish?">Mark 4:38</a>, of sleeping <span class= "ital">on</span> the pillow; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-15.htm" title="But even to this day, when Moses is read, the veil is on their heart.">2Corinthians 3:15</a>, of the veil resting <span class= "ital">upon</span> their hearts; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-4.htm" title="And round about the throne were four and twenty seats: and on the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting, clothed in white raiment; and they had on their heads crowns of gold.">Revelation 4:4</a>, of the elders sitting <span class= "ital">upon</span> their thrones. This word, then, will give us but little help to discover the meaning of the word translated “bare.” (1) That verb means literally “to carry or take up,” and is used thus in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/17-1.htm" title="And after six days Jesus takes Peter, James, and John his brother, and brings them up into an high mountain apart,">Matthew 17:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/9-2.htm" title="And after six days Jesus takes with him Peter, and James, and John, and leads them up into an high mountain apart by themselves: and he was transfigured before them.">Mark 9:2</a>, of taking the disciples up the Mount of Transfiguration; and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-51.htm" title="And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven.">Luke 24:51</a>, of Jesus being carried up into heaven: therefore Hammond, Grimm, and others would here understand it to be, “He carried our sins up with Him on-to the tree,” there to expiate them by His death. (2) A much commoner meaning of the word is that which it bears in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-5.htm" title="You also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.">1Peter 2:5</a>, “to offer up” (so also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-27.htm" title="Who needs not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people's: for this he did once, when he offered up himself.">Hebrews 7:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-15.htm" title="By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name.">Hebrews 13:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-21.htm" title="Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son on the altar?">James 2:21</a>). The substantive formed from it (<span class= "ital">Anaphora</span>) is still the liturgical term for the sacrificial section of the Eucharistic service. This interpretation is somewhat tempting, because the very preposition here used, with the very same case, appears in <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-21.htm" title="Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son on the altar?">James 2:21</a>, and frequently in the Old Testament, together with our present verb, for “to offer up <span class= "ital">upon</span> the altar.” In this way it would be, “He offered up our sins in His own body <span class= "ital">on the altar of</span> the cross.” So Luther and others take it. This would be perfect, were it not for the strangeness of regarding the sins themselves as a sacrifice to be offered on the altar. The only way to make sense of it in that case would be to join very closely “our sins in His own body”—<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>as contained and gathered up in His own sinless body, which might come to nearly the same thing as saying that He “offered up His own body laden with our sins” upon that altar. (3) Both these renderings, however, pass over the fact that St. Peter is referring to Isaiah 53. In the English version of that chapter, “hath borne,” “shall bear,” “bare,” appears in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-4.htm" title="To whom coming, as to a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God, and precious,">1Peter 2:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_peter/2-11.htm" title="Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;">1Peter 2:11-12</a>, indifferently; but the Hebrew is not the same in each case, for in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-11.htm" title="Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;">1Peter 2:11</a> the word for “shall bear” is identical with that rightly rendered “carry” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-4.htm" title="To whom coming, as to a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God, and precious,">1Peter 2:4</a>, and has not the same signification as that which appears as “to bear” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-4.htm" title="To whom coming, as to a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God, and precious,">1Peter 2:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-12.htm" title="Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.">1Peter 2:12</a>. The difference between these two Hebrew roots seems to be that the verb <span class= "ital">sabal</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-11.htm" title="Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;">1Peter 2:11</a> means “to carry,” as a porter carries a load, or as our Lord carried His cross; while the verb <span class= "ital">nasa</span>,’ used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-4.htm" title="To whom coming, as to a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God, and precious,">1Peter 2:4</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-12.htm" title="Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.">1Peter 2:12</a>, means rather “to lift or raise,” which might, of course, be the action preparatory to that other of “carrying.” Now, the Greek word which we have here undoubtedly better represents <span class= "ital">nasa’</span> than <span class= "ital">sabal, </span>but the question is complicated by the fact that the LXX. uses it to express both alike in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_peter/2-11.htm" title="Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;">1Peter 2:11-12</a>, observing at the same time the distinction between “iniquities” and “sin,” while in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-4.htm" title="To whom coming, as to a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God, and precious,">1Peter 2:4</a> (where again it reads “our sins” instead of “our griefs”) it adopts a simpler verb; and St. Peter’s language here seems to be affected by all three passages. The expression “our sins” (which comes in so strangely with the use of “you” all round) seems a reminiscence of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-4.htm" title="To whom coming, as to a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God, and precious,">1Peter 2:4</a> (LXX.). The order in which the words occur is precisely the order of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-11.htm" title="Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;">1Peter 2:11</a>, and the tense points to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-12.htm" title="Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.">1Peter 2:12</a>, as well as the parallel use in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-28.htm" title="So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and to them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin to salvation.">Hebrews 9:28</a>, where the presence of the words “of many” proves that the writer was thinking of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-12.htm" title="Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.">1Peter 2:12</a>. We cannot say for certain, then, whether St. Peter meant to represent <span class= "ital">nasa’</span> or <span class= "ital">sabal.</span> We have some clue, however, to the way in which the Greek word was used, by finding it in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-33.htm" title="And your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years, and bear your prostitutions, until your carcasses be wasted in the wilderness.">Numbers 14:33</a>, where the “whoredoms” of the fathers are said to be “borne” by their children (the Hebrew there being <span class= "ital">nasa’</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> Many instances in classical Greek lead to the conclusion that in such cases it implies something being <span class= "ital">laid</span> or <span class= "ital">inflicted</span> from without upon the person who “bears.” Thus, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-33.htm" title="And your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years, and bear your prostitutions, until your carcasses be wasted in the wilderness.">Numbers 14:33</a>, it will be, “your children will <span class= "ital">have to</span> bear your whoredoms,” or, “will have laid upon them your whoredoms.” In <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-28.htm" title="So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and to them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin to salvation.">Hebrews 9:28</a> it will be, “Christ was once for all presented (at the altar), to have the sins of many laid upon Him.” Here it will be, “Who His own self had our sins laid upon His body on the tree.” Then comes a further question. The persons who hold the substitute theory of the Atonement assert that “our sins” here stands for “the <span class= "ital">punishment</span> of our sins.” This is, however, to use violence with words; we might with as good reason translate <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-22.htm" title="Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:">1Peter 2:22</a>, “Who did, or performed, no punishment for sin.” St. Peter asserts that Christ, in His boundless sympathy with fallen man, in His union with all mankind through the Incarnation whereby He became the second Adam, actually took, as His own, our sins, as well as everything else belonging to us. He was so identified with us, that in the great Psalm of the Messianic sacrifice, He calls them “My sins” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-12.htm" title="For innumerable evils have compassed me about: my iniquities have taken hold on me, so that I am not able to look up; they are more than the hairs of my head: therefore my heart fails me.">Psalm 40:12</a>), sinless as He was. (See St. Matthew’s interpretation of the same thought, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-17.htm" title="That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, Himself took our infirmities, and bore our sicknesses.">Matthew 8:17</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">That we being dead.</span>—Just as the former part of this verse is an expansion of “Christ suffered for us,” so the latter part is an expansion of “that ye should follow His steps.” The “we,” however, is too emphatically placed in the English. To St. Peter, the thought of our union with Christ is so natural, that he slips easily over it, and passes on to the particular point of union which he has in view. “He bore our sins on the tree, in order that, having thus become ‘lost’ to those sins, we might live to righteousness.” The words present, perhaps, a closer parallel to <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-22.htm" title=" In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and blameless and unreproveable in his sight:">Colossians 1:22</a> than to any other passage; but comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-2.htm" title="God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?">Romans 6:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-8.htm" title="Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him:">Romans 6:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-11.htm" title="Likewise reckon you also yourselves to be dead indeed to sin, but alive to God through Jesus Christ our Lord.">Romans 6:11</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-14.htm" title="For the love of Christ constrains us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead:">2Corinthians 5:14</a>, and Notes. St. Peter’s word for “dying” in this place is not elsewhere found in the New Testament, and is originally an euphemism for death; literally, <span class= "ital">to be missing</span>—<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, when sin comes to seek its old servants it finds them gone.<p><span class= "bld">With whose stripes ye were healed.</span>—Observe how soon St. Peter reverts to the second person, even though he has to change the text he is quoting. Another mark of his style may well be noticed here, viz., his fondness for a number of co-ordinate relative sentences. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-8.htm" title="Whom having not seen, you love; in whom, though now you see him not, yet believing, you rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory:">1Peter 1:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-12.htm" title="To whom it was revealed, that not to themselves, but to us they did minister the things, which are now reported to you by them that have preached the gospel to you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven; which things the angels desire to look into.">1Peter 1:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_peter/2-1.htm" title="But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privately shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring on themselves swift destruction.">2Peter 2:1-3</a>; and his speeches, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-13.htm" title="The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified his Son Jesus; whom you delivered up, and denied him in the presence of Pilate, when he was determined to let him go.">Acts 3:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-15.htm" title="And killed the Prince of life, whom God has raised from the dead; whereof we are witnesses.">Acts 3:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-10.htm" title="Be it known to you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead, even by him does this man stand here before you whole.">Acts 4:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/10-38.htm" title="How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him.">Acts 10:38-39</a>.) He is especially fond of finishing off a long sentence with a short relative clause, as here. Comp., for instance, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-8.htm" title="And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense, even to them which stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were appointed.">1Peter 2:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-17.htm" title="These are wells without water, clouds that are carried with a tempest; to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever.">2Peter 2:17</a>, also <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-12.htm" title="Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.">Acts 4:12</a>, where it would be more correct to translate, “Neither is the salvation in any other, for, indeed, there is no second name under heaven which is <span class= "ital">the appointed</span> name among men; <span class= "ital">in whom</span> we <span class= "ital">must</span> be saved”—<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>if we are saved at all. The purpose of the little clause seems to be once more to make the good and ill-used servants feel, when the weals were smarting on their backs, that the Righteous Servant of Jehovah had borne the same, and that it had served a beneficial purpose, as they knew to their everlasting gratitude. Of course the “stripes” (in the original singular number, and literally <span class= "ital">weal</span>) do not refer <span class= "ital">merely</span> to the scourging. The words form a paradox.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_peter/2.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_peter/2-24.htm" title="Who his own self bore our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live to righteousness: by whose stripes you were healed....">1 Peter 2:24-25</a></span>. <span class="ital">Who his own self </span>— In his own person, and by the sacrifice of himself, and not of another, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-28.htm" title="So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and to them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin to salvation.">Hebrews 9:28</a>,) <span class="ital">bare our sins </span>— That is, the punishment due to them; <span class="ital">in his </span>afflicted, torn, dying <span class="ital">body on the tree</span> — The cross, whereon chiefly slaves or servants were wont to suffer.

The apostle uses here the first person, <span class="ital">our sins, </span>to show that Christ bare the sins of believers, in every age and country; and to make us sensible how extensive the operation of his death is in procuring pardon for sinners.” <span class="ital">That we, being dead to sins — </span>Or, as <span class="greekheb">ταις αμαρτιαις απογενομενοι </span>is more literally rendered, <span class="ital">freed from sins </span>—<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>That is, from the guilt and power; from which, without an atonement, it was impossible we should be delivered. <span class="ital">By whose stripes ye were healed</span> — Of your spiritual disorders: evils infinitely greater than any which the cruelty of the severest masters can bring upon you. See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-5.htm" title="But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was on him; and with his stripes we are healed.">Isaiah 53:5</a>. “By changing his discourse from the first to the second person, the apostle addressed those slaves who might be beaten unmercifully by cruel masters; because, of all the considerations by which they could be animated to patience, the most powerful was, to put them in mind of the painful stripes with which Christ was beaten, when he was scourged by Pilate’s order, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-26.htm" title="Then released he Barabbas to them: and when he had scourged Jesus, he delivered him to be crucified.">Matthew 27:26</a>,) and to tell them, that with these stripes the wounds in their souls, occasioned by sin, were healed; wounds far more painful and deadly than those inflicted on them by their froward masters.” <span class="ital">For ye were as sheep going astray </span>— From their pastures, their shepherd, and his flock, and exposed to want and the danger of being lost in the wilderness, or destroyed by wild beasts; ye were wandering out of the way of truth and duty, of safety, holiness, and happiness, into the by-paths of error and sin, of guilt and misery — paths leading to certain destruction. <span class="ital">But are now returned </span>— Through the influence of divine grace; <span class="ital">unto the Shepherd </span>— The great Shepherd of the sheep, brought again from the dead, through the blood of the everlasting covenant; <span class="ital">and Bishop — </span>the kind Observer, Inspector, and Overseer; <span class="ital">of your souls </span>— Who has graciously received you under his pastoral care, and will maintain that inspection over you which shall be your best security against returning to those fatal wanderings. “Though in this passage the apostle addressed his discourse immediately to servants or slaves, yet, by giving titles to Christ which marked his relation to men of all ranks and conditions, he hath intimated that his exhortation to suffer unmerited evils patiently, is intended for all who profess the gospel.” <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_peter/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:18-25 Servants in those days generally were slaves, and had heathen masters, who often used them cruelly; yet the apostle directs them to be subject to the masters placed over them by Providence, with a fear to dishonour or offend God. And not only to those pleased with reasonable service, but to the severe, and those angry without cause. The sinful misconduct of one relation, does not justify sinful behaviour in the other; the servant is bound to do his duty, though the master may be sinfully froward and perverse. But masters should be meek and gentle to their servants and inferiors. What glory or distinction could it be, for professed Christians to be patient when corrected for their faults? But if when they behaved well they were ill treated by proud and passionate heathen masters, yet bore it without peevish complaints, or purposes of revenge, and persevered in their duty, this would be acceptable to God as a distinguishing effect of his grace, and would be rewarded by him. Christ's death was designed not only for an example of patience under sufferings, but he bore our sins; he bore the punishment of them, and thereby satisfied Divine justice. Hereby he takes them away from us. The fruits of Christ's sufferings are the death of sin, and a new holy life of righteousness; for both which we have an example, and powerful motives, and ability to perform also, from the death and resurrection of Christ. And our justification; Christ was bruised and crucified as a sacrifice for our sins, and by his stripes the diseases of our souls are cured. Here is man's sin; he goes astray; it is his own act. His misery; he goes astray from the pasture, from the Shepherd, and from the flock, and so exposes himself to dangers without number. Here is the recovery by conversion; they are now returned as the effect of Divine grace. This return is, from all their errors and wanderings, to Christ. Sinners, before their conversion, are always going astray; their life is a continued error.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_peter/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Who his own self - See the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>, on the phrase "when he had by himself purged our sins." The meaning is, that he did it in his own proper person; he did not make expiation by offering a bloody victim, but was himself the sacrifice.<p>Bare our sins - There is an allusion here undoubtedly to <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-4.htm">Isaiah 53:4</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-12.htm">Isaiah 53:12</a>. See the meaning of the phrase "to bear sins" fully considered in the notes at those places. As this cannot mean that Christ so took upon himself the sins of people as to become himself a sinner, it must mean that he put himself in the place of sinners, and bore that which those sins deserved; that is, that he endured in his own person that which, if it had been inflicted on the sinner himself, would have been a proper expression of the divine displeasure against sin, or would have been a proper punishment for sin. See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>. He was treated as if he had been a sinner, in order that we might be treated as if we had not sinned; that is, as if we were righteous. There is no other way in which we can conceive that one bears the sins of another. They cannot be literally transferred to another; and all that can be meant is, that he should take the consequences on himself, and suffer as if he had committed the transgressions himself.<p>(See also the supplementary notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/4.htm">Romans 4</a>; 5; and <a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a>, in which the subject of imputation is discussed at large)<p>In his own body - This alludes undoubtedly to his sufferings. The sufferings which he endured on the cross were such as if he had been guilty; that is, he was treated as he would have been if he had been a sinner. He was treated as a criminal; crucified as those most guilty were; endured the same kind of physical pain that the guilty do who are punished for their own sins; and passed through mental sorrows strongly resembling - as much so as the case admitted of - what the guilty themselves experience when they are left to distressing anguish of mind, and are abandoned by God. The sufferings of the Saviour were in all respects made as nearly like the sufferings of the most guilty, as the sufferings of a perfectly innocent being could be.<p>On the tree - Margin, "to the tree" Greek, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3be;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;  epi to xulon. The meaning is rather, as in the text, that while himself on the cross, he bore the sorrows which our sins deserved. It does not mean that he conveyed our sorrows there, but that while there he suffered under the intolerable burden, and was by that burden crushed in death. The phrase "on the tree," literally "on the wood," means the cross. The same Greek word is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-30.htm">Acts 5:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-39.htm">Acts 10:39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-29.htm">Acts 13:29</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a>, as applicable to the cross, in all of which places it is rendered "tree."<p>That we, being dead to sins - In virtue of his having thus been suspended on a cross; that is, his being put to death as an atoning sacrifice was the means by which we become dead to sin, and live to God. The phrase "being dead to sins" is, in the original, &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;  tais hamartiais apogenomenoi - literally, "to be absent from sins." The Greek word was probably used (by an euphemism) to denote to die, that is, to be absent from the world. This is a milder and less repulsive word than to say to die. It is not elsewhere used in the New Testament. The meaning is, that we being effectually separated from sin - that is, being so that it no longer influences us - should live unto God. We are to be, in regard to sin, as if we were dead; and it is to have no more influence over us than if we were in our graves. See the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/6-2.htm">Romans 6:2-7</a>. The means by which this is brought about is the death of Christ (See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-8.htm">Romans 6:8</a>) for as he died literally on the cross on account of our sins, the effect has been to lead us to see the evil of transgression, and to lead new, and holy lives.<p>Should live unto righteousness - Though dead in respect to sin, yet we have real life in another respect. We are made alive unto God to righteousness, to true holiness. See the <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-11.htm">Romans 6:11</a> note; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-20.htm">Galatians 2:20</a> note.<p>By whose stripes - This is taken from <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a>. See it explained in the notes on that verse. The word rendered "stripes" (&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;  mo&#772;lo&#772;pi) means, properly, the livid and swollen mark of a blow; the mark designated by us when we use the expression "black and blue." It is not properly a bloody wound, but that made by pinching, beating, scourging. The idea seems to be that the Saviour was scourged or whipped; and that the effect on us is the same in producing spiritual healing, or in recovering us from our faults, as if we had been scourged ourselves. By faith we see the bruises inflicted on him, the black and blue spots made by beating; we remember that they were on account of our sins, and not for his; and the effect in reclaiming us is the same as if they had been inflicted on us.<p>Ye were healed - Sin is often spoken of as a disease, and redemption from it as a restoration from a deadly malady.

His voluntary undertaking of the work of redemption is implied. The Greek puts in antithetical juxtaposition, OUR, and His OWN SELF, to mark the idea of His substitution for us. His "well-doing" in His sufferings is set forth here as an example to servants and to us all (1Pe 2:20).<p>bare&#8212;to sacrifice: carried and offered up: a sacrificial term. Isa 53:11, 12, "He bare the sin of many": where the idea of bearing on Himself is the prominent one; here the offering in sacrifice is combined with that idea. So the same Greek means in 1Pe 2:5.<p>our sins&#8212;In offering or presenting in sacrifice (as the Greek for "bare" implies) His body, Christ offered in it the guilt of our sins upon the cross, as upon the altar of God, that it might be expiated in Him, and so taken away from us. Compare Isa 53:10, "Thou shalt make His soul an offering for sin." Peter thus means by "bare" what the Syriac takes two words to express, to bear and to offer: (1) He hath borne our sins laid upon Him [namely, their guilt, curse, and punishment]; (2) He hath so borne them that He offered them along with Himself on the altar. He refers to the animals upon which sins were first laid, and which were then offered thus laden [Vitringa]. Sin or guilt among the Semitic nations is considered as a burden lying heavily upon the sinner [Gesenius].<p>on the tree&#8212;the cross, the proper place for One on whom the curse was laid: this curse stuck to Him until it was legally (through His death as the guilt-bearer) destroyed in His body: thus the handwriting of the bond against us is cancelled by His death.<p>that we being dead to sins&#8212;the effect of His death to "sin" in the aggregate, and to all particular "sins," namely, that we should be as entirely delivered from them, as a slave that is dead is delivered from service to his master. This is our spiritful standing through faith by virtue of Christ's death: our actual mortification of particular sins is in proportion to the degree of our effectually being made conformable to His death. "That we should die to the sins whose collected guilt Christ carried away in His death, and so LIVE TO THE RIGHTEOUSNESS (compare Isa 53:11. 'My righteous servant shall justify many'), the gracious relation to God which He has brought in" [Steiger].<p>by whose stripes&#8212;Greek, "stripe."<p>ye were healed&#8212;a paradox, yet true.

As was typified by the high priest bearing the sins of the holy things of the people of Israel, when he went into the most holy place, and by the scape goat bearing the iniquities of all the people unto a land not inhabited, and as was foretold by the Prophet Isaiah. The apostle here explains the nature and end of Christ's sufferings, which were to make atonement for sins, and which was done by bearing them. What Christ bore were "sins", even all sorts of sin, original and actual, and every act of sin of his people; and all that is in sin, all that belongs to it, arises from it, and is the demerit of it, as both filth, guilt, and punishment; and a multitude of sins did he bear, even all the iniquities of all the elect; and a prodigious load and weight it was; and than which nothing could be more nauseous and disagreeable to him, who loves righteousness, and hates iniquity: and these sins he bore were not his own, nor the sins of angels, but of men; and not of all men, yet of many, even as many as were ordained to eternal life, for whom Christ gave his life a ransom, whom he justifies and brings to glory; our sins, not the sins of the Jews only, for Peter was a Jew, and so were those to whom he writes, but of the Gentiles also, even the sins of all his people, for them he saves from their sins, being stricken for them. His "bearing" them was in this manner: he becoming the surety and substitute of his people, their sins were laid upon him by his Father, that is, they were imputed to him, they were reckoned as his, and placed to his account; and Christ voluntarily took them upon himself; he took them to himself, as one may take the debt of another, and make himself answerable for it; or as a man takes up a burden, and lays it on his shoulders; so Christ took up our sins, and "carried" them "up", as the word here used signifies, alluding to the priests carrying up the sacrifice to the altar, and referring to the lifting up of Christ upon the cross; whither he carried the sins of his people, and bore them, and did not sink under the weight of them, being the mighty God, and the man of God's right hand, made strong for himself; and so made entire satisfaction for them, by enduring the wrath of God, the curse of the law, and all that punishment which was due unto them; and thereby bore them away, both from his people, and out of the sight of God, and his vindictive justice; and removed them as far as the east is from the west, and made a full end of them; and this he himself did, and not another, nor by another, or with the help of another; not by the means of a goat, as the high priest, but by himself; though he was assisted in bearing his cross, yet he had no help in bearing our sins; angels could not help him; his Father stood at a distance from him; there was none to help; his own arm brought salvation to him; but <p>his own self, who knew no sin, nor did any, he by himself purged away our sins, and made reconciliation for them, by bearing them: and which he did <p>in his own body, and not another's; in that body which his Father prepared for him, and which he took of the virgin, and was free from sin; though not to the exclusion of his soul, which also was made an offering for sin, and in which he endured great pains and sorrows for sin: and all this <p>on the tree; the accursed tree, the cross; which is expressive both of the shame and pain of his sufferings and death. The end of which was, <p>that we being dead to sin; "to our sins", as the Alexandrian copy, and the Ethiopic version read; as all the elect are, through bearing their sins, and suffering death for them, so as that sin shall not be imputed to them; it is as though it never was; it is dead to them, and they to that, as to its damning power and influence; so as that they are entirely discharged from it, and can never come into condemnation on account of it, and can never be hurt, so as to be destroyed by it; nor by death, either corporeal or eternal, since the sting of death, which is sin, is taken away, and the strength of sin, which is the law, is dead to them, and they to that: in short, through the death of Christ they are so dead to sin, that it is not only finished, made an end of, and put away, but the body of it is destroyed, that it should not be served; which is an end subordinate to the former, and expressed in the next clause: <p>should live unto righteousness; live, and not die the second death, and live by faith on the righteousness of Christ, for justification of life, and soberly, righteously, and godly in this present evil world; which the grace of God teaches, and the love of Christ in bearing sin constrains to, and the redemption by his precious blood lays under an obligation to do; for those whose sins Christ has bore are not their own, but being bought with the price of his blood, they are bound to live to him who has a property in them, and a right to claim all obedience from them: <p>by whose stripes ye were healed; the passage referred to is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a> which is a prophecy of the Messiah, as is acknowledged by the Jews (g), who say (h), <p>"this is the King Messiah, who was in the generation of the ungodly, as it is said, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a> "and with his stripes we are healed"; and for this cause God saved him, that he might save Israel, and rejoice with them in the resurrection of the dead. <p>Sin is a disease, a natural and hereditary one, an epidemic distemper, that reaches to all men, and to all the powers and faculties of their souls, and members of their bodies; and which is nauseous and loathsome, and in itself mortal and incurable; nor can it be healed by any creature, or anything that a creature can do. Christ is the only physician, and his blood the balm and sovereign medicine; this cleanses from all sin; through it is the remission of sin, which is meant by healing; for healing of diseases, and forgiving iniquities, is one and the same thing; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-3.htm">Psalm 103:3</a> on which latter text a learned Jew (i) has this note, <p>"this interpreters explain , "as expressive of forgiveness"; <p>and the Jews say, there is no healing of diseases but it signifies forgiveness (k): it is an uncommon way of healing by the stripes of another. Some think the apostle alludes to the stripes which servants receive from their masters, to whom he was now speaking; and in order to encourage them to bear them patiently, observes, that Christ himself suffered stripes, and that they had healing for their diseases and wounds, by means of his stripes, or through his being wounded and bruised for them, <p>(g) Zohar in Exod. fol. 85. 2.

The words of that chapter which were chiefly present to the mind of the apostle, are those of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-12.htm" title="Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.">1 Peter 2:12</a>, LXX. <span class="greekheb">καί αὐτὸς ἁμαρτίας πολλῶν ἀνήνεγκε</span> (<span class="greekheb">נָשָׂא</span>); cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-11.htm" title="Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;">1 Peter 2:11</a> : <span class="greekheb">καὶ τὰς ἁμαρτίας αὐτῶν αὐτὸς ἀνοίσει</span>, (<span class="greekheb">יִסְבֹּל</span>) and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-4.htm" title="To whom coming, as to a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God, and precious,">1 Peter 2:4</a> : <span class="greekheb">οὗτος τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἁμαρτίας ἡμῶν φέρει</span> (<span class="greekheb">נָשָׂא</span>). The Hebrew <span class="greekheb">נָשָׂא</span> with the accus. of the idea of sin, therefore: “to bear sin,” is equivalent to, “to suffer the punishment for sin,” either one’s own or that of another. Now, as <span class="greekheb">ἀνήνεγκε</span> is in the above-quoted passage a translation of <span class="greekheb">נָשָׂא</span>, its meaning is: “He suffered the punishment for the sins of many.”[156]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This suffering of punishment is, in the case of the Servant of God, of such a nature that by it those whose the sin is, and for whom He endures the punishment, become free from that punishment; it is therefore a vicarious suffering.[157] Since, then, Peter plainly had this passage in his mind, the thought here expressed can be no other than this: that Christ in our stead has suffered the punishment we have merited through our sins, and so has borne our sins. But with this the subsequent <span class="greekheb">ἐπὶ τὸ ξύλον</span>, which means not “on the tree,” but “<span class="ital">on to the tree</span>” does not seem to harmonize. Consequently it has been proposed to take <span class="greekheb">ἀναφέρειν</span> in the sense which it has in the phrase: <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΝΑΦΈΡΕΙΝ ΤΙ ἘΠῚ ΤῸ ΘΥΣΙΑΣΤΉΡΙΟΝ</span></span></span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-21.htm" title="Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son on the altar?">Jam 2:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/14-20.htm" title="And the priest shall offer the burnt offering and the meat offering on the altar: and the priest shall make an atonement for him, and he shall be clean.">Leviticus 14:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-16.htm" title="So all the service of the LORD was prepared the same day, to keep the passover, and to offer burnt offerings on the altar of the LORD, according to the commandment of king Josiah.">2 Chronicles 35:16</a>; <a href="http://apocrypha.org/baruch/1-10.htm" title="And they said, Behold, we have sent you money to buy you burnt offerings, and sin offerings, and incense, and prepare ye manna, and offer upon the altar of the Lord our God;">Bar 1:10</a>; <a href="http://apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/4-53.htm" title="And offered sacrifice according to the law upon the new altar of burnt offerings, which they had made.">1Ma 4:53</a>); cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-5.htm" title="You also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.">1 Peter 2:5</a>; where <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤῸ ΞΎΛΟΝ</span></span></span> would be conceived as the altar (Gerhard: Crux Christi fuit sublime illud altare, in quod Christus se ipsum in sacrificium oblaturus ascendit, sicut V. Testamenti sacrificia altari imponebantur). But against this interpretation, besides the fact that <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΝΑΦΈΡ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> is thus here taken in a sense different from that which it has in Isaiah 53, there are the following objections: (1) That in no other passage of the N. T. is the cross of Christ represented as the altar on which He is offered;[158] (2) That neither in the O. T. nor in the N. T. is <span class="ital">sin</span> anywhere spoken of as the offering which is brought up to the altar.[159] <span class="greekheb">ἐπὶ τὸ ξύλον</span> might be explained by assuming a pregnant construction, as in the Versio Syr., which runs: bajulavit omnia peccata nostra eaque sustulit in corpore suo ad crucem,[160] that is: “<span class="ital">bearing our sins He ascended the cross</span>” But the assumption of such a construction is not necessary, since <span class="greekheb">ἀναφέρειν</span> can quite well be taken to mean “<span class="ital">carrying up</span>,” without depriving the word of the signification which it has in the passage in Isaiah, since “carrying up “implies “carrying.” In no other way did Christ bear our sins up on to the cross than by suffering the punishment for our sins in the crucifixion, and thereby delivering us from the punishment. The apostle lays special stress on the idea of substitution here contained, by the addition of <span class="greekheb">αὐτός</span>, which, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-11.htm" title="He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied: by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities.">Isaiah 53:11</a>, stands by way of emphasis next to <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἩΜῶΝ</span></span></span>; but by <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝ Τῷ ΣΏΜΑΤΙ ΑὐΤΟῦ</span></span></span>—not “<span class="ital">in</span>,”[161] but “<span class="ital">on</span> His body”—we are reminded that His body it was on which the punishment was accomplished, inasmuch as it was nailed to the cross and died thereon. It is quite possible that this adjunct, as Wiesinger assumes, is meant at the same time to serve the purpose of expressing the greatness of that love which moved Christ to give His body to the death for our sins; but that there is in it any special reference to the sacramental words of the Lord (Weiss, p. 273), is a conjecture which has nothing to support it. The addition of <span class="greekheb">ἐπὶ τὸ ξύλον</span> is explained by the fact itself, since it is precisely Christ’s death on the cross that has redeemed us from the guilt and power of our sins. Peter also uses the expression <span class="greekheb">τὸ ξύλον</span> to denote the cross, in his sermons, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-30.htm" title="The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom you slew and hanged on a tree.">Acts 5:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-39.htm" title="And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they slew and hanged on a tree:">Acts 10:39</a>. It had its origin in the Old Testament phraseology, <span class="greekheb">עֵץ</span>, rendered <span class="greekheb">ξύλον</span> by LXX., denoting the pole on which the bodies of executed criminals were sometimes suspended; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/21-22.htm" title="And if a man have committed a sin worthy of death, and he be to be put to death, and you hang him on a tree:...">Deuteronomy 21:22-23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-26.htm" title="And afterward Joshua smote them, and slew them, and hanged them on five trees: and they were hanging on the trees until the evening.">Joshua 10:26</a>. Certainly in this way attention is drawn to the shame of the punishment which Christ suffered; but it is at least doubtful, since there is no reference to it in any way, whether Peter, like Paul, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-13.htm" title="Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangs on a tree:">Galatians 3:13</a>, used the expression with regard to the curse pronounced in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-22.htm" title="And if a man have committed a sin worthy of death, and he be to be put to death, and you hang him on a tree:">Deuteronomy 21:22</a> (as Weiss, p. 267, emphatically denies, and Schott as emphatically asserts).

This proves how unwarranted Hofmann (Schriftbeweis, II. 1, p. 465, 2d ed.) is in saying “that in view of the Greek translation of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/53-11.htm" title="He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied: by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities....">Isaiah 53:11-12</a>, it is arbitrary to assume that <span class="greekheb">ἀναφέρειν</span> means simply to carry.” Of course every one knows that in and of itself <span class="greekheb">ἀναφέρειν</span> does not mean “to carry;” but from this it does not follow that the LXX. did not use it in this sense in the phrase above alluded to, the more so that they attribute to the word no meaning opposed to its classical usage; cf. Thuc. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-18.htm" title="For Christ also has once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:">1 Peter 3:18</a> : <span class="greekheb">κινδύνου</span>; <span class="greekheb">ἀναφέρ</span>.; Pol. 1:30: <span class="greekheb">φθόνους καὶ διαβολὰς ἀναφέρ</span>., see Pape, s.v. <span class="greekheb">ἀναφέρω</span>, and Delitzsch, Komment. z.

Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-33.htm" title="And your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years, and bear your prostitutions, until your carcasses be wasted in the wilderness.">Numbers 14:33</a>, where in the expression <span class="greekheb">ἀνοίσουσι τὴν πορνείαν ὑμῶν</span>, the word <span class="greekheb">πορνεία</span> has by no means the meaning “punishment for fornication,” although <span class="greekheb">ἀναθέρειν τὴν πορνείαν</span> means as much as “to suffer the punishment for fornication.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[161] So, too, Schott, who interprets <span class="greekheb">ἐν τῷ σώματι</span> as equal to “in His earthly bodily life”(!).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>REMARK 1. The interpretation of many of the commentators is wanting in the necessary precision, inasmuch as the two senses, which <span class="greekheb">ἀναφέρειν</span> has in the different phrases: <span class="greekheb">ἀναφέρειν τὰς ἁμαρτίας</span> and <span class="greekheb">ἀναφέρειν τι ἐπὶ τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">θυσιαστήριον</span>, are mixed Up with each other.

Primo dicere voluit Petrus, Christum portasse peccata nostra, in quantum illa ipsi erant imposita. Secundo ita tulisse peccata nostra, ut ea secum obtulerit in altari), while drawing, indeed, a distinction between the two meanings, thinks that Peter had both of them in his mind, which of course is impossible.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Hofmann explains <span class="greekheb">ἀναφέρειν</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἐπὶ τὸ ξύλον</span> on the analogy of the phrase: <span class="greekheb">ἀναφέρειν τι ἐπὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον</span>, without, however, understanding the cross as the altar; the meaning then would be: “He lifted up His body on to the cross, thereby bearing up thither our sins, that is to say, <span class="ital">atoning</span> for our sins.” Although Hofmann admits that Peter had in his mind the passage in Isaiah, he nevertheless denies that <span class="greekheb">ἀνήνεγκε</span> has here the same meaning as there. In his <span class="ital">Schriftbeweis</span>, 1st ed., he gives a similar interpretation, only that there he says: “He took up our sins with Him, and so <span class="ital">took them away from us</span>.” He, however, justly adds that <span class="greekheb">ἀναφέρειν</span> has the same meaning here as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-28.htm" title="So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and to them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin to salvation.">Hebrews 9:28</a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/1_peter/2.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-24.htm" title="Who his own self bore our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live to righteousness: by whose stripes you were healed.">1 Peter 2:24</a>.

Christ is the perfect sin-offering: “Himself the victim and Himself the priest.

So <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-21.htm" title="Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son on the altar?">Jam 2:21</a>, <span class="greekheb">ἐπὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον</span> is substituted for <span class="greekheb">ἐπάνω τῶν ξύλων</span> of the original description of the offering of Isaac, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-9.htm" title="And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar on the wood.">Genesis 22:9</a>.

The paradox is especially pointed in an address to slaves who were frequently scourged.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/1_peter/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">24</span>. <span class="ital">who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree</span>] Here again we have an unmistakeable reference to the language of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-12.htm" title="Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he has poured out his soul to death: and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bore the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.">Isaiah 53:12</a>. The Apostle, though he has begun with pointing to the sufferings of Christ as an example, cannot rest satisfied with speaking of them only under that aspect. He remembers that his Lord had spoken of Himself as giving His life a ransom for many (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-28.htm" title="Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered to, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.">Matthew 20:28</a>), of His blood as that of a new covenant (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-28.htm" title="For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.">Matthew 26:28</a>). He must speak accordingly, even to the slaves whom he calls upon to follow in the footsteps of their Master, of the atoning, mediatorial, sacrificial aspects of His death. Each word is full of a profound significance. The Greek verb for “bare” (<span class="ital">anapherein</span>) is always used with a liturgical sacrificial meaning, sometimes, in a directly transitive sense, of him who offers a sacrifice, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-21.htm" title="Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son on the altar?">James 2:21</a> (“Abraham … when he had <span class="ital">offered</span> Isaac”), <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-27.htm" title="Who needs not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people's: for this he did once, when he offered up himself.">Hebrews 7:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-15.htm" title="By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name.">Hebrews 13:15</a>, and in this very chapter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-5.htm" title="You also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.">1 Peter 2:5</a>); sometimes of the victim offered, as bearing the sins of those who have transgressed, and for whom a sacrifice is required, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-28.htm" title="So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and to them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin to salvation.">Hebrews 9:28</a> and the LXX. of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-12.htm" title="Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he has poured out his soul to death: and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bore the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.">Isaiah 53:12</a>. Here, Christ being at once the Priest and the Victim, one meaning seems to melt into the other. He <span class="ital">offers</span> Himself: He <span class="ital">bears</span> the sins of many. But if there was a priest and a sacrifice, where was the altar? The Apostle finds that altar in the cross, just as many of the best commentators, including even Roman theologians like Estius and Aquinas, recognise a reference to the cross in the “we have an altar” of <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-10.htm" title="We have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle.">Hebrews 13:10</a>. In the word for “tree,” used instead of that for “cross,” we have the same term as that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-13.htm" title="Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangs on a tree:">Galatians 3:13</a>, where St Paul’s choice of it was obviously determined by its use in the LXX. of <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-23.htm" title="His body shall not remain all night on the tree, but you shall in any wise bury him that day; (for he that is hanged is accursed of God;) that your land be not defiled, which the LORD your God gives you for an inheritance.">Deuteronomy 21:23</a>. The word was somewhat more generic than “cross,” and included a whole class of punishments to which slaves were subject, impaling, the stocks (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-24.htm" title="Who, having received such a charge, thrust them into the inner prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks.">Acts 16:24</a>), and the like. It is possible that St Peter, in writing to slaves, may have chosen it as bringing home to their thoughts the parallelism between Christ’s sufferings and their own (comp. the “non pasces in cruce corvos” of Horace <span class="ital">Epp</span>. 1:16, 50:48); but its occurrence in St Luke’s reports of his speeches in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-30.htm" title="The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom you slew and hanged on a tree.">Acts 5:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-39.htm" title="And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they slew and hanged on a tree:">Acts 10:39</a> makes it more probable that it was simply a familiar term with him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness</span>] The Greek word for “being dead” is a somewhat unusual one, and is not found elsewhere in the New Testament. As a word it has to a certain extent an euphemistic character, like “departing,” “being away,” and is so far analogous to the <span class="ital">exodos</span> or “decease” of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-15.htm" title="Moreover I will endeavor that you may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance.">2 Peter 1:15</a>. The context leaves no doubt that the English rendering of the word fairly expresses its true meaning. “Having died” would perhaps give more accurately the force of the aorist participle. The thought presents another instance of parallelism between St Peter and St Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-2.htm" title="God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?">Romans 6:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-11.htm" title="Likewise reckon you also yourselves to be dead indeed to sin, but alive to God through Jesus Christ our Lord.">Romans 6:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-19.htm" title="For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live to God.">Galatians 2:19</a>) so close that it at least suggests the idea of derivation. In both cases the tense used implies a single act at a definite point of time, and as interpreted by St Paul’s teaching, and, we may add, by that of St Peter himself (chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-21.htm" title="The like figure whereunto even baptism does also now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ:">1 Peter 3:21</a>), that point of time can hardly be referred to any other occasion than that of the Baptism of those to whom he writes. In that rite they were mystically sharers in the death and entombment of Christ, and they were made so in order that they might live to Him in the righteousness of a new life.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">by whose stripes ye were healed</span>] The word for “stripes” means strictly the livid mark or wheal left on the flesh by the scourge. Comp. <a href="http://apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/28-17.htm" title="The stroke of the whip maketh marks in the flesh: but the stroke of the tongue breaketh the bones.">Sir 28:17</a>. We may well believe that the specific term was chosen rather than any more general word like “sufferings” or “passion,” as bringing before the minds of the slave readers of the Epistle the feature of greatest ignominy in their Lord’s sufferings (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-26.htm" title="Then released he Barabbas to them: and when he had scourged Jesus, he delivered him to be crucified.">Matthew 27:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-15.htm" title="And so Pilate, willing to content the people, released Barabbas to them, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be crucified.">Mark 15:15</a>), that in which they might find the closest parallelism with their own. When the scourge so freely used in Roman households left the quivering flesh red and raw, they were to remember that Christ also had so suffered, and that the stripes inflicted on Him were part of the process by which He was enabled to be the Healer of mankind. The words are cited from the LXX. of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-5.htm" title="But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was on him; and with his stripes we are healed.">Isaiah 53:5</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/1_peter/2.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-24.htm" title="Who his own self bore our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live to righteousness: by whose stripes you were healed.">1 Peter 2:24</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ὃς</span>, <span class="ital">who</span>) Peter infers, that we are able, and ought to follow the footsteps of Christ.—<span class="greekheb">αὐτὸς ἀνήνεγκεν</span>, <span class="ital">Himself bare</span>) <span class="greekheb">αὐτουργία</span>, <span class="ital">personal exertion</span>, becomes a servant, so that <span class="ital">he himself</span> should do what is to be done.

A martyr may be an example of patient suffering; he cannot bear our sins. The apostle proceeds to unfold the contents of the <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> in ver. 21. The Lord <span class="accented">died for</span> us: but what is the meaning of the preposition? Was it that his example might stimulate us to imitate his patience and his holy courage? This is a <span class="accented">true</span> view, but, taken alone, it would be utterly inadequate. The death of the Son of God had a far deeper significance. The <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;</span> used here and elsewhere is explained by the more precise <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;</span> of <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-28.htm">Matthew 20:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-6.htm">1 Timothy 2:6</a>, in which last passage both propositions are combined. The Lord died, not only in our behalf, but in our stead. He gave "his life a ransom for many;" "he is the Propitiation for our sins." St. Peter exhibits here, with all possible emphasis, this vicarious aspect of the Savior's death. "He bore our sins <span class="accented">himself</span>." The pronoun is strongly emphatic; he bore them, though they were not his own. They were <span class="accented">our</span> sins, but <span class="accented">he</span> bore them - he alone; none other could bear that awful burden. <span class="accented">He bare</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>). The apostle is evidently quoting <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-12.htm">Isaiah 53:12</a>, where the Hebrew verb is ▀and the Septuagint Version is <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;</span>; comp. vers. 4 and 11 (in ver. 11 there is another Hebrew verb) of the same chapter. In the Old Testament "to bear <span class="accented">sins"</span> or "iniquity" means to suffer the punishment of sin, whether one's own sin or the sin of others (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-1.htm">Leviticus 5:1, 17</a>, and many similar passages). In the description of the ceremonial of the Day of Atonement in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16.htm">Leviticus 16</a>. it is said (Ver. 22) that the scapegoat "shall bear upon him [the Hebrew is ; the Greek is <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c6;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span>] all their iniquities unto a land not inhabited," where the scapegoat is represented as bearing the sins of the people and taking them away. Compare also the great saying of the Baptist, "Behold the Lamb of God. which taketh away the sin of the world!" where the Greek (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f34;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>) may be rendered with equal exactness, "who beareth," or "who taketh away." The Lord took our sins away by taking them upon himself (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-17.htm">Matthew 8:17</a>). As Aaron put the sins of the people upon the head of the scapegoat (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-21.htm">Leviticus 16:21</a>), and the goat was to bear them upon him unto a land not inhabited, so the Lord laid on the blessed Savior the iniquity of us all, and he bare our sins in his own body on to the tree, and, there dying in our stead, took them away. He bare them on himself, as the scapegoat bare upon him the iniquities of Israel. It was this burden of sin which made his sacred body sweat great drops of blood in his awful agony. He bare them on to the tree (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3be;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>); he carried them thither, and there he expiated them (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-28.htm">Hebrews 9:28</a>, "Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many," where the same Greek word is used - <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>). Another interpretation takes <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> in its sacrificial sense, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-27.htm">Hebrews 7:27</a>, and regards the cross as the altar: "<span class="accented">He</span> bore our sins on to the altar of the cross." The Lord is both Priest and Victim, and the verb is used in the sacred writings both of the priest who offers the sacrifice and of the sacrifice which bears or takes away sin. But the sacrifice which the Lord offered up was himself, not our sins; therefore it seems best to understand <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> here rather of victim than of priest, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-28.htm">Hebrews 9:28</a> and the Greek Version of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-12.htm">Isaiah 53:12</a>. The thought of sacrifice was doubtless present to the apostle's mind, as it certainly was to the prophet's (see ver. 10 of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>.). The word <span class="greek">&#x3be;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> is used for the cross twice in St. Peter's speeches in the Acts of the Apostles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-30.htm">Acts 5:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-39.htm">Acts 10:39</a>). It is also so used by St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness.</span> The Greek word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. Bengel understands it differently. He says that as <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> means "to become the slave of some one," so <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> may mean to cease to be a slave. But this would require the genitive, not the dative, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>; and the ordinary translation is more suitable to the following context. The word is several times used in Herodotus in the sense of "having died;" more literally, "having ceased to be." The tense (aorist) seems to point to a definite time, as the time of baptism (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-2.htm">Romans 6:2, 11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-19.htm">Galatians 2:19, 20</a>). Righteousness here is simply the opposite of sin - obedience, submission to the will of God. Bengel says, "Justitia tota una est; peccatum multiplex." <span class="cmt_word">By whose stripes ye were healed</span>. The apostle is quoting the Septuagint rendering of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a>. The Greek <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f7d;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c8;</span> means the mark or weal left on the flesh by a scourge (comp. Ecclus. 28:17, <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f7d;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>). The slaves, whom the apostle is addressing, might perhaps not infrequently be subjected to the scourge; he bids them remember the more dreadful flagellation which the Lord endured. They were to learn patience of him, and to remember to their comfort that those stripes which he, the holy Son of God, condescended to suffer are to them that believe healing and salvation. Faith in the crucified Savior lifts the Christian out of the sickness of sin into the health of righteousness. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/1_peter/2.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Bare (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;)<p>See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-5.htm">1 Peter 2:5</a>.
