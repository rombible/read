The words, especially when compared with that Psalm, prepare for the description of distress which is to follow. (Comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-19.htm" title="I am a stranger in the earth: hide not your commandments from me.">Psalm 119:19</a>.) The word “pilgrim” (which comes to us through the French form <span class= "ital">pelerin, </span>from the Latin peregrinus) does not originally, or in this place, mean one <span class= "ital">on a pilgrimage.</span> It implies no journeying, but simply residence in a foreign country. Here it represents the same Greek word which is rendered “strangers” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-1.htm" title="Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,">1Peter 1:1</a>, but is used in a metaphorical and not literal sense. Though no longer “scattered,” but gathered mercifully once more into “a people,” they were still far from home—unprotected residents in an alien and hostile world, which scrutinised their conduct and was anxious for an opportunity to get rid of them.<p><span class= "bld">Abstain from fleshly lusts.</span>—First prudential rule. Although <span class= "ital">all</span> bad desires might be described as fleshly, the word seems here to mean what we usually understand by it, the lusts which lead to drunkenness, gluttony, and uncleanness. And though such sins are usually characteristic of the Gentile, not of the Jew, yet see our Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-14.htm" title="As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance:">1Peter 1:14</a>. Jews were not impeccable in such matters, and here the Apostle has a special reason for insisting on the observance of the seventh commandment. It may even be said that his mode of insistence recognises that his readers usually do observe it. He appeals to them as “Israelites from home” to be on their guard in such matters, as Leonidas might exhort Spartans going into battle not to flinch, or Nelson tell English sailors that “England expects every man to do his duty.” There was special reason for these Hebrew Christians to be more than ever vigilant, because (see Note on next verse) of the calumnies which the heathen were beginning to circulate about the Christians.<p><span class= "bld">Which war against the soul.</span>—This clause is no specifying of the particular fleshly lusts to be guarded against, as though there were some of them which did <span class= "ital">not</span> war against the soul; but it is a description of the way in which all fleshly lusts alike act. It means not merely a general antagonism between soul and body, but that the lusts are <span class= "ital">on active service, </span>engaged in a definite campaign against the immortal part of the man. St. Peter has probably forgotten for the moment his metaphor of strangers and sojourners, and we are not to put the two things together too closely, as though their position of strangers rendered them more liable to the attack of the hostile lusts. “Abstain” cannot mean merely “be on your guard against.” It runs rather thus: “You Christian Jews are dwelling as sojourners in the midst of jealous Gentile foreigners, and must, therefore, be particularly observant of moral conduct; for though I know that you usually are so, yet the fleshly appetites are actively engaged against your soul all the time; and if you should in any degree let them get the better of you, the heathen neighbours will at once take advantage of you.” As the expression might have been drawn equally well from St. Paul or from St. James, it is perhaps the easiest thing to suppose that (like the metaphors of building or of giving milk) it was part of the common property of Christians, and not consciously traceable to any originator.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_peter/2.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_peter/2-11.htm" title="Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;...">1 Peter 2:11-12</a></span>. <span class="ital">I beseech you, as strangers </span>— Or sojourners; <span class="ital">and pilgrims</span> — Who have no inheritance on this earth, but are travelling to the heavenly country. The former word, <span class="greekheb">παροικοι</span>, properly means those who are in a strange house, a house not their own: the second, <span class="greekheb">παρεπιδημοι</span>, those who are in a strange country, and among a people not their own. We sojourn in the body; we are pilgrims in this world; <span class="ital">abstain from fleshly lusts </span>— Or carnal desires; from inordinate desires of any thing in this country. “The settled inhabitants of a country are anxious to acquire riches, to purchase lands, and to build houses. But they who stay but a few weeks in a country, or who only travel through it, are commonly not solicitous to secure to themselves accommodations which they are so soon to leave. In the same manner, believers, being only sojourners on earth, and travellers to a better country, ought not to place their happiness in the enjoyment of those objects by which carnal desires are gratified, and which are peculiar to this earthly state, but in securing themselves possessions in the heavenly country, the proper habitation of the righteous.” — Macknight. <span class="ital">Which </span>carnal desires, though pleasant to the senses, <span class="ital">war against the soul </span>— Against the health, the strength, the liberty, the purity, the usefulness, the comfort of the soul. <span class="ital">Having your conversation </span>— Your whole behaviour; <span class="ital">honest </span>— Greek, <span class="greekheb">καλην</span>, amiable, excellent, commendable, and honourable, pious and virtuous in every respect. But our language sinks under the force, copiousness, and beauty of the original expressions; <span class="ital">among the Gentiles </span>— Your heathen neighbours, who narrowly watch you; <span class="ital">that whereas they speak against you as evil-doers </span>— As seditious persons and atheists, because ye do not worship their false gods, and because you join yourselves with what they presumptuously call the impious sect of Christians; <span class="ital">they may by your good works </span>— Your unblameable, useful, and holy conduct, your obedience to the just laws of the state, your submission to magistrates, and your patience and meekness when unjustly punished; <span class="ital">which they shall behold </span>— Shall be eye-witnesses of; may not only lay aside their blasphemous reproaches and bitter enmities, but may exchange them for commendations and praises, and so may <span class="ital">glorify God </span>— By owning his grace in you, being induced to believe and obey the truth, and to imitate your example; <span class="ital">in the day of visitation </span>— During the season in which the gospel is preached among them, whereby they are visited with the offers of pardon and salvation. It is well known that the patience, fortitude, and meekness with which the first Christians bore persecution for their religion, and the forgiving disposition which they expressed toward their persecutors, made such an impression on the heathen, who were witnesses of their sufferings, that many of them glorified God by embracing the gospel.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_peter/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:11,12 Even the best of men, the chosen generation, the people of God, need to be exhorted to keep from the worst sins. And fleshly lusts are most destructive to man's soul. It is a sore judgment to be given up to them. There is a day of visitation coming, wherein God may call to repentance by his word and his grace; then many will glorify God, and the holy lives of his people will have promoted the happy change.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_peter/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Dearly beloved, I beseech you strangers and pilgrims - On the word rendered "strangers," (&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;  paroikous,) see the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-19.htm">Ephesians 2:19</a>, where it is rendered "foreigners." It means, properly, one dwelling near, neighboring; then a by-dweller, a sojourner, one without the rights of citizenship, as distinguished from a citizen; and it means here that Christians are not properly citizens of this world, but that their citizenship is in heaven, and that they are here mere sojourners. Compare the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/3-20.htm">Philippians 3:20</a>, "For our conversation (citizenship) is in heaven." On the word rendered "pilgrims," (&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;  parepide&#772;mous,) see the <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-1.htm">1 Peter 1:1</a> note; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-13.htm">Hebrews 11:13</a> note. A pilgrim, properly, is one who travels to a distance from his own country to visit a holy place, or to pay his devotion to some holy object; then a traveler, a wanderer. The meaning here is, that Christians have no permanent home on earth; their citizenship is not here; they are mere sojourners, and they are passing on to their eternal home in the heavens. They should, therefore, act as become such persons; as sojourners and travelers do. They should not:<p>(a) regard the earth as their home.<p>(b) They should not seek to acquire permanent possessions here, as if they were to remain here, but should act as travelers do, who merely seek a temporary lodging, without expecting permanently to reside in a place.<p>(c) They should not allow any such attachments to be formed, or arrangements to be made, as to impede their journey to their final home, as pilgrims seek only a temporary lodging, and steadily pursue their journey.<p>(d) Even while engaged here in the necessary callings of life - their studies, their farming, their merchandise - their thoughts and affections should be on other things. One in a strange land thinks much of his country and home; a pilgrim, much of the land to which he goes; and even while his time and attention may be necessarily occupied by the arrangements needful for the journey, his thoughts and affections will be far away.<p>(e) We should not encumber ourselves with much of this world's goods. Many professed Christians get so many worldly things around them, that it is impossible for them to make a journey to heaven. They burden themselves as no traveler would, and they make no progress. A traveler takes along as few things as possible; and a staff is often all that a pilgrim has. We make the most rapid progress in our journey to our final home when we are least encumbered with the things of this world.<p>Abstain from fleshly lusts - Such desires and passions as the carnal appetites prompt to. See the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/5-19.htm">Galatians 5:19-21</a>. A sojourner in a land, or a pilgrim, does not give himself up to the indulgence of sensual appetites, or to the soft pleasures of the soul. All these would hinder his progress, and turn him off from his great design. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-4.htm">Romans 13:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-24.htm">Galatians 5:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-22.htm">2 Timothy 2:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-12.htm">Titus 2:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-14.htm">1 Peter 1:14</a>.<p>Which war against the soul - Compare the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/8-12.htm">Romans 8:12-13</a>. The meaning is, that indulgence in these things makes war against the nobler faculties of the soul; against the conscience, the understanding, the memory, the judgment, the exercise of a pure imagination. Compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-17.htm">Galatians 5:17</a>. There is not a faculty of the mind, however brilliant in itself, which will not be ultimately ruined by indulgence in the carnal propensities of our nature. The effect of intemperance on the noble faculties of the soul is well known; and alas, there are too many instances in which the light of genius, in those endowed with splendid gifts, at the bar, in the pulpit, and in the senate, is extinguished by it, to need a particular description. But there is one vice preeminently, which prevails all over the pagan world, (Compare the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/1-27.htm">Romans 1:27-29</a>) and extensively in Christian lands, which more than all others, blunts the moral sense, pollutes the memory, defiles the imagination, hardens the heart. and sends a withering influence through all the faculties of the soul.<p>"The soul grows clotted by contagion,<p>Embodies, and embrutes, till she quite lose<p>The divine property of her first being."<p>Of this passion, Burns beautifully and truly said - <p>"But oh! it hardens a' within,<p>And petrifies the feeling."<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_peter/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11.

Sojourners, literally, settlers having a house in a city without being citizens in respect to the rights of citizenship; a picture of the Christian's position on earth; and pilgrims, staying for a time in a foreign land. Flacius thus analyzes the exhortation: (1) Purify your souls (a) as strangers on earth who must not allow yourselves to be kept back by earthly lusts, and (b) because these lusts war against the soul's salvation. (2) Walk piously among unbelievers (a) so that they may cease to calumniate Christians, and (b) may themselves be converted to Christ.<p>fleshly lusts&#8212;enumerated in Ga 5:19, &c. Not only the gross appetites which we have in common with the brutes, but all the thoughts of the unrenewed mind.<p>which&#8212;Greek, "the which," that is, inasmuch as being such as "war." &c. Not only do they impede, but they assail [Bengel].<p>the soul&#8212;that is, against the regenerated soul; such as were those now addressed. The regenerated soul is besieged by sinful lusts. Like Samson in the lap of Delilah, the believer, the moment that he gives way to fleshly lusts, has the locks of his strength shorn, and ceases to maintain that spiritual separation from the world and the flesh of which the Nazarite vow was the type.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_peter/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Strangers and pilgrims; </span> not only strangers in the several countries where ye inhabit, (being out of your own land), but strangers in the world, as all believers are, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-15.htm" title="For we are strangers before you, and sojourners, as were all our fathers: our days on the earth are as a shadow, and there is none abiding.">1 Chronicles 29:15</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/39-12.htm" title="Hear my prayer, O LORD, and give ear to my cry; hold not your peace at my tears: for I am a stranger with you, and a sojourner, as all my fathers were.">Psalm 39:12</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-19.htm" title="I am a stranger in the earth: hide not your commandments from me.">Psalm 119:19</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-13.htm" title="These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.">Hebrews 11:13</a>,14</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Abstain from fleshly lusts; </span> not only sensual desires, but all the works of the flesh, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/galatians/5-19.htm" title="Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,...">Galatians 5:19-21</a></span>, the carnal mind itself being enmity against God, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-7.htm" title="Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.">Romans 8:7</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Which war; </span> as enemies, oppose and fight against, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-23.htm" title="But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.">Romans 7:23</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/4-1.htm" title="From where come wars and fights among you? come they not hence, even of your lusts that war in your members?">Jam 4:1</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Against the soul; </span> the inner man, or regenerate part, or Spirit, which is opposed to fleshly lusts: see <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-17.htm" title="For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that you cannot do the things that you would.">Galatians 5:17</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_peter/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Dearly beloved, I beseech you,....

Probably, however, <span class="greekheb">ἀπέχεσθε</span> is the original reading, and was changed into the infinitive in order to make the connection with <span class="greekheb">παρακαλῶ</span> more close. <span class="greekheb">ἀπέχεσθαι</span> presents the negative aspect of sanctification, as chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-1.htm" title="Why laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, all evil speakings,">1 Peter 2:1</a> : <span class="greekheb">ἀποθέμενοι</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τῶν σαρκικῶν ἐπιθυμιῶν</span>] similar expressions in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-10.htm" title="I have confidence in you through the Lord, that you will be none otherwise minded: but he that troubles you shall bear his judgment, whoever he be.">Galatians 5:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-3.htm" title="Among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others.">Ephesians 2:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-18.htm" title="For when they speak great swelling words of vanity, they allure through the lusts of the flesh, through much wantonness, those that were clean escaped from them who live in error.">2 Peter 2:18</a>. The <span class="greekheb">ἐπιθυμίαι</span> are <span class="greekheb">σαρκικαί</span>, because they have their seat in the <span class="greekheb">σάρξ</span>. Wiesinger improperly says that “the lusts which manifest themselves outwardly” are here meant, for <span class="ital">all</span> <span class="greekheb">ἐπιθυμίαι</span> tend to, and do, manifest themselves outwardly, if there be no <span class="greekheb">ἀπέχεσθαι</span>. Schott assumes, without reason, that the <span class="greekheb">ἐπιθυμίαι</span> are here considered “as something <span class="ital">outside</span> of the Christian community, and manifesting itself only in the surrounding heathen population;” they are indeed peculiar to the unbelieving world; but the Christian, too, has them still in his <span class="greekheb">σάρξ</span>, though he can and should prevent them from having a determining power over him, inasmuch as in the world over which they rule he is a <span class="greekheb">πάροικος καὶ παρεπίδημος</span>.[132] This sequence of thought lies plainly indicated in the close connection of the exhortation with what precedes (as opposed to Hofmann).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">αἵτινες στρατεύονται κατὰ τῆς ψυχῆς</span>] is not a definition of the <span class="greekheb">σαρκικαί</span>, but as <span class="greekheb">αἵτινες</span>, equal to “<span class="ital">as those which</span>,” shows, explains the nature of the <span class="greekheb">ἐπιθυμίαι σαρκικαί</span>, thus giving the reason of the exhortation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">στρατεύειν</span> is not: “to lay siege to” (Steiger), but: “<span class="ital">to war</span>,” “<span class="ital">fight against</span>,” as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/4-1.htm" title="From where come wars and fights among you? come they not hence, even of your lusts that war in your members?">Jam 4:1</a> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-23.htm" title="But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.">Romans 7:23</a> : <span class="greekheb">ἀντιστρατεύεσθαι</span>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ψυχή</span> has here its usual meaning; it is neither: vita et salus animae (Hornejus, Grotius), nor: ratio (Pott: libidines, quae nos impellunt ad peragenda ea, quae rationi contraria sunt); nor does it mean: “the <span class="ital">new</span> man” (Gerhard: totus homo novus ac interior, quatenus est per Spiritum s. renovatus), nor: the soul, “in so far as it is penetrated by the Holy Spirit” (Steiger), nor: “life as determined by the new Ego” (Schott); but it is here simply, in contradistinction to <span class="greekheb">σῶμα</span>, the spiritual substance of man of which Peter says that it must be sanctified (chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-22.htm" title="Seeing you have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit to unfeigned love of the brothers, see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently:">1 Peter 1:22</a>), and its <span class="greekheb">σωτηρία</span> is the end of faith (chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-9.htm" title="Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls.">1 Peter 1:9</a>); thus also de Wette-Brückner, Wiesinger, Hofmann, Fronmüller.

Somewhat after the manner of St Paul, the Apostle, alter having allowed his thoughts to travel through the mysteries of redemption, reaches, as it were, the highest region of the truth, and then pauses in the act of writing or dictating, and takes a fresh start. In doing so, however, he goes back to the opening words of the Epistle (see note on chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-1.htm" title="Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,">1 Peter 1:1</a>). Those to whom he wrote were “strangers and pilgrims” (the English reader must remember that “pilgrim” is but another form of <span class="ital">peregrinus</span>), not only as belonging to the Jews of the dispersion, but as being, like the patriarchs of old (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-13.htm" title="These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.">Hebrews 11:13</a>), men who, in whatever country they might be, felt that their true home was elsewhere. In the LXX. version of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/39-12.htm" title="Hear my prayer, O LORD, and give ear to my cry; hold not your peace at my tears: for I am a stranger with you, and a sojourner, as all my fathers were.">Psalm 39:12</a> we find both the words and the thoughts to which St Peter now gives utterance. It is obvious that the special local position of the disciples, though not, it may be, altogether excluded, is now thrown quite into the background.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul</span>] The negative aspect of the Christian life is put forward first, as being prior, both in order of thought, and often in that of time, to its more positive development. The entreaty rests upon the character implied in the previous words. Travellers in a strange land, yet more in the land of enemies, do not care commonly to adopt all its customs. They retain their nationality. The exiles who hung their harps by the waters of Babylon did not forget Jerusalem, and would not profane its hymns by singing them at idolfeasts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/137-1.htm" title="By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yes, we wept, when we remembered Zion....">Psalm 137:1-3</a>). The citizens of the heavenly Jerusalem were in like manner to keep themselves from all that would render them unfit for their true home. The words “fleshly lusts” have, perhaps, a somewhat wider range than the English term suggests, and take in all desires that originate in man’s corrupt nature, as well as those directly connected with the appetites of the body: comp. St Paul’s list of the “works of the flesh” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/galatians/5-19.htm" title="Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,...">Galatians 5:19-21</a>.

He calls his readers "strangers and <span class="accented">pilgrims</span>." The word here rendered "<span class="accented">strangers"</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>) is equivalent to the classical <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, and means "foreign set-tiers, dwellers in a strange land." The second word (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, translated "strangers" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1.htm">1 Peter 1</a>.) means "visitors" who tarry for a time in a foreign country, not permanently settling in it. It does not contain the ideas associated with the modern use of "<span class="accented">pilgrim</span>;" though that word, derived kern the <span class="accented">Latin peregrinus</span>, originally meant no more than "sojourner." St. Peter is plainly using the words metaphorically his readers were citizens of the heavenly country; on earth they were sojourners. Both words occur in the Septuagint Version of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/39-12.htm">Psalm 39:12</a> (38:13 in the Greek), with the same metaphorical meaning. <span class="cmt_word">Abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul.</span> Strangers and pilgrims should remember their distant home, and not follow the practices of the strange land in which they sojourn. The lusts of the flesh are all those desires which issue out of our corrupt nature (temp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-16.htm">Galatians 5:16-21</a>). They "<span class="accented">war</span> against the soul." "<span class="accented">Non</span> mode impediunt," says Bengel, "sod oppugnant; grande verbum" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-23.htm">Romans 7:23</a>). St. Peter uses the word "<span class="accented">soul"</span> here for the whole spiritual nature of man, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-9.htm">1 Peter 1:9, 22</a>. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/1_peter/2.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Beloved (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;)<p>A favorite term with Peter, occurring eight times in the epistles.
