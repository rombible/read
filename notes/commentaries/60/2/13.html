Literally, <span class= "ital">to every human creation, i.e., </span>to every office or authority which men have established. It is not only to ordinances of directly Divine institution that we are to submit. Mind that he does not say we are to submit to every <span class= "ital">law</span> that men may pass. This passage is most directly modelled on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-1.htm" title="Let every soul be subject to the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God.">Romans 13:1</a>, <span class= "ital">et seq., </span>where the reason assigned for submission is the same as that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-11.htm" title="Jesus answered, You could have no power at all against me, except it were given you from above: therefore he that delivered me to you has the greater sin.">John 19:11</a>, viz., that ultimately the authority proceeds from God Himself. Here, however, the thought is quite different. They are to submit, but not because of the original source from which the authority flows, but because of the practical consequences of not submitting. It must be done “for the Lord’s” (<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>Jesus Christ’s) “sake,” <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>in order not to bring discredit upon His teaching, and persecution upon His Church. This difference of treatment, in the midst of so much resemblance, shows that at the date of St. Peter’s letter there was much more immediate cause for laying stress on political subordination. St. Paul, writing <span class= "ital">to</span> the Roman Church, urges submission to Claudius, because the Roman Jews (among whom the Christians were reckoned) were often in trouble and expelled from the city of Rome (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-2.htm" title="And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome:) and came to them.">Acts 18:2</a>); St. Peter, writing in all probability <span class= "ital">from</span> the Roman Church, urges submission to Nero and the provincial governors because “ignorant and foolish men” were beginning to misrepresent the Christian Church as a kind of Internationalist or Socialist conspiracy.<p><span class= "bld">The king, as supreme.</span>—First division of second prudential rule: subordination political. Of course it means the emperor. The name “king,” though detested in Latin, was used without scruple by the provincial Greeks to express the sovereignty of the Caesars. When he is described here as “supreme,” it is not intended (as our English version would convey) to contrast his supreme power with the inferior power of the “governors;” the word is only the same which is rendered “higher” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-1.htm" title="Let every soul be subject to the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God.">Romans 13:1</a>. Huther rightly says, “The emperor was in the Roman Empire not merely the highest, but actually the only ruler; all other magistrates were but the instruments by which he exercised his sway.” Of course all Asia Minor, to which St. Peter was writing, was in the Roman Empire; the language would have been different had the letter been addressed to, or perhaps had it even been written from, the geographical Babylon.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_peter/2.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_peter/2-13.htm" title="Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme;...">1 Peter 2:13-15</a></span>. <span class="ital">Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man </span>— Greek, <span class="greekheb">παση ανθρωπινη κτισει</span>, <span class="ital">to every human constitution </span>of government, under which you are placed by Divine Providence, and which is formed instrumentally by men, and relates to you as men, and not as Christians.

Christians must endeavour, in all relations, to behave aright, that they do not make their liberty a cloak or covering for any wickedness, or for the neglect of duty; but they must remember that they are servants of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_peter/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man - Greek, "to every creation of man," (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#837; &#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;  anthro&#772;pine&#772; ktisei The meaning is, to every institution or appointment of man; to wit, of those who are in authority, or who are appointed to administer government. The laws, institutes, and appointments of such a government may be spoken of as the creation of man; that is, as what man makes. Of course, what is here said must be understood with the limitation everywhere implied, that what is ordained by those in authority is not contrary to the law of God. See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-19.htm">Acts 4:19</a>. On the general duty here enjoined of subjection to civil authority, see the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1-7</a>.<p>For the Lord's sake - Because he has required it, and has entrusted this power to civil rulers. See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-5.htm">Romans 13:5</a>. Compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-7.htm">Ephesians 6:7</a>.<p>Whether it be to the king - It has been commonly supposed that there is reference here to the Roman emperor, who might be called king, because in him the supreme power resided. The common title of the Roman sovereign was, as used by the Greek writers, &#x3b1;&#787;&#837;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;  autokrato&#772;r, and among the Romans themselves, "imperator," (emperor;) but the title king was also given to the sovereign. <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/19-15.htm">John 19:15</a>, "we have no king but Cesar." <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/17-7.htm">Acts 17:7</a>, "and these all do contrary to the decrees of Cesar, saying that there is another king, one Jesus." Peter undoubtedly had particular reference to the Roman emperors, but he uses a general term, which would be applicable to all in whom the supreme power resided, and the injunction here would require submission to such authority, by whatever name it might be called. The meaning is, that we are to be subject to that authority whether exercised by the sovereign in person, or by those who are appointed by him.<p>As supreme - Not supreme in the sense of being superior to God, or not being subject to him, but in the sense of being over all subordinate officers. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_peter/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13. every ordinance of man&#8212;"every human institution" [Alford], literally, "every human creation." For though of divine appointment, yet in the mode of nomination and in the exercise of their authority, earthly governors are but human institutions, being of men, and in relation to men. The apostle speaks as one raised above all human things. But lest they should think themselves so ennobled by faith as to be raised above subordination to human authorities, he tells them to submit themselves for the sake of Christ, who desires you to be subject, and who once was subject to earthly rulers Himself, though having all things subject to Him, and whose honor is at stake in you as His earthly representatives. Compare Ro 13:5, "Be subject for conscience' sake."<p>king&#8212;The Roman emperor was "supreme" in the Roman provinces to which this Epistle was addressed. The Jewish zealots refused obedience. The distinction between "the king as supreme" and "governors sent by him" implies that "if the king command one thing, and the subordinate magistrate another, we ought rather to obey the superior" [Augustine in Grotius]. Scripture prescribes nothing upon the form of government, but simply subjects Christians to that everywhere subsisting, without entering into the question of the right of the rulers (thus the Roman emperors had by force seized supreme authority, and Rome had, by unjustifiable means, made herself mistress of Asia), because the de facto governors have not been made by chance, but by the providence of God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_peter/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Every ordinance; </span> of all kinds, whether supreme or subordinate. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Ordinance of man; </span> Greek, human creatures, which may be understood either, as <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/16-15.htm" title="And he said to them, Go you into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.">Mark 16:15</a></span>, every human creature for every man, only restraining it to the present subject whereof he treats, viz. magistrates, and the sense is, to every magistrate: or rather, (though to the same effect), to every human ordinance; or, as we translate it, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">ordinance of man; </span> the word creature being taken for an ordinance, or constitution, and creating for ordaining, or appointing: so CEcumenius will have the word to signify, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-15.htm" title="Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself of two one new man, so making peace;">Ephesians 2:15</a></span>, <span class="ital">to make of twain one new man.</span> But this creature, or ordinance, here is to be understood of the magistrate; (as appears by the following words), which is called human, not as if magistracy were not an ordinance of God, <span class="ital">{for, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-1.htm" title="Let every soul be subject to the higher powers.

Or, "to every human creation", or "creature"; not to "all the sons of men", as the Syriac version renders it; or to all the individuals of mankind; for there are some that are in such stations and circumstances, that they are not to be submitted to, but to be ruled over, and governed: so kings are not to submit to their subjects, nor are parents to be subject to their children, nor husbands to their wives, nor masters to their servants, which would be preposterous; but submission is limited and restrained to persons in such a place and situation: "the human creature", or "creation", here designs the Gentiles, who are elsewhere called the creature, the whole creation, every creature, and every creature under heaven, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-19.htm">Romans 8:19</a> and particularly Heathen magistrates, styled creation, or creature: not as men, for all men, as such, are creatures; but as magistrates, being created, constituted, and appointed such, and installed into, and invested with such an office: and "human"; not only because they were men, and were taken out from among men that bore the office of magistrates, and governed over men, and were for the good and advantage of mankind, but because they were created and placed in such a station by men; though government itself is of God, is a divine institution, yet this and that particular form of government is of man; and especially the forms of government among the Gentiles were human; and are here so called, in distinction from the form of government among the Jews, which was a theocracy, and was divine; wherefore the Jews, and so these converted ones, scrupled yielding obedience to Heathen magistrates; on which account they were spoken against, as evildoers; hence the apostle, in the first place, and as a principal part of their honest conversation among the Gentiles, exhorts them to submission to civil magistrates, though they were creatures of men; and to everyone of them, though a Gentile, an unbeliever, and a wicked man: and this he urges, <p>for the Lord's sake; for the sake of Christ Jesus the Lord, because of his command, who ordered to give to Caesar the things that are Caesar's; and in imitation of him, who paid tribute to whom tribute was due; and for the sake of his honour and glory, who was ill thought and spoken of by the Gentiles, because of the disregard of the converted Jews to their magistrates; and which served to prejudice them against Christ and his Gospel: the Vulgate Latin, Syriac, and Ethiopic versions, read, "for God's sake"; because civil government is of God; magistracy is of divine appointment; the powers that he are ordained of God, though this or the other form is of man's prescription: it is the command of God that magistrates should be obeyed; and it makes for his glory, as well as for the good of men, when they are submitted to in things that do not contradict the revealed will of God; for otherwise, not man, but God, is to be obeyed: <p>whether it be to the king; to Caesar, the Roman emperor; and the then reigning one seems to be Nero, who, though a wicked man, was to be submitted to in things civil and lawful; and it holds good of any other king that has the supreme government of a nation: the Syriac version reads it in the plural number, "to kings"; and though the name of king was odious to the Romans, from the times of Tarquin, nor did they call their chief governor, or governors, by this name, yet other nations did; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-15.htm">John 19:15</a> and subjection was to be yielded to him, "as supreme"; for the sake, and in consideration of his being in so high and exalted a station, having the supreme power and government of the people in his hands.

First of all, an exhortation to obey those in authority.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὑποτάγητε</span>] the aor. pass. is used here, as it often is, with a middle, not a passive—as Wiesinger thinks—force. It is not: “<span class="ital">be made subject</span>,” but “<span class="ital">make yourselves subject</span>” (cf. <span class="greekheb">ταπεινώθητε</span>, chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-6.htm" title="Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time:">1 Peter 5:6</a>).[135] The more liable liberty in Christ was to be misunderstood by the heathen, and even to be abused by the Christians themselves, the more important it was that the latter should have inculcated upon them as one of their principal duties this <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὙΠΟΤΆΣΣΕΣΘΑΙ</span></span></span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-18.htm" title="Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the fraudulent.">1 Peter 2:18</a>, chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-1.htm" title="Likewise, you wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives;">1 Peter 3:1</a>) in all circumstances of life.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΆΣῌ ἈΝΘΡΩΠΊΝῌ ΚΤΊΣΕΙ</span></span></span>] <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΤΊΣΙς</span></span></span> is here, in accordance with the signification peculiar to the verb <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΤΊΖΕΙΝ</span></span></span>: “to establish, to set up,” the <span class="ital">ordinance</span>, or <span class="ital">institution</span> (“an ordinance resting on a particular arrangement,” Hofmann). In connection with the attribute <span class="greekheb">ἀνθρωπίνη</span>, this expression seems to denote an ordinance or institution established by men (so most expositors, and formerly in this commentary). But it must be noted that <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΤΊΖΕΙΝ</span></span></span> (and its derivatives) are never applied to human, but only to divine agency; besides, the demand that they should submit themselves to every human ordinance would be asking too much. It is therefore preferable to understand, with Hofmann, by the term, an ordinance (of God) applying to human relations (“regulating the social life of man”[136]). By the subsequent <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΕἼΤΕ</span> … <span class="greekheb">ΕἼΤΕ</span></span></span>, the expression is referred in the first instance to the magistracy; but this does not justify the interpretation of it as equal directly to: “authority,” or even: persons in authority (Gerhard: concretive et personaliter: homines, qui magistratum gerunt). That Peter’s exposition of the idea had direct reference to persons in authority, is to be explained from the circumstance that the institution possessed reality only in the existence of those individuals.[137] At variance with this view is de Wette’s (following Erasmus, Estius, Pott) interpretation of the expression: “to every human creature, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> to all men.” Not only, however, the singular circumlocution: <span class="greekheb">κτίσις ἀνθρωπίνη</span> for <span class="greekheb">ἄνθρωπος</span>,—for which de Wette wrongly quotes <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/16-15.htm" title="And he said to them, Go you into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.">Mark 16:15</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-23.htm" title=" If you continue in the faith grounded and settled, and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel, which you have heard, and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven; whereof I Paul am made a minister;">Colossians 1:23</a>,—but the very idea that Christians should be subject to all men,—and in support of it no appeal can be made either to chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-5.htm" title="Likewise, you younger, submit yourselves to the elder. Yes, all of you be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God resists the proud, and gives grace to the humble.">1 Peter 5:5</a> or to the following exhortation: <span class="greekheb">πάντας τιμήσατε</span>,—is decisive against this view.[138] The fact that Peter places the general term <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠᾶΣΑ ΚΤΊΣΙς</span></span></span> first, is explained most naturally in this way: that it was his intention to speak not of the magistracy merely, but also of the other institutions of human life.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The motive for the submission here demanded is given by <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΙᾺ ΚΎΡΙΟΝ</span></span></span>, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> <span class="greekheb">Χριστόν</span> (not <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΘΕΌΝ</span></span></span>, as Schott thinks), which must be taken to mean: “because such is the will of the Lord,” or, with Hofmann: “out of consideration due to Christ, to whom the opposite would bring dishonour.” The latter, however, is the less likely interpretation. Still less natural is it to say, with Wiesinger, that this adjunct points to the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΘΕῖΟΝ</span></span></span> in ordinances under which human life is passed.

The word for “ordinance,” usually translated “creature,” may possibly have that sense here. So taken, the counsel would stand parallel to the “honour all men” of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-17.htm" title="Honor all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the king.">1 Peter 2:17</a>, to the “be ye subject one to another” of ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-5.htm" title="Likewise, you younger, submit yourselves to the elder. Yes, all of you be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God resists the proud, and gives grace to the humble.">1 Peter 5:5</a>, and would express the thought that the Christian was to act and speak as a “<span class="ital">servus servorum</span>,” submitting himself, as far as God’s law would allow, even to the meanest. Against this view, however, it may be urged that “every human creature” would be a somewhat awkward periphrasis for “all men,” and that the subdivision that follows points to something more specific. On the whole, therefore, there seems sufficient reason for accepting the English Version, and taking the word in the sense which it will well bear of “ordinance,” or better, perhaps, <span class="bld">institution</span>. The obedience which is thus enjoined is to be rendered not through fear of punishment but “for the Lord’s sake,” partly as remembering His example (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_peter/2-21.htm" title="For even hereunto were you called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that you should follow his steps:...">1 Peter 2:21-22</a>), partly in zeal for the honour of His name, lest that also be “blasphemed among the Gentiles” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-24.htm" title="For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you, as it is written.">Romans 2:24</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">whether it be to the king, as supreme</span>] The adjective is the same as in the “<span class="ital">higher</span> powers” of <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-1.htm" title="Let every soul be subject to the higher powers.

The “king” is of course the Emperor Nero, the Greek language not supplying a word with the full significance of the Roman <span class="ital">Imperator</span>. So we have prayers for “kings,” obviously including the Emperor, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-2.htm" title="For kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty.">1 Timothy 2:2</a>. The “Governors” include the Pro-consuls or Pro-praetors of Roman provinces, and all officials such as the town-clerk of Ephesus, the Asiarchs, and other municipal authorities.

Certainly "there is no power but of God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1</a>); but the form which that power assumes is a human institution. St. Peter bids his readers to submit themselves to the <span class="accented">de facto</span> form of government. <span class="cmt_word">For the Lord's sake.</span> Not from human motives, as fear of punishment; but for the Lord's sake, because "the powers that be are ordained of God," and in obeying them we obey the ordinance of God.
