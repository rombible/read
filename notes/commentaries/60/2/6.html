The right reading here is not “wherefore also,” but <span class= "ital">because</span>—<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the quotations are introduced in the same way as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-16.htm" title="Because it is written, Be you holy; for I am holy.">1Peter 1:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-24.htm" title="For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass. The grass wither, and the flower thereof falls away:">1Peter 1:24</a>, as justifying the foregoing expressions.<p><span class= "bld">It is contained in the scripture.</span>—In the original the phrase is a curious one. “The scripture” never means the Old Testament as a whole, which would be called “the Scriptures,” but is always the particular book or passage of the Old Testament. Literally, then, our present phrase runs, <span class= "ital">because it encloses</span> or <span class= "ital">contains in that passage.</span> Thus attention is drawn to the context of the quotation, and in this context we shall again find what made St. Peter quote the text.<p><span class= "bld">Behold, I lay.</span>—The sentence is taken from <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-16.htm" title="Therefore thus said the Lord GOD, Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner stone, a sure foundation: he that believes shall not make haste.">Isaiah 28:16</a>, and, like the last, is adapted to the occasion out of both Hebrew and LXX. Gesenius on that passage gives evidence to show that the early Jewish explanation, current in our Lord’s time, referred it to the Messiah; the later Rabbinical expositors, probably by way of opposition to the Christians, explained it to mean Hezekiah. In order to gain a clear conception of St. Peter’s aim in the quotation, it is necessary to glance over the whole section contained in the 28th and 29th chapters of Isaiah. “The prophecy here cited,” says Archbishop Leighton, “if we look upon it in its own place, we shall find inserted in the middle of a very sad denunciation of judgment against the Jews.” Besides our present text, which is quoted also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-33.htm" title="As it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a stumbling stone and rock of offense: and whoever believes on him shall not be ashamed.">Romans 9:33</a>, our Lord’s prophecy of the destruction of Jerusalem is an amplification of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/29-3.htm" title="And I will camp against you round about, and will lay siege against you with a mount, and I will raise forts against you.">Isaiah 29:3-4</a>; His sharp censure of the corrupt traditions which had superseded the law of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/15-7.htm" title="You hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying,">Matthew 15:7-9</a>) is taken from <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-13.htm" title="Why the Lord said, For as much as this people draw near me with their mouth, and with their lips do honor me, but have removed their heart far from me, and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men:">Isaiah 29:13</a>; St. Paul’s image of the potter changing his purpose with the lump of clay (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-21.htm" title="Has not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel to honor, and another to dishonor?">Romans 9:21</a>), comes from <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-16.htm" title="Surely your turning of things upside down shall be esteemed as the potter's clay: for shall the work say of him that made it, He made me not? or shall the thing framed say of him that framed it, He had no understanding?">Isaiah 29:16</a>. Like one bright spot in the sad picture appears our verse, but only as serving to heighten the general gloom. St. Peter’s quotation here, therefore, calling attention as it does to the context, is at least as much intended to show his Hebrew readers the sweeping away of the carnal Israel as to encourage them in their Christian allegiance. In the original passage the sure foundation is contrasted with the refuge of lies which the Jewish rulers had constructed for themselves against Assyria, “scorning” this sure foundation as a piece of antiquated and unpractical religionism. Nägelsbach (in his new commentary on Isaiah) seems to be right in interpreting the “refuge of lies” to mean the diplomatic skill with which Ahaz and the Jewish authorities flattered themselves their treaty with Egypt was drawn up, and the “sure foundation” opposed to it is primarily God’s plighted promise to the house of David, in which all who trusted would have no cause for flight. In the Messianic fulfilment, those promises are all summed up in the one person of Jesus Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-33.htm" title="God has fulfilled the same to us their children, in that he has raised up Jesus again; as it is also written in the second psalm, You are my Son, this day have I begotten you.">Acts 13:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-20.htm" title="For all the promises of God in him are yes, and in him Amen, to the glory of God by us.">2Corinthians 1:20</a>); and the “refuge of lies” in which the Jewish rulers had trusted was the wicked policy by which they had tried to secure their “place and nation” against the Romans (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-48.htm" title="If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him: and the Romans shall come and take away both our place and nation.">John 11:48</a>).<p><span class= "bld">In Sion.</span>—In Isaiah it means that the people have not to look for any distant external aid, such as that of Pharaoh: all that they need is to be found in the city of David itself. Here, it seems to impress upon the Hebrew Christians that they are not abandoning their position as Hebrews by attaching themselves to Jesus Christ. It is they who are really clinging to Sion when the other Jews are abandoning her.<p><span class= "bld">Shall not be confounded</span> (or, <span class= "ital">ashamed</span>)<span class= "ital">.—</span>Our version of Isaiah translates the Hebrew original by the unintelligible “shall not make haste.” It really means, <span class= "ital">shall not flee.</span> While all the Jewish rulers, who had turned faithless and trusted in their finesse with Egypt, would have to flee from the face of the Assyrians, those who preserved their faith in God would be able to stand their ground. This, of course, did not come literally true in the first instance, where a common temporal overthrow came upon faithful and faithless alike, from Babylon, though not from Assyria. In the Messianic fulfilment, however, the faith or unbelief of the individual makes all the difference to him: the overthrow of the many does not affect the few. St. Peter adds to “believe” the words “on Him” or “on it.” which are found in neither the Hebrew nor the Greek of Isaiah, such an addition being quite in keeping with the Rabbinic method of quotation, which frequently alters words (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/2-6.htm" title="And you Bethlehem, in the land of Juda, are not the least among the princes of Juda: for out of you shall come a Governor, that shall rule my people Israel.">Matthew 2:6</a>) to bring out the concealed intention more fully. The general quality of “faith” of which the prophet spoke, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>reliance on the promises of God, becomes faith in Him in whom the promises are fulfilled. For a like cause St. Peter prefers the LXX. “be ashamed” to the Hebrew “flee away,” there being (except at the Fall of Jerusalem) no opportunity for actual flight. It comes to the same thing in the end: “shall not find his confidence misplaced.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_peter/2.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_peter/2-6.htm" title="Why also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that believes on him shall not be confounded....">1 Peter 2:6-8</a></span>. <span class="ital">Wherefore also </span>— To which purpose; <span class="ital">it is contained in the Scripture </span>— In <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-16.htm" title="Therefore thus said the Lord GOD, Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner stone, a sure foundation: he that believes shall not make haste.">Isaiah 28:16</a>, the passage before referred to. <span class="ital">Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner-stone </span>— To support and hold together the whole building.

See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/118-22.htm" title="The stone which the builders refused is become the head stone of the corner.">Psalm 118:22</a>. But they rejected the stone here spoken of, and would give it no place in the building; <span class="ital">the same is made the head of the corner </span>— And all their opposition to it is vain.

Thus Simeon, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-34.htm" title="And Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary his mother, Behold, this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel; and for a sign which shall be spoken against;">Luke 2:34</a>;) <span class="ital">This child is set for the fall </span>as well as <span class="ital">the rising again of many in Israel, </span>and for <span class="ital">a sign that shall be spoken against; </span>a prediction awfully fulfilled. <span class="ital">Even to them which stumble, being disobedient: whereunto also they were appointed </span>— This translation of the clause seems to imply that those who are disobedient were appointed to be so; but the original does not convey that sense, but is literally rendered, <span class="ital">Who, disobeying the word, stumble, to which also they were appointed: </span>that is, those who disobey the word are appointed to stumble, namely, at the stone of stumbling here spoken of, according to the prediction of Isaiah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/8-14.htm" title="And he shall be for a sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offense to both the houses of Israel, for a gin and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem....">Isaiah 8:14-15</a>; <span class="ital">He shall be for a sanctuary, but for a stone of stumbling,</span> &c<span class="ital">., to both the houses of Israel; </span>that is, to those that are unbelieving and disobedient; <span class="ital">and many among them shall stumble and fall, and be broken, and snared, and taken. </span>This is what God has appointed, that they who reject Christ shall stumble at him, and fall into misery and ruin: or, that <span class="ital">he who believeth not shall be damned: </span>the unalterable decree of the God of heaven.

A new life needs suitable food. Infants desire milk, and make the best endeavours for it which they are able to do; such must be a Christian's desires after the word of God. Our Lord Jesus Christ is very merciful to us miserable sinners; and he has a fulness of grace. But even the best of God's servants, in this life, have only a taste of the consolations of God. Christ is called a Stone, to teach his servants that he is their protection and security, the foundation on which they are built. He is precious in the excellence of his nature, the dignity of his office, and the glory of his services. All true believers are a holy priesthood; sacred to God, serviceable to others, endowed with heavenly gifts and graces. But the most spiritual sacrifices of the best in prayer and praise are not acceptable, except through Jesus Christ. Christ is the chief Corner-stone, that unites the whole number of believers into one everlasting temple, and bears the weight of the whole fabric. Elected, or chosen, for a foundation that is everlasting. Precious beyond compare, by all that can give worth. To be built on Christ means, to believe in him; but in this many deceive themselves, they consider not what it is, nor the necessity of it, to partake of the salvation he has wrought. Though the frame of the world were falling to pieces, that man who is built on this foundation may hear it without fear. He shall not be confounded. The believing soul makes haste to Christ, but it never finds cause to hasten from him. All true Christians are a chosen generation; they make one family, a people distinct from the world: of another spirit, principle, and practice; which they could never be, if they were not chosen in Christ to be such, and sanctified by his Spirit. Their first state is a state of gross darkness, but they are called out of darkness into a state of joy, pleasure, and prosperity; that they should show forth the praises of the Lord by their profession of his truth, and their good conduct. How vast their obligations to Him who has made them his people, and has shown mercy to them! To be without this mercy is a woful state, though a man have all worldly enjoyments. And there is nothing that so kindly works repentance, as right thoughts of the mercy and love of God. Let us not dare to abuse and affront the free grace of God, if we mean to be saved by it; but let all who would be found among those who obtain mercy, walk as his people.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_peter/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture - <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-16.htm">Isaiah 28:16</a>.

In the LXX. it is: <span class="greekheb">ἰδού</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἐγὼ ἐμβάλλω εἰς τὰ θεμέλια Σιὼν</span> (instead of which we have here, exactly as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-33.htm" title="As it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a stumbling stone and rock of offense: and whoever believes on him shall not be ashamed.">Romans 9:33</a> : <span class="greekheb">ἰδού</span>, <span class="greekheb">τίθημι ἐν Σιὼν</span>) <span class="greekheb">λίθον πολυτελῆ</span> (this adject. here omitted) <span class="greekheb">ἐκλεκτὸν ἀκρογωνιαῖον</span> (these two words here transposed) <span class="greekheb">ἔντιμον εἰς τὰ θεμέλια αὐτῆς</span> (the last two words <span class="greekheb">εἰς</span> … <span class="greekheb">αὐτῆς</span> here left out) <span class="greekheb">καὶ ὁ πιστεύων</span> (<span class="greekheb">ἐπʼ αὐτῷ</span> added) <span class="greekheb">οὐ μὴ καταισχυνθῇ</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-33.htm" title="As it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a stumbling stone and rock of offense: and whoever believes on him shall not be ashamed.">Romans 9:33</a> : <span class="greekheb">καὶ πᾶς ὁ πιστεύων ἐπʼ αὐτῷ οὐ καταισχυνθήσεται</span>). Whatever may be understood by the stone in Zion, whether the theocracy, or the temple, or the house of David, or the promise given to David, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-12.htm" title="And when your days be fulfilled, and you shall sleep with your fathers, I will set up your seed after you, which shall proceed out of your bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.">2 Samuel 7:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-16.htm" title="And your house and your kingdom shall be established for ever before you: your throne shall be established for ever.">2 Samuel 7:16</a> (Hofmann), this passage, which certainly has a Messianic character,—inasmuch as the thought expressed in it should find, and has found, its fulfilment in Christ,—is not here only, but by Paul and the Rabbis (see Vitringa, <span class="ital">ad Jes.</span> I. p. 217), taken to refer directly to the Messiah, who also, according to Delitzsch (cf. <span class="ital">in loc</span>.), is directly meant by the stone (“this stone is the true seed of David, manifested in Christ”). Luther, following Oecumenius and Theophylactus, assumes that Christ is called <span class="greekheb">λίθος ἀκρογων</span>. because He has united Jew and Gentile together, and out of both collected the <span class="ital">one</span> church; this Calvin, not entirely without reason, calls a subtilius philosophari. In the words: <span class="greekheb">καὶ ὁ πιστεύων κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., <span class="greekheb">πιστεύων</span> corresponds to <span class="greekheb">προσερχόμενοι</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-4.htm" title="To whom coming, as to a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God, and precious,">1 Peter 2:4</a>. <span class="greekheb">οὐ μὴ καταισχυνθῇ</span> does not refer to the glory which consists for the believer in this, “that he, as a <span class="greekheb">λίθος ζῶν</span>, will form part of the <span class="greekheb">οἶκος πν</span>.” (Wiesinger), but to “the final glory of salvation which is the aim of the present <span class="greekheb">πιστεύειν</span>” (Schott); cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-2.htm" title="As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that you may grow thereby:">1 Peter 2:2</a> : <span class="greekheb">εἰς σωτηρίαν</span>.[120]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[120] Hofmann is wrong in asserting that it is here said “that <span class="greekheb">οὐ μὴ καταισχύνθῃ</span> is meant to <span class="ital">call back to mind</span> the <span class="greekheb">εἰς σωτηρίαν</span> in ver. 2.”<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/1_peter/2.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-6.htm" title="Why also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that believes on him shall not be confounded.">1 Peter 2:6</a>. <span class="greekheb">περιέχει ἐν γραφῇ</span>, <span class="ital">it is contained in Scripture</span>.

This omission may be due to the fact that Christians emphasised the idea that the stone was a corner stone binding the two wings of the Church together (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-20.htm" title="And are built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone;">Ephesians 2:20</a>) and regarded this as inconsistent with <span class="greekheb">εἰς κεφ</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[148] Codex Sinaiticus (sæc. iv.), now at St. Petersburg, published in facsimile type by its discoverer, Tischendorf, in 1862.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/1_peter/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">6</span>. <span class="ital">Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture</span>] As the words are not quoted in exact accordance either with the LXX. or with the Hebrew, it is natural to see in them a citation from <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-16.htm" title="Therefore thus said the Lord GOD, Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner stone, a sure foundation: he that believes shall not make haste.">Isaiah 28:16</a>, freely made from memory.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">a chief corner stone</span>] The words, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/118-22.htm" title="The stone which the builders refused is become the head stone of the corner.">Psalm 118:22</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-20.htm" title="And are built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone;">Ephesians 2:20</a>, point to the stone at the corner where two walls met, and resting on which they were bonded together and made firm.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">elect, precious</span>] Better, to maintain the identity of phrase, <span class="bld">chosen, precious</span> (or, <span class="bld">held in honour</span>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">he that believeth on him shall not be confounded</span>] The meaning of the Hebrew is fairly expressed by the English version, “He that believeth shall not make haste,” i.e. shall go on his way calmly and trustfully, shall not be put to a hurried or hasty flight.
