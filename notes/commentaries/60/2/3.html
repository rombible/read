St. Peter confidently reckons that it is so. It should rather be <span class= "ital">ye tasted, </span>looking back to a quite past time, probably that of the first conversion, when the taste of spiritual things is the most delicious. How sad to be past the relish for evangelical truth! The quotation, or rather adaptation, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-8.htm" title="O taste and see that the LORD is good: blessed is the man that trusts in him.">Psalm 34:8</a> is, no doubt, suggested by the metaphor of “milk.” A curious little point about our translation here is that the word “gracious” has been adopted to suit the Prayer Book version of the Psalm. It is scarcely suitable to the Greek word, which, originally signifying “usable,” “serviceable,” passes on to be used of anything mild and pleasant, as, for instance, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/5-39.htm" title="No man also having drunk old wine straightway desires new: for he said, The old is better.">Luke 5:39</a>, of the mellowness of old wine. Here, therefore, the word seems to be peculiarly used with reference to the sense of taste. A more important point, doctrinally, is that St. Peter is here applying to Jesus Christ (as the next verse shows) a passage which otherwise we might not have thought of applying to Him in particular. It gives quite a new complexion to the 34th Psalm, when we see that in St. Peter’s view the Psalmist was speaking prophetically of our Lord. We shall find him quoting the same Psalm in the same sense again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-10.htm" title="For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile:">1Peter 3:10</a>.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_peter/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:1-10 Evil-speaking is a sign of malice and guile in the heart; and hinders our profiting by the word of God. A new life needs suitable food. Infants desire milk, and make the best endeavours for it which they are able to do; such must be a Christian's desires after the word of God. Our Lord Jesus Christ is very merciful to us miserable sinners; and he has a fulness of grace. But even the best of God's servants, in this life, have only a taste of the consolations of God. Christ is called a Stone, to teach his servants that he is their protection and security, the foundation on which they are built. He is precious in the excellence of his nature, the dignity of his office, and the glory of his services. All true believers are a holy priesthood; sacred to God, serviceable to others, endowed with heavenly gifts and graces. But the most spiritual sacrifices of the best in prayer and praise are not acceptable, except through Jesus Christ. Christ is the chief Corner-stone, that unites the whole number of believers into one everlasting temple, and bears the weight of the whole fabric. Elected, or chosen, for a foundation that is everlasting. Precious beyond compare, by all that can give worth. To be built on Christ means, to believe in him; but in this many deceive themselves, they consider not what it is, nor the necessity of it, to partake of the salvation he has wrought. Though the frame of the world were falling to pieces, that man who is built on this foundation may hear it without fear. He shall not be confounded. The believing soul makes haste to Christ, but it never finds cause to hasten from him. All true Christians are a chosen generation; they make one family, a people distinct from the world: of another spirit, principle, and practice; which they could never be, if they were not chosen in Christ to be such, and sanctified by his Spirit. Their first state is a state of gross darkness, but they are called out of darkness into a state of joy, pleasure, and prosperity; that they should show forth the praises of the Lord by their profession of his truth, and their good conduct. How vast their obligations to Him who has made them his people, and has shown mercy to them! To be without this mercy is a woful state, though a man have all worldly enjoyments. And there is nothing that so kindly works repentance, as right thoughts of the mercy and love of God. Let us not dare to abuse and affront the free grace of God, if we mean to be saved by it; but let all who would be found among those who obtain mercy, walk as his people.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_peter/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>If so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious - Or rather, as Doddridge renders it, "Since you have tasted that the Lord is gracious."

We can scarcely doubt that the Apostle saw in the Master he had owned in Christ the “Lord” of whom the Psalmist spoke. It is possible that he may have been led to choose the quotation from the close resemblance in sound between the two Greek words for “Christ” (<span class="ital">Christos</span>) and “gracious” (<span class="ital">Chrestos</span>). The acceptance of the name of Christian as carrying with it this significance, and being, as it were, <span class="ital">nomen et omen</span>, was common in the second century (Tertullian <span class="ital">Apol</span>. 100:3), and it would have been quite in accordance with Jewish habits of thought for St Peter to have anticipated that application.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/1_peter/2.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-3.htm" title="If so be you have tasted that the Lord is gracious.">1 Peter 2:3</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἐγεύσασθε</span>, <span class="ital">ye have tasted</span>) A taste excites the appetite.[14]—<span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὍΤΙ</span></span></span>, <span class="ital">that</span>) <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-8.htm" title="O taste and see that the LORD is good: blessed is the man that trusts in him.">Psalm 34:8</a>.

The "if" does not imply doubt; the apostle supposes that they have once tasted, and urges them, on the ground of that first taste, to long for more. The first experiences of the Christian life stimulate God's people to further efforts. The words are a quotation from <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-8.htm">Psalm 34:8</a>, "Oh taste and see that the Lord is good!"
