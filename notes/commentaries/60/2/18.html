And not only to those pleased with reasonable service, but to the severe, and those angry without cause. The sinful misconduct of one relation, does not justify sinful behaviour in the other; the servant is bound to do his duty, though the master may be sinfully froward and perverse. But masters should be meek and gentle to their servants and inferiors. What glory or distinction could it be, for professed Christians to be patient when corrected for their faults? But if when they behaved well they were ill treated by proud and passionate heathen masters, yet bore it without peevish complaints, or purposes of revenge, and persevered in their duty, this would be acceptable to God as a distinguishing effect of his grace, and would be rewarded by him. Christ's death was designed not only for an example of patience under sufferings, but he bore our sins; he bore the punishment of them, and thereby satisfied Divine justice. Hereby he takes them away from us. The fruits of Christ's sufferings are the death of sin, and a new holy life of righteousness; for both which we have an example, and powerful motives, and ability to perform also, from the death and resurrection of Christ. And our justification; Christ was bruised and crucified as a sacrifice for our sins, and by his stripes the diseases of our souls are cured. Here is man's sin; he goes astray; it is his own act. His misery; he goes astray from the pasture, from the Shepherd, and from the flock, and so exposes himself to dangers without number. Here is the recovery by conversion; they are now returned as the effect of Divine grace. This return is, from all their errors and wanderings, to Christ. Sinners, before their conversion, are always going astray; their life is a continued error.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_peter/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Servants, be subject to your masters - On the duty here enjoined, see the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-5.htm">Ephesians 6:5-9</a>. The Greek word used here (&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;  oiketai) is not the same which is employed in Ephesians, (&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;  douloi.) The word here means properly "domestics" - those employed about a house, or living in the same house - from &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#787;&#834;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  oikos, "house." These persons might have been slaves, or might not. The word would apply to them, whether they were hired, or whether they were owned as slaves. The word should not and cannot be employed to prove that slavery existed in the churches to which Peter wrote, and still less to prove that he approved of slavery, or regarded it as a good institution. The exhortation here would be, and still is, strictly applicable to any persons employed as domestics, though they had voluntarily hired themselves out to be such. It would be incumbent on them, while they remained in that condition, to perform with fidelity their duties as Christians, and to bear with Christian meekness all the wrongs which they might suffer from those in whose service they were.<p>Those who are hired, and who are under a necessity of "going out to service" for a living, are not always free from hard usage, for there are trials incident to that condition of life which cannot be always avoided. It might be better, in many cases, to bear much than to attempt a change of situation, even though they were entirely at liberty to do so. It must be admitted, however, that the exhortation here will have more force if it is supposed that the reference is to slaves, and there can be no doubt that many of this class were early converted to the Christian faith. The word here rendered "masters" (&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;  despotais) is not the same which is used in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-5.htm">Ephesians 6:5</a>, (&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;  kuriois.) Neither of these words necessarily implies that those who were under them were slaves. The word used here is applicable to the head of a family, whatever may be the condition of those under him. It is frequently applied to God, and to Christ; and it cannot be maintained that those to whom God sustains the relation of &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;  despote&#772;s, or "master," are "slaves." See <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-29.htm">Luke 2:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-24.htm">Acts 4:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-21.htm">2 Timothy 2:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-1.htm">2 Peter 2:1</a>; Jde 1:4; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-10.htm">Revelation 6:10</a>. The word, indeed, is one that might be applied to those who were owners of slaves. If that be the meaning here, it is not said, however, that those to whom it is applied were Christians. It is rather implied that they were pursuing such a course as was inconsistent with real piety. Those who were under them are represented as suffering grievous wrongs.<p>With all fear - That is, with all proper reverence and respect. See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-5.htm">Ephesians 6:5</a>.<p>Not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward - The word rendered "froward" (&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2;  skoliois) means properly "crooked, bent;" then perverse, wicked, unjust, peevish. Anyone who is a servant or domestic is liable to be employed in the service of such a master; but while the relation continues, the servant should perform his duty with fidelity, whatever may be the character of the master. Slaves are certainly liable to this; and even those who voluntarily engage as servants to others, cannot always be sure that they will have kind employers. Though the terms used here do not necessarily imply that those to whom the apostle gave this direction were slaves, yet it may be presumed that they probably were, since slavery abounded throughout the Roman empire; but the directions will apply to all who are engaged in the service of others, and are therefore of permanent value. Slavery will, sooner or later, under the influence of the gospel, wholly cease in the world, and instructions addressed to masters and slaves will have no permanent value; but it will always be true that there will be those employed as domestics, and it is the duty of all who are thus engaged to evince true fidelity and a Christian spirit themselves, whatever may be the character of their employers. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_peter/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18. Servants&#8212;Greek, "household servants": not here the Greek for "slaves." Probably including freedmen still remaining in their master's house. Masters were not commonly Christians: he therefore mentions only the duties of the servants. These were then often persecuted by their unbelieving masters. Peter's special object seems to be to teach them submission, whatever the character of the masters might be. Paul not having this as his prominent design, includes masters in his monitions.<p>be subject&#8212;Greek, "being subject": the participle expresses a particular instance of the general exhortation to good conduct, 1Pe 2:11, 12, of which the first particular precept is given 1Pe 2:13, "Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake." The general exhortation is taken up again in 1Pe 2:16; and so the participle 1Pe 2:18, "being subject," is joined to the hortatory imperatives going before, namely, "abstain," "submit yourselves." "honor all men."<p>with&#8212;Greek, "in."<p>all&#8212;all possible: under all circumstances, such as are presently detailed.<p>fear&#8212;the awe of one subject: God, however, is the ultimate object of the "fear": fear "for the Lord's sake" (1Pe 2:13), not merely slavish fear of masters.<p>good&#8212;kind.<p>gentle&#8212;indulgent towards errors: considerate: yielding, not exacting all which justice might demand.<p>froward&#8212;perverse: harsh.

The fulness with which slaves are thus addressed, here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/6-5.htm" title="Servants, be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as to Christ;...">Ephesians 6:5-8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-22.htm" title=" Servants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh; not with eye-service, as men pleasers; but in singleness of heart, fearing God;">Colossians 3:22</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_timothy/6-1.htm" title="Let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honor, that the name of God and his doctrine be not blasphemed....">1 Timothy 6:1-2</a>, indicates the large proportion of converts that belonged to that class. Nearly all the names in Romans 16 and many of those of other members of the Church are found in the <span class="ital">Columbaria</span> or <span class="ital">Catacombs</span> of Rome as belonging to slaves or freedmen. The term for “servants,” here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-13.htm" title="No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.">Luke 16:13</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-7.htm" title="And when the angel which spoke to Cornelius was departed, he called two of his household servants, and a devout soldier of them that waited on him continually;">Acts 10:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-4.htm" title="Who are you that judge another man's servant? to his own master he stands or falls. Yes, he shall be held up: for God is able to make him stand.">Romans 14:4</a>, differs from the more common word as pointing specially to household servants, the “domestics” of a family. It may have been chosen by St Peter as including the wide class of <span class="ital">libertini</span> or freedmen and freedwomen who, though no longer in the <span class="ital">status</span> of slavery, were still largely employed in the households of the upper classes, as scribes, musicians, teachers, physicians, needle-women and the like. It is obvious that the new thoughts of converts to the faith of Christ must have brought with them some peculiar dangers. They had learnt that all men were equal in the sight of God. Might they not be tempted to assert that equality in word or act? They felt themselves raised to a higher life than their heathen masters. Could they endure to serve loyally and humbly those whom they looked on as doomed to an inevitable perdition? Was it not their chief duty to escape by flight or purchase from the degradation and dangers of their position? The teaching of St Paul in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/7-21.htm" title="Are you called being a servant? care not for it: but if you may be made free, use it rather....">1 Corinthians 7:21-23</a>, as well as in the passages above referred to, shews how strongly he felt the urgency of this danger. Cardinal Wiseman’s <span class="ital">Fabiola</span> may be mentioned as giving, with special vividness and insight, a picture of this aspect of the social life of the early Church.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">with all fear</span>] So St Paul urges obedience “with fear and trembling” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-5.htm" title="Servants, be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as to Christ;">Ephesians 6:5</a>). There was, looking to the then existing relations of society, a comparative nobleness in a service into which the fear of offending their master, as distinct from the mere dread of the scourge or other punishment, entered as a motive into the obedience of slaves. And this was not to depend on the character of the master. He might be good and easy-going, or perverse and irritable. Their duty was in either case to submit, with thankfulness in the one case, with a cheerful patience in the other.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/1_peter/2.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-18.htm" title="Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the fraudulent.">1 Peter 2:18</a>. <span class="greekheb">Οἱ οἰκέται</span>, <span class="ital">servants</span>) He prescribes duties to these, and not to masters, the greater part of whom were heathens.—<span class="greekheb">ὑποτασσόμενοι</span>, <span class="ital">subject</span>) The participle, for the imperative, depending upon ὑ̔<span class="greekheb">ποτάγητε</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-13.htm" title="Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme;">1 Peter 2:13</a>; from which the form of the imperative ought to be repeated by Zeugma.

The word is not <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, slaves,but <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, household servants, domestics. St. Peter may have used it as a less harsh term, in Christian kindliness and courtesy; or he may have chosen it purposely to include the large class of freedmen and other dependents who were to be found in the houses of the great. The frequent mention of slaves in the Epistles shows that many of the first Christians must have been in a condition of servitude (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-21.htm">1 Corinthians 7:21-23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-5.htm">Ephesians 6:5-8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-22.htm">Colossians 3:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-1.htm">1 Timothy 6:1, 2</a>, etc.). It was only natural that men should feel uneasy and irritable under the yoke of slavery as they came to learn the equality of all men in the sight of God, and to understand the blessed privileges and the high hopes of Christians. The apostles counseled submission and resignation to the will of God. Slavery was an unnatural institution; it must in time disappear under the softening influences of the gospel. But Christian slaves were to wait in faith and patience. The sacred writers use language of studied moderation, carefully avoiding any expressions which might be regarded as exciting to violence or revolutionary outbreaks. <span class="cmt_word">Be subject to your</span> <span class="cmt_word">masters with all fear</span>. The participle <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> seems to look back to the imperative <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> in ver. 13; the relation of slaves to their lords being one of the ordinances of man alluded to there (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-5.htm">Ephesians 6:5</a>, where St. Paul bids slaves to be obedient to their masters "with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto Christ"). The holy fear of God, by whose providence they were set in that lowly station, would involve the fear of failing in their duty to their masters. <span class="accented">All fear</span>; not only fear of punishment, but also fear of neglecting duty. <span class="cmt_word">Not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward</span>. Servants must not make the character of their masters an excuse for disobedience; if their masters are froward (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>, literally, "crooked, perverse"), still they must be submissive to the wilt of God. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/1_peter/2.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Servants (&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;)<p>Household servants. So Rev., in margin. Not a common term in the New Testament, occurring only in three other passages: <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-13.htm">Luke 16:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-7.htm">Acts 10:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-4.htm">Romans 14:4</a>. Some suppose that Peter intended to cover by it freedmen and other dependants in the household, or that he uses it with a conciliatory purpose, as presenting the slave in closer relation with the family.<p>Gentle (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;)<p>A common derivation of this word is from &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;, to yield. Hence the meaning, mind, yielding, indulgent. But the true derivation is from &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;, reasonable; and the word implies rather the not being unduly rigorous: "Wherein not strictness of legal right, but consideration for one another, is the rule of practice" (Alford). Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/4-5.htm">Philippians 4:5</a>, where, for moderation (&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#768;&#x3c2;), Rev. gives forbearance, with gentleness in margin. According to Aristotle, the word stands in contrast with &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, one who is exactingly just, as one who is satired with less than his due.<p>Froward (&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2;)<p>Lit., crooked. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-5.htm">Luke 3:5</a>. Peter uses the word in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-40.htm">Acts 2:40</a> (untoward); and Paul, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-15.htm">Philippians 2:15</a> (crooked). The word froward is Anglo-Saxon fream-ward or from-ward, the opposite of to-ward. (See untoward, above.) Thus Ben Jonson:<p>"Those that are froward to an appetite;"<p>i.e., averse. Compare the phrases to-God-ward (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-4.htm">2 Corinthians 3:4</a>); to-us-ward. </body></html>
