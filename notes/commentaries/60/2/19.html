Quite literally it is, <span class= "ital">for this is grace, </span>or else (for, like <span class= "ital">grâce</span> in French, ‘the word has the double signification) <span class= "ital">this is thanks.</span> The passage has some little importance in controversy, as some of the older Roman Catholic divines pressed it into the service of the supererogation theory. “This is grace,” they said, means “this <span class= "ital">deserves</span> grace as its reward.” It is needless to point out how shallow a view of <span class= "ital">duty</span> is implied in the thought that it was <span class= "ital">more</span> than duty to be thus submissive. Still taking the first translation, others would interpret, “this is a mark of grace”—<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, shows that you are Christians indeed; or, “this is a gift of grace”—<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>a supernatural and heroic virtue, such as must have come from God, and not from you.” These two interpretations make good sense in themselves, but they seem not to suit the context (“what <span class= "ital">glory</span> is it”) quite so well as our authorised rendering, and they ignore the sayings of our Lord, which must certainly have been in St. Peter’s mind, recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/6-27.htm" title="But I say to you which hear, Love your enemies, do good to them which hate you,">Luke 6:27-35</a>, especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/6-32.htm" title="For if you love them which love you, what thank have you? for sinners also love those that love them.">Luke 6:32-34</a>, and again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/17-9.htm" title="Does he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him? I trow not.">Luke 17:9</a>. The thought is that where duty is both obvious and easy (as is the case with good masters), people do not lavish gratitude for the performance of it. The best of masters hardly feels grateful to the best of servants for <span class= "ital">doing</span> his duty, though he will be grateful for the spirit and manner in which it is done. Here the “thanks” are put quite generally, as in the first passage in St. Luke: “this is a matter for thanks.” It does not say as yet who is to pay the thanks, and we may naturally conclude that the master so served, and all who are cognisant of the service, are the persons meant.<p><span class= "bld">For conscience toward God endure grief, suffering wrongfully.</span>—This does not mean “if a man is afflicted for his religion’s sake.” Rather, <span class= "ital">the conscience towards God, </span>or, perhaps, rather, <span class= "ital">consciousness of God, </span>is thrown in to guard against any false theory that patience <span class= "ital">by itself</span> is a thankworthy thing. However unjust the man’s treatment may be, and however little he may resent it in act, it is not thankworthy unless his resignation be grounded on consciousness of God’s presence. A resignation which comes from stolid want of feeling, or stoical fatalism, or from the sense that it is no good to seek redress—such resignation is sinfully defective. The two necessary qualifications, before patience can become in any sense meritorious, are (1) that the suffering should be <span class= "ital">undeserved, </span>(2) that the man should recognise in it the hand of God.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_peter/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:18-25 Servants in those days generally were slaves, and had heathen masters, who often used them cruelly; yet the apostle directs them to be subject to the masters placed over them by Providence, with a fear to dishonour or offend God. And not only to those pleased with reasonable service, but to the severe, and those angry without cause. The sinful misconduct of one relation, does not justify sinful behaviour in the other; the servant is bound to do his duty, though the master may be sinfully froward and perverse. But masters should be meek and gentle to their servants and inferiors. What glory or distinction could it be, for professed Christians to be patient when corrected for their faults? But if when they behaved well they were ill treated by proud and passionate heathen masters, yet bore it without peevish complaints, or purposes of revenge, and persevered in their duty, this would be acceptable to God as a distinguishing effect of his grace, and would be rewarded by him. Christ's death was designed not only for an example of patience under sufferings, but he bore our sins; he bore the punishment of them, and thereby satisfied Divine justice. Hereby he takes them away from us. The fruits of Christ's sufferings are the death of sin, and a new holy life of righteousness; for both which we have an example, and powerful motives, and ability to perform also, from the death and resurrection of Christ. And our justification; Christ was bruised and crucified as a sacrifice for our sins, and by his stripes the diseases of our souls are cured. Here is man's sin; he goes astray; it is his own act. His misery; he goes astray from the pasture, from the Shepherd, and from the flock, and so exposes himself to dangers without number. Here is the recovery by conversion; they are now returned as the effect of Divine grace. This return is, from all their errors and wanderings, to Christ. Sinners, before their conversion, are always going astray; their life is a continued error.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_peter/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For this is thank-worthy - Margin, "thank." Greek, "This is grace," (&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;  charis). Doddridge renders the expression, "This is graceful indeed." Various interpretations of this expression have been proposed; but the meaning evidently is, that it is acceptable to God, (see <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-20.htm">1 Peter 2:20</a>, "this is acceptable to God" - &#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837;  charis para Theo&#772;;) that is, this will be regarded by him with favor. It does not mean that it was worthy of thanks, or that God would thank them for doing it, (compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/17-9.htm">Luke 17:9-10</a>;) but that such conduct would meet with his approbation.<p>If a man for conscience toward God - If, in the conscientious discharge of his duty, or if, in the endurance of this wrong, he regards himself as serving God. That is, if he feels that God, by his providence, has placed him in the circumstances in which he is, and that it is a duty which he owes to him to bear every trial incident to that condition with a submissive spirit. If he does this, he will evince the true nature of religion, and will be graciously accepted of God.<p>Endure grief - That is, endure that which is suited to produce grief, or that which is wrong.<p>Suffering wrongfully - Suffering injury, or where there is "injustice," (&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;  pascho&#772;n adiko&#772;&#772;s.) This, though a general remark, has particular reference to servants, and to their duty in the relation which they sustain to their masters. In view of what is here said, we may remark:<p>(1) that if this has reference to slaves, as has been usually supposed, it proves that they are very liable to be abused; that they have little or no security against being wronged; and that it was a special and very desirable characteristic of those who were in that condition, to be able to bear wrong with a proper spirit. It is impossible so to modify slavery that this shall not be the case; for the whole system is one of oppression, and there can be nothing that shall effectually secure the slave from being ill-treated.<p>(2) It would follow from this passage, if this refers to slavery, that that is a very hard and undesirable condition of life; for that is a very undesirable condition where the principal virtue. which they who are in it are required to exercise, is "patience under wrongs." Such a condition cannot be in accordance with the gospel, and cannot be designed by God to be permanent. The relation of parent and child is never thus represented. It is never said or implied in the Scriptures that the principal virtue to which children are exhorted is patience under wrongs; nor, in addressing them, is it ever supposed that the most prominent thing in their condition is, that they would need the exercise of such patience.<p>(3) it is acceptable to God, if we bear wrong with a proper spirit, from whatever quarter it may come. Our proper business in life is, to do the will of God; to evince the right spirit, however others may treat us; and to show, even under excessive wrong, the sustaining power and the excellence of true religion. Each one who is oppressed and wronged, therefore, has an eminent opportunity to show a spirit which will honor the gospel; and the slave and the martyr may do more to honor the gospel than if they were both permitted to enjoy liberty and life undisturbed. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_peter/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19.

Besides, Wiesinger alters the term “grace” into “sign of grace.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Some commentators, on account of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-20.htm" title="For what glory is it, if, when you be buffeted for your faults, you shall take it patiently? but if, when you do well, and suffer for it, you take it patiently, this is acceptable with God.">1 Peter 2:20</a>, explain <span class="greekheb">χάρις</span> as synonymous with <span class="greekheb">κλέος</span>, but without any linguistic justification; thus already Oecumenius (Calvin: idem valet nomen gratiae quod laudis; qui patienter ferunt injurias, ii laude digni sunt). In profane Greek <span class="greekheb">χάρις</span> denotes either the <span class="ital">charm</span> or the <span class="ital">loveliness</span>, or also the <span class="ital">favour</span> which one person has for another (to which are linked on the meanings, expressions of goodwill and thanks). Both senses are to be found in the Scriptures.[149] If the first signification be adopted, the enduring of the adversity of which Peter here speaks is characterized as something lovely; and so Cremer (see under <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΧΆΡΙς</span></span></span>, p. 576) seems to take it. But it is more natural to hold by the second sense, and to explain “<span class="ital">this is favour</span>,” as equal to “<span class="ital">this causes favour</span>.” Several interpreters explain <span class="greekheb">χάρις</span> as equal directly to “delight,” substituting for the substantive the adjective “well-pleasing,” and supplying <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΑΡᾺ Τῷ ΘΕῷ</span></span></span> from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-20.htm" title="For what glory is it, if, when you be buffeted for your faults, you shall take it patiently? but if, when you do well, and suffer for it, you take it patiently, this is acceptable with God.">1 Peter 2:20</a>. Thus Gerhard: hoc est Deo gratum et acceptum; de Wette: “Favour with God, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> well-pleasing before God;” so, too, Hofmann. But both of these are open to objection. Hofmann no doubt gives as the ground of his supplement: “that the slave who lived up to the apostle’s injunction has to look for the approval of none.” This is, however, surely an unjustifiable assertion.

So also St. Paul recalls the parallel between Christ’s and the Chrstians’ sufferings (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-11.htm" title="Even to this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwelling place;">1 Corinthians 4:11</a>) <span class="greekheb">κολαφιζόμεθα</span>.—<span class="greekheb">ἀγαθοποιοῦντες</span>, opposed to <span class="greekheb">ἁμαρτάνοντες</span>, explains <span class="greekheb">ἀδίκως</span> (19).—<span class="greekheb">χάρις</span>, see on 10. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-19.htm" title="For this is thank worthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure grief, suffering wrongfully.">1 Peter 2:19</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/1_peter/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">19</span>. <span class="ital">For this is thankworthy</span>] The word <span class="ital">charis</span>, commonly translated “grace,” is here used in the sense, which attaches also to the Latin <span class="ital">gratia</span>, as in <span class="ital">ago tibi gratias</span>, and the French <span class="ital">mille graces</span>, of thanks or cause for thanks. So in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-32.htm" title="For if you love them which love you, what thank have you? for sinners also love those that love them.">Luke 6:32</a> the same word is used in “what <span class="ital">thank</span> have ye,” where the context shews that it is equivalent to a “reward,” and in that case, as in this, a reward from God. It is not unreasonable to suppose that St Peter’s choice of the term was determined by the use of it which St Luke records in his report of the Sermon on the Plain.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">for conscience toward God</span>] Literally, <span class="bld">consciousness of God</span>, i.e. of His presence as seeing, judging, helping, rewarding, His suffering servants. The phrase is analogous to the “conscience of the idol” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-7.htm" title="However, there is not in every man that knowledge: for some with conscience of the idol to this hour eat it as a thing offered to an idol; and their conscience being weak is defiled.">1 Corinthians 8:7</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">suffering wrongfully</span>] Natural impulse, one might almost say natural ethics, sanctions the burning indignation and desire to retaliate which is caused by the sense of wrong. Here, as in the Sermon on the Mount (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-39.htm" title="But I say to you, That you resist not evil: but whoever shall smite you on your right cheek, turn to him the other also.">Matthew 5:39</a>), which this teaching distinctly reproduces, that is made the crucial instance in which the Christian is to shew that the law of Christ is his rule of life. It is obvious that in this case the allowance of any exception to the rule would make it altogether inoperative. Each party in a dispute or quarrel thinks himself at the moment in the right, and it is only by acting on the principle that the more he believes himself to be in the right the more it is his duty to submit patiently, that a man can free himself from an endless entanglement of recriminations and retaliations.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/1_peter/2.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-19.htm" title="For this is thank worthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure grief, suffering wrongfully.">1 Peter 2:19</a>. <span class="greekheb">Χάρις</span> [“thank-worthy”], <span class="ital">favour</span>) with God: <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-20.htm" title="For what glory is it, if, when you be buffeted for your faults, you shall take it patiently? but if, when you do well, and suffer for it, you take it patiently, this is acceptable with God.">1 Peter 2:20</a>.—<span class="greekheb">διὰ συνείδησιν Θεοῦ</span>, <span class="ital">for conscience toward God</span>) On account of the consciousness of a mind which does things good and pleasing to God, even though they please no man (let the force of <span class="greekheb">κλέος</span>, which presently follows, be considered).[18]—<span class="greekheb">ἀδίκως</span>, <span class="ital">unjustly</span>) that is, suffering those things, which are unjustly inflicted. <span class="greekheb">חנם</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀδίκως</span>, Septuagint, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-11.htm" title="If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk privately for the innocent without cause:">Proverbs 1:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-17.htm" title="Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird.">Proverbs 1:17</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[18] When a just man is not approved of by men, though doing what is good, and when he does not acquire, either before or afterwards, either their assent, support, or the intimation of a grateful mind, nay, rather experiences everything of an opposite kind, he may possibly be affected with no small chagrin and sorrow.

The idea is not conscientiousness in the ordinary sense, but the conscious sense of one's relation to God; his consciousness of God. Thus one suffers patiently, not from a conscientious sense of duty, but from an inner consciousness of his relation to God as a son, and to Christ as a joint-heir, which involves his suffering with him no less than his being glorified with him. </body></html>
