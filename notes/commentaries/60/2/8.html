Here there is no thought whatever of the stone as a material for building; the thought is that of a mass of rock on the road, on which the terror-stricken fugitives stumble and fall. The words are taken from <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-14.htm" title="And he shall be for a sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offense to both the houses of Israel, for a gin and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.">Isaiah 8:14</a>, and are translated directly from the Hebrew. The LXX. not only makes nonsense, but can again be hardly acquitted of “guile” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-1.htm" title="Why laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, all evil speakings,">1Peter 2:1</a>) in its endeavour to make out the best possible case for Israel by deliberately inserting the word “not” twice over. We shall find St. Peter in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-14.htm" title="But and if you suffer for righteousness' sake, happy are you: and be not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled;">1Peter 3:14</a> quoting the verses which immediately precede our present citation, and again the point lies in the context. The words are no mere phrase hastily caught up to serve the turn. They come out of the great Immanuel section of Isaiah, and immediately involve, like the quotation in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-6.htm" title="Why also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that believes on him shall not be confounded.">1Peter 2:6</a>, the sharp contrast between the Jews who trust in Immanuel (the presence of God with Israel) and the Jews who do not, but rely on “confederacies.” To the one party, the Lord of Hosts will be “for a sanctuary;” but to the other party, who are described as “both houses of Israel,” and specially as the “inhabitant of Jerusalem,” He will be “for a stone of striking, and for a rock of stumbling over,” and also “for a snare.” The “sanctuary” does not seem to mean a temple (though this would connect it with the preceding words of St. Peter), but rather such a “sanctuary” as that of Bethel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-18.htm" title="And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put for his pillows, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil on the top of it.">Genesis 28:18</a>), a consecrated stone to which a man might flee as an asylum. In the flight of terror before the face of the Assyrians the very stone which afforded right of sanctuary to those who recognised and trusted it, was a vexatious and dangerous obstacle, a trap full in the way to those who did not. Once more, therefore, the Hebrews of the Dispersion, in separating themselves from “both houses of Israel” and the “inhabitant of Jerusalem,” were obeying the warnings of the Immanuel prophecy, which every Hebrew recognised as Messianic. Though the coupling of these passages of the Old Testament together certainly seems to show traces of the influence of St. Paul (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/9-32.htm" title="Why? Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law. For they stumbled at that stumbling stone;">Romans 9:32-33</a>), yet St. Peter must have been present and heard “the Lord of Hosts” Himself put them together (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/20-17.htm" title="And he beheld them, and said, What is this then that is written, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner?">Luke 20:17-18</a>), and probably St. Paul’s use of the passages is itself to be traced back to the same origin.<p><span class= "bld">Stumble at the word, being disobedient.</span>—It seems better to arrange the words otherwise: <span class= "ital">which stumble, being disobedient to the word.</span> The participle thus explains the verb. “‘A stone of stumbling’ He is to them; and the manner of the stumbling is in being disobedient to the gospel preaching” (Leighton).<p><span class= "bld">Whereunto also they were appointed</span>—<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>unto stumbling. The present commentator believes that when St. Peter says that these unhappy Jews were appointed to stumble, he primarily means that the clear prophecies of the Old Testament which he has quoted marked them for such a destiny. It was no unforeseen, accidental consequence of the gospel. It had never been expected that all who heard the gospel would accept it. Those who stumbled by disbelief were marked out in prophecy as men who would stumble. Thus the introduction of the statement here has the direct practical purpose of confirming the faith of the readers by showing the verification of the prophecy. Still, in fairness, we must not shirk the further question which undoubtedly comes in at this point. Even though the moment of their appointment to stumble was that of the utterance of the prophecy, it cannot be denied that, in a certain sense, it was God Himself who appointed them to stumble. It will be observed, however, from the outset, that our present passage casts not a glance at the condition of the stumbling Jews <span class= "ital">after death.</span> With this caution, we may say that God puts men sometimes into positions where, during this life, they almost inevitably reject the truth. This is implied in the very doctrine of election—<span class= "ital">e.g., </span>in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-13.htm" title="But we are bound to give thanks always to God for you, brothers beloved of the Lord, because God has from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth:">2Thessalonians 2:13</a>, where, if God selects one man out of the hundred to a present salvation through belief of truth, it seems to follow logically that the ninety and nine are appointed to have no share in that salvation, so far as this life is concerned, through disbelief of truth. These things remain as a trial of faith. It suffices that we know for certain that God is Love. He has “brought us forth at His own option by the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of His creatures” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-18.htm" title="Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of first fruits of his creatures.">James 1:18</a>). We have but to prize more highly our own present salvation, and to trust His love for that fuller harvest of which we are but the firstfruits. In some way even their stumbling will ultimately prove His love, to them as well as to us.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_peter/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:1-10 Evil-speaking is a sign of malice and guile in the heart; and hinders our profiting by the word of God. A new life needs suitable food. Infants desire milk, and make the best endeavours for it which they are able to do; such must be a Christian's desires after the word of God. Our Lord Jesus Christ is very merciful to us miserable sinners; and he has a fulness of grace. But even the best of God's servants, in this life, have only a taste of the consolations of God. Christ is called a Stone, to teach his servants that he is their protection and security, the foundation on which they are built. He is precious in the excellence of his nature, the dignity of his office, and the glory of his services. All true believers are a holy priesthood; sacred to God, serviceable to others, endowed with heavenly gifts and graces. But the most spiritual sacrifices of the best in prayer and praise are not acceptable, except through Jesus Christ. Christ is the chief Corner-stone, that unites the whole number of believers into one everlasting temple, and bears the weight of the whole fabric. Elected, or chosen, for a foundation that is everlasting. Precious beyond compare, by all that can give worth. To be built on Christ means, to believe in him; but in this many deceive themselves, they consider not what it is, nor the necessity of it, to partake of the salvation he has wrought. Though the frame of the world were falling to pieces, that man who is built on this foundation may hear it without fear. He shall not be confounded. The believing soul makes haste to Christ, but it never finds cause to hasten from him. All true Christians are a chosen generation; they make one family, a people distinct from the world: of another spirit, principle, and practice; which they could never be, if they were not chosen in Christ to be such, and sanctified by his Spirit. Their first state is a state of gross darkness, but they are called out of darkness into a state of joy, pleasure, and prosperity; that they should show forth the praises of the Lord by their profession of his truth, and their good conduct. How vast their obligations to Him who has made them his people, and has shown mercy to them! To be without this mercy is a woful state, though a man have all worldly enjoyments. And there is nothing that so kindly works repentance, as right thoughts of the mercy and love of God. Let us not dare to abuse and affront the free grace of God, if we mean to be saved by it; but let all who would be found among those who obtain mercy, walk as his people.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_peter/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And a stone of stumbling - A stone over which they, stumble, or against which they impinge. The idea seems to be that of a cornerstone which projects from the building, against which they dash themselves, and by which they are made to fall. See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-44.htm">Matthew 21:44</a>. The rejection of the Saviour becomes the means of their ruin. They refuse to build on him, and it is as if one should run against a solid projecting cornerstone of a house, that would certainly be the means of their destruction. Compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-34.htm">Luke 2:34</a>. An idea similar to this occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-44.htm">Matthew 21:44</a>; "Whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken." The meaning is, that if this foundation-stone is not the means of their salvation, it will be of their ruin. It is not a matter of indifference whether they believe on him or not - whether they accept or reject him. They cannot reject him without the most fearful consequences to their souls.<p>And a rock of offence - This expresses substantially the same idea as the phrase "stone of stumbling." The word rendered "offence," (&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;  skandalon) means properly "a trap-stick - a crooked stick on which the bait is fastened which the animal strikes against, and so springs the trap," (Robinson, Lexicon) then "a trap, gin, snare"; and then "anything which one strikes or stumbles against; a stumbling-block." It then denotes "that which is the cause or occasion of ruin." This language would be strictly applicable to the Jews, who rejected the Saviour on account of his humble birth, and whose rejection of him was made the occasion of the destruction of their temple, city, and nation. But it is also applicable to all who reject him, from whatever cause; for their rejection of him will be followed with ruin to their souls. It is a crime for which God will judge them as certainly as he did the Jews who disowned him and crucified him, for the offence is substantially the same. What might have been, therefore, the means of their salvation, is made the cause of their deeper condemnation.<p>Even to them which stumble at the word - To all who do this. That is, they take the same kind of offence at the gospel which the Jews did at the Saviour himself. It is substantially the same thing, and the consequences must be the same. How does the conduct of the man who rejects the Saviour now, differ from that of him who rejected him when he was on the earth?<p>Being disobedient - <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-7.htm">1 Peter 2:7</a>. The reason why they reject him is, that they are not disposed to obey. They are solemnly commanded to believe the gospel; and a refusal to do it, therefore, is as really an act of disobedience as to break any other command of God.<p>Whereunto they were appointed - (&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#788;&#769; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;  eis ho kai etethe&#772;san.) The word "whereunto "means unto which. But unto what? It cannot be supposed that it means that they were "appointed" to believe on him and be saved by him; for:<p>(1) this would involve all the difficulty which is ever felt in the doctrine of decrees or election; for it would then mean that he had eternally designated them to be saved, which is the doctrine of predestination; and,<p>(2) if this were the true interpretation, the consequence would follow that God had been foiled in his plan - for the reference here is to those who would not be saved, that is, to those who "stumble at that stumblingstone," and are destroyed.<p>Calvin supposes that it means, "unto which rejection and destruction they were designated in the purpose of God." So Bloomfield renders it, "Unto which (disbelief) they were destined," (Critical Digest) meaning, as he supposes, that "into this stumbling and disobedience they were permitted by God to fall." Doddridge interprets it, "To which also they were appointed by the righteous sentence of God, long before, even as early as in his first purpose and decree he ordained his Son to be the great foundation of his church." Rosenmuller gives substantially the same interpretation. Clemens Romanus says it means that "they were appointed, not that they should sin, but that, sinning, they should be punished." See Wetstein. So Macknight. "To which punishment they were appointed." Whitby gives the same interpretation of it, that because they were disobedient, (referring, as he supposes, to the Jews who rejected the Messiah) "they were appointed, for the punishment of that disobedience, to fall and perish."<p>Dr. Clark supposes that it means that they were prophesied of that they should thus fall; or that, long before, it was predicted that they should thus stumble and fall. In reference to the meaning of this difficult passage, it is proper to observe that there is in the Greek verb necessarily the idea of designation, appointment, purpose. There was some agency or intention by which they were put in that condition; some act of placing or appointing, (the word &#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;  tithe&#772;mi meaning to set, put, lay, lay down, appoint, constitute) by which this result was brought about. The fair sense, therefore, and one from which we cannot escape, is, that this did not happen by chance or accident, but that there was a divine arrangement, appointment, or plan on the part of God in reference to this result, and that the result was in conformity with that. So it is said in Jde 1:4, of a similar class of people, "For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old ordained to this condemnation." The facts were these:<p>(1) That God appointed his Son to be the cornerstone of his church.<p>(2) that there was a portion of the world which, from some cause, would embrace him and be saved.<p>(3) that there was another portion who, it was certain, would not embrace him.<p>(4) that it was known that the appointment of the Lord Jesus as a Saviour would be the occasion of their rejecting him, and of their deeper and more aggravated condemnation.<p>(5) that the arrangement was nevertheless made, with the understanding that all this would be so, and because it was best on the whole that it should be so, even though this consequence would follow. That is, it was better that the arrangement should be made for the salvation of people even with this result, that a part would sink into deeper condemnation, than that no arrangement should be made to save any. The primary and originating arrangement, therefore, did not contemplate them or their destruction, but was made with reference to others, and notwithstanding they would reject him, and would fall. The expression "whereunto" (&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;  eis ho) refers to this plan, as involving, under the circumstances, the result which actually followed. Their stumbling and falling was not a matter of chance, or a result which was not contemplated, but entered into the original arrangement; and the whole, therefore, might be said to be in accordance with a wise plan and purpose. And,<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_peter/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. stone of stumbling, &c.&#8212;quoted from Isa 8:14. Not merely they stumbled, in that their prejudices were offended; but their stumbling implies the judicial punishment of their reception of Messiah; they hurt themselves in stumbling over the corner-stone, as "stumble" means in Jer 13:16; Da 11:19.<p>at the word&#8212;rather, join "being disobedient to the word"; so 1Pe 3:1; 4:17.<p>whereunto&#8212;to penal stumbling; to the judicial punishment of their unbelief. See above.<p>also&#8212;an additional thought; God's ordination; not that God ordains or appoints them to sin, but they are given up to "the fruit of their own ways" according to the eternal counsel of God. The moral ordering of the world is altogether of God. God appoints the ungodly to be given up unto sin, and a reprobate mind, and its necessary penalty. "Were appointed," Greek, "set," answers to "I lay," Greek, "set," 1Pe 2:6. God, in the active, is said to appoint Christ and the elect (directly). Unbelievers, in the passive, are said to be appointed (God acting less directly in the appointment of the sinner's awful course) [Bengel]. God ordains the wicked to punishment, not to crime [J. Cappel]. "Appointed" or "set" (not here "FORE-ordained") refers, not to the eternal counsel so directly, as to the penal justice of God. Through the same Christ whom sinners rejected, they shall be rejected; unlike believers, they are by God appointed unto wrath as FITTED for it. The lost shall lay all the blame of their ruin on their own sinful perversity, not on God's decree; the saved shall ascribe all the merit of their salvation to God's electing love and grace.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_peter/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence; </span> i.e. a stone at which they stumble, a rock at which they are offended; and so it implies Christ not to be the cause of their stumbling, but the object of it; they of their own accord, and through the pravity of their nature, without any just occasion given by him, being offended, either because cause they find not that in him which they expected, viz. outward encouragements; or find that in him which they do not like, the holiness of his law, and purity of his doctrine, contrary to their corruptions and lusts, and especially his requiring of them faith in him for the justification of their persons, which was so contrary to the pride of their hearts, and which was one great reason of the Jews stumbling at him, as seeking to establish their own righteousness, and therefore not submitting to the righteousness of God, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-32.htm" title="Why?

The apostle alludes to <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-14.htm">Isaiah 8:14</a> and which is a prophecy of the Messiah;  see Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-33.htm">Romans 9:33</a> and had its accomplishment in the unbelieving and disobedient Jews; who stumbled at his birth and parentage; at the manner of his birth, being born of a virgin; at the meanness of his parents, his supposed father being a carpenter, and his mother, Mary, a poor woman, when they expected the Messiah would have sprung from some rich and noble family; and at the place of his birth, which they imagined was Galilee, from his education and conversation there; they stumbled also at his education, and could not conceive how he should know letters, and from whence he should have his wisdom, having never been trained up in any of their schools and academies, or at the feet of any of their doctors and Rabbins; but, on the other hand, was brought up and employed in the trade of a carpenter; they stumbled at his outward meanness and poverty, when they expected the Messiah would be a rich, powerful, and glorious monarch; and so at the obscurity of his kingdom, which was not of this world, and came not with observation, when they dreamt of an earthly and temporal one, which should be set up in great splendour and glory; and they stumbled likewise at the company he kept, and the audience that attended him, being the poorer sort of the people, and the more illiterate, and also such who had been very profane and wicked, as publicans and harlots; moreover, they stumbled at his ministry, at the doctrine he preached, particularly at the doctrine of his divinity, and of spiritual communion with him, by eating his flesh, and drinking his blood, and at the doctrines of distinguishing grace; and so at his miracles, by which he confirmed his mission and ministry, some of these being wrought on the sabbath day, and others they imputed to diabolical influence and assistance, in a word, they stumbled at his death, having imbibed a notion that Christ abideth for ever, and especially at the manner of it, the death of the cross; wherefore the preaching of Christ crucified always was, and still is, a stumbling block unto them: <p>even to them which stumble at the word; either the essential Word, Christ Jesus, as before; or rather at the doctrine of the Gospel, at that part of it which respects a trinity of persons in the Godhead; because their carnal reason could not comprehend it, and they refused to submit to revelation, and to receive the witness of God, which is greater than that of men; and at that part of it which regards the deity of Christ, and that for this reason, because he was a man, and in order to enervate the efficacy of his blood, righteousness, and sacrifice, and fearing too much honour should be given to him; and also at that part of the word which concerns the distinguishing grace of God, as eternal personal election, particular redemption, and efficacious grace in conversion; against which the carnal mind of man is continually cavilling and replying, and, in so doing, against God himself, charging him with cruelty, injustice, and insincerity; and particularly at that part of the word which holds forth the doctrine of free justification, by the righteousness of Christ; this was the grand stumbling block of the Jews, who sought for righteousness, not by faith, but, as it were, by the works of the law, being ignorant of the righteousness of God, and of the spirituality of the law, and of themselves, and their own righteousness, of which they had an overweening opinion: <p>being disobedient; to the Gospel revelation, and unwilling to submit their carnal reason to it; this is the source and cause of their stumbling at Christ and his Gospel: it is worth while to compare this with the paraphrase of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-14.htm">Isaiah 8:14</a> which passage is here referred to; and the paraphrase of it runs thus, <p>""if ye obey not", his word shall be among you for revenge, and for a stone smiting, and for a rock of offence to both houses of the princes of Israel, and for destruction and offence to those who are divided upon the house of Judah, &amp;c. <p>whereunto also they were appointed; both to stumble at the word of the Gospel, and at Christ, the sum and substance of it, he being set in the counsel and purpose of God, as for the rising of some, so for the stumbling and falling of others; and also to that disobedience and infidelity which was the cause of their stumbling; for as there are some whom God appointed and foreordained to believe in Christ, on whom he has determined to bestow true faith in him, and who have it as a pure gift, in consequence of such appointment; so there are others, whom he has determined to leave in that disobedience and infidelity into which the fall brought and concluded them, through which they stumble at Christ, and his word, and, in consequence thereof, justly perish; but this is not the case of all; there are some who are the objects of distinguishing grace and favour, and who are described in the following verse. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_peter/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence, even to them which stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were appointed.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/1_peter/2.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-8.htm" title="And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense, even to them which stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were appointed.">1 Peter 2:8</a>. <span class="greekheb">οἱ προσκόπτουσι</span>] links itself on to <span class="greekheb">ἀπειθοῦσι κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.: “<span class="ital">that is to those who</span>,” etc., not to what follows, as if <span class="greekheb">εἰσι</span> were to be supplied: “they who stumble are those who are,” etc.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">προσκόπτειν</span> has here the same meaning as that contained in the last words, but the turn of the thought is different;

For, on the one hand, the leading idea <span class="greekheb">προσκ</span>. would be weakened by its connection with <span class="greekheb">λόγῳ</span>; and, on the other, the nearer definition requisite is supplied of itself from what precedes; it would, too, be inappropriate “that <span class="greekheb">λόγος</span> should of a sudden take the place of Christ, who in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-7.htm" title="To you therefore which believe he is precious: but to them which be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made the head of the corner,">1 Peter 2:7</a> is, as <span class="greekheb">λίθος</span>, the object of <span class="greekheb">προσκ</span>.” (Brückner).

T., “to appoint, constituere” (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-9.htm" title="For God has not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,">1 Thessalonians 5:9</a>). It is clear from the connection of this verse with the preceding, that <span class="greekheb">εἰς ὅ</span> does not go back to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-5.htm" title="You also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.">1 Peter 2:5</a> (Gerhard: in hoc positi sunt, videlicet, ut ipsi quoque in hunc lapidem fide aedificarentur). It may be referred either to <span class="greekheb">ἀπειθεῖν</span> (Calvin, Beza, Piscator, and others) or to <span class="greekheb">προσκόπτειν</span> and <span class="greekheb">ἀπειθεῖν</span> (Estius, Pott, de Wette, Usteri, Hofmann, Wiesinger,[123] etc.), or, more correctly, to <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΡΟΣΚΌΠΤΕΙΝ</span></span></span> (Grotius, Hammond, Benson, Hensler, Steiger, Weiss), since on the latter (not on <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΠΕΙΘΕῖΝ</span></span></span>) the chief emphasis of the thought lies, and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΕἸς Ὃ Κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Λ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> applies to that which is predicated of the subject, that is, of the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΠΕΙΘΟῦΝΤΕς</span></span></span>, but not to the characteristic according to which the subject is designated. The <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΡΟΣΚΌΠΤΕΙΝ</span></span></span> it is to which they, the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΠΕΙΘΟῦΝΤΕς</span></span></span>, were already appointed, and withal on account of their unbelief, as appears from the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Τῷ ΛΌΓῼ ἈΠΕΙΘ</span></span></span>. This interpretation alone is in harmony with the connection of thought, for it is simply the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΙΣΤΕΎΟΝΤΕς</span></span></span> and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΠΕΙΘΟῦΝΤΕς</span></span></span>, together with the blessing and curse which they respectively obtain, that are here contrasted, without any reference being made to the precise ground of faith and unbelief. Vorstius correctly: Increduli sunt designati vel constituti ad hoc, ut poenam sive exitium sibi accersant sua incredulitate.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Following the construction of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-7.htm" title="To you therefore which believe he is precious: but to them which be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made the head of the corner,">1 Peter 2:7</a> adopted by him, Hofmann takes <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΟἹ ΠΡΟΣΚΌΠΤΟΥΣΙΝ</span></span></span> not as an adjunct referring to what precedes, but as protasis to the subsequent <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΕἸς Ὅ</span></span></span>, which, according to him, contains the apodosis expressed in the form of an exclamation. This interpretation falls with that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-7.htm" title="To you therefore which believe he is precious: but to them which be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made the head of the corner,">1 Peter 2:7</a>. Besides, it gives rise to a construction entirely abnormal, and of which there is no other example in the N. T., either as regards the relative pronoun[124] or the method here resorted to, of connecting apodosis with protasis. The words are added by the apostle in order to show that the being put to shame of unbelievers, takes place according to divine determination and direction. Oecumenius[125] is not justified by the context in laying special stress on the personal guilt of unbelief; or Aretius, in answering the question: quis autem illos sic posuit? by non Deus certe, sed Satan tales posuit.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[122] The application to the <span class="ital">Word</span> or to <span class="ital">Christ</span> occurs already in the older commentators; thus Beda says: in hoc positi sunt i. e. per naturam facti sunt homines, ut credant Deo et ejus voluntati obtemperent; and Nicol. de Lyra, applying it specially to the Jews: illis data fuit lex, ut disponerentur ad Christum secundum quod dicitur Galatians 3. lex paedagogus noster fuit in Christo; et ipsi pro majore parte remanserunt increduli.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[123] Different interpreters seek in various ways to soften the harshness of the dea here presented. Thus Estius, by explaining <span class="greekheb">ἐτέθησαν</span> only of the permission of God; Pott, by paraphrasing the idea thus: “their lot seemed to bring this with it;” Wiesinger, by asserting that “the passage here speaks of the action of God as a matter of history, not of His eternal decrees.” But what justifies any such softening down? While Hofmann, in the 1st edition of his <span class="ital">Schriftbeweis</span>, I. p. 210, says precisely: that God has ordained them to this, that they should not become obedient to His word, but should stumble at it and fall over it; in the 2d ed. I. p. 237, it appears that the meaning only is: “that the evil which befalls them in the very fact of their not believing, is ordained by God to those who do not obey His message of salvation, as a punishment of their disposition of mind.” Schott agrees with this view. But in it the idea of <span class="greekheb">ἐτέθησαν</span> in relation to <span class="greekheb">ἀπειθοῦντες</span> is arbitrarily weakened; since Schott expressly says that unbelievers, by their own state of mind, “appoint themselves to unbelief,” he can look on unbelief only in so far as the result of a divine decree, that God has appointed faith impossible with a carnal disposition. But a limitation of this kind is here all the more inappropriate, that Peter in the passage makes no allusion to the disposition which lies at the foundation of unbelief. Hofmann in his commentary says: “it is the word which is preached to them that they refuse to obey, but by the very fact of their doing so they stumble at Christ and fall over Him, as over a stone that lies in the way. Both are one and the same thing, named from different sides; the one time from what they do, the other from what is done to them.” Yet these are two different things; the one the cause, the other the effect.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[124] Hofmann, indeed, appeals to <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-50.htm" title="And Jesus said to him, Friend, why are you come? Then came they, and laid hands on Jesus and took him.">Matthew 26:50</a>; but the interpretation of this passage is so doubtful that it cannot be relied upon; cf. the various interpretations in Meyer on this passage; in Winer, p. 157 [E. T. 207 f.]; in Buttmann, p. 217.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[125] <span class="greekheb">Οὐχ ὡς ἀπὸ τοῦ Θεοῦ εἰς τοῦτο ἀφωρισμένοις</span>, <span class="greekheb">εἴρηται</span>· <span class="greekheb">οὐδευία γὰρ αἰτία ἀπωλείας παρὰ τοῦ πάντας ἀνθρώπους θέλοντος σωθῆναι βραβεύεται</span>· <span class="greekheb">ἀλλὰ τοῖς ἑαυτοῖς σκευή κατηρτικόσιν ὀργῆς καὶ ἡ ἀπείθεια ἐπηκολούθησε</span>, <span class="greekheb">καὶ εἰς ἣν παρεσκεύασαν ἑαυτοὺς τάξιν ἐτέθησαν</span>. Thus also Didymus: ad non credendum a semetipsis sunt positi; and Hornejus: constituti ad impingendum et non credendum ideo dicuntur, quia cum credere sermoni Dei nollent, sed ultro eum repellerent, deserti a Deo sunt et ipsius permissione traditi ut non crederent et impingerent.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/1_peter/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">8</span>. <span class="ital">which stumble at the word</span>] The “word,” as before, is the sum and substance of the Gospel. Men opposing themselves to that word, looking on it as an obstacle to be got rid of, were as those who rush upon a firm-fixed stone, and who falling over it are sorely bruised.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">whereunto also they were appointed</span>] Attempts have been made to soften the apparent fatalism of the words by carrying the antecedent of the “whereunto” as far back as <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-5.htm" title="You also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.">1 Peter 2:5</a>, and seeing in the words the statement that even those who stumbled were appointed, as far as God’s purpose was concerned, to be built up on Christ. It is, however, all but obvious that this puts a forced and artificial meaning on the Apostle’s words. What he really affirms is that it is part of God’s appointed order that the disobedient should stumble and be put to shame. And it may be noted that this way of looking on things is eminently characteristic of him. In the treachery of Judas he read the lesson that “the Scripture must needs have been fulfilled” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-16.htm" title="Men and brothers, this scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy Ghost by the mouth of David spoke before concerning Judas, which was guide to them that took Jesus.">Acts 1:16</a>). Stumbling, however, was not necessarily identical with falling irretrievably (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-11.htm" title="I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? God forbid: but rather through their fall salvation is come to the Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealousy.">Romans 11:11</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/1_peter/2.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-8.htm" title="And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense, even to them which stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were appointed.">1 Peter 2:8</a>. <span class="greekheb">Οἱ προσκόπτουσι</span>, <span class="greekheb">τῷ λόγῷ ἀπειθοῦντες</span>, <span class="ital">who stumble, not believing the word</span>) In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-7.htm" title="To you therefore which believe he is precious: but to them which be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made the head of the corner,">1 Peter 2:7</a>, he expressed the different judgments of believers and unbelievers respecting Christ; now he sets forth the difference itself between believers and unbelievers. Many construct <span class="greekheb">προσκόπτουσι τῷ λόγῳ</span>, <span class="ital">stumble at the word</span>. But <span class="greekheb">προσκόπτουσι</span>, put absolutely (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-9.htm" title="Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk in the day, he stumbles not, because he sees the light of this world.">John 11:9</a>), is derived from <span class="greekheb">προσκόμματος</span>, the word quoted from Isaiah; and the declaration follows, <span class="greekheb">τῷ λόγῳ ἀπειθοῦντες</span>, <span class="ital">not believing the word</span>, as ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-17.htm" title="For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God?">1 Peter 4:17</a>, <span class="greekheb">Τὶ τὸ τέλος τῶν ἀπειθούντων τῷ τοῦ Θεοῦ εὐαγγελίῳ</span>; <span class="ital">What shall be the end of those who obey not the Gospel of God?</span> and certainly ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-1.htm" title="Likewise, you wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives;">1 Peter 3:1</a>, <span class="greekheb">εἴ τινες ἀπειθοῦσι τῷ λόγῳ</span>: <span class="ital">If any obey not the word</span>. It is in the Gospel-word that <span class="ital">the preciousness</span> of Christ is set forth: they who do not believe the word, despise Christ, and stumble at Him.—<span class="greekheb">εἰς ὃ καὶ ἐτέθησαν</span>, <span class="ital">to which also they were appointed</span>) <span class="ital">Which</span> refers to <span class="ital">stumble</span>: they who do not believe, stumble; they who stumble are also appointed for stumbling. This <span class="ital">appointment</span> follows unbelief and stumbling, as even the intensive particle, <span class="ital">also</span>, and the order of this clause which is placed last, signify. And yet <span class="ital">stumble</span> is present. <span class="ital">They were appointed</span> has the force of a past tense; by which it is implied, that by a most just judgment of God, unbelievers stumble more and more from day to day. <span class="ital">Are appointed</span> answers to <span class="ital">I lay</span> (<span class="ital">or appoint</span>), <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-6.htm" title="Why also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that believes on him shall not be confounded.">1 Peter 2:6</a>; but with some difference: for God is said, in the active, <span class="ital">to appoint</span> Christ and the elect: unbelievers, in the passive, are said <span class="ital">to be appointed</span>. Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-22.htm" title="What if God, willing to show his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much long-suffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction:">Romans 9:22</a>, note.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense</span>. St. Peter combines <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-14.htm">Isaiah 8:14</a> with his first quotations, as St. Paul also does (Ram. 9:33), both apostles quoting from the Hebrew, not from the Septuagint, which is quite different, inserting two negatives. The living Stone is not only made the Head of the corner to the confusion of the disobedient, but becomes also to their destruction a Stone of stumbling; they fall on that Stone, and are broken (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-44.htm">Matthew 21:44</a>). That Stone is a Rock (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>), the Rock of Ages, the Rock on which the Church is built; but to the disobedient it is a Rock of offense (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>). <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> (<span class="accented">in Attic Greek</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) is properly the catch or spring of a trap, which makes animals fall into the trap; then a stumbling-block - anything which causes men to fall. We cannot fail to notice how St. Peter echoes the well-remembered words of our Lord, recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-18.htm">Matthew 16:18, 23</a>. Peter was himself then a <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, a rock of offense. Even to them <span class="cmt_word">which stumble at the Word, being disobedient</span>; literally, <span class="accented">who being disobedient stumble at the Word - the</span> relative referring back to "them which be disobedient" in ver. 7. This seems better than (with Huther and others) to take <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x1ff3;</span> with <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, "who stumble, being disobedient to the Word." <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, literally," unbelieving," contains here, as frequently, the idea of disobedience, willful opposition. St. Peter seems to come very near to St. John's use of <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> for the personal Word, the Lord Jesus Christ. <span class="cmt_word">Whereunto also they were appointed</span>. "Whereunto" (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f44;</span>) cannot refer back to ver. 5; God had appointed them to be built up in his spiritual house, but they were disobedient. It must refer either to <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> - sin is punished by sin; for sin in God's awful judgment hardens the heart; the disobedient are in danger of eternal sin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-29.htm">Mark 3:29</a>, according to the two oldest manuscripts) - or, more probably, to <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>; it is God's ordinance that disobedience should end in stumbling; but that stumbling does not necessarily imply condemnation (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-11.htm">Romans 11:11</a>). The word, the preaching of Christ crucified, was to the Jews a stumbling-block (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-23.htm">1 Corinthians 1:23</a>). But not all stumbled that they might fall. Nevertheless, perseverance in disobedience must end in everlasting death. </body></html>
