We are hardly to take this as a separate paragraph from the foregoing, but rather as a corollary added to it, to correct a false impression that might otherwise have been conveyed.<p><span class= "bld">Dwell.</span>—Rather, <span class= "ital">dwelling.</span> The participle is attached to the previous sentences, just as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-16.htm" title="As free, and not using your liberty for a cloak of maliciousness, but as the servants of God.">1Peter 2:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-18.htm" title="Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the fraudulent.">1Peter 2:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-1.htm" title="Likewise, you wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives;">1Peter 3:1</a>; but St. Peter does not like to say to the husbands “submitting yourselves” (though it is implied in the “likewise”), and conveys the deference which the husbands are to pay under other terms: such as “according to knowledge,” “giving honour.”<p><span class= "bld">With them.</span>—The whole order of the sentences needs re-arrangement as follows: <span class= "ital">Ye husbands, likewise, dwelling according to knowledge, as with a weaker vessel, with what is female, apportioning honour as to joint heirs also of a grace of life.</span> In order to understand this very hard passage, we must remember what is St. Peter’s object all throughout these instructions, viz., to commend Christianity to jealous watchers without. Here, therefore, we may well suppose that he is thinking chiefly of the case of believing husbands (Jewish) married to unbelieving wives (Jewish also), thus presenting the counter-picture to that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-1.htm" title="Likewise, you wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives;">1Peter 3:1</a>. And the first thing is that they are to “dwell with” these wives, not to divorce them, nor to cease from conjugal cohabitation with them; such harshness would lend very little attractiveness to the Christian religion among the Jewish homes to which the divorced wife would turn. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-12.htm" title="But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother has a wife that believes not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away.">1Corinthians 7:12</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.</span>—a passage which must almost have been in St. Peter’s mind.)<p><span class= "bld">According to knowledge.</span>—This phrase, which is like an adverb, such as “scientifically, intelligently,” means that the husband is to study to enter into the whole bearings of the case, to take everything into account. Husband and wife will not get on together smoothly at haphazard, without pains taken to <span class= "ital">understand</span> the situation. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-4.htm" title="That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honor;">1Thessalonians 4:4</a>; “you should <span class= "ital">know.</span>”)<p><span class= "bld">Unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel.</span>—Or rather, as we now take it, <span class= "ital">as with a weaker vessel, with what is female.</span> This explains the saying “according to knowledge.” The thing which the husband is specially to understand and take into account is that he is dealing with a thing less strong than himself. The whole of chivalry is in these words, and St. Peter (next after Christ) may be considered the founder of it. Weakness itself, by being weakness, has a claim upon the strong man’s deference and self-submission. The weakness here ascribed to the female sex is primarily that of the body, as we shall see when we consider the word “vessel,” though it may, perhaps, indicate frailty in other respects as well. If the word “vessel” is to be here a description of a “wife,” as some contend on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-4.htm" title="That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honor;">1Thessalonians 4:4</a>, in a sense in which it does not equally describe a husband, it is difficult to see with what the vessel is compared and pronounced weaker. “Dwell with the female as with a more delicate vessel or instrument” than what? If we answer “than yourselves,” it becomes clear that the husbands are, by implication, <span class= "ital">less</span> delicate <span class= "ital">vessels.</span> And this is the case. In the Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-4.htm" title="That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honor;">1Thessalonians 4:4</a>, it has been shown that the word “vessel” (whether as receptacle or as instrument) is a description of the <span class= "ital">body, </span>or rather of the self as manifested in the body. The word in itself may be used to describe anything made to be serviceable—machinery, tackle and gear, pots and pans, and, in fact, any kind of apparatus or implement—and here it might be very fairly rendered, “as with a weaker thing or object.” That which is translated “the wife” is really a neuter adjective, and it is a question whether we are to supply with it the noun “vessel”—“with the female [vessel] as with a vessel which is weaker”—or whether it is to stand absolutely, “the female,” as we say “the good,” “the evil”—<span class= "ital">i.e., “</span>that which is female.” The latter seems, on the whole, simpler and more forcible, as calling closer attention to the fact of weakness being inherent in the sex.<p><span class= "bld">Giving honour.</span>—The word for “giving” implies rendering a portion which is <span class= "ital">due.</span> And what is here called “honour” is not to be understood only of the wife’s maintenance (as some say), though such is probably the interpretation of the word in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-17.htm" title="Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honor, especially they who labor in the word and doctrine.">1Timothy 5:17</a>, and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-10.htm" title="If he take him another wife; her food, her raiment, and her duty of marriage, shall he not diminish.">Exodus 21:10</a>; nor is the wife only to be honoured by being consulted in affairs of moment and put in charge of the household. The “honour” to be accorded to wives “as to joint heirs of a grace of life” is the same kind of “honour” as St. Paul, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-4.htm" title="That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honor;">1Thessalonians 4:4</a>, says must be accorded to oneself. Indeed, from the juxtaposition of three significant words there, we can hardly escape the conclusion that St. Peter was remembering that passage of St. Paul, “that every one of you should <span class= "ital">know</span> how to obtain possession of the <span class= "ital">vessel</span> of himself in sanctification and <span class= "ital">honour.”</span> It is that chaste respect for the wife which is meant in the Prayer Book by the phrase, “With my body I thee worship.” It means that the husband must not dare to take any <span class= "ital">liberties</span> with his wife. Would the Christian husband be likely to approve his religion to the unbelieving wife if she found that he took a coarse view of the conjugal tie?<p><span class= "bld">And as being heirs together of the grace of life.</span>—There is here a very intricate question of readings, on which it depends whether the “heirs” are to be nominative or dative, the husbands or the wives. The present annotator prefers, on the whole, to follow Tischendorf, and read the dative, “paying respect as to persons who are also joint heirs (<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>with you) of a grace of life.” Happily, it comes to much the same thing, the only difference being that in the one case deference is paid to the wife on the ground of her possessing a joint dignity with the husband, and in the other case on the ground that the husband does not possess his dignity except conjointly with the wife. That dignity which they conjointly “inherit”—<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>possess as a gift from God—is called “the grace (or perhaps, a grace) of life.” This is generally interpreted to mean, “the gracious gift of everlasting life.” Undoubtedly, “life” is often used absolutely in the New Testament to mean eternal life—<span class= "ital">e.g., </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-8.htm" title="Why if your hand or your foot offend you, cut them off, and cast them from you: it is better for you to enter into life halt or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire.">Matthew 18:8</a>; and it gives a very intelligible sense, that the husband should reverence the wife as being equally with himself an everlasting soul. But this neither gives sufficient force to the <span class= "ital">conjoint</span> nature of the possession, nor does it take into account the possibility of such a case as, in fact, we suppose to be here intended, viz., of a believing husband and unbelieving wife. Although, in a sense, “the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-14.htm" title="For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy.">1Corinthians 7:14</a>), yet not in such a sense as for them to be called conjoint possessors of eternal life. It seems best, therefore, to suppose that the “grace (or dower) of life” which husband and wife hold, not only in common, but <span class= "ital">conjointly, </span>is life in the <span class= "ital">natural</span> sense. This “grace,” this mysterious and divine gift—not apart from one another, but conjointly—they are privileged by the Creator’s primeval benediction (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-28.htm" title="And God blessed them, and God said to them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moves on the earth.">Genesis 1:28</a>) to transmit. They have the power (no Archangel has the like) to bring human beings into existence. And in consideration that such is the dignity and the intention of marriage, a man may well be called upon to revere his partner in the great prerogative.<p><span class= "bld">That your prayers be not hindered</span>—<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, the husbands’ prayers, not necessarily their prayers <span class= "ital">with</span> their wives. It is easy to feel how the consciousness of having treated a wife with less awe than is indicated by the foregoing words would clog the man’s prayers, whether for himself or for his wife’s conversion—the latter being, probably, what St. Peter chiefly meant. Very likely he had in view what St. Paul writes in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-5.htm" title="Defraud you not one the other, except it be with consent for a time, that you may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again, that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency.">1Corinthians 7:5</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_peter/3.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-7.htm" title="Likewise, you husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge, giving honor to the wife, as to the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life; that your prayers be not hindered.">1 Peter 3:7</a></span>. <span class="ital">Likewise, ye husbands </span>— See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-25.htm" title="Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it;">Ephesians 5:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-19.htm" title=" Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter against them.">Colossians 3:19</a>; <span class="ital">dwell with them </span>— Conduct yourselves toward them, <span class="ital">according to knowledge — </span>Wisely and discreetly; suitably to that knowledge of your duty which you have obtained by the gospel: or, knowing they are weak, and therefore to be used with tenderness: yet do not despise them for this, but <span class="ital">give them honour </span>— Both in heart and in your behaviour toward them, as those who are called to be <span class="ital">joint-heirs </span>of that eternal <span class="ital">life </span>which ye and they hope to receive by the free <span class="ital">grace of God. </span>“In Scripture, <span class="ital">honour </span>is sometimes used for <span class="ital">maintenance, </span>because to supply any one with the necessaries and conveniences of life was considered, in ancient times, as doing him honour. Accordingly the Greeks, in reward of eminent services done to the community, decreed maintenance at the public expense to those who had performed these services. By assigning as the reason why <span class="ital">honour </span>should be given to the wife, that she is weaker than the husband, in <span class="ital">body </span>or <span class="ital">person, </span>(as the word <span class="greekheb">σκευος</span>, <span class="ital">vessel, </span>here seems to mean,) the apostle hath intimated, not only that he ought to afford her a competent share of the necessaries and conveniences of life, but as much relief from bodily labour as his circumstances will allow: all which is most reasonable, considering the many bodily troubles women are subject to, in the breeding, bearing, and nursing of children.” <span class="ital">That your</span> <span class="ital">prayers be not hindered — </span>On the one part or the other.

We daily see how narrowly evil men watch the ways and lives of professors of religion. Putting on of apparel is not forbidden, but vanity and costliness in ornament. Religious people should take care that all their behaviour answers to their profession. But how few know the right measure and bounds of those two necessaries of life, food and raiment! Unless poverty is our carver, and cuts us short, there is scarcely any one who does not desire something beyond what is good for us. Far more are beholden to the lowliness of their state, than the lowliness of their mind; and many will not be so bounded, but lavish their time and money upon trifles. The apostle directs Christian females to put on something not corruptible, that beautifies the soul, even the graces of God's Holy Spirit. A true Christian's chief care lies in right ordering his own spirit. This will do more to fix the affections, and excite the esteem of a husband, than studied ornaments or fashionable apparel, attended by a froward and quarrelsome temper. Christians ought to do their duty to one another, from a willing mind, and in obedience to the command of God. Wives should be subject to their husbands, not from dread and amazement, but from desire to do well, and please God. The husband's duty to the wife implies giving due respect unto her, and maintaining her authority, protecting her, and placing trust in her. They are heirs together of all the blessings of this life and that which is to come, and should live peaceably one with another. Prayer sweetens their converse. And it is not enough that they pray with the family, but husband and wife together by themselves, and with their children. Those who are acquainted with prayer, find such unspeakable sweetness in it, that they will not be hindered therein. That you may pray much, live holily; and that you may live holily, be much in prayer.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_peter/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Likewise, ye husbands - On the general duty of husbands, see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25</a> ff.<p>Dwell with them - That is, "Let your manner of living with them be that which is immediately specified."<p>According to knowledge - In accordance with an intelligent view of the nature of the relation; or, as becomes those who have been instructed in the duties of this relation according to the gospel. The meaning evidently is, that they should seek to obtain just views of what Christianity enjoins in regard to this relation, and that they should allow those intelligent views to control them in all their contact with their wives.<p>Giving honor unto the wife - It was an important advance made in society when the Christian religion gave such a direction as this, for everywhere among the pagan, and under all false systems of religion, woman has been regarded as worthy of little honor or respect. She has been considered as a slave, or as a mere instrument to gratify the passions of man. It is one of the elementary doctrines of Christianity, however, that woman is to be treated with respect; and one of the first and most marked effects of religion on society is to elevate the wife to a condition in which she will be worthy of esteem. The particular reasons for the honor which husbands are directed to show to their wives, here specified, are two: she is to be treated with special kindness as being more feeble than man, and as having a claim therefore to delicate attention; and she is to be honored as the equal heir of the grace of life. Doddridge, Clarke, and some others, suppose that the word honor here refers to maintenance or support; and that the command is, that the husband is to provide for his wife so that she may not want. But it seems to me that the word is to be understood here in its more usual signification, and that it inculcates a higher duty than that of merely providing for the temporal needs of the wife, and strikes at a deeper evil than a mere neglect of meeting her temporal necessities. The reasons assigned for doing this seem to imply it.<p>As unto the weaker vessel - It is not uncommon in the Scriptures to compare the body to a vessel, (Compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-4.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:4</a>), and thence the comparison is extended to the whole person. This is done either because the body is frail and feeble, like an earthen vessel easily broken; or because it is that in which the soul is lodged; or because, in accordance with a frequent use of the word, (see below,) the body is the instrument by which the soul accomplishes its purposes, or is the helper of the soul. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-15.htm">Acts 9:15</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/9-22.htm">Romans 9:22-23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-7.htm">2 Corinthians 4:7</a>. In the later Hebrew usage it was common to apply the term vessel (Hebrew &#1499;&#1500;&#1497;  keliy, Greek &#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  skeuos) to a wife, as is done here. See Schoettgen, Hor. Heb. p. 827. Expressions similar to this, in regard to the comparative feebleness of woman, occur frequently in the classic writers. See Wetstein in loc. The reasons why the term vessel was given to a wife, are not very apparent.<p>A not unfrequent sense of the word used here (&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  skeuos) in the Greek classics was that of an instrument; a helper; one who was employed by another to accomplish anything, or to aid him (Passow), and it seems probable that this was the reason why the term was given to the wife. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-18.htm">Genesis 2:18</a>. The reason here assigned for the honor that was to be shown to the wife is, that she is "the weaker vessel." By this it is not necessarily meant that she is of feebler capacity, or inferior mental endowments, but that she is more tender and delicate; more subject to infirmities and weaknesses; less capable of enduring fatigue and toil; less adapted to the rough and stormy scenes of life. As such, she should be regarded and treated with special kindness and attention. This is a reason, the force of which all can see and appreciate. So we feel toward a sister; so we feel toward a beloved child, if he is of feeble frame and delicate constitution; and so every man should feel in relation to his wife. She may have mental endowments equal to his own; she may have moral qualities in every way superior to his; but the God of nature has made her with a more delicate frame, a more fragile structure, and with a body subject to many infirmities to which the more hardy frame of man is a stranger.<p>And as being heirs together of the grace of life - The grace that is connected with eternal life; that is, as fellow-Christians. They were equal heirs of the everlasting inheritance, called in the Scripture "life;" and the same "grace" connected with that inheritance had been conferred on both. This passage contains a very important truth in regard to the female sex. Under every other system of religion but the Christian system, woman has been regarded as in every way inferior to man. Christianity teaches that, in respect to her higher interests, the interests of religion, she is every way his equal. She is entitled to all the hopes and promises which religion imparts. She is redeemed as he is. She is addressed in the same language of tender invitation. She has the same privileges and comforts which religion imparts here, and she will be elevated to the same rank and privileges in heaven. This single truth would raise the female sex everywhere from degradation, and check at once half the social evils of the race. Make her the equal of man in the hope of heaven, and at once she rises to her appropriate place. Home is made what it should be, a place of intelligence and pure friendship; and a world of suffering and sadness smiles under the benefactions of Christian woman.<p>That your prayers be not hindered - It is fairly implied here:<p>(1) that it was supposed there would be united or family prayer. The apostle is speaking of "dwelling with the wife," and of the right manner of treating her; and it is plainly supposed that united prayer would be one thing that would characterise their living together. He does not direct that there should be prayer. He seems to take it for granted that there would be; and it may be remarked, that where there is true religion in right exercise, there is prayer as a matter of course. The head of a family does not ask whether he must establish family worship; he does it as one of the spontaneous fruits of religion - as a thing concerning which no formal command is necessary. Prayer in the family, as everywhere else, is a privilege; and the true question to be asked on the subject is not whether a man must, but whether he may pray.<p>(2) it is implied that there might be such a way of living as effectually to hinder prayer; that is, to prevent its being offered aright, and to prevent any answer. This might occur in many ways. If the husband treated the wife unkindly; if he did not show her proper respect and affection; if there were bickerings, and jealousies, and contentions between them, there could be no hope that acceptable prayer would be offered. A spirit of strife; irritability and unevenness of temper; harsh looks and unkind words; a disposition easily to take offence, and an unwillingness to forgive, all these prevent a "return of prayers." Acceptable prayer never can be offered in the tempest of passion, and there can be no doubt that such prayer is often "hindered" by the inequalities of temper, and the bickerings and strifes that exist in families. Yet how desirable is it that husband and wife should so live together that their prayers may not be hindered! How desirable for their own peace and happiness in that relation; how desirable for the welfare of children! In view of the exposition in this verse we may remark:<p>(a) that Christianity has done much to elevate the female sex. It has taught that woman is an heir of the grace of life as well as man; that, while she is inferior in physical vigor, she is his equal in the most important respect; that she is a fellow-traveler with him to a higher world; and that in every way she is entitled to all the blessings which redemption confers, as much as he is. This single truth has done more than all other things combined to elevate the female sex, and is all that is needful to raise her from her degradation all over the world.<p>(b) They, therefore, who desire the elevation of the female sex, who see woman ignorant and degraded in the dark parts of the earth, should be the friends of all well-directed efforts to send the gospel to pagan lands. Every husband who has a pure and intelligent wife, and every father who has an accomplished daughter, and every brother who has a virtuous sister, should seek to spread the gospel abroad. To that gospel only he owes it that he has such a wife, daughter, sister; and that gospel, which has given to him such an intelligent female friend, would elevate woman everywhere to the same condition. The obligation which he owes to religion in this respect can be discharged in no better way than by aiding in diffusing that gospel which would make the wife, the daughter, the sister, everywhere what she is in his own dwelling.<p>(c) Especially is this the duty of the Christian female. She owes her elevation in society to Christianity, and what Christianity has made her, it would make the sunken and debased of her own sex all over the earth; and how can she better show her gratitude than by aiding in any and every way in making that same gospel known in the dark parts of the world?<p>(d) Christianity makes a happy home. Let the principles reign in any family which are here enjoined by the apostle, and that family will be one of intelligence, contentment, and peace. There is a simple and easy way of being happy in the family relation. It is to allow the spirit of Christ and his gospel to reign there. That done, though there be poverty, and disappointment, and sickness, and cares, and losses, yet there will be peace within, for there will be mutual love, and the cheerful hope of a brighter world. Where that is missing, no outward splendor, no costly furniture or viands, no gilded equipage, no long train of servants, no wine, or music, or dances, can secure happiness in a dwelling. With all these things there may be the most corroding passions; in the mansion where these things are, pale disease, disappointment, and death may come, and there shall be nothing to console and support. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_peter/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. dwell&#8212;Greek, "dwelling": connected with the verb, 1Pe 2:17, "Honor all."<p>knowledge&#8212;Christian knowledge: appreciating the due relation of the sexes in the design of God, and acting with tenderness and forbearance accordingly: wisely: with wise consideration.<p>them &#8230; giving honour to the wife&#8212;translate and punctuate the Greek rather, "dwelling according to knowledge with the female (Greek adjective, qualifying 'vessel'; not as English Version, a noun) as with the weaker vessel (see on [2618]1Th 4:4.

It is a part of that prudence according to which men should dwell with their wives, to have the more regard to them because of their infirmities, (in bearing with them and hiding them), lest they should be discouraged, if they find their weakness makes them contemptible. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And as being heirs together:</span> another reason why husbands should give honour to their wives, viz. because though by nature they are weak and unequal to their husbands, yet they are equal to them in respect of their being called to the same grace and glory, there being neither male nor female in Christ, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-28.htm" title="There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for you are all one in Christ Jesus.">Galatians 3:28</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Of the grace of life; </span> i.e. eternal life, which is the gift of grace; or, is to be given out of grace. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">That your prayers be not hindered; </span> either, that ye be not diverted and hindered from praying; or, that the efficacy of your prayers be not hindered, viz. by those contentions and differences which are like to arise, if you do not dwell with your own wives according to knowledge, and give them the honour that belongs to them. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_peter/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with them,.... "With your wives", as the Syriac and Ethiopic versions read; which not only included dwelling together in the same house, and bedding together in the same bed, but the whole of conjugal conversation, and all the offices and duties incumbent on men in a married state: <p>according to knowledge; of themselves, and their wives, and the duties belonging to the conjugal state, and the laws of God and man respecting it; and according to their knowledge of the Gospel, and the Christian dispensation, which no ways breaks in upon, but strengthens and encourages to the observance of things belonging to natural religion, and civil life; and according to that superior knowledge of things, which, generally speaking, men have to women; as also wisely, prudently, becoming their characters as men and Christians: <p>particularly giving honour to the wife; by speaking well of her, and respectfully to her, and by deeds as well as words; not only by clothing her in a decent and becoming manner, suitable to her station; but by providing everything honest and comely for her, food and raiment, a suitable maintenance, all the necessaries, conveniences, and delights of life, that are laudable and proper; in which sense the word honour is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-3.htm">1 Timothy 5:3</a> and this was agreeably to the doctrine of the Jews (q), who say, <p>"let a man always take care , "of the glory of his wife"; for there is no blessing found in a man's house, but for the sake of his wife, as it is said, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-16.htm">Genesis 12:16</a> "and he entreated Abraham well for her sake": and Rabba used to say to the citizens, , "honour your wives", that ye may be rich. <p>And indeed this is what they promised in their marriage contract, which runs thus (r): <p>"be thou unto me for a wife, according to the law of Moses and Israel, and I, by the word of heaven, or God, will worship,  "and honour", and nourish, and take care of thee, according to the custom of the Jews, who worship, and "honour", and nourish, and take care of their wives. <p>As unto the weaker vessel; so in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-4.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:4</a> the wife is called a vessel; see Gill on <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-4.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:4</a>, and here "the weaker"; being so for the most part, both as to strength of body, and endowments of mind; and therefore to be used gently and tenderly, and not be treated with neglect and contempt, or with inhumanity and severity; but as, in every state and condition, the strong are to bear the infirmities of the weak; so a man should bear with, and accommodate himself to the infirmities of his wife, and hide them as much as he can, and not expose them, nor despise her on account of them. It is a saying of the Jews (s), <p>"if thy wife be short of stature, bow thyself, and whisper to her. <p>The meaning of the proverb is, that he ought to suit himself to her capacity and weakness: <p>and as being heirs together of the grace of life; not of a natural life, and the good things of it; though husbands and wives partake of the same kind of life, and have a right unto, and share in the same necessaries of life; so Adam and Eve were partakers of the same life, and sharers of the same benefits; and which is a reason indeed why they ought to live lovingly together: but something more is intended; not the external gifts of the Spirit, which, unless in some few instances, are bestowed on men, and not on women; nor the Gospel, and the ordinances of it, which are the means of grace and life; though men and women, called by grace, have an equal right to them, and enjoy them; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a> but grace here, and glory hereafter, are here meant. Some copies, as the Alexandrian, and others, read, "heirs together of the manifold grace of life"; God's own people, without any difference as to sex, as men and women, equally share in grace, as it signifies the love and favour of God; which is the same to all the objects, as to the date of it, which is from everlasting, one not being loved before another; and as to the quality of it, which is free, sovereign, special, discriminating and unchangeable, one being loved not with one sort of love, another with another; and as to the quantity of it, it not admitting of more or less; and as to the duration, which is for ever: and so they are heirs of it, as it denotes the blessings of grace; being equally heirs of, and sharers in electing, redeeming, justifying, pardoning, and adopting grace: and as it may intend the internal graces of the Spirit, as faith, hope, and love; which as to their principles are the same in all the saints, though different as to the degree of the exercise of them: and which may be called "the grace of life"; or "living grace", as some copies and the Complutensian edition read, and so the Arabic version, because by it men and women, who were dead in trespasses and sins, are quickened; and in distinction to counterfeit grace, which differs as much from true grace, as the picture of a man from a living man; and because it lives for ever, and never dies, and gives a meetness for eternal life, which it springs up to, issues in, and is inseparably connected with. Moreover, by it may be meant eternal life and salvation, of which the saints, without any difference as to sex, are heirs of: so some copies read, "heirs of manifold grace, and life"; by the former, meaning grace here, and by the latter, glory hereafter; which is a life of vision of God, and uninterrupted communion with him; of perfection and pleasure, and which will last for ever; and may be called <p>the grace of life, because it is the free gift of God's grace: and agreeably the Syriac version renders it, "the gift of eternal life"; and the Ethiopic version, glorious life: and this is represented as an inheritance, being what belongs only to the children; and which they have not by their own works, as an acquisition of theirs, but by the free grace of their heavenly Father, and as his gift and bequest unto them. Now all the saints, of whatever state, condition, or sex, are equally heirs of this inheritance; for there is but one inheritance, one kingdom, one crown of glory, which all shall enjoy; and whatever disparity there may be, particularly between husband and wife, in their natural relation, there is none in the things of grace, and with regard to the kingdom of glory; and which is an argument why husbands should dwell peaceably and comfortably with their wives, and give all due honour to them, since they are upon a par in spiritual things, there being neither male nor female in Christ Jesus, and because they are now joint heirs of, and shall equally share in eternal life and happiness, <p>That your prayers be not hindered: as they would be were they not to dwell together; or should not the husband give honour to his wife, and take care of her as he ought to do: hence would arise strifes and quarrels, when they could not cordially, and to edification, join together in prayer; nor would such prayers, put up in wrath, be acceptable unto God, who requires that men should lift up holy hands everywhere, whether in public, or in private, in God's house, or in their own houses, without wrath and doubting. From hence we may observe, that family prayer is a duty incumbent on professors of religion, and great care should be taken that it be not neglected and hindered, <p>(q) T. Bab.

Pott erroneously renders <span class="greekheb">ὁμοίως</span> by “vicissim, on the other hand;” nor is it, as de Wette thinks probable, to be expanded: “in like manner, ye men also, hear my exhortation.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">συνοικοῦντες</span>] <span class="greekheb">συνοικεῖν</span> (<span class="greekheb">ἅπ</span>. <span class="greekheb">λεγ</span>.) is not a euphemismus de tori conjugalis consuetudine (Hieronym. contra Jovian, lib. l. c. 4; Augustin. in Psalms 146., etc.); the reference is rather to life together at home.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">κατὰ γνῶσιν</span>] As <span class="greekheb">γνῶσις</span> is here anarthrous, it is wrong to understand <span class="greekheb">γνῶσις</span> as referring directly to “Christian recognition of the relation of wife to husband” (Brückner, Schott); <span class="greekheb">κατὰ γνῶσιν</span> is rather an adverbial expression, in which <span class="greekheb">γνῶσις</span> is to be understood generally, as Wiesinger correctly remarks: “according to recognition, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> so that home life must be regulated by knowledge and understanding” (so also Hofmann). Similar adverbial expressions, formed by a conjunction of <span class="greekheb">κατά</span> with an anarthrous subst., occur frequently both in classical and N. T. Greek. It is evident from the context that <span class="greekheb">κατὰ γνῶσιν</span> has here special reference to the marriage relation; but from this it does not follow that the interpretation: “<span class="ital">in a judicious, discerning manner</span>,” or Luther’s: “with reason,” is incorrect (in opposition to Brückner and Schott). De Wette is completely mistaken in rendering <span class="greekheb">γνῶσις</span> by: “that knowledge of men and self, in fact, that inward discernment, which is the condition of all <span class="ital">moderation</span>,” as is Bengel also directly by: moderatio.[176]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὡς ἀσθενεστέρῳ σκεύει τῷ γυναικείῳ</span>] is erroneously connected by Luther and others with <span class="greekheb">ἀπονέμοντες</span>; it belongs, however, to <span class="greekheb">συνοικοῦντες</span>, which requires a nearer definition.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The word <span class="greekheb">σκεῦος</span> is used to designate the wife in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-4.htm" title="That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honor;">1 Thessalonians 4:4</a> (see Lünemann <span class="ital">in loc</span>.) with reference to the husband; the same meaning, though with various applications, is here attributed to it by many interpreters. Beza: est femina vas i. e. comes et adjutrix viro ad fideliter coram Deo transigendam vitam adjuncta; Bengel: denotat hoc sexum et totum ingenium temperamentumque foemineum. But this view is incorrect, for <span class="greekheb">τῷ γυναικείῳ</span>, <span class="ital">sc</span>. <span class="greekheb">σκεύει</span>, is subjoined by way of explanation, and the comparative <span class="greekheb">ἀσθ</span>. shows that the husband also is thought of as <span class="greekheb">σκεῦος</span>. <span class="greekheb">σκεῦος</span> must be taken here in its specific meaning of a utensil (or instrument) serving a particular purpose, and is accordingly to be understood as specially applicable to man, in so far as the latter is used by God for the accomplishment of His will (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-15.htm" title="But the Lord said to him, Go your way: for he is a chosen vessel to me, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Israel:">Acts 9:15</a>).

Hofmann understands <span class="greekheb">σκεῦος</span> here as referring both to the husband and the wife, inasmuch as “in a life united in marriage, one part is destined to be and to accomplish something for the other;” but the reference to this mutual relation is purely arbitrary.[177]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΣΘΕΝΕΣΤΈΡῼ</span></span></span>] Bengel: Comparativus, etiam vir habet infirmitatem; in like manner Steiger: “the less weak is called upon to assist the more weak” (thus also Fronmüller).

The thought here must not be arbitrarily limited to any special relation (<span class="ital">e.g.</span> to that of maintenance or of continence, etc.). The husband should, in <span class="ital">every</span> relation, show the respect due to his wife.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὡς καὶ συγκληρονόμοις</span>[-<span class="greekheb">οι</span>] <span class="greekheb">χάριτος ζωῆς</span>] serves as ground of the exhortation; if the reading be: <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΣΥΓΚΛΗΡΟΝΌΜΟΙς</span></span></span>, the reference is to the wives; if <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΣΥΓΚΛΗΡΟΝΌΜΟΙ</span></span></span>, to the husbands (in opposition to Pott, who somewhat singularly interprets as equal to <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΕἸΣΙ ΓᾺΡ ΣΥΓΚΛΗΡΟΝΌΜΟΙ</span></span></span>, <span class="ital">sc</span>. <span class="greekheb">αἱγυναῖκες</span>).

But since this last is really the point of importance, it can hardly be assumed that the apostle would only have hinted at it—without openly giving expression to it.[178]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑῚ ΣΥΓΚΛΗΡΟΝΌΜΟΙς</span></span></span>] de Wette-Brückner explain: “as (those who) also (like yourselves) (are) fellow-heirs (<span class="ital">one with another</span>).” The reference here attributed to <span class="greekheb">συν</span>—simply on account of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑΊ</span></span></span>—is inappropriate, since it is a thought entirely foreign to the context, that the wives are heirs <span class="ital">with each other</span>. If the reading <span class="greekheb">συγκληρονόμοις</span> be adopted, <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΣΥΝ</span></span></span> applies to the husbands, equivalent to “<span class="ital">with you</span>;” <span class="greekheb">καί</span> may stand with reference to the foregoing <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΣΘΕΝΕΣΤΈΡῼ</span></span></span>, adding a second particular to it (Schott); or it may also serve simply to intensify <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΣΥΝ</span></span></span>, since, strictly speaking, it is redundant.[179] If, however, <span class="greekheb">συγκληρονόμοι</span> be read, <span class="greekheb">καί</span> is to be taken in the latter way, and is not to be explained thus: “by <span class="greekheb">ἀπονέμοντες</span> something further is enjoined, which goes beyond the … <span class="greekheb">κατὰ γνῶσιν</span>” (Hofmann); for <span class="greekheb">συνοικοῦντες κατὰ γνῶσιν</span> stands imperatively, whilst <span class="greekheb">συγκληρονόμοι</span> does not say what the husbands should be, but what they are. With the idea <span class="greekheb">κληρονόμοι</span>, cf. chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-4.htm" title="To an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fades not away, reserved in heaven for you,">1 Peter 1:4</a>; the expression <span class="greekheb">συγκληρ</span>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-17.htm" title="And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.">Romans 8:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-6.htm" title="That the Gentiles should be fellow heirs, and of the same body, and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel:">Ephesians 3:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-9.htm" title="By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise:">Hebrews 11:9</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">χάριτος ζωῆς</span>] <span class="greekheb">ζωῆς</span> states in what the <span class="greekheb">χάρις</span>, of which they are and will be <span class="greekheb">κληρονόμοι</span>, consists. It is erroneous to resolve the expression into <span class="greekheb">χάρις ζῶσα</span> (Erasmus) or <span class="greekheb">χάρις ζωοποιοῦσα</span> (Grotius). Hofmann, assuming <span class="greekheb">συγκληρονόμοι ποικίλης χάριτος ζωῆς</span> to be the true reading, gives an interpretation different from the above: “as such who, with their wives, share a life of manifold grace, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> of those divine favours which are experienced in common in every marriage by believers and unbelievers.” In this way, however, justice is done to neither of the ideas, nor is it pointed out what the favours in married life referred to are.[180]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">εἰς τὸ μὴ ἐγκόπτεσθαι</span>, (<span class="ital">Rec.</span> <span class="greekheb">ἐκκόπτεσθαι</span>) <span class="greekheb">τὰς προσευχὰς ὑμῶν</span>] <span class="greekheb">ἐγκόπτειν</span>, strictly, incidere, then intercidere, from which arises the further meaning impedire (Hes. <span class="greekheb">ἐμποδίζειν</span>, <span class="greekheb">διακωλύειν</span>); <span class="greekheb">ἐκκόπτειν</span>, pr. excidere, whence stirpitus delere; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-10.htm" title="He has destroyed me on every side, and I am gone: and my hope has he removed like a tree.">Job 19:10</a>, LXX.: <span class="greekheb">ἐξέκοψε δὲ ὥσπερ δένδρον τὴν ἐλπίδα μου</span>; the idea of the latter word is stronger than that of the former, but the thought in both readings remains substantially the same, since both expressions denote the ceasing of prayer. Wiesinger incorrectly understands the meaning of the term <span class="greekheb">ἐγκόπτ</span>. to be: “prayer in the meantime there still is, but the way is closed to it.” In like manner de Wette, following Bretschneider: ne viam praecludatis precibus vestris, remarks: “Prayer is by sin <span class="ital">hindered</span> from mounting up to the throne of God;” and such is in substance Hofmann’s view.[181] This idea would, however, have been more definitely expressed. The apostle does not say that the <span class="ital">power</span> and the <span class="ital">hearing</span> of prayer are hindered, but that the prayer itself is (this also in opposition to Reiche). In harmony with the connection of this last clause, by <span class="greekheb">τὰς προσευχὰς ὑμῶν</span> is to be understood either the joint prayer of married persons (Weiss, p. 352),[182] or the prayers which those here addressed offer up, as the husbands of their wives (or, further, as heads of households). Depreciation of the wife, in spite of union with respect to the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΛΗΡΟΝΟΜΊΑ</span></span></span>, necessarily excludes prayer from married life.[183] Schott: “Where the husband does not recognise that the union of natural life in marriage is also union in the state of grace, there can naturally be no expression of the spiritual and Christian fellowship of marriage, no prayer in common.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[176] Oecumenius understands this exhortation in connection with ver. 6 as having a special application to the household: <span class="greekheb">οἱ ἄνδρες</span> … <span class="greekheb">συνοικῦντες</span>· <span class="greekheb">τουτέστιν</span>: <span class="greekheb">αἴσθησιν λαμβάνοντες τῆς τοῦ θήλεος κουφότητος καὶ τοῦ εὐπαραφόρου ἐν πᾶσι</span>, <span class="greekheb">καὶ εἰς μικροψυχίαν εὐολίσθου</span>, <span class="greekheb">μακρόθυμοι γίνεσθε πρὸς αὐτὰς</span>, <span class="greekheb">μὴ λόγον ἀπαιτοῦντες πικρῶς τῶν κατὰ τὴν οἰκίαν αὐτῶν εἰς ταμιείαν παρακατεθέτων</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[177] Schott arbitrarily asserts that the creature is here termed <span class="greekheb">σκεῦος</span>, “as a <span class="ital">vessel</span> which is destined to <span class="ital">receive into itself</span>, as its real contents, the realization of the divine will.” Even though a vessel containing something can be termed a <span class="greekheb">σκεῦος</span>, it does not follow that <span class="greekheb">σκεῦος</span> must be understood as meaning this and nothing else.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[178] In the 2d edition of this Commentary it was said: “Why should not the apostle base his exhortation to the men to honour their wives, by reminding them (the men) that they are called to inherit the <span class="greekheb">χάρις ζωῆς</span> along with their wives?” Reiche says: scilicet quia <span class="ital">absurdum</span>(!) esset, sic argumentari; Brückner maintains that meaning to be “altogether inappropriate and foreign to the purpose of the address.” These assertions, however, can by no means be accepted, since the consciousness of being a fellow-heir of salvation with any one may very well lead to a recognition of the <span class="greekheb">τιμή</span> which he possesses. Nor is there anything improbable in the circumstance itself, that the apostle, whilst basing the exhortation: <span class="greekheb">συνοικεῖν κατὰ γνῶσιν</span>, on the position of the women, should ground the <span class="greekheb">ἀπονέμειν τιμήν</span> on the position of the men.—Schott passes too lightly over the whole question.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[179] On the redundance of <span class="greekheb">καί</span> in comparisons, see Winer, p. 390 [E. T. 548]; but this use of it cannot be appealed to, since <span class="greekheb">ὡς</span> here is not a comparative particle. Wiesinger thinks that <span class="greekheb">συν</span> perhaps contains the reference to a community to which man and wife equally belong; but what this was, would have been indicated by the context, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-6.htm" title="That the Gentiles should be fellow heirs, and of the same body, and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel:">Ephesians 3:6</a>; such, however, is not the case here. To the expression “strictly” Reiche adds a?, without ever thinking that, since the same idea is expressed by <span class="greekheb">καί</span> and <span class="greekheb">συν</span>, one of the two must be redundant, and that “strictly” is only meant to show that <span class="greekheb">καί</span> is in so far not purely redundant, that it serves to strengthen the idea expressed by <span class="greekheb">συν</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[180] There is no warrant for the opinion that the apostle’s exhortation must apply also to such husbands as have unbelieving wives, since a case so special might well have been passed over. If the apostle had wished to make reference to this, he would in some way have alluded to it; cf. ver. 1 ff.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[181] In this interpretation the reference to the coming of prayer <span class="ital">to God</span> is a simple importation. Hofmann adds to the interpretation, that “the sighs of the wife bar the road to the husband’s prayers, by accusing him to God before his prayer, thus rendered worthless, reaches Him.” But this is a thought altogether foreign to the context.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[182] Although in ver. 7 it is the husbands who are addressed, still, as the verse treats of their behaviour towards their wives, <span class="greekheb">ὑμῶν</span> can well apply to both.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[183] Hieronymus, Oecumenius, etc., apply the words according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-3.htm" title="Let the husband render to the wife due benevolence: and likewise also the wife to the husband.">1 Corinthians 7:3</a>, ad honorem impertiendum uxoribus a viris, qui sit abstinentia a congressu, ut orationi vacare possint (Lorinus), which is connected with the false interpretation of <span class="greekheb">συνοικοῦντες</span>; Nicol. de Lyra says more correctly: cum vir et uxor non sunt bene Concordes, minus possunt orationi vacare.

Behold, as the clay is in the potter's hand, so are you in my hand, O house of Israel.">Jeremiah 18:6</a>). In Sap. 15:7, there is an elaborate description of the maker of clay images, in which <span class="greekheb">σκεῦος</span> replaces <span class="greekheb">πλάσμα</span> and <span class="ital">vessels which serve clean uses</span> are distinguished from <span class="ital">the contrary sort</span>. Thence St. Paul adopts the figure and employs it to illustrate the absolute sovereignty of the Creator, as Isaiah had done (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-21.htm" title="Has not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel to honor, and another to dishonor?">Romans 9:21</a>), distinguishing <span class="ital">vessels intended for honour</span> from those <span class="ital">intended for dishonour</span>. Lastly <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-20.htm" title="But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honor, and some to dishonor.">2 Timothy 2:20</a> exemplifies the particular application of the figure, on which Peter’s use of <span class="greekheb">σκεῦος</span> rests—<span class="greekheb">ἐν μεγάλῃ δὲ οἰκίᾳ</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-5.htm" title="You also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.">1 Peter 2:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-17.htm" title="For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God?">1 Peter 4:17</a>) … <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. The comparative <span class="greekheb">ἀσθενεστέρῳ</span> proves that both husband and wife are <span class="ital">vessels</span> and assists to exclude the notion that St. Paul could mean to call a wife the vessel of her husband in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-4.htm" title="That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honor;">1 Thessalonians 4:4</a>.—<span class="greekheb">ὡς</span> … <span class="greekheb">ζωῆς</span>, <span class="ital">inasmuch as they are also heirs with you of the grace</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-10.htm" title="Of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come to you:">1 Peter 1:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-13.htm" title="Why gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ;">1 Peter 1:13</a>) <span class="ital">of life</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-24.htm" title="Who his own self bore our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live to righteousness: by whose stripes you were healed.">1 Peter 2:24</a>): the heavenly inheritance is not distributed according to earthly custom, which gave the wife no rights of her own.—<span class="greekheb">εἰς</span> … <span class="greekheb">ὑμῶν</span>.

In the then existing state of society this was, of course, natural enough. The wife might be converted without the husband, but hardly the husband without the wife. The word for “dwell together” (not found elsewhere) is clearly intended to cover all the relations of married life. In those relations men were to act “according to knowledge,” i.e. with a clear perception of all that marriage involved, and of the right relation in which each of the two parties to the contract stood to the other. The wife was not to be treated as a slave or a concubine, nor again as the ruler and mistress of the house, but as a helpmeet in the daily work of life, a sharer in its higher hopes and duties, the mother of children to be brought up “in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">giving honour unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel</span>] The word for “giving,” not found elsewhere in the New Testament, implies an equitable apportionment, that for “wife” is strictly an adjective agreeing with “vessel,” and would therefore be rightly rendered by <span class="bld">female</span>. In the term “vessel,” which finds a parallel in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-4.htm" title="That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honor;">1 Thessalonians 4:4</a>, we have the thought that all, men and women alike, are “instruments” which God has made for His service (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_timothy/2-20.htm" title="But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honor, and some to dishonor....">2 Timothy 2:20-21</a>). The husband is bound to think of himself in that light. He must recognise himself as the stronger vessel of the two, and therefore, because <span class="ital">noblesse oblige</span>, he must render due honour to the weaker, seeking to strengthen and purify and elevate it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">as being heirs together of the grace of life</span>] The MSS. present various readings, some making the word “heirs” refer to the husbands and some to the wives. As, in either case, stress is laid on their being joint heirs, there is practically no difference. The “life” in which both are thus called to be sharers is, of course, none other than the eternal life which consists in knowing God. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-3.htm" title="And this is life eternal, that they might know you the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.">John 17:3</a>.)<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">that your prayers be not hindered</span>] Some MSS. give a stronger form of the verb, “that your prayers be not <span class="bld">cut off</span> (or, <span class="bld">stopped</span>).” The more natural interpretation is that which refers the pronoun to both the husband and the wife. Where there was no reciprocated respect, each recognising the high vocation of the other, there could be no union of heart and soul in prayer. Where the husband thought of the wife only as ministering to his comfort or his pleasures, as one whom he might, as both Jewish and Roman law permitted, repudiate at will, there could be no recognition of the fact that she shared his highest hopes. The words clearly include, though they do not dwell on them, the special hindrances to prayer referred to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/7-3.htm" title="Let the husband render to the wife due benevolence: and likewise also the wife to the husband....">1 Corinthians 7:3-5</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/1_peter/3.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-7.htm" title="Likewise, you husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge, giving honor to the wife, as to the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life; that your prayers be not hindered.">1 Peter 3:7</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ὁμοίως</span>, <span class="ital">in like manner</span>) The <span class="ital">likeness</span> does not refer to special duties, some of which belong to the wife, and others to the husband; but to the foundation of love: thus, <span class="ital">in like manner</span>, ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-5.htm" title="Likewise, you younger, submit yourselves to the elder.

The reason why the husband ought to show <span class="ital">moderation</span> towards the wife, is derived from <span class="ital">the weakness of the wife</span>; the reason why the husband ought to give <span class="ital">honour</span> to the wife, is derived from the fact, that God also gives <span class="ital">honour</span> to the man, as to an heir.

This therefore is the better reading. For the apostle wishes that the prayers of husbands should not even be hindered or interrupted.

As wives are exhorted to be in subjection to their own husbands, so husbands also must do their duty to their wives. The construction (participial as in ver. 1) seems, like ver. 1, to look back to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-13.htm">1 Peter 2:13</a>. The relation, indeed, is no longer directly one of subjection, and marriage is an ordinance of God; but Christian husbands must submit themselves to the duties arising out of the marriage tie; and marriage involves a civil contract, though to us Christians it is a holy estate instituted of God, and a parable of the mystical union that is betwixt Christ and his Church. St. Peter, we observe, does not consider the case of a Christian husband with an unbelieving wife; probably that would be very uncommon. <span class="cmt_word">Dwell with them according to knowledge, giving honor unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel</span>; literally, <span class="accented">living together with the feminine as with the weaker vessel.</span> This connection seems best suited to the balance of the sentence, and also to the sense. The apostle bids the husband, first, to give due consideration to his partner on the ground of her comparative weakness; and, secondly, to give her due honor as being an heir, like himself, of the grace of life. The disparity of the sexes was the cause of the degradation of woman among the heathen; Christianity makes it the ground of tender consideration. Christian love should abound in knowledge (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-9.htm">Philippians 1:9</a>); it should throw its softening light upon all the relations of life. Man and woman are alike vessels - vessels made by God for his service (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/64-8.htm">Isaiah 64:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-6.htm">Jeremiah 18:6</a>, etc.; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-4.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:4, 5</a>); the woman is the weaker, and must, for that very reason, be treated with gentleness. For "according to knowledge," comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-5.htm">2 Peter 1:5</a>. Christians must be thoughtful; they must consider what becomes them in all the relations of life; not act carelessly and at random. <span class="cmt_word">And as being heirs together of the grace of life</span>; rather, <span class="accented">rendering honor as to those who are also fellow-heirs</span>, or, according to another well-supported reading, <span class="accented">rendering honor</span> (<span class="accented">to them</span>) <span class="accented">as being also fellow-heirs</span> (<span class="accented">with them</span>). The sense is not materially affected: husband and wife are joint-heirs of the grace of life, that is, of God's gracious gift of everlasting life. <span class="cmt_word">That your prayers be not hindered</span>; or, according to another reading, <span class="accented">be not cut</span> off. If husband and wife live together without mutual reverence and affection, there can be no sympathy in united prayer; the promise made by Christ in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-19.htm">Matthew 18:19</a> cannot be realized. Nor can either pray acceptably if they live at variance; jealousies and bickerings are opposed to the spirit of prayer; they hinder the free flow of prayer, and mar its earnestness and devotion. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/1_peter/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>According to knowledge<p>With an intelligent recognition of the nature of the marriage relation.<p>The woman (&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#837;)<p>Not a noun, however, as would appear from the ordinary rendering, but an adjective, agreeing with &#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;, vessel, as does also &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#837;, weaker. Both are attributes of vessel; the female vessel as weaker. So Rev., in margin.<p>Vessel (&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;)<p>Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-4.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:4</a>. The primary idea of vessel, which is formed from the Latin  vasellum, the diminutive of vas, a vase, is that of the receptacle which covers and contains; the case or protecting cover. Hence it is allied, etymologically, with vest, vestment, and wear. It is used in the New Testament (1) in the sense of a cup or dish (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-16.htm">Luke 8:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-29.htm">John 19:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-20.htm">2 Timothy 2:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-27.htm">Revelation 2:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/18-12.htm">Revelation 18:12</a>). (2) Of the man, as containing the divine energy, or as a subject of divine mercy or wrath, and hence becoming a divine instrument. Thus Paul is a chosen vessel to bear God's name (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-15.htm">Acts 9:15</a>). Vessels of wrath (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-22.htm">Romans 9:22</a>); of mercy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-23.htm">Romans 9:23</a>). So of the woman, as God's instrument, along with man, for his service in the family and in society. (3) Collectively, in the plural, of all the implements of any particular economy, as a house, or a ship. <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/12-29.htm">Matthew 12:29</a>, goods; <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/27-17.htm">Acts 27:17</a>, the tackling or gear of a ship.<p>Giving (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;)<p>Only here in New Testament. The word means, literally, to portion out, and is appropriate to the husband as controlling what is to be meted out to the wife.<p>Hindered (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;)<p>So A. V. and Rev., and the best texts, and the majority of commentators. The word means, literally, to knock in; make an incision into; and hence, generally, to hinder or thwart (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-7.htm">Galatians 5:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-18.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:18</a>). Some, however, read &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, to cut off or destroy. </body></html>
