The two last adjectives, however, lead gradually into the wider field of conduct, and probably now he is thinking solely of relation to the adverse world. Among the Christians surely there would be no “evil” or “railing” to <span class= "ital">provoke</span> a retort! “Evil,” in act; “railing,” in word. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-23.htm" title="Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed himself to him that judges righteously:">1Peter 2:23</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-17.htm" title="Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the sight of all men.">Romans 12:17</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">But contrariwise blessing.</span>—No doubt a reminiscence of the Sermon on the Mount (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-44.htm" title="But I say to you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which spitefully use you, and persecute you;">Matthew 5:44</a>). The word “blessing” here is not substantive, but a participle, opposed to “rendering:” “not rendering them evil or railing, but on the contrary blessing them.” Though the word is chosen as the exact opposite of the bad <span class= "ital">language</span> used against the Christians, “blessing” may perhaps involve the opposite of unkind <span class= "ital">action</span> as well. It is used for the conferring of <span class= "ital">benefits</span>: (1) spiritual, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-26.htm" title="To you first God, having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him to bless you, in turning away every one of you from his iniquities.">Acts 3:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-8.htm" title="And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel to Abraham, saying, In you shall all nations be blessed.">Galatians 3:8</a>; (2) material, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-5.htm" title="Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brothers, that they would go before to you, and make up beforehand your bounty, whereof you had notice before, that the same might be ready, as a matter of bounty, and not as of covetousness.">2Corinthians 9:5</a>, (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/5-15.htm" title="And he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and came, and stood before him: and he said, Behold, now I know that there is no God in all the earth, but in Israel: now therefore, I pray you, take a blessing of your servant.">2Kings 5:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-14.htm" title="Who knows if he will return and repent, and leave a blessing behind him; even a meat offering and a drink offering to the LORD your God?">Joel 2:14</a> : <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/2-19.htm" title="Is the seed yet in the barn? yes, as yet the vine, and the fig tree, and the pomegranate, and the olive tree, has not brought forth: from this day will I bless you.">Haggai 2:19</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Knowing that ye are hereunto called.</span>—Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-21.htm" title="For even hereunto were you called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that you should follow his steps:">1Peter 2:21</a>. It should be, <span class= "ital">were called, </span>viz., when St. Paul and others first preached to you. What, then, does he mean that they were called to? to the foregoing, or to the following? to blessing instead of rendering evil and railing? or to receive a blessing? The comparison of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-21.htm" title="For even hereunto were you called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that you should follow his steps:">1Peter 2:21</a> seems to support the former, for there the “hereunto” points to what preceded. The argument will then be precisely the same as in that passage: “You ought not now to shrink from so hard a duty, for you were given clearly to understand, when you were admitted into Christianity, that you would have to act thus.”<p><span class= "bld">That ye should inherit a blessing.</span>—Rather, <span class= "ital">in</span> <span class= "ital">order that ye may inherit a blessing.</span> God had a purpose in calling them to so hard a task, and in now requiring of them the fulfilment of it; and that purpose is that they may receive a blessing. They must not think it an arbitrary hardship, or a restriction which will not in the end be found gainful to themselves. God’s full and eternal blessing is only to be obtained through such a course of self-suppression and of love even to those who hate us. The argument thus becomes more forcible, and the question which follows more appropriate, than if we adopt the other view, viz., “Bless, instead of retorting, for it is more suitable for men who are expecting to be blessed.”<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_peter/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:8-13 Though Christians cannot always be exactly of the same mind, yet they should have compassion one of another, and love as brethren. If any man desires to live comfortably on earth, or to possess eternal life in heaven, he must bridle his tongue from wicked, abusive, or deceitful words. He must forsake and keep far from evil actions, do all the good he can, and seek peace with all men. For God, all-wise and every where present, watches over the righteous, and takes care of them.

The hope of eternal life should make your minds calm; and the prospect that you are to be so exalted in heaven should fill your hearts with benignity and love." There is nothing which is better suited to cause our hearts to overflow with benignity, to make us ready to forgive all others when they injure us, than the hope of salvation. Cherishing such a hope ourselves, we cannot but wish that all others may share it, and this will lead us to wish for them every blessing, A man who has a hope of heaven should abound in every virtue. and show that he is a sincere well-wisher of the race. Why should one who expects soon to be in heaven harbor malice in his bosom? Why should he wish to injure a fellow-worm?

Vindictiveness, in any form, whether in word or act, is at variance with the conditions on which that inheritance is offered and involves therefore its certain forfeiture.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/1_peter/3.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-9.htm" title="Not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing: but contrariwise blessing; knowing that you are thereunto called, that you should inherit a blessing.">1 Peter 3:9</a>. <span class="greekheb">Κακὸν</span>, <span class="ital">evil</span>) in deed.—<span class="greekheb">λοιδορίαν</span>, <span class="ital">railing</span>) in words.—<span class="greekheb">τοὐναντίον</span>, <span class="ital">on the contrary</span>) This has reference to <span class="ital">railing</span>.

St. Peter. like St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-17.htm">Romans 12:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-15.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:15</a>), repeats his Master's teaching in the sermon on the mount (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-39.htm">Matthew 5:39</a>). He forbids revenge in word, as well as in deed. <span class="cmt_word">But contrariwise blessing</span>. The word "blessing" is not the substantive, but the participle (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>), and thus corresponds with the participle "rendering" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-44.htm">Matthew 5:44</a>, "Bless them that curse you"). <span class="cmt_word">Knowing</span> <span class="cmt_word">that ye are thereunto called;</span> rather<span class="cmt_word">,</span> as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">for hereunto were ye called.</span> The word "knowing" is omitted in the best manuscripts (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-21.htm">1 Peter 2:21</a>). Some commentators take these words with the preceding: "Ye were called to bless others, that so ye may inherit a blessing." But, on the whole, it seems better to connect them with the following clause: <span class="cmt_word">That ye should inherit a blessing.</span> Christians bless others, not in order that they should inherit a blessing, but because it is God's will and their duty; and that duty follows from the fact that God has made them inheritors of his blessing. "Benedictionem aeternam," says Bengel, "cujus primitias jam nunc pit habent." God has blessed them; therefore they must bless others. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/1_peter/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Rendering evil, etc<p>See <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-17.htm">Romans 12:17</a>.<p>Blessing (&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;)<p>Not a noun governed by rendering, but a participle.
