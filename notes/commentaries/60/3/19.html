But as that former rendering is untenable, we must here keep strictly to <span class= "ital">in which</span>—<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>in spirit. This might mean either of two things: (1) “spiritually speaking,” “so far as thought and sympathy goes,” as, for instance, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-3.htm" title="For I truly, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already, as though I were present, concerning him that has so done this deed,">1Corinthians 5:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-5.htm" title=" For though I be absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit, rejoicing and beholding your order, and the steadfastness of your faith in Christ.">Colossians 2:5</a>; or else (2) “in spirit,” as opposed to “in the body”—<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>“out of the body” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-2.htm" title="I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knows;) such an one caught up to the third heaven.">2Corinthians 12:2</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-10.htm" title="I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet,">Revelation 1:10</a>), as a disembodied spirit. We adopt the latter rendering without hesitation, for reasons which will be clearer in the next Note.<p><span class= "bld">He went and preached unto the spirits in prison.</span>—There are two main ways of interpreting this mysterious passage. (1) The spirits are understood as being <span class= "ital">now</span> in prison, in consequence of having rejected His preaching to them while they were still on earth. According to this interpretation—which has the support of such names as Pearson, Hammond, Barrow, and Leighton (though he afterwards modified his opinion). among ourselves, besides divers great theologians of other countries, including St. Thomas Aquinas on the one hand and Beza on the other—it was “in spirit,” <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>mystically speaking, our Lord Himself who, in and through the person of Noah, preached repentance to the old world. Thus the passage is altogether dissociated from the doctrine of the descent into hell; and the sense (though not the Greek) would be better expressed by writing, <span class= "ital">He had gone and preached unto the spirits</span> (<span class= "ital">now</span>)<span class= "ital"> in prison.</span> In this case, however, it is difficult to see the purpose of the digression, or what could have brought the subject into St. Peter’s mind. (2) The second interpretation—which is that of (practically) all the Fathers, and of Calvin, Luther (finally), Bellarmine, Bengel, and of most modern scholars—refers the passage to what our Lord did while His body was dead. This is the most natural construction to put upon the words “in which also” (<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>in spirit). It thus gives point to the saying that He was “quickened in spirit,” which would otherwise be left very meaningless. The “spirits” here will thus correspond with “in spirit” there. It is the only way to assign any intelligible meaning to the words “He went and” to suppose that He “went” straight from His quickening in spirit—<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>from His death. It is far the most natural thing to suppose that the spirits <span class= "ital">were</span> in prison at the time when Christ went and preached to them. We take it, then, to mean that, directly Christ’s human spirit was disengaged from the body, He gave proof of the new powers of purely spiritual action thus acquired by going off to the place, or state, in which other disembodied spirits were (who would have been incapable of receiving direct impressions from Him had He not Himself been in the purely spiritual condition), and conveyed to them certain tidings: He “preached” unto them. What was the substance of this preaching we are not here told, the word itself (which is not the same as, <span class= "ital">e.g., </span>in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-25.htm" title="But the word of the Lord endures for ever. And this is the word which by the gospel is preached to you.">1Peter 1:25</a>) only means to publish or proclaim like a crier or herald; and as the spirits are said to have been disobedient and in prison, some have thought that Christ went to proclaim to them the certainty of their damnation! The notion has but to be mentioned to be rejected with horror; but it may be pointed out also that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-6.htm" title="For for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.">1Peter 4:6</a>, which refers back to this passage, it is distinctly called a “gospel;” and it would be too grim to call that a gospel which (in Calvin’s words) “made it more clear and patent to them that they were shut out from all salvation!” He brought <span class= "ital">good</span> tidings, therefore, of some kind to the “prison” and the spirits in it. And this “prison” must not be understood (with Bp. Browne, <span class= "ital">Articles, </span>p. 95) as merely “a place of safe keeping,” where good spirits might be as well as bad, though etymologically this is imaginable. The word occurs thirty-eight times in the New Testament in the undoubted sense of a “prison,” and not once in that of a place of protection, though twice (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/18-2.htm" title="And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird.">Revelation 18:2</a>) it is used in the derived sense of “a cage.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_peter/3.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_peter/3-19.htm" title="By which also he went and preached to the spirits in prison;...">1 Peter 3:19-20</a></span>. <span class="ital">By which also </span>— That is, by which Spirit; <span class="ital">he went and preached </span>— <span class="greekheb">Πορευθεις εκηρυξεν</span>, <span class="ital">having gone, he preached, </span>namely, in and by Noah, who spake by the Spirit of Christ, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-11.htm" title="Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow.">1 Peter 1:11</a>,) and of the Father, who said, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-3.htm" title="And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.">Genesis 6:3</a>,) referring to the men of that generation, <span class="ital">My Spirit shall not always strive with man. </span>Hence Noah is called <span class="ital">a preacher of righteousness: </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-5.htm" title="And spared not the old world, but saved Noah the eighth person, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood on the world of the ungodly;">2 Peter 2:5</a>. “By attributing the preaching of the ancient prophets to Christ, the apostle hath taught us, that from the beginning the economy of man’s redemption has been under the direction of Christ. <span class="ital">To the spirits in prison </span>— That is, which were in prison when St. Peter wrote this epistle.

These things teach us, that we should not think the worse of the gospel, because it hath been rejected by many; nor of ourselves, because we are persecuted by the wicked.

What was the ground and reason of their hope? We should be able to defend our religion with meekness, in the fear of God. There is no room for any other fears where this great fear is; it disturbs not. The conscience is good, when it does its office well. That person is in a sad condition on whom sin and suffering meet: sin makes suffering extreme, comfortless, and destructive. Surely it is better to suffer for well-doing than for evil-doing, whatever our natural impatience at times may suggest. The example of Christ is an argument for patience under sufferings. In the case of our Lord's suffering, he that knew no sin, suffered instead of those who knew no righteousness. The blessed end and design of our Lord's sufferings were, to reconcile us to God, and to bring us to eternal glory. He was put to death in respect of his human nature, but was quickened and raised by the power of the Holy Spirit. If Christ could not be freed from sufferings, why should Christians think to be so? God takes exact notice of the means and advantages people in all ages have had. As to the old world, Christ sent his Spirit; gave warning by Noah. But though the patience of God waits long, it will cease at last. And the spirits of disobedient sinners, as soon as they are out of their bodies, are committed to the prison of hell, where those that despised Noah's warning now are, and from whence there is no redemption. Noah's salvation in the ark upon the water, which carried him above the floods, set forth the salvation of all true believers. That temporal salvation by the ark was a type of the eternal salvation of believers by baptism of the Holy Spirit. To prevent mistakes, the apostle declares what he means by saving baptism; not the outward ceremony of washing with water, which, in itself, does no more than put away the filth of the flesh, but that baptism, of which the baptismal water formed the sign. Not the outward ordinance, but when a man, by the regeneration of the Spirit, was enabled to repent and profess faith, and purpose a new life, uprightly, and as in the presence of God. Let us beware that we rest not upon outward forms. Let us learn to look on the ordinances of God spiritually, and to inquire after the spiritual effect and working of them on our consciences. We would willingly have all religion reduced to outward things. But many who were baptized, and constantly attended the ordinances, have remained without Christ, died in their sins, and are now past recovery. Rest not then till thou art cleansed by the Spirit of Christ and the blood of Christ. His resurrection from the dead is that whereby we are assured of purifying and peace.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_peter/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>By which - Evidently by the Spirit referred to in the previous verse - &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c9;&#788;&#834;&#837;  en ho&#772; - the divine nature of the Son of God; that by which he was "quickened" again, after he had been put to death; the Son of God regarded as a Divine Being, or in that same nature which afterward became incarnate, and whose agency was employed in quickening the man Christ Jesus, who had been put to death. The meaning is, that the same "Spirit" which was efficacious in restoring him to life, after he was put to death, was that by which he preached to the spirits in prison.<p>He went - To wit, in the days of Noah. No particular stress should be laid here on the phrase "he went." The literal sense is, "he, having gone, preached," etc. &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#768;&#x3c2;  poreutheis. It is well known that such expressions are often redundant in Greek writers, as in others. So Herodotus, "to these things they spake, saying" - for they said. "And he, speaking, said;" that is, he said. So <a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-17.htm">Ephesians 2:17</a>, "And came and preached peace," etc. <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/9-13.htm">Matthew 9:13</a>, "but go and learn what that meaneth," etc. So God is often represented as coming, as descending, etc., when he brings a message to mankind. Thus, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/11-5.htm">Genesis 11:5</a>, "The Lord came down to see the city and the tower." <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-20.htm">Exodus 19:20</a>, "the Lord came down upon Mount Sinai." <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/11-25.htm">Numbers 11:25</a>, "the Lord came down in a cloud." <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-10.htm">2 Samuel 22:10</a>, "he bowed the heavens and came down." The idea, however, would be conveyed by this language that he did this personally, or by himself, and not merely by employing the agency of another. It would then be implied here, that though the instrumentality of Noah was employed, yet that it was done not by the Holy Spirit, but by him who afterward became incarnate. On the supposition, therefore, that this whole passage refers to his preaching to the antediluvians in the time of Noah, and not to the "spirits" after they were confined in prison, this is language which the apostle would have properly and probably used. If that supposition meets the full force of the language, then no argument can be based on it in proof that he went to preach to them after their death, and while his body was lying in the grave.<p>And preached - The word used here (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;  eke&#772;ruxen) is of a general character, meaning to make a proclamation of any kind, as a crier does, or to deliver a message, and does not necessarily imply that it was the gospel which was preached, nor does it determine anything in regard to the nature of the message. It is not affirmed that he preached the gospel, for if that specific idea had been expressed it would have been rather by another word - &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;  euangelizo&#772;. The word used here would be appropriate to such a message as Noah brought to his contemporaries, or to any communication which God made to people. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-1.htm">Matthew 3:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-17.htm">Matthew 4:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/1-35.htm">Mark 1:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/5-20.htm">Mark 5:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/7-36.htm">Mark 7:36</a>. It is implied in the expression, as already remarked, that he did this himself; that it was the Son of God who subsequently became incarnate, and not the Holy Spirit, that did this; though the language is consistent with the supposition that he did it by the instrumentality of another, to wit, Noah. "Qui facit per alium, facit per se." God really proclaims a message to mankind when he does it by the instrumentality of the prophets, or apostles, or other ministers of religion; and all that is necessarily implied in this language would be met by the supposition that Christ delivered a message to the antediluvian race by the agency of Noah. No argument, therefore, can be derived from this language to prove that Christ went and personally preached to those who were confined in hades or in prison.<p>Unto the spirits in prison - That is, clearly, to the spirits now in prison, for this is the fair meaning of the passage. The obvious sense is, that Peter supposed there were "spirits in prison" at the time when he wrote, and that to those same spirits the Son of God had at some time "preached," or had made some proclamation respecting the will of God. Since this is the only passage in the New Testament upon which the Roman Catholic doctrine of purgatory is supposed to rest, it is important to ascertain the fair meaning of the language here employed. There are three obvious inquiries in ascertaining its signification. Who are referred to by "spirits?" What is meant by "in prison?" Was the message brought to them while in the prison, or at some previous period?<p>I. Who are referred to by spirits? The specification in the next verse determines this. They were those "who were sometimes disobedient, when once the long-suffering of God waited in the days of Noah." No others are specified; and if it should be maintained that this means that he went down to hell (Hades), or to Sheol, and preached to those who are confined there, it could be inferred from this passage only that he preached to that portion of the lost spirits confined there which belonged to the particular generation in which Noah lived. Why he should do this; or how there should be such a separation made in hades that it could be done; or what was the nature of the message which he delivered to that portion, are questions which it is impossible for any man who bolds to the opinion that Christ went down to hell after his death to preach, to answer. But if it means that he preached to those who lived in the days of Noah, while they were yet alive, the question will be asked why are they called "spirits?"<p>Were they spirits then, or were they people like others? To this the answer is easy. Peter speaks of them as they were when he wrote; not as they had been, or were at the time when the message was preached to them. The idea is, that to those spirits who were then in prison who had formerly lived in the days of Noah, the message had been in fact delivered. It was not necessary to speak of them precisely as they were at the time when it was delivered, but only in such a way as to identify them. We should use similar language now. If we saw a company of men in prison who had seen better days - a multitude now drunken, and debased, and poor, and riotous - it would not be improper to say that "the prospect of wealth and honor was once held out to this ragged and wretched multitude. All that is needful is to identify them as the same persons who once had this prospect. In regard to the inquiry, then, who these "spirits" were, there can be no difference of opinion. They were that wicked race which lived in the days of Noah. There is no allusion in this passage to any other; there is no intimation that to any others of those "in prison" the message here referred to had been delivered.<p>II. What is meant by prison here? Purgatory, or the limbus patrum, say the Romanists - a place in which departed souls are supposed to be confined, and in which their final destiny may still be effected by the purifying fires which they endure, by the prayers of the living, or by a message in some way conveyed to their gloomy abodes - in which such sins may be expiated as do not deserve eternal damnation. The Syriac here is "in Sheol," referring to the abodes of the dead, or the place in which departed spirits are supposed to dwell. The word rendered "prison," (&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#834;&#837;  phulake&#772;,) means properly "watch, guard" - the act of keeping watch, or the guard itself; then watchpost, or station; then a place where anyone is watched or guarded, as a prison; then a watch in the sense of a division of the night, as the morning watch. It is used in the New Testament, with reference to the future world, only in the following places: <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-19.htm">1 Peter 3:19</a>, "Preached unto the spirits in prison;" and <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/20-7.htm">Revelation 20:7</a>, "Satan shall be loosed put of his prison."<p>An idea similar to the one here expressed may be found in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-4.htm">2 Peter 2:4</a>, though the word prison does not there occur: "God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment;" and in Jde 1:6, "And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains, under darkness, unto the judgment of the great day." The allusion, in the passage before us, is undoubtedly to confinement or imprisonment in the invisible world; and perhaps to those who are reserved there with reference to some future arrangement - for this idea enters commonly into the use of the word prison. There is, however, no specification of the place where this is; no intimation that it is purgatory - a place where the departed are supposed to undergo purification; no intimation that their condition can be affected by anything that we can do; no intimation that those particularly referred to differ in any sense from the others who are confined in that world; no hint that they can be released by any prayers or sacrifices of ours. This passage, therefore, cannot be adduced to support the Roman Catholic doctrine of purgatory, because:<p>(1) the essential ideas which enter into the doctrine of purgatory are not to be found in the word used here;<p>(2) there is no evidence in the fair interpretation of the passage that any message is borne to them while in prison;<p>(3) there is not the slightest hint that they can be released by any prayers or offerings of those who dwell on the earth. The simple idea is that of persons confined as in a prison; and the passage will prove only that in the time when the apostle wrote there were those wire were thus confined.<p>III. Was the message brought to them while in prison, or at some previous period? The Romanists say that it was while in prison; that Christ, after he was put to death in the body, was still kept alive in his spirit, and went and proclaimed his gospel to those who were in prison. So Bloomfield maintains, (in loc.,) and so (Ecumenius and Cyril, as quoted by Bloomfield. But against this view there are plain objections drawn from the language of Peter himself:<p>(1) As we have seen, the fair interpretation of the passage "quickened by the Spirit," is not that he was kept alive as to his human soul, but that he, after being dead, was made alive by his own divine energy.<p>(2) if the meaning be that he went and preached after his death, it seems difficult to know why the reference is to those only who "had been disobedient in the days of Noah." Why were they alone selected for this message? Are they separate from others? Were they the only ones in purgatory who could be beneficially affected by his preaching? On the other method of interpretation, we can suggest a reason why they were particularly specified. But how can we on this?<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_peter/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18. Confirmation of 1Pe 3:17, by the glorious results of Christ's suffering innocently.<p>For&#8212;"Because." That is "better," 1Pe 3:17, means of which we are rendered more like to Christ in death and in life; for His death brought the best issue to Himself and to us [Bengel].<p>Christ&#8212;the Anointed Holy One of God; the Holy suffered for sins, the Just for the unjust.<p>also&#8212;as well as yourselves (1Pe 3:17).

It is "better" for us also once to suffer with Christ, than for ever without Christ We now are suffering our "once"; it will soon be a thing of the past; a bright consolation to the tried.<p>for sins&#8212;as though He had Himself committed them. He exposed Himself to death by His "confession," even as we are called on to "give an answer to him that asketh a reason of our hope." This was "well-doing" in its highest manifestation. As He suffered, "The Just," so we ought willingly to suffer, for righteousness' sake (1Pe 3:14; compare 1Pe 3:12, 17).<p>that he might bring us to God&#8212;together with Himself in His ascension to the right hand of God (1Pe 3:22). He brings us, "the unjust," justified together with Him into heaven. So the result of Christ's death is His drawing men to Him; spiritually now, in our having access into the Holiest, opened by Christ's ascension; literally hereafter. "Bring us," moreover, by the same steps of humiliation and exaltation through which He Himself passed. The several steps of Christ's progress from lowliness to glory are trodden over again by His people in virtue of their oneness with Him (1Pe 4:1-3). "To God," is Greek dative (not the preposition and case), implying that God wishes it [Bengel].<p>put to death&#8212;the means of His bringing us to God.<p>in the flesh&#8212;that is, in respect to the life of flesh and blood.<p>quickened by the Spirit&#8212;The oldest manuscripts omit the Greek article. Translate with the preposition "in," as the antithesis to the previous "in the flesh" requires, "IN spirit," that is, in respect to His Spirit. "Put to death" in the former mode of life; "quickened" in the other. Not that His Spirit ever died and was quickened, or made alive again, but whereas He had lived after the manner of mortal men in the flesh, He began to live a spiritual "resurrection" (1Pe 3:21) life, whereby He has the power to bring us to God. Two ways of explaining 1Pe 3:18, 19, are open to us: (1) "Quickened in Spirit," that is, immediately on His release from the "flesh," the energy of His undying spirit-life was "quickened" by God the Father, into new modes of action, namely, "in the Spirit He went down (as subsequently He went up to heaven, 1Pe 3:22, the same Greek verb) and heralded [not salvation, as Alford, contrary to Scripture, which everywhere represents man's state, whether saved or lost, after death irreversible. Nor is any mention made of the conversion of the spirits in prison. See on [2619]1Pe 3:20. Nor is the phrase here 'preached the Gospel' (evangelizo), but 'heralded' (ekeruxe) or 'preached'; but simply made the announcement of His finished work; so the same Greek in Mr 1:45, 'publish,' confirming Enoch and Noah's testimony, and thereby declaring the virtual condemnation of their unbelief, and the salvation of Noah and believers; a sample of the similar opposite effects of the same work on all unbelievers, and believers, respectively; also a consolation to those whom Peter addresses, in their sufferings at the hands of unbelievers; specially selected for the sake of 'baptism,' its 'antitype' (1Pe 3:21), which, as a seal, marks believers as separated from the rest of the doomed world] to the spirits (His Spirit speaking to the spirits) in prison (in Hades or Sheol, awaiting the judgment, 2Pe 2:4), which were of old disobedient when," &c. (2) The strongest point in favor of (1) is the position of "sometime," that is, of old, connected with "disobedient"; whereas if the preaching or announcing were a thing long past, we should expect "sometime," or of old, to be joined to "went and preached." But this transposition may express that their disobedience preceded His preaching. The Greek participle expresses the reason of His preaching, "inasmuch as they were sometime disobedient" (compare 1Pe 4:6). Also "went" seems to mean a personal going, as in 1Pe 3:22, not merely in spirit. But see the answer below. The objections are "quickened" must refer to Christ's body (compare 1Pe 3:21, end), for as His Spirit never ceased to live, it cannot be said to be "quickened." Compare Joh 5:21; Ro 8:11, and other passages, where "quicken" is used of the bodily resurrection. Also, not His Spirit, but His soul, went to Hades. His Spirit was commended by Him at death to His Father, and was thereupon "in Paradise." The theory&#8212;(1) would thus require that His descent to the spirits in prison should be after His resurrection! Compare Eph 4:9, 10, which makes the descent precede the ascent. Also Scripture elsewhere is silent about such a heralding, though possibly Christ's death had immediate effects on the state of both the godly and the ungodly in Hades: the souls of the godly heretofore in comparative confinement, perhaps then having been, as some Fathers thought, translated to God's immediate and heavenly presence; but this cannot be proved from Scripture. Compare however, Joh 3:13; Col 1:18. Prison is always used in a bad sense in Scripture. "Paradise" and "Abraham's bosom," the abode of good spirits in Old Testament times, are separated by a wide gulf from Hell or Hades, and cannot be called "prison." Compare 2Co 12:2, 4, where "paradise" and the "third heaven" correspond. Also, why should the antediluvian unbelievers in particular be selected as the objects of His preaching in Hades? Therefore explain: "Quickened in spirit, in which (as distinguished from in person; the words "in which," that is, in spirit, expressly obviating the objection that "went" implies a personal going) He went (in the person of Noah, "a preacher of righteousness," 2Pe 2:5: Alford's own Note, Eph 2:17, is the best reply to his argument from "went" that a local going to Hades in person is meant. As "He CAME and preached peace" by His Spirit in the apostles and ministers after His death and ascension: so before His incarnation He preached in Spirit through Noah to the antediluvians, Joh 14:18, 28; Ac 26:23. "Christ should show," literally, "announce light to the Gentiles") and preached unto the spirits in prison, that is, the antediluvians, whose bodies indeed seemed free, but their spirits were in prison, shut up in the earth as one great condemned cell (exactly parallel to Isa 24:22, 23 "upon the earth &#8230; they shall be gathered together as prisoners are gathered in the pit, and shall be shut up in the prison," &c. [just as the fallen angels are judicially regarded as "in chains of darkness," though for a time now at large on the earth, 1Pe 2:4], where 1Pe 3:18 has a plain allusion to the flood, "the windows from on high are open," compare Ge 7:11); from this prison the only way of escape was that preached by Christ in Noah. Christ, who in our times came in the flesh, in the days of Noah preached in Spirit by Noah to the spirits then in prison (Isa 61:1, end, "the Spirit of the Lord God hath sent me to proclaim the opening of the prison to them that are bound"). So in 1Pe 1:11, "the Spirit of Christ" is said to have testified in the prophets. As Christ suffered even to death by enemies, and was afterwards quickened in virtue of His "Spirit" (or divine nature, Ro 1:3, 4; 1Co 15:45), which henceforth acted in its full energy, the first result of which was the raising of His body (1Pe 3:21, end) from the prison of the grave and His soul from Hades; so the same Spirit of Christ enabled Noah, amidst reproach and trials, to preach to the disobedient spirits fast bound in wrath. That Spirit in you can enable you also to suffer patiently now, looking for the resurrection deliverance.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_peter/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">By which also; </span> by which Spirit, mentioned in the end of the former verse, i.e. by, or in, his Divine nature, the same by which he was quickened. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">He; </span> Christ.

Various are the senses given of this passage: some say, that Christ, upon his death, went in his human soul to hell; either, as some, to preach to the devils and damned spirits, that they might be saved, if they would; and, as others, to let them know that he was come, and to fill them with dread and terror; but though hell may be meant by the prison, yet the text does not say that he went unto it, or preached in it; only that the spirits were in it, to whom he sometimes went, and preached; nor is his human soul, but his divine nature meant, by the Spirit, by which he went and preached to them: and as for the ends proposed, the former is impracticable and impossible; for after death follows judgment, which is an eternal one; nor is there any salvation, or hope of salvation afterwards; and the latter is absurd, vain, and needless. Others, as the Papists, imagine the sense to be, that Christ, at his death, went in his human soul, into a place they call "Limbus Patrum", which they suppose is meant by the prison here, and delivered the souls of the Old Testament saints and patriarchs from thence, and carried them with him to heaven; but this sense is also false, because, as before observed, not the human soul of Christ, but his divine nature, is designed by the Spirit; nor is there any such place as here feigned, in which the souls of Old Testament saints were, before the death of Christ; for they were in peace and rest, in the kingdom of heaven, in Abraham's bosom, inheriting the promises, and not in a prison; besides, the text says not one word of the delivering of these spirits out of prison, only of Christ's preaching to them: add to all this, and which Beza, with others, observes, the apostle speaks of such as had been disobedient, and unbelievers; a character which will not agree with righteous men, and prophets, and patriarchs, under the former dispensation: others think the words are to be understood of Christ's going to preach, by his apostles, to the Gentiles, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-17.htm">Ephesians 2:17</a> who were in a most miserable condition, strangers to the covenants of promise, and destitute of the hope of salvation, and sat in darkness, and the shadow of death, and, as it were, at the gates of hell; were in the bonds of iniquity, and dead in sin, and had been for long time past foolish and disobedient, serving divers lusts and pleasures, to which they were in bondage. This is, indeed, a more tolerable sense than the former; but it will be difficult to show, that men, in the present state of life, are called "spirits", which seems to be a word that relates to the souls of men, in a separate state from their bodies; and especially that carnal and unconverted men are ever so called; and besides, the apostle is speaking of such who were disobedient in the times of Noah; and therefore not of the Gentiles, in the times of the apostles: add to which, that the transition from the times of the apostles, according to this sense, to the days of Noah, is very unaccountable; this sense does not agree with the connection of the words: others are of opinion, that this is meant of the souls of the Old Testament saints, who were , "in a watch", as they think the phrase may be rendered, instead of "in prison": and said to be in such a situation, because they were intent upon the hope of promised salvation, and were looking out for the Messiah, and anxiously desiring his coming, and which he, by some gracious manifestation, made known unto them: but though the word may sometimes signify a watch, yet more commonly a prison, and which sense best suits here; nor is that anxiety and uneasiness, which represents them as in a prison, so applicable to souls in a state of happiness; nor such a gracious manifestation so properly called preaching; and besides, not believers, but unbelievers, disobedient ones, are here spoken of; and though it is only said they were sometimes so, yet to what purpose should this former character be once mentioned of souls now in glory? but it would be tedious to reckon up the several different senses of this place; some referring it to such in Noah's time, to whom the Gospel was preached, and who repented; and though they suffered in their bodies, in the general deluge, yet their souls were saved; whereas the apostle calls them all, "the world of the ungodly", <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-5.htm">2 Peter 2:5</a> and others, to the eight souls that were shut up in the ark, as in a prison, and were saved; though these are manifestly distinguished in the text from the disobedient spirits. The plain and easy sense of the words is, that Christ, by his Spirit, by which he was quickened, went in the ministry of Noah, the preacher of righteousness, and preached both by words and deeds, by the personal ministry of Noah, and by the building of the ark, to that generation who was then in being; and who being disobedient, and continuing so, a flood was brought upon them which destroyed them all; and whose spirits, or separate souls, were then in the prison of hell, so the Syriac version renders it,  "in hell", see <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-7.htm">Revelation 20:7</a> when the Apostle Peter wrote this epistle; so that Christ neither went into this prison, nor preached in it, nor to spirits that were then in it when he preached, but to persons alive in the days of Noah, and who being disobedient, when they died, their separate souls were put into prison, and there they were when the apostle wrote: from whence we learn, that Christ was, that he existed in his divine nature before he was incarnate, he was before Abraham, he was in the days of Noah; and that Christ also, under the Old Testament, acted the part of a Mediator, in his divine nature, and by his Spirit discharged that branch of it, his prophetic office, before he appeared in human nature; and that the Gospel was preached in those early times, as unto Abraham, so before him. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_peter/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{22}</span> By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison;</span><p>(22) A secret objection: Christ indeed might do this, but what is that to us? Indeed (faith the apostle) for Christ has showed his power in all ages both in the preservation of the godly, were they never so few and miserable, and in avenging the rebellion of his enemies, as it appears by the history of the flood: for Christ is he who in those days (when God through his patience appointed a time of repentance to the world) was present, not in corporal presence, but by his divine power, preaching repentance, even by the mouth of Noah himself who then prepared the ark, to those disobedient spirits who are now in prison, waiting for the full recompence of their rebellion, and saved those few, (that is, only eight people) in the water.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/1_peter/3.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-19.htm" title="By which also he went and preached to the spirits in prison;">1 Peter 3:19</a>.

It may appear singular that in this passage Peter should make mention of those who were unbelieving in the days of Noah, and of baptism as the antitype of the water of the deluge; but this may be explained from the circumstance that he looks on the deluge as a type of the approaching judgment. It must be observed that it is not so much the condemnation of the unbelieving, as the salvation of believers that the apostle has here in his mind.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐν ᾧ καὶ κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.] “<span class="ital">in which (spirit) He also went and preached unto the spirits in prison (to them), which sometime were unbelieving when</span>,” etc. The close connection of these words with what immediately precedes—by <span class="greekheb">ἐν ᾧ</span>, <span class="ital">sc.</span> <span class="greekheb">πνεύματι</span>,—favours the view that <span class="greekheb">ἐκήρυξε</span> refers to an act of Christ which, as the <span class="greekheb">ζωοποιηθεὶς πνεύματι</span>, He performed after His death, and that with reference to the spirits <span class="greekheb">ἐν φυλακῇ</span> of the unbelievers who had perished in the deluge. This is the view of the oldest Fathers of the Greek and Latin Church; as also of the greater number of later and modern theologians. Augustin, however, opposed it, and considered <span class="greekheb">ἐκήρυξεν</span> as referring to a preaching by Christ <span class="greekheb">ἐν πνεύματι</span>, long before His incarnation, in the days of Noah, to the people of that generation, upon whom the judgment of the deluge came because of their unbelief.[205] This view, after being adopted by several theologians of the Middle Ages, became prevalent in the Reformed Church. In recent times, it has been defended more especially by Schweizer, Wichelhaus, Besser, and Hofmann. The chief arguments which those who maintain it advance in opposition to that first mentioned, are the following:—(1) The idea that Christ preached to the spirits <span class="greekheb">ἐν φυλακῇ</span> would be an isolated one occurring nowhere else in Scripture; and, further, preaching such as this, if conceived as judicial, would have been entirely useless, whilst, looked on as a proclamation of salvation, it would stand in contradiction to the uniform teaching of Scripture regarding the state of man after death. To this, however, it must be replied, that isolated ideas are to be found expressed here and there in Scripture, and that the reconciliation of the idea of a salvation offered to the spirits <span class="greekheb">ἐν φυλακῇ</span> with the other doctrines of Scripture, can at most be termed a problem difficult of solution; nor must it be forgotten that the eschatological doctrines comprehend within them very many problems. (2) This view does not correspond with the tendency of the entire passage from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-17.htm" title="For it is better, if the will of God be so, that you suffer for well doing, than for evil doing.">1 Peter 3:17</a> to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-22.htm" title="Who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God; angels and authorities and powers being made subject to him.">1 Peter 3:22</a>, and therefore does not fit into the train of thought. But this assertion is to the point only if those who make it have themselves correctly understood the tendency of the passage, which in this instance they have not done. (3) It cannot be understood how Peter comes so suddenly to speak of the spirits in prison. But, in reply, it may be urged, with at least equal justification, that it is not easy to understand how Peter comes so suddenly to speak of an act of Christ <span class="ital">before</span> His incarnation. (4) The want of the article before <span class="greekheb">ἀπειθήσασι</span> compels us to translate this participle not: “which sometime were unbelieving,” but: “when they sometime were unbelieving.” This, however, is not the case, since the participle, added with adjectival force to a substantive, is often enough joined to the latter without an article. If Peter had put the words <span class="greekheb">πορευθεὶς ἐκήρυξε</span>, before <span class="greekheb">τοῖς</span> … <span class="greekheb">πνεύμασι</span>, no difficulty would have presented itself in the translation under dispute (“the sometime unbelieving spirits in prison”). The translation to which preference is given is grammatically untenable.[206]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Finally, appeal has been made to the fact that <span class="greekheb">καί</span> is placed after <span class="greekheb">ἐν ᾧ</span>, indeed even to <span class="greekheb">ἐν ᾧ</span> itself; but a correct explanation offers no justification for so doing. Besides the close connection of the relative clause with that immediately preceding, the following points favour the interpretation attacked:—(1) The correspondence of the <span class="greekheb">πνεύματι</span> to be supplied to <span class="greekheb">ἐν ᾧ</span> with the subsequent <span class="greekheb">πνεύμασιν</span>; (2) <span class="greekheb">πορευθείς</span>, which must be taken in the same sense as the <span class="greekheb">πορευθείς</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-22.htm" title="Who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God; angels and authorities and powers being made subject to him.">1 Peter 3:22</a>; (3) The fact that <span class="greekheb">ποτέ</span> does not stand with <span class="greekheb">ἐκήρυξε</span>, but in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-20.htm" title="Which sometime were disobedient, when once the long-suffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls were saved by water.">1 Peter 3:20</a> with <span class="greekheb">ἀπειθήσασιν</span>, which shows that the <span class="greekheb">ἀπειθεῖν</span> took place previous to the <span class="greekheb">κηρύσσειν</span>; and, lastly, (4) The circumstance that had Peter closed his sentence with <span class="greekheb">ἐκήρυξεν</span>, it could have occurred to no one that Peter was here speaking of a preaching of Christ which took place in a time long gone by.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐν ᾧ</span>] is not equivalent to <span class="greekheb">διό</span> (<span class="greekheb">αἰτιολογικῶς</span> with reference to <span class="greekheb">ἔπαθε</span>, Theophylact); but whilst <span class="greekheb">ᾧ</span> refers back to <span class="greekheb">πνεύματι</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἐν ᾧ</span> states in what condition Christ accomplished that which is mentioned in what follows,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>He accomplished it not <span class="greekheb">ἐν σαρκί</span> (for after the <span class="greekheb">σάρξ</span> He was put to death), but <span class="greekheb">ἐν πνεύματι</span> (for after the <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span> He was made alive). <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span> stands here in a position similar to that which it holds in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-8.htm" title="So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.">Romans 8:8</a>, where, however, <span class="greekheb">σάρξ</span> and <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span> form an ethical antithesis, which here is not the case. Hofmann wrongly attributes to <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span> here an “instrumental force” equivalent to “by means of;” he is induced to do solely by his explanation of the <span class="greekheb">πνεύματι</span> to be supplied. Although it is evident that <span class="greekheb">πνεύματι</span> here must be taken in no sense different from that of the foregoing <span class="greekheb">πνεύματι</span>, Hofmann nevertheless holds it to be identical with the <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα Χριστοῦ</span> mentioned in chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-11.htm" title="Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow.">1 Peter 1:11</a>, while he himself says that the <span class="greekheb">πνεύματι</span> subjoined to <span class="greekheb">ζωοποιηθείς</span> cannot be understood of the Holy Ghost.[207]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Peter says, then, that Christ, in the Spirit according to which He was made alive, preached to the spirits <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝ ΦΥΛΑΚῇ</span></span></span>, which cannot be understood to mean anything else than that He did it as a <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΝΕῦΜΑ</span></span></span> (in His pneumatical condition).

Hofmann wrongly—because in opposition to the uniform usage in the N. T.—denies all local reference to the expression, and would therefore translate <span class="greekheb">ἐν φυλακῇ</span> by “in durance.” The meaning is, that the <span class="greekheb">πνεύματα</span> were in prison as prisoners.[209] The expression occurs in the N. T. with the article and without it, and its more precise force here is clear from the passages: <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-7.htm" title="And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison,">Revelation 20:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-4.htm" title="For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved to judgment;">2 Peter 2:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-6.htm" title="But Adonibezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes.">Judges 1:6</a>. It does not denote generally the kingdom of the dead (Lactant. <span class="ital">Inst</span>. I. 7, c. 21: omnes [animae] in una communique custodia detinentur), but that part of it, which serves as abode for the souls of the ungodly until the day of judgment.[210] The dative depends, indeed, on <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΚΉΡΥΞΕΝ</span></span></span>, not on <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΟΡΕΥΘΕΊς</span></span></span>; but the addition of the latter word gives prominence to the fact that Christ went to those spirits, and preached to them in that place where they were. Hofmann is not altogether wrong when, in support of his own view of the passage, he says: “the operation of the spirit of Christ, by which Noah was made the organ of His proclamation, might be termed a ‘going and preaching’ on the part of Christ” (comp. especially the passage, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-17.htm" title="And came and preached peace to you which were afar off, and to them that were near.">Ephesians 2:17</a> : <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΛΘῺΝ ΕὐΗΓΓΕΛΊΣΑΤΟ</span></span></span>; see Meyer <span class="ital">in loc</span>., to which Hofmann might have appealed).

T. of the preaching (not the teaching) of Christ and His apostles. Usually it is accompanied by an object (<span class="greekheb">τὸ εὐαγγέλιον</span>, <span class="greekheb">τὴν βασιλείαν τοῦ Θεοῦ</span>, <span class="greekheb">Χριστόν</span>, or the like); but it is frequently, as here, used absolutely, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-1.htm" title="And it came to pass, when Jesus had made an end of commanding his twelve disciples, he departed there to teach and to preach in their cities.">Matthew 11:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/1-38.htm" title="And he said to them, Let us go into the next towns, that I may preach there also: for therefore came I forth.">Mark 1:38</a>, etc.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It cannot be concluded, with Zezschwitz, from the connection of this relative clause with <span class="greekheb">ζωοποιηθεὶς πνεύματι</span>, that <span class="greekheb">ζωοποίησιν</span> illam spiritualem quasi fundamentum fuisse concionis idemque argumentum; nor does the word itself disclose either the contents or the purpose of that preaching; but since <span class="ital">Christ</span> is called the <span class="greekheb">κήρυξας</span> without the addition of any more precise qualification, it must be concluded that the contents and design of this <span class="greekheb">κήρυγμα</span> are in harmony with the <span class="greekheb">κήρυγμα</span> of Christ elsewhere. It is accordingly arbitrary, and in contradiction to Christ’s significance for the work of redemption, to assume that this preaching consisted in the proclamation of the coming judgment (Flacius, Calov., Buddeus, Hollaz, Wolf, Aretius, Zezschwitz, Schott, etc.), and was a praedicatio damnatoria.[212] Wiesinger justly asks: “This concio damnatoria—what does it mean in general, what here especially?”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is unjustifiable to deny, with some commentators, that the apostle regarded this <span class="greekheb">πορευθεὶς ἐκήρυξε</span> as an actual reality.[213]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καί</span>, following <span class="greekheb">ἐν ᾧ</span>, must not be explained, as Schweizer does, in this way, that Peter, wishing to hold up Christ to his readers as a pattern of how they should conduct themselves under suffering, adduces two examples, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-19.htm" title="By which also he went and preached to the spirits in prison;">1 Peter 3:19</a> ff., His death on the cross, and His preaching; the whole structure of the clauses, as well as their contents, contradicts this. Nor can it be explained, as Hofmann assumes, “from the antithesis between us whom Christ wished to bring to God, and those who as spirits are in durance.” This would hold good only if, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-18.htm" title="For Christ also has once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:">1 Peter 3:18</a>, it were affirmed that Christ did the same to us as to those spirits, that is, preached to us. It is likewise incorrect to take <span class="greekheb">καί</span> as equivalent to “even” (Wiesinger, Fronmüller); for a distinction between these spirits and others is nowhere hinted at. <span class="greekheb">καί</span> is put rather in order to show prominently that what is said in this verse coincides with the <span class="greekheb">ζωοποιηθεὶς πνεύματι</span> of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-18.htm" title="For Christ also has once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:">1 Peter 3:18</a>. Zezschwitz: ut notio, quae in enunciatione <span class="greekheb">ἐν ᾧ</span> latet (<span class="greekheb">ζωοπ</span>. <span class="greekheb">πνεύματι</span>) urgeatur.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[205] It must be observed, that whilst Hofmann considers the preaching of Christ as having taken place through Noah, Schweizer most decidedly disputes this, and is of the opinion that it was addressed to Noah himself as well as to his contemporaries. In support of this, he very rightly appeals to the fact that Noah is not here—as <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-5.htm" title="And spared not the old world, but saved Noah the eighth person, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood on the world of the ungodly;">2 Peter 2:5</a>—termed a <span class="greekheb">κῆρυξ</span>. But he does not say by whom this preaching must be considered to have taken place.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[206] Hofmann, indeed, says that since the expression is not <span class="greekheb">τοῖς ἀπειθήσασι</span>, the translation should not be “those spirits in durance, which sometime were disobedient;” but he grants that, from a grammatical point of view, it remains doubtful “whether <span class="greekheb">ποτέ</span> signifies the past as related to the time of Christ’s preaching, or the past as regards the present of the writer.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[207] Hofmann says that the accusation made against him, that he effaces the distinction between <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span> as a term used to designate the precise nature of Christ, and <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span> as the third Person in the Trinity, is the result of that confusion of ideas by which “in the Spirit” and “as a Spirit” are understood to mean the same thing. But it must be replied that rather is the identification of two different ideas, contained in his interpretation, the result of the confusion of ideas, leading him as it does to hide the difference by defining <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span> as “the Spirit of Christ’s life.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[208] Baur (<span class="ital">Tüb. theol.

T. it is nowhere indicated as being a coming of Christ <span class="greekheb">ἐν πνεύματι</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[212] Hollaz: Fuit praedicatio Christi in inferno non evangelica, quae hominibus tantum in regno gratiae annunciatur, sed <span class="ital">legalis</span> elenchthica, terribilis eaque tum verbalis, qua ipsos aeterna supplicia promeritos esse convincit, tum realis, qua immanem terrorem iis incussit. This interpretation, which, has its origin in dogmatic views, Zezschwitz seeks to found on exegesis by characterizing the idea of judgment as the leading conception of the whole passage, to which, however, the context gives no warrant, and also by maintaining that otherwise Peter would have used the word <span class="greekheb">εὐαγγελίζειν</span>, or a compound of <span class="greekheb">ἀγγέλλειν</span>. It is certainly correct when Schott and Köhler say that <span class="greekheb">κηρύσσειν</span> is not in itself equal to <span class="greekheb">εὐαγγελίζειν</span>; but it does not follow that it may not be applied to a message of salvation. It must be remembered that Christ’s aim, even as a preacher of judgment, ever was the accomplishment of salvation, as he declared <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-10.htm" title="For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.">Luke 19:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-47.htm" title="And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.">John 12:47</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[213] Thus Picus Mirandola says: Christus non veraciter et quantum ad realem praesentiam descendit ad inferos, sed solum quoad effectum. Cf., too, J. R. Lavater, <span class="ital">de descensu Christi ad inf.</span> lib. I. c. 9.—Many interpreters unwarrautably weaken at least <span class="greekheb">ἐκήρυξε</span>, in so far as to make it synonymous with “showed Himself,” or, at any rate, they say that the preaching of Christ was potius realiter, quam verbaliter. This the author of the article, “Die Höllenfahrt Christi,” in the <span class="ital">Erlanger Zeitschrift für Protest.</span> 1856, should not have sanctioned. Schott is not free from this arbitrary method of interpretation, in that he characterizes <span class="greekheb">κηρύσσειν</span> “as a bearing witness to oneself, not only in word, but also in deed,” and calls “this bearing witness to and showing forth of Himself by Christ in the glory of His mediatorial person,” a concio damnatoria.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/1_peter/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">19</span>. <span class="ital">by which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison</span>] We enter here on a passage of which widely different interpretations have been given. It seems best in dealing with it to give in the first place what seems to be the true sequence of thought, and afterwards to examine the other views which appear to the present writer less satisfactory. It is obvious that every word will require a careful study in its relation to the context. (1) For “by which” we ought to read “in which.” It was not by the instrumentality of the Holy Spirit, but in His human spirit as distinct from the flesh, that He who had preached to men living in the flesh on earth now went and preached to the spirits that had an existence separate from the flesh. (2) The word “went” is, in like manner, full of significance. It comes from the Apostle who was the first to proclaim that the “spirit” or “soul” of Christ had passed into Hades, but had not been left there (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-31.htm" title="He seeing this before spoke of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see corruption.">Acts 2:31</a>). It agrees with the language of St Paul in the Epistle to which we have found so many references in this Epistle, that He had “descended first into the lower parts of the earth,” i.e. into the region which the current belief of the time recognised as the habitation of the disembodied spirits of the dead (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-9.htm" title="(Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth?">Ephesians 4:9</a>). It harmonises with the language of the Apostle who was St Peter’s dearest friend when he records the language in which the risen Lord had spoken of Himself as having “the keys of Hades and of death,” as having been dead, but now “alive for evermore” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-18.htm" title="I am he that lives, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for ever more, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death.">Revelation 1:18</a>). Taking all these facts together, we cannot see in the words anything but an attestation of the truth which the Church Catholic has received in the Apostles’ Creed, that Christ “died and was buried and descended into Hell.” And if we accept the record of St Peter’s speeches in the Acts as a true record, and compare the assured freedom and clearness of his teaching there with his imperfect insight into the character of our Lord’s work during the whole period of His ministry prior to the Resurrection, we can scarcely fail to see in his interpretation of the words “thou shalt not leave my soul in hell,” the first-fruits of the method of prophetic interpretation which he had learnt from our Lord Himself when He expounded to His disciples the things that were written concerning Himself in the Law, and the Prophets, and the Psalms (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-44.htm" title="And he said to them, These are the words which I spoke to you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me.">Luke 24:44</a>), when He spoke to them of “the things pertaining to the kingdom of God” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-3.htm" title="To whom also he showed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs, being seen of them forty days, and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God:">Acts 1:3</a>). In the special truth on which the Apostle now lays stress, we must see, unless we think of him as taking up a legendary tradition, as writing either what had been revealed to him, “not by flesh and blood, but by his Father in heaven” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-17.htm" title="And Jesus answered and said to him, Blessed are you, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood has not revealed it to you, but my Father which is in heaven.">Matthew 16:17</a>), or as reporting what he had himself heard from the lips of the risen Lord. Of the two views the latter seems every way the more probable, and accepting it, we have to remember also that it was a record in which he was guided by the teaching of the Spirit.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And he “went and preached.” The latter word is used throughout the Gospels of the work of Christ as proclaiming “the Gospel of the kingdom” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-23.htm" title="And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people.">Matthew 4:23</a>), preaching “repentance” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-17.htm" title="From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.">Matthew 4:17</a>), and the glad tidings of remission of sins as following upon repentance. It would do violence to all true methods of interpretation to assume that the Apostle, who had been converted by that preaching and had afterwards been a fellow-worker in it, would use the word in any other meaning now. We cannot think of the work to which the Spirit of Christ went as that of proclaiming an irrevocable sentence of condemnation. This interpretation, resting adequately on its own grounds, is, it need hardly be said, confirmed almost beyond the shadow of a doubt by the words of ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-6.htm" title="For for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.">1 Peter 4:6</a>, that “the Gospel was preached also to the dead.” Those to whom He thus preached were “spirits.” The context determines the sense of this word as denoting that element of man’s personality which survives when the body perishes. So, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-23.htm" title="To the general assembly and church of the firstborn, which are written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect,">Hebrews 12:23</a>, we read of “the <span class="ital">spirits</span> of just men made perfect;” and the same sense attaches to the words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-37.htm" title="But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit.">Luke 24:37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-39.htm" title="Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit has not flesh and bones, as you see me have.">Luke 24:39</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/23-8.htm" title="For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit: but the Pharisees confess both....">Acts 23:8-9</a>, and in the “<span class="ital">spirits</span> and souls of <span class="bld">the righteous</span>” in the <span class="ital">Benedicite Omnia Opera</span>. And these spirits are in “prison.” The Greek word, as applied to a place, can hardly have any other meaning than that here given (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/14-3.htm" title="For Herod had laid hold on John, and bound him, and put him in prison for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's wife.">Matthew 14:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/14-10.htm" title="And he sent, and beheaded John in the prison.">Matthew 14:10</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-17.htm" title="For Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold on John, and bound him in prison for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's wife: for he had married her.">Mark 6:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-27.htm" title="And immediately the king sent an executioner, and commanded his head to be brought: and he went and beheaded him in the prison,">Mark 6:27</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/21-12.htm" title="But before all these, they shall lay their hands on you, and persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues, and into prisons, being brought before kings and rulers for my name's sake.">Luke 21:12</a>), and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-7.htm" title="And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison,">Revelation 20:7</a> it is distinctly used of the prison-house of Satan. The “spirits in prison” cannot well mean anything but disembodied souls, under a greater or less degree of condemnation, waiting for their final sentence, and undergoing meanwhile a punishment retributive or corrective (see note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-9.htm" title="The Lord knows how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to reserve the unjust to the day of judgment to be punished:">2 Peter 2:9</a>). Had the Apostle stopped there we might have thought of the preaching of which he speaks as having been addressed to all who were in such a prison. The prison itself may be thought of as part of Hades contrasted with the Paradise of God, which was opened, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-43.htm" title="And Jesus said to him, Truly I say to you, To day shall you be with me in paradise.">Luke 23:43</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-7.htm" title="He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit said to the churches; To him that overcomes will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the middle of the paradise of God.">Revelation 2:7</a>, to the penitent and the faithful.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/1_peter/3.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-19.htm" title="By which also he went and preached to the spirits in prison;">1 Peter 3:19</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἐν ᾧ</span>) <span class="ital">in which</span> spirit. Christ had to do with the living, in the flesh; with spirits, in spirit. He Himself has efficacy with the living and the dead. There are wonders in that invisible world. In a subject full of mystery, we ought not to dismiss from it the proper signification of the language employed, because it has no parallel passages. For they, to whom each mystery has first been revealed, have most nobly believed the word of God even without parallel passages. For instance, our Saviour only once said, <span class="ital">This is My body</span>. The mystery respecting the change of those who shall be alive at the coming of the Lord, is only once written.—<span class="greekheb">τοῖς</span>—<span class="greekheb">πνεύυασι</span>, <span class="ital">to the spirits</span>) Peter does not say that all the spirits were in that place of confinement, for many might have been in a more gloomy place; but he means, that Christ preached to all who were in confinement.—<span class="greekheb">ἐν φυλακῇ</span>, <span class="ital">in guard</span>) The guilty are punished in prison; they are kept <span class="ital">in guard</span>, until they experience what the Judge is about to do. The expression about the state of those living under the Old Testament, <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-23.htm" title="But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up to the faith which should afterwards be revealed.">Galatians 3:23</a>, bears some analogy to this.—<span class="greekheb">πυεύμασι</span>, <span class="ital">to the spirits</span>) of the dead. Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-23.htm" title="To the general assembly and church of the firstborn, which are written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect,">Hebrews 12:23</a>. He does not call them <span class="ital">souls</span>, as in the next verse.—<span class="greekheb">πορευθεὶς</span>, <span class="ital">going</span>) namely, to those spirits. The same word is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-22.htm" title="Who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God; angels and authorities and powers being made subject to him.">1 Peter 3:22</a>. Those spirits were not in the tomb of Jesus: He went to them.—<span class="greekheb">ἐκήρυξεν</span>, <span class="ital">He preached</span>) By this preaching, which followed close upon His being quickened, Christ showed Himself both <span class="ital">alive</span>, even then, and <span class="ital">righteous</span>. Peter would not say, <span class="greekheb">εὐηγγελίσατο</span>, <span class="ital">He preached the Gospel</span>, if even ever so much the preaching of grace only were here designed: for the hearers had fallen asleep before the times <span class="ital">of the Gospel</span>; therefore he uses a word of wider meaning, <span class="ital">He preached</span> (or <span class="ital">published</span>). Noah, <span class="ital">a preacher</span> of righteousness, was despised, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-5.htm" title="And spared not the old world, but saved Noah the eighth person, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood on the world of the ungodly;">2 Peter 2:5</a>; but Christ was a more powerful <span class="ital">preacher</span>, who, when quickened in spirit, vindicated His own righteousness, which was not believed by them of former times, and openly refuted their unbelief, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-16.htm" title="And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached to the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.">1 Timothy 3:16</a>. If he were speaking of preaching by Noah, the word <span class="ital">sometime</span> would either be altogether omitted, or be joined with the word <span class="ital">preached</span>. This preaching was a prelude to the general judgment; comp. ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-5.htm" title="Who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead.">1 Peter 4:5</a>; and the term “preaching” itself is to be taken in its wider sense, that it may be understood to have been to some a preaching of the Gospel, as Hutter says, to their consolation, which is more peculiarly the office of Christ; to others, and perhaps the greater part, a publishing of the law, for their terror. For if the judgment itself shall be a cause of joy to some, assuredly this preaching was not a subject of dread to all. The author of the Adumbrations, which are assigned to Clement of Alexandria and to Cassiodorus, says, <span class="ital">They saw not His form, but heard the sound of His voice. Calvin</span>, in his Institutes, 2d Book, ch. 16:9, says, <span class="ital">For the context also leads to this conclusion, that the faithful, who had died before that time, were sharers of the same grace with us: because it enhances the power of His death from this circumstance, that it penetrated even to the dead; while the souls of the righteous obtained an</span> immediate view of that visitation, <span class="ital">which they had anxiously expected, on the contrary, it was more plainly revealed</span> to the lost, <span class="ital">that they are altogether excluded from salvation. And though</span> Peter <span class="ital">does not speak with such distinctness, it must not thus be understood as though he mixed together the righteous and the wicked without any difference, but he only wishes to teach, that a</span> perception <span class="ital">of the death of Christ was</span> common to both.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison</span>; rather, <span class="accented">in which</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c9;&#x1fee;&#x1fbe;</span>). The Lord was no longer in the flesh; the component parts of his human nature were separated by death; his flesh lay in the grave. As he had gone about doing good in the flesh, so now he went in the spirit - in his holy human spirit. <span class="accented">He went.</span> The Greek word (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span>) occurs again in ver. 22, "who is <span class="accented">gone</span> into heaven." It must have the same meaning in both places; in ver. 22 it asserts a change of locality; it must do the like here. There it is used of the ascent into heaven; it can scarcely mean here that, without any such change of place, Christ preached, not in his own Person, but through Noah or the apostles. Compare St. Paul's words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-9.htm">Ephesians 4:9</a> (the Epistle which seems to have been so much in St. Peter's thoughts), "Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth?" <span class="accented">And preached</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>). It is the word constantly used of the Lord from the time when "Jesus began to preach (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>), and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-17.htm">Matthew 4:17</a>). Then, himself in our human flesh, he preached to men living in the flesh - to a few of his own age and country. Now the range of his preaching was extended;  himself in the spirit, he preached to spirits: "<span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span>; spiritu, spiritibus." says Bengel; "<span class="accented">congruens sermo."</span> He preached <span class="accented">also</span> to the spirits; not only once to living men, but now also to spirits, even to them. The <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span> calls for attention; it implies a new and additional fact; it emphasizes the substantive (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>). The preaching and the condition of the hearers are mentioned together; they were spirits when they heard the preaching. It seems impossible to understand these words of preaching through Noah or the apostles to men who passed afterwards into the state of disembodied spirits. And he preached in the spirit. The words seem to limit the preaching to the time when the Lord's soul was left in Hades (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-27.htm">Acts 2:27</a>). Huther, indeed, says that "<span class="accented">as</span> both expressions (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span>) apply to Christ in his entire Person, consisting of body and soul, what follows must not be conceived as an activity which he exercised in his spirit only, and whilst separated from his body." But does <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span> apply to body and <span class="accented">soul?</span> Men "are not able to kill the soul." And is it true, as Huther continues, that the first words of this verse are not opposed to the view that Christ preached in his glorified body, "inasmuch as in <span class="accented">this</span> body the Lord is no longer <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;</span>, but entirely <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>? Indeed, we are taught that "<span class="accented">flesh</span> and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; "and that that which "<span class="accented">is</span> sown a natural body is raised a spiritual body" (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>); but Christ himself said of his resurrection-body, "A spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-39.htm">Luke 24:39</a>). He preached to "the spirits <span class="accented">in prison</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1fc7;</span>)." (For <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;</span>, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-7.htm">Revelation 20:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-25.htm">Matthew 5:25</a>, etc.). It cannot mean the whole realm of the dead, but only that part of Hades in which the souls of the ungodly are reserved unto the day of judgment. Bengel says, "In carcere puniuntur sontes: in <span class="accented">custodia</span> servantur, dum experiantur quid facturus sit judex?" But it seems doubtful whether this distinction between <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> can be pressed; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-7.htm">Revelation 20:7</a> <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;</span> is used of the prison of Satan, though, indeed, that prison is not the <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> into which he will be cast at the last. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/1_peter/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>By which (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c9;&#788;&#834;&#837;)<p>Wrong.

Excepting in the last passage, the word occurs nowhere else in the New Testament in a metaphorical sense. It is often translated watch (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/14-25.htm">Matthew 14:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-8.htm">Luke 2:8</a>); hold and cage (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/18-2.htm">Revelation 18:2</a>). Others explain as Hades, the kingdom of the dead generally. </body></html>
