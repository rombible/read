It had been accepted by Him in the holy women of old who hoped in Him, and would be accepted again. “The Apostle enforces his doctrine by example,” says Leighton: “the most compendious way of teaching.” By “holy women” he means, not only holy in character, but “sainted”—consecrated by their memories being recorded for our reverence in Holy Writ.<p><span class= "bld">Who trusted in God.</span>—It is a great pity that “trusted” should have been substituted for the original “hoped.” The position of Sara and the holy women of the Old Testament was one of <span class= "ital">expectancy, </span>of looking <span class= "ital">forward</span> to the fulfilment of a promise; and the description of them as such is intended to make the readers of the letter feel the difference of <span class= "ital">their</span> position. To <span class= "ital">them</span> the promise to Sara was accomplished. The expression contains a reference to the mention of God in the last verse.<p><span class= "bld">Adorned themselves, being in subjection.</span>—The imperfect tense of the verb means “<span class= "ital">used</span> to adorn themselves.” They took daily pains thus to adorn themselves, and spent, perhaps, as long in the process as the other ladies over their toilette. The participle which is added explains more fully the “after this manner.” Their subjection was their ornament.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_peter/3.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_peter/3-5.htm" title="For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection to their own husbands:...">1 Peter 3:5-6</a></span>. <span class="ital">For after this manner </span>— Namely, with inward holiness and outward plainness; <span class="ital">in old time </span>— In the patriarchal ages; <span class="ital">the holy women who trusted in God </span>— And therefore did not act thus from servile fear, but from true piety, and are consequently worthy to be imitated; <span class="ital">adorned themselves — </span>Their adorning, according to St. Peter here, was, 1st, Their meek subjection to their husbands; 2d, Their quiet spirit, <span class="ital">not afraid </span>or <span class="ital">amazed; </span>and, 3d, Their unblameable behaviour, <span class="ital">doing </span>all things <span class="ital">well.

Therefore, by mentioning the reverence with which Sarah spake of Abraham, the apostle intimates that she entertained the highest respect for him, and a just sense of her own subjection to him. Sarah was considered by the Jewish women as an illustrious pattern of a dutiful wife; <span class="ital">whose daughters </span>— Or children, in a spiritual, as well as natural sense; <span class="ital">ye are </span>— Or show yourselves to be, and that ye are entitled to the same inheritance; <span class="ital">as long as ye do well — </span>Discharge all your conjugal duties conscientiously. Sarah being constituted by God the mother of all believers, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-26.htm" title="But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all.">Galatians 4:26</a>,) even as Abraham was made their father, the believing women of Pontus, by imitating Sarah’s virtues, became her children, though not descended from her. <span class="ital">And are not afraid with any amazement </span>— So terrified with the apprehension of any danger or prejudice that may arise to you on account of your piety, as to be discouraged from your duty, or induced, through fear of displeasing your husbands, to do actions contrary to your religion. For, while the apostle enjoined wives to be in subjection to their husbands, he cautioned them against committing sin, especially the sin of idolatry, either from a desire to please their husbands, or from a fear of offending them.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_peter/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:1-7 The wife must discharge her duty to her own husband, though he obey not the word. We daily see how narrowly evil men watch the ways and lives of professors of religion. Putting on of apparel is not forbidden, but vanity and costliness in ornament. Religious people should take care that all their behaviour answers to their profession. But how few know the right measure and bounds of those two necessaries of life, food and raiment! Unless poverty is our carver, and cuts us short, there is scarcely any one who does not desire something beyond what is good for us. Far more are beholden to the lowliness of their state, than the lowliness of their mind; and many will not be so bounded, but lavish their time and money upon trifles. The apostle directs Christian females to put on something not corruptible, that beautifies the soul, even the graces of God's Holy Spirit. A true Christian's chief care lies in right ordering his own spirit. This will do more to fix the affections, and excite the esteem of a husband, than studied ornaments or fashionable apparel, attended by a froward and quarrelsome temper. Christians ought to do their duty to one another, from a willing mind, and in obedience to the command of God. Wives should be subject to their husbands, not from dread and amazement, but from desire to do well, and please God. The husband's duty to the wife implies giving due respect unto her, and maintaining her authority, protecting her, and placing trust in her. They are heirs together of all the blessings of this life and that which is to come, and should live peaceably one with another. Prayer sweetens their converse. And it is not enough that they pray with the family, but husband and wife together by themselves, and with their children. Those who are acquainted with prayer, find such unspeakable sweetness in it, that they will not be hindered therein. That you may pray much, live holily; and that you may live holily, be much in prayer.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_peter/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For after this manner, in the old time - The allusion here is particularly to the times of the patriarchs, and the object of the apostle is to state another reason why they should seek that kind of ornament which he had been commending.

In ages past, the years of many generations, since the time that God created man upon earth; in the times before the flood, and after it; in the times of the patriarchs, judges, kings, and prophets of Israel, under the Old Testament dispensation. The apostle exhorts and encourages to this inward dress and ornament, from the antiquity of it: for in this way, and after this fashion, <p>the holy women also: who were sanctified by the Spirit of God, and lived holy lives and conversations, such as Sarah, Rebekah, Rachel, Leah, Ruth, Hannah, and others: <p>who trusted in God; that he would send the Messiah, and make good all his promises, judging and believing him to be faithful to his word, and able to fulfil whatever he had promised, as Sarah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-11.htm">Hebrews 11:11</a>. Such holy and believing women as these are worthy of imitation in their adorning and dress, and who, in the manner before described by the apostle, adorned themselves; or this was the adorning which they sought after, valued, and chiefly regarded; not what was external, but internal: and which lay in meekness and humility, and in a quiet deportment, and in <p>being in subjection unto their own husbands; according to their original make, and natural relation, and the laws of God, and of creation; which is more becoming and adorning than plaiting of hair, wearing of gold, or costly raiment, and recommends them more, both in the sight of God and men; nothing being a more indecent and uncomely sight than a woman not in subjection to her husband. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_peter/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{4}</span> For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their own husbands:</span><p>(4) An argument taken from the example of women, and especially of Sarah, who was the mother of all believers.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/1_peter/3.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_peter/3-5.htm" title="For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection to their own husbands:...">1 Peter 3:5-6</a>. <span class="greekheb">οὕτω γάρ</span>] ground for the exhortation: <span class="greekheb">ὧν ἔστω</span>, etc., by the example of the saintly women of the O.
