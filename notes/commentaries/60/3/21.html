First, the word “whereunto” is a mistake for the more difficult <span class= "ital">which;</span> and second, it should be <span class= "ital">you, </span>not “us.” We may then translate, either, <span class= "ital">Which baptism also, in antitype, doth now save you, </span>or else, <span class= "ital">Which</span> (w<span class= "ital">ater</span>)<span class= "ital"> also, in antitype, now saveth you</span>—<span class= "ital">baptism.</span> The first is less likely, both from the order of the words in Greek, and also because of the difficulty of calling the Flood point-blank a baptism. According to the second translation, the water <span class= "ital">through</span> which Noah was saved is said in the present day (“now,” as opposed to “in the days of Noe”) to save <span class= "ital">us</span> (the “you” is emphatic). It does so, in the same sense as we might say, for instance, that the sprinkling of the paschal blood saves us: that is to say, it foreshadowed something which does as a fact save us. This St. Peter expresses by the adjective which may be rendered “in antitype.” The thing it represented is Christian baptism. Where, then, lies the likeness between the two? Not merely in the identity of the element water, which serves but to arrest the fancy, and make one think of the deeper resemblance. One obvious point is that the number of persons accepting the proffered salvation at the present crisis is, as in the days of Noe, very small compared with those who reject it. The main thought, however, is not of the Christians, as a body or family (like Noe’s), being saved while others are lost. For each individual by himself there is a meaning in his baptism which is prefigured by the Flood; and the explanation of baptism which follows, and the opening of the next chapter, show that the Apostle was thinking chiefly of this individual application. As the passage of Israel through the Red Sea is described as a baptism (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-2.htm" title="And were all baptized to Moses in the cloud and in the sea;">1Corinthians 10:2</a>) because it marked their transition from the state of bondage to a new national life, and left their enemies destroyed in the water, so Noe’s safe passage through the Flood is a type of baptism, because it was a regeneration of humanity, it was a destruction of the carnal, sensual element (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-3.htm" title="And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.">Genesis 6:3</a>. “he also is <span class= "ital">flesh</span>”)<span class= "ital">, </span>it washed the human race from its pollutions, and man rose to a new and more spiritual existence for the time being, with the bow for a sign of a perpetual covenant made. So baptism is a destruction and death to the flesh, but a new life to the spirit. It must be observed how carefully St. Peter expresses the <span class= "ital">permanent</span> effect of baptism by the present tense “saveth:” not “saved you,” nor “hath saved you;” it is a living and ever present fact, the “<span class= "ital">everlasting</span> benediction of His heavenly washing;” it washes the neophyte not from past sins only, but from those which he afterwards commits, if only he still repents and believes.<p><span class= "bld">Not the putting away of the filth of the flesh.</span>—The Apostle is not cautioning his readers against the thought that baptism acted <span class= "ital">ex opere operato, </span>as a charm, but he is telling them, on the contrary, that it is no external rite. He was writing to Jews, who were very familiar with ceremonial washings, or “baptisings,” which, though <span class= "ital">they symbolised</span> a cleansing from sin, really <span class= "ital">effected</span> nothing but to make the skin less dirty.<p><span class= "bld">But the answer of a good conscience toward God.</span>—An expression which has caused almost as much difficulty as any in the New Testament. The difficulty lay especially in two points: first, that the context was so involved as to give little indication what to <span class= "ital">expect;</span> secondly, that the Greek word (<span class= "ital">eperôtêma</span>) which is here rendered “answer” is so seldom found. and might easily take such various shades of meaning. (1) Touching the word itself, we may at once reject the translation “answer,” for it could only mean an “answer” in that sense in which “question” and “answer” are identical, both of them being “the thing asked,” the subject matter of both being the same; but so cumbersome a sense is not in keeping here. (2) Next we may consider the attractive theory that it means a “contract.” The form in which a contract was made was as follows: N says to M, “Dost thou promise?” and M answers, “I promise.” Now in Byzantine Law-Greek such a contract is known as an <span class= "ital">eperôtêma, </span>or “questionment,” from the question with which proceedings began. And, as a matter of fact, the baptismal covenant has undoubtedly been entered upon from the earliest times with just such questions and answers. Tertullian speaks of this (<span class= "ital">De Corona, </span>chap. iii.) as an ancient custom in the end of the second century. There are, however, three serious objections: first, that “the contract of a good conscience” is a somewhat vague and imperfect phrase, and far more difficult in Greek than in English; secondly, that there is no trace of the legal term <span class= "ital">eperôtêma</span> until centuries after the date of St. Peter, or of Tertullian either; thirdly, that had <span class= "ital">eperôtêma</span> been a recognised term for a “contract” in St. Peter’s time, we should have been certain to find this explanation in some of the Greek Fathers. (3) The usual meaning of the verb would lead us towards a less unsatisfactory conclusion. <span class= "ital">Eperôtân</span> is “to put a question” for further information’s sake. And we may remark that the order of the Greek would strongly suggest that the words “toward God” should be attached (in spite of the analogy of <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-16.htm" title="And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void to offense toward God, and toward men.">Acts 24:16</a>) not to “good conscience,” but to the word <span class= "ital">eperôtêma.</span> Now, there is a constant use of the verb <span class= "ital">eperôtân</span> in the Old Testament in connection with the name of God. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/9-14.htm" title="And the men took of their victuals, and asked not counsel at the mouth of the LORD.">Joshua 9:14</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-1.htm" title="Now after the death of Joshua it came to pass, that the children of Israel asked the LORD, saying, Who shall go up for us against the Canaanites first, to fight against them?">Judges 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-5.htm" title="And they said to him, Ask counsel, we pray you, of God, that we may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous.">Judges 18:5</a>, and many other places, it means “to consult God,” “to inquire of the Lord,” to seek to Him for direction. Or, with a slightly different turn, it is used, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-3.htm" title="And the spirit of Egypt shall fail in the middle thereof; and I will destroy the counsel thereof: and they shall seek to the idols, and to the charmers, and to them that have familiar spirits, and to the wizards.">Isaiah 19:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-1.htm" title="I am sought of them that asked not for me; I am found of them that sought me not: I said, Behold me, behold me, to a nation that was not called by my name.">Isaiah 65:1</a>, for “to inquire after God,” in which sense it finds its way into the New Testament in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-20.htm" title="But Esaias is very bold, and said, I was found of them that sought me not; I was made manifest to them that asked not after me.">Romans 10:20</a>. Thus baptism would be said to be, “not the flesh’s putting away of dirt (for so it might be turned, though it is somewhat forced), but a good conscience’s inquiry at the hands of God,” or “a good conscience’s inquiry after God.” Observe that if the “good conscience” is the agent in this transaction, as here expressed, St. Peter would recognise (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-15.htm" title="But that on the good ground are they, which in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, keep it, and bring forth fruit with patience.">Luke 8:15</a>) the man’s happy state of soul <span class= "ital">before</span> baptism, and baptism would be the mode of his further approach to God. That this is good doctrine cannot be denied. (4) There is, however, another version for which a still better case can be made out: viz., “demand.” It is true that the verb <span class= "ital">eperôtân</span> more frequently means “to ask” a question than “to ask” a boon, expecting a verbal response rather than a practical one; but it is once used in the New Testament in the latter sense (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-1.htm" title="The Pharisees also with the Sadducees came, and tempting desired him that he would show them a sign from heaven.">Matthew 16:1</a>), and in the Old Testament also (as <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/137-3.htm" title="For there they that carried us away captive required of us a song; and they that wasted us required of us mirth, saying, Sing us one of the songs of Zion.">Psalm 137:3</a>). And the only other instance of the word <span class= "ital">eperôtêma</span> in inspired literature makes for this view. This occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-17.htm" title="This matter is by the decree of the watchers, and the demand by the word of the holy ones: to the intent that the living may know that the most High rules in the kingdom of men, and gives it to whomsoever he will, and sets up over it the basest of men.">Daniel 4:17</a>, where the English has “demand,” and the Latin <span class= "ital">petitio.</span> There is, indeed, almost as much difficulty in ascertaining the exact sense there as here; but, on the whole, it seems to mean the “demand” for Nebuchadnezzar’s degradation. This was evidently the meaning assigned to our present passage by the anonymous Father in the Catena, for, wrongly joining the words “through the resurrection” with <span class= "ital">eperôtêma, </span>he says: “It teacheth also how we <span class= "ital">beseech</span> of Him; and how? by confessing the resurrection of the Lord.” Taking, then, the rendering “demand,” a further question arises: Does St. Peter mean that baptism is the demand (made by God or the Church upon the man) <span class= "ital">for</span> a good conscience towards God? or the demand <span class= "ital">made by</span> a good conscience upon God, without specifying the demand? or finally, the demand upon God (made by the man) <span class= "ital">for</span> a good conscience? Of these the second seems the weakest, because it leaves the nature of the demand so open, and because the notion of a good conscience <span class= "ital">previous</span> to baptism is less suited to the context. The first would indeed give a vigorous sense. St. Peter would then be saying, “Have a good conscience (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-16.htm" title="Having a good conscience; that, whereas they speak evil of you, as of evildoers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation in Christ.">1Peter 3:16</a>), for, besides all else, it is your baptismal obligation, and in defiling conscience you forfeit your baptismal salvation;” but it labours under the defect of connecting “toward God” with “conscience” instead of with “demand,” and it is imperfect, moreover, in not demanding a good conscience toward men as well as toward God. The last seems both the clearest in itself, the best antithesis to the balancing clause, and the most in keeping with the context. It will then be: “Noah’s flood, in antitype, to this day saves you—that is to say, baptism, which is no cleansing of the skin from dirt, but an application to God for a clear conscience.” A “good conscience,” in this case, will not mean an honest frame of mind, but a consciousness of having nothing against you, such as would come to even the chief of sinners from the baptismal remission of sins. “Conscience” is used in this retrospective sense four times in Hebrews (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-9.htm" title="Which was a figure for the time then present, in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience;">Hebrews 9:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-14.htm" title="How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?">Hebrews 9:14</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-2.htm" title="For then would they not have ceased to be offered? because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins.">Hebrews 10:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-22.htm" title="Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water.">Hebrews 10:22</a>); and, indeed, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-16.htm" title="Having a good conscience; that, whereas they speak evil of you, as of evildoers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation in Christ.">1Peter 3:16</a> it meant “having nothing on your mind because of the past,” rather than “being sure that you <span class= "ital">mean</span> well.” And how well this suits the context! The Apostle, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-13.htm" title="And who is he that will harm you, if you be followers of that which is good?">1Peter 3:13</a> to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-6.htm" title="For for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.">1Peter 4:6</a>, is uttering the praises of a clear conscience, and warning from everything that could defile it. “With this,” he says, “you cannot be harmed; with this, you will be always ready to defend the faith when called to account. It was because He had this that Christ was able to atone for you and bring you to God, and to conduct His mission to the dead, and to give by His resurrection an efficacy to your baptism; and that baptism itself only saves you by the fact that in it you ask and receive the cleansing of the conscience.”<p><span class= "bld">By the resurrection.</span>—Rightly joined in our version with “doth save.” Baptism derives all its sacramental efficacy from the fact that Christ has, by the Resurrection, introduced into the world a new kind of life, which in baptism is imparted to the believer. The doctrine here approaches still nearer to that of Romans 6 than to that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-3.htm" title="Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy has begotten us again to a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,">1Peter 1:3</a>. In the first chapter, the Resurrection of Christ was said to be the means and the moment of our regeneration, but baptism (though of course implied) was not mentioned, nor the death to sin. But here, as in Romans, these two take a prominent place. As humanity died to the flesh in the bad Antediluvians, and rose again, washed clean, in Noe, so to the believer there was in baptism a death to the flesh, and he rose again, with a conscience washed clean through the union thereby effected with the crucified and risen Christ. Note, again, that when the Apostle speaks of glories he uses the name of Jesus: when of sufferings, it is the title of Christ.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_peter/3.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_peter/3-21.htm" title="The like figure whereunto even baptism does also now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ:...">1 Peter 3:21-22</a></span>. <span class="ital">The like figure whereunto </span>— <span class="greekheb">Αντιτυπον</span>, <span class="ital">the antitype whereof, </span>that is, the thing which corresponds, not with the water, but with the ark; <span class="ital">even baptism doth now save us </span>— Or is the instrument of our safety and preservation, from the guilt, power, and consequences of sin, which overwhelms the world as a flood. <span class="ital">Not the putting away the filth of the flesh </span>— As if he had said, By baptism I do not mean merely or chiefly the sprinkling or washing the body with water from its filthiness, which is only the outward or visible sign of baptism, but the inward renewing grace of God, producing the <span class="ital">answer of a good conscience, </span>or a divine consciousness that both our persons and our actions are accepted; <span class="ital">by the resurrection of Christ </span>— That is, the baptism which consists in the answer of a good conscience toward God, and which is the antitype or thing which was signified by Noah’s preservation in the ark, now saves us as effectually as the ark preserved Noah from destruction by the flood. It is well known the Jews laid a great stress upon their lustrations or washings. The apostle, therefore, very properly cautions his readers against such foolish dependancies. A readiness to perform their whole duty, and even to suffer persecution for the sake of truth, was absolutely necessary in the first Christians, in order to their maintaining that good conscience, to which, in their baptism, they professed a great regard, and to the exercise of which they solemnly engaged themselves. The word <span class="greekheb">επερωτημα</span>, here rendered <span class="ital">answer, </span>signifies rather <span class="ital">interrogation, </span>and is said by Archbishop Leighton to be a judicial word, and to signify interrogations used in the law for a trial, or executing a process, and has been thought by some commentators to refer to certain interrogations, said by Cyprian and other ancient writers to be put to persons who offered themselves to baptism, concerning their faith in Christ, and their renunciation of Satan with all his works, and the vanities of the world. But it does not appear, Macknight thinks, that these questions and answers were used in the apostle’s days; and if they were not, the apostle could not refer to them. “Allowing, however,” he says, “that the word <span class="ital">question </span>is here put for the word <span class="ital">answer, </span>this <span class="ital">answer of a good conscience, </span>being made to God, is an <span class="ital">inward answer, </span>and means the baptized person’s sincere persuasion of the things which, by submitting to baptism, he professed to believe; namely, that Jesus, in whose name baptism is administered, arose from the dead, and that at the last day he will raise all from the dead to eternal life, who sincerely obey him. This signification of baptism the Apostle Paul hath taught, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/6-4.htm" title="Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life....">Romans 6:4-5</a>; and therefore he calls it, <span class="ital">our begun confidence, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-14.htm" title="For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast to the end;">Hebrews 3:14</a>; and exhorts the Hebrews <span class="ital">to hold it steadfast to the end.” Who is gone into heaven — </span>As our forerunner; <span class="ital">and is on the right hand of God </span>— Having all power in heaven and on earth; <span class="ital">angels, authorities, and powers </span>— That is, all orders, both of angels and men; <span class="ital">being made subject to him </span>— Insubserviency of his great design, of saving all his true followers. The apostle, in speaking here of the resurrection and glory of Christ, means not only to represent him as the object of our confidence, but to intimate, that if we imitate him in his courageous fidelity, we may hope to partake with him in his glory. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_peter/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:14-22 We sanctify God before others, when our conduct invites and encourages them to glorify and honour him. What was the ground and reason of their hope? We should be able to defend our religion with meekness, in the fear of God. There is no room for any other fears where this great fear is; it disturbs not. The conscience is good, when it does its office well. That person is in a sad condition on whom sin and suffering meet: sin makes suffering extreme, comfortless, and destructive. Surely it is better to suffer for well-doing than for evil-doing, whatever our natural impatience at times may suggest. The example of Christ is an argument for patience under sufferings. In the case of our Lord's suffering, he that knew no sin, suffered instead of those who knew no righteousness. The blessed end and design of our Lord's sufferings were, to reconcile us to God, and to bring us to eternal glory. He was put to death in respect of his human nature, but was quickened and raised by the power of the Holy Spirit. If Christ could not be freed from sufferings, why should Christians think to be so? God takes exact notice of the means and advantages people in all ages have had. As to the old world, Christ sent his Spirit; gave warning by Noah. But though the patience of God waits long, it will cease at last. And the spirits of disobedient sinners, as soon as they are out of their bodies, are committed to the prison of hell, where those that despised Noah's warning now are, and from whence there is no redemption. Noah's salvation in the ark upon the water, which carried him above the floods, set forth the salvation of all true believers. That temporal salvation by the ark was a type of the eternal salvation of believers by baptism of the Holy Spirit. To prevent mistakes, the apostle declares what he means by saving baptism; not the outward ceremony of washing with water, which, in itself, does no more than put away the filth of the flesh, but that baptism, of which the baptismal water formed the sign. Not the outward ordinance, but when a man, by the regeneration of the Spirit, was enabled to repent and profess faith, and purpose a new life, uprightly, and as in the presence of God. Let us beware that we rest not upon outward forms. Let us learn to look on the ordinances of God spiritually, and to inquire after the spiritual effect and working of them on our consciences. We would willingly have all religion reduced to outward things. But many who were baptized, and constantly attended the ordinances, have remained without Christ, died in their sins, and are now past recovery. Rest not then till thou art cleansed by the Spirit of Christ and the blood of Christ. His resurrection from the dead is that whereby we are assured of purifying and peace.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_peter/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The like figure whereunto, even baptism, doth also now save us - There are some various readings here in the Greek text, but the sense is not essentially varied. Some have proposed to read (&#x3c9;&#834;&#837;  ho&#772;) to which instead of (&#x3bf;&#788;&#769;  ho) which, so as to make the sense "the antitype to which baptism now also saves us." The antecedent to the relative, whichever word is used, is clearly not the ark, but water; and the idea is, that as Noah was saved by water, so there is a sense in which water is made instrumental in our salvation. The mention of water in the case of Noah, in connection with his being saved, by an obvious association suggested to the mind of the apostle the use of water in our salvation, and hence led him to make the remark about the connection of baptism with our salvation. The Greek word here rendered "figure" - &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;  antitupon - "antitype" means properly, "resisting a blow or impression," (from &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;  anti and &#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  tupos;) that is, hard, solid. In the New Testament, however, it is used in a different sense; and (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;  anti) in composition, implies resemblance, correspondence and hence, the word means, "formed after a type or model; like; corresponding; that which corresponds to a type" - Robinson, Lexicon. The word occurs only in this place and <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-24.htm">Hebrews 9:24</a>, rendered "figures." The meaning here is, that baptism corresponded to, or had a resemblance to, the water by which Noah was saved; or that there was a use of water in the one case which corresponded in some respects to the water that was used in the other; to wit, in effecting salvation. The apostle does not say that it corresponded in all respects; in respect, e. g., to quantity, or to the manner of the application, or to the efficacy; but there is a sense in which water performs an important part in our salvation, as it did in his.<p>Baptism - Not the mere application of water, for that idea the apostle expressly disclaims, when he says that it involves not "putting away the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God." The sense is, that baptism, including all that is properly meant by baptism as a religious rite - that is, baptism administered in connection with true repentance, and true faith in the Lord Jesus, and when it is properly a symbol of the putting away of sin, and of the renewing influences of the Holy Spirit, and an act of unreserved dedication to God - now saves us. On the meaning of the word "baptism," see the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/3-6.htm">Matthew 3:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-16.htm">Matthew 3:16</a>.<p>Doth also now save us - The water saved Noah and his family from perishing in the flood; to wit, by bearing up the ark. Baptism, in the proper sense of the term, as above explained, where the water used is a symbol, in like manner now saves us; that is, the water is an emblem of that purifying by which we are saved. It may be said to save us, not as the meritorious cause, but as the indispensable condition of salvation. No man can be saved without that regenerated and purified heart of which baptism is the appropriate symbol, and when it would be proper to administer that ordinance. The apostle cannot have meant that water saves us in the same way in which it saved Noah, because that cannot be true. It is neither the same in quantity, nor is it applied in the same way, nor is it efficacious in the same manner. It is indeed connected with our salvation in its own proper way, as an emblem of that purifying of the heart by which we are saved. Thus, it corresponds with the salvation of Noah by water, and is the (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;  antitupon) "antitype" of that. Nor does it mean that the salvation of Noah by water was designed to be a type of Christian baptism. There is not the least evidence of that; and it should not be affirmed without proof. The apostle saw a resemblance in some respects between the one and the other; such a resemblance that the one naturally suggested the other to his mind, and the resemblance was so important as to make it the proper ground of remark.<p>(But if Noah's preservation in the ark, be the type of that salvation of which baptism is the emblem, who shall say it was not so designed of God? Must we indeed regard the resemblance between Noah's deliverance and ours, as a happy coincidence merely? But the author is accustomed to deny typical design in very clear cases; and in avoiding one extreme seems to have gone into another. Some will have types everywhere; and, therefore, others will allow them nowhere. See the supplementary note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-1.htm">Hebrews 7:1</a>; M. Knight's Essay, viii. Sect. v., on the laws of typical interpretation, with his commentary in loco)<p>The points of resemblance in the two cases seem to have been these:<p>(1) There was salvation in both; Noah was saved from death, and we are saved from hell.<p>(2) water is employed in both cases - in the case of Noah to uphold the ark; in ours to be a symbol of our purification.<p>(3) the water in both cases is connected with salvation: in the case of Noah by sustaining the ark; in ours by being a symbol of salvation, of purity, of cleansing, of that by which we may be brought to God.<p>The meaning of this part of the verse, therefore, may be thus expressed: "Noah and his family were saved by water, the antitype to which (to wit, that which in important respects corresponds to that) baptism (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, or the mere application of material water, but that purifying of the heart of which it is the appropriate emblem) now saves us."<p>Not the putting away of the filth of the flesh - Not a mere external washing, however solemnly done. No outward ablution or purifying saves us, but that which pertains to the conscience. This important clause is thrown in to guard the statement from the abuse to which it would otherwise be liable, the supposition that baptism has of itself a purifying and saving power. To guard against this, the apostle expressly declares that he means much more than a mere outward application of water.<p>But the answer of a good conscience toward God - The word here rendered "answer" (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;  epero&#772;te&#772;ma) means properly a question, an inquiry. It is "spoken of a question put to a convert at baptism, or rather of the whole process of question and answer; that is, by implication, examination, profession" - Robinson, Lexicon. It is designed to mark the spiritual character of the baptismal rite in contrast with a mere external purification, and evidently refers to something that occurred at baptism; some question, inquiry, or examination, that took place then; and it would seem to imply:<p>(1) that when baptism was performed, there was some question or inquiry in regard to the belief of the candidate;<p>(2) that an answer was expected, implying that there was a good conscience; that is, that the candidate had an enlightened conscience, and was sincere in his profession; and,<p>(3) that the real efficacy of baptism, or its power in saving, was not in the mere external rite, but in the state of the heart, indicated by the question and answer, of which that was the emblem.<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_peter/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21. whereunto&#8212;The oldest manuscripts read, "which": literally, "which (namely, water, in general; being) the antitype (of the water of the flood) is now saving (the salvation being not yet fully realized by us, compare 1Co 10:1, 2, 5; Jude 5; puts into a state of salvation) us also (two oldest manuscripts read 'you' for 'us': You also, as well as Noah and his party), to wit, baptism." Water saved Noah not of itself, but by sustaining the ark built in faith, resting on God's word: it was to him the sign and mean of a kind of regeneration, of the earth. The flood was for Noah a baptism, as the passage through the Red Sea was for the Israelites; by baptism in the flood he and his family were transferred from the old world to the new: from immediate destruction to lengthened probation; from the companionship of the wicked to communion with God; from the severing of all bonds between the creature and the Creator to the privileges of the covenant: so we by spiritual baptism. As there was a Ham who forfeited the privileges of the covenant, so many now. The antitypical water, namely, baptism, saves you also not of itself, nor the mere material water, but the spiritual thing conjoined with it, repentance and faith, of which it is the sign and seal, as Peter proceeds to explain. Compare the union of the sign and thing signified, Joh 3:5; Eph 5:26; Tit 3:5; Heb 10:22; compare 1Jo 5:6.<p>not the, &c.&#8212;"flesh" bears the emphasis. "Not the putting away of the filth of the flesh" (as is done by a mere water baptism, unaccompanied with the Spirit's baptism, compare Eph 2:11), but of the soul. It is the ark (Christ and His Spirit-filled Church), not the water, which is the instrument of salvation: the water only flowed round the ark; so not the mere water baptism, but the water when accompanied with the Spirit.<p>answer&#8212;Greek, "interrogation"; referring to the questions asked of candidates for baptism; eliciting a confession of faith "toward God" and a renunciation of Satan ([Augustine, The Creed, 4.1]; [Cyprian, Epistles, 7, To Rogatianus]), which, when flowing from "a good conscience," assure one of being "saved." Literally, "a good conscience's interrogation (including the satisfactory answer) toward God." I prefer this to the translation of Wahl, Alford and others, "inquiry of a good conscience after God": not one of the parallels alleged, not even 2Sa 11:7, in the Septuagint, is strictly in point. Recent Byzantine Greek idiom (whereby the term meant: (1) the question; (2) the stipulation; (3) the engagement), easily flowing from the usage of the word as Peter has it, confirms the former translation.<p>by the resurrection of Jesus&#8212;joined with "saves you": In so far as baptism applies to us the power of Christ's resurrection.

For where this faith is not, there can be no good conscience, nor any sincere answering what God requires of us in baptism: if men do not believe the satisfaction of Divine justice by Christ’s death, which is evidenced by his resurrection, they will not close with the offers of his grace, nor engage themselves to be the Lord’s.

The ark, and deliverance by it, as it was a type of Christ, and salvation by him, so it was a figure of baptism, and baptism was the antitype of that; or there is something in these which correspond, and answer to, and bear a resemblance to each other: as the ark was God's ordinance, and not man's invention, so is baptism, it is of heaven, and not of men; and as the ark, while it was preparing, was the scorn and derision of men, so is this ordinance of the Gospel; it was rejected with disdain by the Scribes and Pharisees, as it still is by many; and as the ark, when Noah and his family were shut up in it by God, represented a burial, and they seemed, as it were, to be buried in it, it was a lively emblem of baptism, which is expressed by a burial, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-4.htm">Romans 6:4</a> and as they in the ark had the great deep broke up under them, and the windows of heaven opened over them, pouring out waters upon them, they were, as it were, immersed in, and were covered with water, this fitly figured baptism by immersion; nor were there any but adult persons that entered into the ark, nor should any be baptized but believers; to which may be added, that as the one saved by water, so does the other; for it is water baptism which is here designed, which John practised, Christ gave a commission for, and his disciples administered: it saves not as a cause, for it has no causal influence on, nor is it essential to salvation. Christ only is the cause and author of eternal salvation; and as those only that were in the ark were saved by water, so those only that are in Christ, and that are baptized into Christ, and into his death, are saved by baptism; not everyone that is baptized, but he that believeth, and is baptized, shall be saved, <a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/16-16.htm">Mark 16:16</a>, for baptism <p>is not the putting away of the filth of the flesh; the design of it is not to take off the sordid flesh, as circumcision did; or in a ceremonious way, outwardly, to sanctify to the purifying of the flesh, as the Jewish baptisms did; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-10.htm">Hebrews 9:10</a>, or to take away either original or actual sin; this only the blood of Christ can do; and it is not a mere external cleansing of the body: <p>but the answer of a good conscience towards God; the Vulgate Latin renders it, "the interrogation of a good conscience"; referring, it may be, to the interrogations that used to be put to those who desired baptism; as, dost thou renounce Satan? dost thou believe in Christ? see <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/8-36.htm">Acts 8:36</a>, others render it, "the stipulation of a good conscience"; alluding also to the ancient custom of obliging those that were baptized to covenant and agree to live an holy life and conversation, to renounce the devil and all his works, and the pomps and vanities of this world; and baptism does certainly lay an obligation on men to walk in newness of life; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/6-4.htm">Romans 6:4</a>, the Ethiopic version renders it, "confession of God"; and to this the Syriac version agrees, rendering it, "confessing God with a pure conscience"; for, to baptism, profession of faith in Christ, and of the doctrine of Christ in a pure conscience, is requisite; and in baptism persons make a public confession of God, and openly put on Christ before men: the sense seems plainly this; that then is baptism rightly performed, and its end answered, when a person, conscious to himself of its being an ordinance of Christ, and of his duty to submit to it, does do so upon profession of his faith in Christ, in obedience to his command, and "with" a view to his glory; in doing which he discharges a good conscience towards God: and being thus performed, it saves, <p>by the resurrection of Jesus Christ; being a means of leading the faith of the baptized person, as to the blood of Christ, for pardon and cleansing, so to the resurrection of Christ, to justification; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/2-38.htm">Acts 2:38</a>, moreover, the sense of the passage may be this, that baptism is a like figure as the ark of Noah was; that as the entrance of Noah and his family into the ark was an emblem of a burial, so their coming out of it was a figure of the resurrection; and just such a figure is baptism, performed by immersion, both of the resurrection of Christ from the dead, and of the resurrection of saints to walk in newness of life.

The general term receives a more precise definition in the adjectival <span class="greekheb">ἀντίτυπον</span>, by means of which the water which now saves is contrasted as <span class="ital">antitype</span>[219] with the water which saved Noah and those with him. What this antitypical water is, is stated by the subjoined <span class="greekheb">βάπτισμα</span>, which as an apposition must be explained in the sense: “<span class="ital">as baptism</span>” (comp. Winer, p. 491 [E. T. 663]). Differently Hofmann; he would take the apposition in the sense of: “<span class="ital">a baptism namely</span>;” he says: “in the explanatory apposition the apostle substitutes the term ‘baptism’ for ‘water,’ without, by the anarthrous <span class="greekheb">βάπτισμα</span>, directly indicating Christian baptism. What kind of baptism he means is stated by the apposition subjoined to <span class="greekheb">βάπτισμα</span>.” On this it must be remarked that <span class="greekheb">βάπτισμα</span> would certainly convey to the readers only the idea of a definite Christian baptism, and that the apposition following is not fitted to mark the term baptism, indefinite in itself, as the specifically Christian baptism, but only to point out in what way baptism possesses in itself the saving power attributed to it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Without any cogent reason, Steiger interprets <span class="greekheb">βάπτισμα</span> as equivalent to “<span class="ital">baptismal water</span>.” The direct conjunction which takes place here ceases to occasion surprise, if it be considered that the typical character of the deluge, as regards baptism, consists not only in the sameness of the elements, but in the similarity of the relation of the water to those saved. If <span class="greekheb">διʼ ὕδατος</span> be rendered “through the water,” an incongruity will arise, disturbing to the parallelism, and which attempts have been made to overcome by supplying intermediate ideas. According to de Wette, the antitypical character of baptism consists in this: “that in it the flesh must perish and, as it were, <span class="ital">be judged</span>; whilst, at the same time, through faith in the resurrection of Christ, pure spiritual life is attained, and the believer saved.” By these and such like supplements, which the apostle himself in no way suggests, elements are introduced foreign to his conception.[220]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The present <span class="greekheb">σώζει</span> is put here neither instead of the preterite nor the future; it denotes rather the effect which, from the moment of its accomplishment, baptism produces on the persons who submit to it. The latter resemble the Noahites whilst by means of water they were being preserved in the ark from destruction (<span class="greekheb">ἀπώλεια</span>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The antithesis which exists between <span class="greekheb">ὑμᾶς</span> and the preceding <span class="greekheb">ὀλίγοι</span>, indicates that the proportion saved by baptism to the unbelieving is but small. <span class="greekheb">ὀλίγοι</span> has accordingly a <span class="ital">typical</span> significance. It is more doubtful whether the same is the case with the ark; Oecumenius already saw in it the church, whilst others regard it as a symbol of Jesus Christ. Thus Hemming: quemadmodum aqua per se non salvavit Noe, sed mediante area, ita aqua baptismi per se non salvat, sed mediante area, h. e. Christo Jesu.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">οὐ σαρκὸς ἀπόθεσις ῥύπου</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀλλά</span>] Apposition to <span class="greekheb">βάπτισμα</span>, which, however, does not state the nature of baptism generally, but only in what sense it effects <span class="greekheb">σώζειν</span>. This is stated first negatively, in order thereby to mark more distinctly the standpoint. Almost all commentators take <span class="greekheb">σαρκός</span> as a genitive depending on <span class="greekheb">ῥύπου</span>, and preceding it only for the sake of emphasis. Bengel, on the other hand, joins it—as genit. subj.—directly with <span class="greekheb">ἀπόθεσις</span>: “carni adscribitur depositio sordium; ideo non dicitur: depositio sordium carnis.” The sense would then be: baptism does not consist in this, “that the <span class="ital">flesh lays aside its uncleanness</span>.” This explanation, corresponding as it does to the position of the words, is well suited to the idea <span class="greekheb">ἀπόθεσις</span>, which does not necessarily presuppose the activity of the subject, but can be used when the subject is, strictly speaking, passive; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-14.htm" title="Knowing that shortly I must put off this my tabernacle, even as our Lord Jesus Christ has showed me.">2 Peter 1:14</a>, the only other passage in which the word occurs in the N. T. Hofmann is accordingly mistaken in asserting that “the laying aside of uncleanness cannot be regarded as an act of the flesh.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>An antithetical allusion to the Jewish washings can hardly be here assumed (cf. Justin M. <span class="ital">dial. c. Tryph.</span> p. 331: <span class="greekheb">τί γὰρ ὄφελος ἐκείνου τοῦ βαπτίσματος</span> (the Jewish washing), <span class="greekheb">ὃ τὴν σάρκα καὶ μόνον τὸ σῶμα φαιδρύνει</span>; <span class="greekheb">βαπτίσθητε τὴν ψυχήν</span>).[221]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἀλλὰ συνειδήσεως ἀγαθῆς ἐπερώτημα εἰς Θεόν</span>] The positive, as contrasted with the negative character of baptism, <span class="greekheb">συνειδήσεως ἀγαθῆς</span> can be either the subjective or the objective gen.[222] <span class="greekheb">ἐπερώτημα</span>, a <span class="greekheb">ἅπ</span>. <span class="greekheb">λεγ</span>. in the N. T. (in the O. T. only once, LXX. <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-14.htm" title="He cried aloud, and said thus, Hew down the tree, and cut off his branches, shake off his leaves, and scatter his fruit: let the beasts get away from under it, and the fowls from his branches:">Daniel 4:14</a>, as a translation of <span class="greekheb">שְׁאֵלְתָּא</span>), is used in classical Greek only in the sense of “<span class="ital">question</span>.” Holding by this meaning, commentators have explained it as—(1) the <span class="ital">question concerning a good conscience addressed to God</span> (thus Wiesinger, who, however, prefers the translation “<span class="ital">inquiry</span>” to “question”), or (2) “the <span class="ital">question of a good conscience directed to God</span>” (Gerhard, Steiger, Besser). The first of these renderings is not in harmony with the nature of baptism, inasmuch as the person to be baptized already knows how the good conscience is to be obtained. From the second there results only an incomplete idea, necessitating arbitrary supplements.[223] Now, as <span class="greekheb">ἐπερωτᾷν</span>, which doubtless means only “<span class="ital">to ask a question</span>,” is used also of such questions as would obtain something from the person asked (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-1.htm" title="The Pharisees also with the Sadducees came, and tempting desired him that he would show them a sign from heaven.">Matthew 16:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/137-3.htm" title="For there they that carried us away captive required of us a song; and they that wasted us required of us mirth, saying, Sing us one of the songs of Zion.">Psalm 137:3</a>, LXX.), the meaning has been assigned to <span class="greekheb">ἐπερώτημα</span>: “<span class="ital">the inquiring desire</span>,” “<span class="ital">the inquiring request</span>.” Some commentators here take <span class="greekheb">συν</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἀγ</span>. as a <span class="ital">subj</span>. gen., and interpret: “<span class="ital">the request of a good conscience addressed to God</span>” (thus Bengel, with whom Schmid, <span class="ital">Bibl. Theol. des N.T</span>. p. 199, agrees: salvat nos rogatio bonae conscientiae, i. e. rogatio, qua nos Deum compellamus cum bona conscientia, peccatis remissis et depositis[224]); but this also gives rise to an incomplete idea, inasmuch as the contents of the request are not stated. On this rendering of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΠΕΡΏΤΗΜΑ</span></span></span> it is better to regard the gen. as an <span class="ital">object</span>. gen., thus: “<span class="ital">the request addressed to God for a good conscience</span>; “Lutz, Lechler, Weiss, Weizsäcker (Reuter’s <span class="ital">Repert</span>. 1858, H. 3), Hofmann, Schott; Wiesinger, too, is inclined to agree.[225] But to this also objections which cannot be overlooked arise: (1) Although the reception of baptism be founded on the desire for a reconciled conscience, yet it does not follow that baptism itself can be described as the expression of this desire; (2) Taken thus, the proper meaning of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΠΕΡΏΤΗΜΑ</span></span></span> is entirely lost sight of; the word is used in a sense in which it occurs nowhere else,—a proceeding which is all the more open to question that the apostle had certainly other words at his command wherewith to give the idea of request; (3) The object which the recipient of baptism requests, namely, “the reconciled conscience,” is inadequately expressed by <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΣΥΝΕΊΔΗΣΙς ἈΓΑΘΉ</span></span></span>, for here no stress is laid on the essential element—the forgiveness of sin; lastly, (4) In this interpretation <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΕἸς ΘΕΌΝ</span></span></span> is only of secondary importance, whilst the passages, chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-21.htm" title="Who by him do believe in God, that raised him up from the dead, and gave him glory; that your faith and hope might be in God.">1 Peter 1:21</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-18.htm" title="For Christ also has once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:">1 Peter 3:18</a>, show that the chief emphasis lies on <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΕἸς ΘΕΌΝ</span></span></span>.[226]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Even from early times interpreters have attempted to explain <span class="greekheb">ἐπερώτημα</span> in this passage, not according to common, but according to juristic usage, taking it as equal to <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΣΎΜΦΩΝΟΝ</span></span></span>, stipulatio mutua, contract (Luther: “covenant”), referring at the same time to the act of question and answer, which took place at baptism: <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΠΟΤΆΣΣῌ Τῷ ΣΑΤΑΝᾶ</span>; <span class="greekheb">ἈΠΟΤΆΣΣΟΜΑΙ</span>· <span class="greekheb">ΣΥΝΤΆΣΣῌ Τῷ ΧΡΙΣΤῷ</span></span></span>; <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΣΥΝΤΆΣΣΟΜΑΙ</span>·<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> abrenuntias? abrenuntio; credis? credo (Tertull. lib. de resurr. cam.: anima non lavatione, sed responsione sancitur).

De Wette’s is likewise wrong: “by metonymy, because questions were addressed to the individual who took the vow, <span class="greekheb">ἐπερωτᾶσθαι</span> acquired the meaning promittere, spondere, and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΠΕΡΏΤΗΜΑ</span></span></span> that of sponsio;” for <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΠΕΡΏΤΗΜΑ</span></span></span> is not derived from <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΠΕΡΩΤᾶΣΘΑΙ</span></span></span>, but from <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΠΕΡΩΤᾷΝ</span></span></span>, and therefore never had or could have had the signification: “<span class="ital">solemn pledge</span>.” Further, it has been not unjustly remarked, in opposition to this view, according to which <span class="greekheb">συν</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἀγ</span>. is considered as an <span class="ital">object</span>. gen, that it would have been better to have spoken of <span class="greekheb">ἀναστροφὴ ἀγαθή</span> as that which has to be vowed.[227] Brückner has substantially corrected de Wette by pointing out that in the language of the Byzantine lawyers <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΠΕΡΩΤᾷΝ</span></span></span> is used in the sense: “to conclude a treaty, a contract, stipulari,” taking <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΣΥΝ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἈΓ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> as a <span class="ital">subject</span>, gen. But his exposition suffers from an uncertain wavering, for he too declares <span class="greekheb">ἐπερώτημα</span> to be synonymous with “<span class="ital">treaty</span>,” indeed with “<span class="ital">vow</span>,” which is certainly not the case. The facts are these: a contract was concluded in the form of question and answer: spondesne? spondeo (comp. Puchta, <span class="ital">Curs. der Instit.</span> v. 3, p. 97); by the question, on the one side, the agreement was proposed; by the reply, on the other, it was concluded. <span class="greekheb">ἐπερώτημα</span> is then this question by which the conclusion of a contract began, not then the contract itself, and still less the pledge which was taken rather by him who replied. The questioner bound himself by his question to accept that which he who gave the reply promised. If, then, the designation of baptism as <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΣΥΝΕΙΔΉΣΕΩς ἈΓ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἘΠΕΡΏΤΗΜΑ ΕἸς ΘΕΌΝ</span></span></span> is to be explained from legal procedure, it can only be spoken of as such, inasmuch as the person baptized, by the reception of baptism, enters into a relation—as it were of contract—with God, in which he submits in faith to God’s promise of salvation. Nor can it be denied that this is really in harmony with the nature of baptism, more especially if it be considered that in the legal proceedings, connected with the conclusion of a contract, the respondent pronounced his spondeo in the expectation that the interrogator would fulfil the conditions previously stipulated, to which he had pledged himself. This explains the expression <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΣΥΝΕΙΔΉΣΕΩς ἈΓΑΘῆς</span></span></span>, which points to the circumstance that the recipient of baptism, in submitting to it, has the honest purpose faithfully to fulfil the conditions under which the divine assent is given. This interpretation is distinguished from those above mentioned by its concrete precision. No doubt <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΠΕΡΏΤΗΜΑ</span></span></span> in this juristic sense is to be found only in writings of a later date; but since this form of concluding a contract belonged to an earlier time, it may be assumed that the word had previously been in use thus in legal phraseology.[228] The adjunct: <span class="greekheb">διʼ ἀναστάσεως Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ</span>, by referring back to <span class="greekheb">ζωοποιηθεὶς δὲ πνεύματι</span>, brings the apostle again to his former train of thought. The words are not appended in a loose way to <span class="greekheb">ἐπερώτημα</span> for the purpose of stating how this is effected, as Grotius, Pott, Hensler, Zezschwitz, Hofmann, Schott, and others assume;[229] they are rather conjoined with the verb of the clause <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΣΏΖΕΙ</span></span></span>, inasmuch as they state that through which the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΒΆΠΤΙΣΜΑ</span></span></span> exercises its saving effect (de Wette, Wiesinger, Weiss). The former construction is the less justifiable, that it is more natural to unite the concluding adjunct with the leading idea than with the secondary thought which specifies the nature of baptism. It is still less appropriate to connect the words directly with <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΣΥΝΕΙΔΉΣΕΩς ἈΓ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> (as against Fronmüller).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[219] Raphelius: <span class="greekheb">τύπος</span> res aliud quid praefigurans, <span class="greekheb">ἀντίτυπος</span> res ilia praefigurata. <span class="greekheb">ἀντίτυπος</span> has another meaning in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-24.htm" title="For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us:">Hebrews 9:24</a>, where the <span class="greekheb">τύπος</span> is the <span class="greekheb">ἀληθινόν</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[220] Schott, indeed, justly remarks “that the antitypical nature of baptism, and therefore the typical nature of that to which baptism corresponds as antitype, consists precisely in what is asserted of both, namely, in their saving power and effect.” He thinks, however, “that the antitypical nature of the water applies to what was essentially peculiar to the great flood.” What this is he explains by saying that “the flood was a judgment which destroyed mankind from the earth, so that from out of it only a small number, belonging to the church of believers, were saved;” that is, “it was a judgment of extirpation in such a way that it was the means of effecting a salvation.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[221] Augustin’s opinion (<span class="ital">contr. Faust.</span> c. 12 et 13), with which Beda and others agree, is quite inappropriate. It is, that the apostle here alludes to the baptism of the heretics. Calvin’s assertion, too, that this negative apposition emphasizes the fact that baptism, as an outward form, is of no use, introduces a foreign idea into the words of the apostle.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[222] This is denied, indeed, by several commentators, specially by Hofmann and Schott, because a good conscience does not precede, but is the fruit of baptism. But this assertion presupposes the identification of the <span class="ital">good</span> conscience with that conscience which by Christ is reconciled with God, and is released from the feeling of guilt. For this, however, the N. T. phraseology gives no warrant. According to it, <span class="greekheb">συνείδησις ἀγαθή</span> rather means: “the consciousness of pure intentions,” or “the consciousness of sincerely willing that which is good”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[223] Gerhard: quomodo deus erga baptizatum affectus sit, etc.; Steiger: “for the salvation of which he who receives baptism would be assured;” Besser: Art thou not my father? am I not thy child? The interpretation given in the <span class="ital">Erlanger Zeitschrift</span>, 1856, p. 293 ff., is evidently altogether erroneous: “the proof of the good conscience attained in baptism is the <span class="greekheb">ἐπερώτημα εἰς Θ</span>., <span class="ital">i.e.</span> the question: Am I not saved by my baptism from the judgment on an unbelieving world?” Apart from all else, the matter here treated of is not a question which is only put after baptism, since baptism itself is designated as the <span class="greekheb">ἐπερώτημα</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[224] To this interpretation of Bengel, Hofmann rightly objects: “that <span class="greekheb">ἐπερώτημα</span> cannot well mean something which presupposes the reception of baptism;” but if the “peccatis remissis et depositis” be not looked upon as belonging to the idea of a good conscience, Hofmann’s objection loses its validity.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[225] The same view is to be found already in Seb. Schmidius, only that he regards <span class="greekheb">ἐπερ</span>. as meaning the petitio addressed to God by him who baptizes, and <span class="greekheb">συν</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἀγ</span>. as the gift which he implores for the person baptized; evidently this is entirely arbitrary.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[226] Hofmann, in support of the interpretation here called in question, appeals to the circumstance, “that the petition for the cleansing of the conscience from past sins forms the only suitable antithesis to the putting away of filth contracted outwardly.” But it must be remarked in opposition, that however suitable this antithesis may appear in itself, it does not follow that the apostle had it in his mind in the way here stated. It is rather improbable that he had, since in this positive nearer definition of baptism its application to <span class="ital">cleansing</span> is in no way alluded to.—The explanation given in <span class="ital">Weissagung und Erfüllung</span>, II. p. 234: “the <span class="ital">happiness</span> of a good conscience <span class="ital">asked</span> of God,” he passes over in silence in his <span class="ital">Schriftbeweis</span>, II. 2.—The interpretation given by Winer in the 5th ed. of his <span class="ital">Gr.</span>: “The inquiry of a good conscience after God, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> the turning to God, the seeking Him,” does not occur in the subsequent editions, nor is there any justification for it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[227] Estius, Beza, Grotius, Semler, Pott, Hensler, etc., interpret similarly to de Wette,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[228] After the explanation here given, it is evidently incorrect when Hofmann says that “<span class="greekheb">ἐπερώτημα</span> could only be the question addressed by him who closes an agreement, to the person who is to consent to it.” The very opposite is the case. The question is not addressed from the former to the latter, but from the latter to the former; that is, then, not from God to the person baptized, but from the person baptized to God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[229] <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-7.htm" title="And Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD besides, that we might inquire of him?">1 Kings 22:7</a> : <span class="greekheb">ἔτι εἷς ἔστιν ἀνὴρ εἰς τὸ ἐπερωτῆσαι διʼ αὐτοῦ τὸν κύριον</span>, has been appealed to in favour of this construction. Erroneously, since <span class="greekheb">διʼ αὐτοῦ</span> applies to a person. Between it, therefore, and <span class="greekheb">διʼ ἀναστάσεως</span> no parallel can be drawn.—According to Hofmann, <span class="greekheb">διά</span> states that which the person baptized <span class="ital">appeals</span> to in support of his desire for the remission of sin. The passages, however, which he quotes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-10.htm" title="Now I beseech you, brothers, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that you be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment.">1 Corinthians 1:10</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-1.htm" title="I beseech you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service.">Romans 12:1</a>) by no means prove that the prep. <span class="greekheb">διά</span> has this signification.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-18.htm" title="Pray for us: for we trust we have a good conscience, in all things willing to live honestly.">Hebrews 13:18</a> : <span class="greekheb">καλὴν συνείδησιν ἔχομεν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἐν πᾶσι καλῶς θέλοντες ἀναστρέφεθαι</span>; cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-16.htm" title="Having a good conscience; that, whereas they speak evil of you, as of evildoers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation in Christ.">1 Peter 3:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-1.htm" title="And Paul, earnestly beholding the council, said, Men and brothers, I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day.">Acts 23:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-5.htm" title="Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned:">1 Timothy 1:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-19.htm" title="Holding faith, and a good conscience; which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck:">1 Timothy 1:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-9.htm" title="Holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.">1 Timothy 3:9</a>).

The following definition by exclusion contrasts Christian baptism with Jewish and pagan lustrations and also with the Deluge which was a removal of sin-fouled flesh from the sinners of old (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-6.htm" title="For for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.">1 Peter 4:6</a>); the former affected the flesh and not the conscience (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-13.htm" title="For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifies to the purifying of the flesh:">Hebrews 9:13</a> f.), the latter removed the flesh but not the spiritual defilement proceeding from past sin. <span class="greekheb">σαρκός</span> and <span class="greekheb">συνειδήσεως</span> stand before their belongings for emphasis and not merely in accordance with prevalent custom. For <span class="greekheb">ἀπόθεσις ῥύπου</span> compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/4-4.htm" title="When the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the middle thereof by the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of burning.">Isaiah 4:4</a> (sequel of the description of the daughters of Zion which is used above <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-3.htm" title="Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel;">1 Peter 3:3</a>), <span class="ital">Jehovah shall wash away their filth</span> (<span class="greekheb">τὸν ῥύπον</span>: LXX chivalrously prefixes <span class="ital">of the sons and</span>). <span class="greekheb">ἐπερώτημα</span> is explained by Oecumenius as meaning <span class="ital">earnest, pledge</span> as in Byzantine Greek law. Its use for the questions put to the candidate in the baptismal service (dost thou renou nee.…?) is probably due to St. Peter here. In ordinary Greek (Herodotus and Thucydides) it = <span class="ital">question</span> <span class="greekheb">ἐπ</span>. having no force, as if implying a second additional question arising out of the first). Here the noun corresponds to the verb as used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-1.htm" title="I am sought of them that asked not for me; I am found of them that sought me not: I said, Behold me, behold me, to a nation that was not called by my name.">Isaiah 65:1</a>, quoted by St. Paul in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-20.htm" title="But Esaias is very bold, and said, I was found of them that sought me not; I was made manifest to them that asked not after me.">Romans 10:20</a>, <span class="greekheb">ἐμφανὴς ἐγενόμην τοῖς ἐμὲ μὴ ἐπερωτῶσι</span> = (1) a seeking, quest after God or (2) <span class="ital">request addressed to God</span> (supported by <span class="greekheb">εἰς</span> <span class="ital">cf.</span> the formula <span class="greekheb">ἔντευξις εἰς τὸ βασίλεως ὄνομα</span>, a petition addressed to the king’s majesty). In the latter case Peter will still be thinking as above and below of the disobedient spirits who presented a petition (<span class="greekheb">ἐρώτη σις</span>) to God inspired by an evil conscience (see Enoch summarised above). At any rate <span class="greekheb">συνειδ</span>. is probably subjective or possessive rather than objective genitive. The believer who comes to baptism has believed in Christ and repented of his past sins, renounces them and the spirits which prompted them and appeals to God for strength to carry out this renunciation in his daily life.—<span class="greekheb">διʼ ἀναστ</span>. with <span class="greekheb">σώζει</span>; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/15-13.htm" title="But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen:...">1 Corinthians 15:13-17</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/1_peter/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">21</span>. <span class="ital">The like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us</span>] The MSS. present two readings; one that of the <span class="ital">Textus Receptus</span>, answering to the English Version as giving the relative pronoun in the dative, the other, supported by the better MSS., giving the pronoun in the nominative, “which also” (sc. the element of water) “the <span class="bld">antitype</span> [of the deluge,] doth even now save us,” and then he adds, as explaining what was the antitype, the word “baptism” in apposition with the subject of the sentence. At first it seems hard to see the parallelism between the flood which destroyed and the baptism which saves, but reflection will shew that the Apostle may well have thought of the deluge as burying the old evils of the world and giving the human race, as it were, a fresh start, under new and better conditions, a world, in some sense, regenerated or brought into a new covenant with God, and therefore new relations to Him. Does not the teaching of the previous verse suggest the inference that he thought of the flood as having been even for those who perished in it, not merely an instrument of destruction, but as placing even the souls of the disobedient in a region in which they were not shut out from the pitying love of the Father who there also did not “will that any should perish”?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">not the putting away of the filth of the flesh</span>] The Greek word for “putting away” may be noted as one of those common to the two Epistles (see note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-14.htm" title="Knowing that shortly I must put off this my tabernacle, even as our Lord Jesus Christ has showed me.">2 Peter 1:14</a>). The implied protest against the notion that this was all that was meant by Christian baptism, though it might be necessary both for Jewish and heathen converts, gains immensely in its significance if we think of the Epistle as addressed mainly to the former class. They were in danger of looking upon baptism, not as the sacrament of a new birth, but as standing on the same level as the “washing” or “baptism” (the same word is used) of the older ritual. So, even during the ministry of the Baptist, there was a dispute between some of his disciples and the Jews “about purification” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-25.htm" title="Then there arose a question between some of John's disciples and the Jews about purifying.">John 3:25</a>), obviously rising out of that confusion of thought. So it formed part of the elementary instruction of Christian catechumens that they should learn the “doctrine of baptisms” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-2.htm" title="Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.">Hebrews 6:2</a>), i.e. the distinction between the Jewish and the Christian rites that went almost or altogether[18] by the same name. St Peter warns men against the perilous thought that they washed away their sins by the mere outward act. So far as he may have contemplated heathen converts at all we may remember that they too thought of guilt as washed away by a purely ceremonial institution. So Ovid, <span class="ital">Fast</span>. ii. 45,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[18] The tendency to desynonymize led to the term <span class="ital">baptisma</span> in the neuter being used of the Christian rite, while the masculine <span class="ital">baptismos</span> was used in a more generic sense.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“Full easy souls who dream the crystal flood<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Can wash away the deep-dyed stain of blood.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[Ah, nimium faciles qui tristia crimina caedis<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Fluminea tolli posse putetis aqua.]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Comp. also Juven. <span class="ital">Sat</span>. vi. 522, Persius, <span class="ital">Sat</span>. ii. 15, Horace, <span class="ital">Sat</span>. ii. 3.290. History records but too many instances of the revival of a like superstition. The tendency to postpone baptism in order to cancel the sins that were in the meantime accumulating, and avoid the danger of postbaptismal sin, of which we see conspicuous instances in the lives of Constantine and Augustine, the mediæval dogma still lingering in popular belief, that unbaptized infants are excluded from salvation; these are examples of ways of looking at baptism more or less analogous to that which St Peter condemns. With him the saving power of baptism varies with the activity and purity of the moral consciousness of the baptized.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">but the answer of a good conscience toward God</span>] The words admit of very different interpretations. (1) The Greek word translated “answer” means primarily “<span class="bld">question,</span>” “enquiry.” If this sense be admitted here, there would then rise the question whether the words “of a good conscience” were in the genitive of the subject or the object. If the former, the condition on which St Peter lays stress would be equivalent to (<span class="ital">a</span>) the enquiry of a good conscience, the seeking of the soul after God; if the latter, that condition would be (<span class="ital">b</span>) the prayer addressed to God for a good conscience. Neither of these interpretations, however, is satisfactory. <span class="bld">It is against (<span class="ital">a</span>) that</span> it is the idea of baptism that men are no longer seeking God but have found Him. It is against (<span class="ital">b</span>) that it is also the idea of baptism that it is more than the asking for a gift. A true solution is found partly in the forensic use of the Greek word for question, as including, like our word “examination,” both question and answer, and so applied to the whole process of a covenant, the conditions of which were determined by mutual interrogatories and affirmative or negative replies, and partly in the fact that at a date so early that it is reasonable to infer an Apostolic origin, the liturgical administration of baptism involved interrogatories and answers, in substance identical with those that have been in use in the Church at large and are in use still. “Dost thou renounce Satan?” “I do renounce him.” “Dost thou believe in Christ?” “I do believe in Him,” the second question sometimes taking the form “Dost thou take thy stand with Christ?” and the answer, “I do take my stand.” In this practice of interrogation then we find that which explains St Peter’s meaning. That which is of the essence of the saving power of baptism is the confession and the profession which precedes it. If that comes from a conscience (see notes on chaps. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-19.htm" title="For this is thank worthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure grief, suffering wrongfully.">1 Peter 2:19</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-16.htm" title="Having a good conscience; that, whereas they speak evil of you, as of evildoers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation in Christ.">1 Peter 3:16</a>) that really renounces sin and believes on Christ, then baptism, as the channel through which the grace of the new birth is conveyed and the convert admitted into the Church of Christ, “saves us,” but not otherwise. The practice of Infant Baptism, though the scales of argument both as regards Scripture and antiquity turn in its favour, presents, it must be admitted, an apparent inversion of the right order, though the idea is still retained in the questions put to the sponsors who answer in the infant’s name, as his representatives. If the question is asked, What then is the effect of Infant Baptism? the answer must be found, that it is, in the language of Scripture, as a new birth, the admission into new conditions of life, into, as it were, the citizenship of a new country. It gives the promise and potency of life, but its power to save the man that grows out of the infant varies with the fulfilment of the conditions when consciousness is developed. Now, as when St Peter wrote, it is not the “putting away the filth of the flesh” that saves, but “the answer of a good conscience towards God.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">by the resurrection of Jesus Christ</span>] So far the words have brought before us the human side of baptism. But the rite has also a divine side and this the last words of the verse bring before us. Baptism derives its power to save from the Resurrection of Christ. It brings us into union with the life of Him who “was dead and is alive for evermore” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-18.htm" title="I am he that lives, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for ever more, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death.">Revelation 1:18</a>).

The oldest manuscripts also read "you" instead of "us." The antecedent of the relative  must be the word immediately preceding, <span class="greek">&#x1f55;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, water; the word "baptism" is added in apposition, to define more clearly the apostle's meaning; the water which saves is the water of baptism. Thus the literal translation will be, "Which (as) antitype is saving you also, (namely) baptism;" that is, the water which is saving you is the antitype of the water of the Flood. That water was made the means of saving a few; it bore up the ark in which they were. It saved them, perhaps, from the malice of the ungodly; it saved them from that corruption which was almost universal; it was the means of saving the race of men as by a new birth through death into a new life, a new beginning; it washed away the evil, those who suffered for evil-doing, and so saved those who had doubtless been suffering for well-doing. Thus it is the figure (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) of the antitype (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) baptism; the two (the water of the Flood and the water of baptism) correspond as type and antitype. The <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> is the counterpart of the <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>; and as <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> sometimes means the original, sometimes the figure, there is a correspondent variation in the meaning of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>. Delitzsch says, on <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-24.htm">Hebrews 9:24</a>, "We have found <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> at 1 Peter 8:5 used in the sense of an original figure - a model from which a copy is made; such copy from an original (or architype) is that designated as <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;</span> here. <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> again (as at <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-14.htm">Romans 5:14</a>) is used in the sense of a prophetic foretype, of which the accomplishment is reserved for the future (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>); and that accomplishment is again called <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> (antitype); <span class="accented">e.g.</span> baptism, at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-21.htm">1 Peter 3:21</a>, is in this sense an <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> of the Deluge. The earthly reflection of the heavenly archetype, and the actual fulfillment of the prophetic <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, are each called <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>." Here the water of the Flood is the prophetic foretype; baptism is the accomplishment. "Baptism," St. Peter says, "is saving you," the few Christians, separating you from the vast number of Gentiles, whom in some sense it condemns through their rejection of God's offered mercy (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-7.htm">Hebrews 11:7</a>), saving you from the corruption of their evil example, bringing you into the ark of Christ's Church, bearing up that ark through the grace of the new birth. The apostle says, "Baptism is saving you;" he does not say, "hits saved;" he is using the present tense in its proper sense of an incomplete action; it brings us into a state of salvation, into covenant with God. But it is only the beginning, the birth; the growth must follow; the death unto sin, the new birth unto righteousness, must be realized in actual life; otherwise, alas! we shall have received the grace of God in vain (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-5.htm">Titus 3:5</a>). (<span class="cmt_word">Not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God.)</span> St. Peter hastens to explain his statement. Baptism doth save us, but not the mere outward ceremony; you may "make clean the outside" with the most scrupulous care; you may be very careful in putting away the filth of the flesh (or, if the genitive is to be regarded as subjective, with Bengel, the flesh may put away its filth); but more is needed than the old Jewish washings, the frequent purifications.

Observe that St. Peter uses the word here rendered "putting away" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) again in the Second Epistle (1. 14) of putting off the earthly tabernacle (comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-1.htm">1 Peter 2:1</a>, where he uses the corresponding participle, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>). The next clause presents great difficulty. Is the genitive subjective or objective? What is the meaning of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>? The word <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> occurs only in one other place in the Greek Scriptures (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-14.htm">Daniel 4:14</a> [in the Authorized Version, 4:17D, where it is translated "demand;" the corresponding verb is of frequent occurrence; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-20.htm">Romans 10:20</a>, "them that asked not after me;" and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-7.htm">2 Kings 11:7</a> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-7.htm">2 Samuel 11:7</a>, in the Authorized Version), where it is joined with the preposition <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span>, as in this verse. Thus <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> seems to mean an "inquiry," and the genitive is probably subjective. The inner meaning of baptism is not that the flesh puts away its filth, but that a good conscience inquires after God. The outward and visible sign doth not save if separated from the inward and spiritual grace. The first is necessary, for it is an outward sign appointed by Christ; but it will not save without the second; those who draw near to God must have their bodies washed with pure water, but also their hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-22.htm">Hebrews 10:22</a>). The inner cleansing of the soul results in a good conscience, a consciousness of sincerity, of good intentions and desires, which will instinctively seek after God. And that good conscience is the effect of baptism, when baptism has its perfect work, when those who have once been grafted into the true Vine abide in Christ, when those who have once been baptized in one Spirit into one body keep the unity of the Spirit, Christ dwelling in them, and they in Christ. Archbishop Leighton explains the word <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> as "the whole correspondence of the conscience with God, and with itself as towards God, or in the sight of God." If the genitive is regarded as objective, the meaning will be, "an inquiry addressed to God for a good conscience;" the soul, once awakened, seeks continually fuller purification, hungers and thirsts after righteousness. This gives a good sense, but seems less suitable in this context. It is possible also to join the preposition <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> with <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> in the sense of a good conscience in relation to God; but it seems much more natural to connect it with <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>. Some commentators follow AEcumenius in paraphrasing <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> by <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x1fe5;&#x1fe4;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>; they take the ground that, in legal language, the word was used in the sense of a contract, and they see in St. Peter's words a reference to the covenant made with God in baptism, and to the questions and answers in which, from the earliest times, that covenant was expressed; <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> being used in a general sense so as to cover answers as well as questions. This is a possible alternative, but the word seems to have acquired this meaning in later times. <span class="cmt_word">By the resurrection of Jesus Christ</span>.

In classical Greek the word means a question and nothing else. The meaning here is much disputed, and can hardly be settled satisfactorily. The rendering answer has no warrant. The meaning seems to be (as Alford), "the seeking after God of a good and pure conscience, which is the aim and end of the Christian baptismal life." So Lange: "The thing asked may be conceived as follows: 'How shall I rid myself of an evil conscience? Wilt thou, most holy God, again accept me, a sinner? Wilt thou, Lord Jesus, grant me the communion of thy death and life? Wilt thou, O Holy Spirit, assure me of grace and adoption, and dwell in my heart?' To these questions the triune Jehovah answers in baptism, 'Yea!' Now is laid the solid foundation for a good conscience. The conscience is not only purified from its guilt, but it receives new vital power by means of the resurrection of Jesus Christ."<p>This is the sense of &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#834;&#837;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2;, in the only place where it occurs in scripture, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-7.htm">2 Samuel 11:7</a> (Sept.): "David asked of him how Joab did (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bd; &#x399;&#787;&#x3c9;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b2;)." Lit., with reference to the peace of Joab. Rev. renders, the interrogation, and puts inquiry, appeal, in margin. </body></html>
