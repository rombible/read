What he means by this “suffering,” which is so much more than being “harmed,” may be seen from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-21.htm" title="For even hereunto were you called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that you should follow his steps:">1Peter 2:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-17.htm" title="For it is better, if the will of God be so, that you suffer for well doing, than for evil doing.">1Peter 3:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-1.htm" title="For as much then as Christ has suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin;">1Peter 4:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-15.htm" title="But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as an evildoer, or as a busybody in other men's matters.">1Peter 4:15</a>. He means the horrors of capital punishment. He does not speak of this as something that was already occurring, nor as though it were something immediately and certainly impending, but as a case well supposable. There had then as yet been no martyrdoms in Asia. The letter is therefore earlier in date than the Apocalypse (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-13.htm" title="I know your works, and where you dwell, even where Satan's seat is: and you hold fast my name, and have not denied my faith, even in those days wherein Antipas was my faithful martyr, who was slain among you, where Satan dwells.">Revelation 2:13</a>). It is a noticeable point that in all St. Paul’s Epistles the word “to suffer” occurs but seven times, and nowhere twice in the same Epistle; whereas it comes twelve times in this one short Letter of St. Peter.<p><span class= "bld">For righteousness’</span> <span class= "bld">sake.</span>—Like the “suffering wrongfully” of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-19.htm" title="For this is thank worthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure grief, suffering wrongfully.">1Peter 2:19</a>. It is not <span class= "ital">as</span> suffering that it is valuable.<p><span class= "bld">Happy are ye.</span>—Quite the right word: yet the use of it obscures the obvious reference to the Sermon on the Mount (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-10.htm" title="Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.">Matthew 5:10</a>). The reference to it is all the clearer in the Greek from the significant way in which St. Peter leaves his sentence incomplete, merely giving the catchword of the beatitude. We might represent it to ourselves by putting “Blessed” in inverted commas, and a dash after it. He makes sure his readers will catch the allusion. There is no part of our Lord’s discourses which seems (from the traces in the earliest Christian literature) to have taken so rapid and firm a hold on the Christian conscience as the Sermon on the Mount.<p><span class= "bld">Be not afraid of their terror.</span>—Here the translators might with advantage have kept the same word, and said (as in the original passage from which St. Peter is quoting, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-12.htm" title="Say you not, A confederacy, to all them to whom this people shall say, A confederacy; neither fear you their fear, nor be afraid.">Isaiah 8:12</a>), <span class= "ital">Fear ye not their fear</span>—<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the thing which makes them fear; do not regard with dread the same object as they do. In the original, the persons whose fears Isaiah and the faithful Jews are not to fear are those who were in dread of Syria and Israel. Here the persons are not named; but, of course, according to this interpretation, “they” cannot be the enemies who try to harm the Christians, but, if any one, those of the Christians who, for fear of man, were beginning to abandon Christianity. The intention, however, is not to press this clause for its own sake, but to throw greater force upon the clause which begins the next verse. It argues carelessness about the passage in Isaiah to interpret, “Be not afraid of the fear which your foes strike into you.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/maclaren/1_peter/3.htm">MacLaren's Expositions</a></div>1 Peter<span class="bld"><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>HALLOWING CHRIST</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_peter/3-14.htm" title="But and if you suffer for righteousness' sake, happy are you: and be not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled;...">1 Peter 3:14-15</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>These words are a quotation from the prophet Isaiah, with some very significant variations. As originally spoken, they come from a period of the prophet’s life when he was surrounded by conspirators against him, eager to destroy, and when he had been giving utterance to threatening prophecies as to the coming up of the King of Assyria, and the voice of God encouraged him and his disciples with the ringing words: ‘Fear not their fear, nor be afraid. Sanctify the Lord of Hosts Himself, and let Him be your fear, and let Him be your dread, and He shall be for a sanctuary.’ Peter was in similar circumstances. The gathering storm of persecution of the Christians as Christians seems to have been rising on his horizon, and he turns to his brethren, and commends to them the old word which long ago had been spoken to and by the prophet. But the variations are very remarkable. The Revised Version correctly reads my text thus: ‘Fear not their fear, neither be troubled, but sanctify in your hearts Christ as Lord.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. We have first to note the substitution, as a matter of course, without any need for explanation or vindication, of Jesus Christ in place of the Jehovah of the Old Testament.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>There is no doubt that the reading adopted in the Revised Version is the true one, as attested by weighty evidence in the manuscripts, and in itself more probable by reason of its very difficulty. The other reading adopted in Authorised Versions is likely to have arisen from a marginal note which crept into the text, and was due to some copyist who was struck by Peter’s free handling of the passage, and wished to make the quotations verbally accurate.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Now, if we think for a moment of the Jew’s reverence for the letter of Scripture, and then think again of the Jew’s intense monotheism and dread of putting any creature into the place of God, we shall understand how saturated with the belief in the divinity of Jesus Christ, and how convinced that it was the vital centre of all Christian teaching, this Apostle must have been when, without a word of explanation, he took his pen, and, as it were, drew it through ‘Lord God’ in Isaiah’s words, and wrote in capitals over it, ‘Christ as Lord.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>What does that mean? Some of us would, perhaps, hesitate to say that it means that He who was all through the growing ages of brightening revelation of old, named ‘Jehovah,’ is now named Jesus Christ. I believe that from the beginning He whom we call, according to the teaching of the great prologue of John’s Gospel, the ‘Word of God,’ was the Agent of all Divine revelation. But whether that be so or no, whether we have the right to say that the same Person who was revealed as ‘Jehovah’ is now revealed as ‘Jesus Christ,’ the ‘Word made flesh,’ or no, we distinctly fail to apprehend who and what Jesus Christ was to the writer of this epistle, and fail to sanctify Him in our hearts, unless we say: ‘To Thee belongeth all that belongs to God.’ That is the first great truth that comes out of these words, and I would commend it to any of you who may be hesitating about that Christian fact of the true divinity of Jesus Christ. You cannot strike it out of the New Testament, and if you try to do so you tear the book to pieces, and reduce it to rags and tatters.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Further, mark here what the Apostle means by the Christian sanctifying of Christ.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>That is a strange expression. How am I to sanctify Jesus Christ? Well, it is the same word that is used in the Lord’s Prayer, and perhaps its use there may throw light on Peter’s meaning here. ‘Hallowed be Thy name’--explains the meaning of hallowing Christ as Lord in our hearts. We sanctify or hallow one who is holy already, when we recognise the holiness, and honour what we recognise. So that the plain meaning of the commandments here is: set Christ in your hearts on the pedestal and pinnacle that belongs to Him, and then bow down before Him with all reverence and submission. Be sure that you give Him all that is His due, and in the love of your hearts, as well as in the thinkings of your minds, recognise Him for what He is, the Lord. Let us take care that our thoughts about Jesus Christ are full of devout awe and reverence. I venture to think that a great deal of modern and sentimental Christianity is very defective in this respect. You cannot love Jesus Christ too much, but you can love Him with too little reverence. And if you take up some of our luscious modern hymns that people are so fond of singing, I think you will find in them a twang of unwholesomeness, just because the love is not reverent enough, and the approaching confidence has not enough of devout awe in it. This generation looks at the half of Christ. When people are suffering from indigestion, they can only see half of the thing that they look at, and there are many of us that can only see a part of the whole Christ: and so, forgetting that He is judge, and forgetting that He is the Lion of the tribe of Judah, and forgetting that whilst He is manifested in the flesh our brother He is also God manifest in the flesh, our Creator as well as our Redeemer, and our Judge as well as our Saviour, some do not enough hallow Him in their hearts as Lord.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Peter had heard Jesus say that ‘all men should honour the Son as they honoured the Father.’ I beseech you, embrace the whole Christ, and see to it that you do not dethrone Him from His rightful place, or take from Him the glory that is due to His name. For your love will suffer, and become a mere sentiment, inoperative and sometimes unwholesome, unless you keep in mind Peter’s injunction.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But, further, there is included in this commandment, not only what Isaiah said, ‘Let Him be your fear and your dread,’ but also a reverent love and trust. For we do not hallow Christ as we ought, unless we absolutely confide in every word of His lips. Did you ever think that not to trust Jesus Christ is to blaspheme and profane that holy name by which we are called; and that to hallow Him means to say to Him, ‘I believe every word that Thou speakest, and I am ready to risk my life upon Thy veracity’? Distrust is dishonouring the Master, and taking from Him the glory that is due unto His name.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Then there is another point to be noted: ‘Sanctify in your hearts Christ as Lord.’ That is Peter’s addition to Isaiah’s words, and it is not a mere piece of tautology, but puts great emphasis into the exhortation. What is a man’s heart, in New Testament and Old Testament language? It is the very centre-point of the personal self. And when Peter says, ‘Hallow Him in your hearts,’ he means that, deep down in the very midst of your personal being, as it were, there should be, fundamental to all, and interior to all, this reverential awe and absolute trust in Jesus Christ--an habitual thought, a central emotion, an all-dominant impulse. ‘Out of the heart are the issues of life.’ Put the healing agent into it, the fountain-head, and all the streams that pour out thence will be purified and sweetened. Deep in the heart put Christ, and life will be pure.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Now, in another part of this letter the Apostle says, ‘Ye are a spiritual house.’ I think some notion of the same sort is running in his mind here. He thinks of each man’s heart as being a shrine in which the god is enthroned, and in which worship is rendered. And if we have Christ in our hearts, then our hearts are temples; and if we ‘hallow’ the Christ that dwells within us, we shall take care that there are no foul things in that sanctuary. We dishonour the indwelling Deity when into that same heart we allow to come lusts, foulnesses, meannesses, worldlinesses, passions, sins, and all the crew of reptiles and wild beasts that we sometimes admit there. If we hallow Christ in our hearts, in any true fashion, He will turn out the money-changers and overturn the tables. And if we desire to hallow Him in our hearts, we too, must by His Spirit’s help, purge the temple that He may enter and abide.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And so I come to the next point, and that is the Christian courage and calmness that ensue from hallowing Christ in the heart.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Apostle first puts his exhortation: ‘Be not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled,’ and then he presents us an opposite injunction, obedience to which is the only means of obeying the first exhortation. If you do not sanctify Christ in your hearts, you cannot help being afraid of their terror, and troubled. If you do, then there is no fear that you will fall into that snare. That is to say, the one thing that delivers men from the fears that make cowards of us all is to have Christ lodged within our hearts. Sunshine puts out culinary fires. They who have the awe and the reverent love that knit them to Jesus Christ, and who carry Him within their hearts, have no need to be afraid of anything besides. Only he who can say, ‘The Lord is the strength of my life’ can go on to say, ‘Of whom shall I be afraid?’ There is nothing more hopeless than to address to men, ringed about with dangers, the foolish exhortations: ‘Cheer up! do not be frightened,’ unless you can tell them some reason for not being frightened. And the one reason that will carry weight with it, in all circumstances, is the presence of Jesus.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> ‘With Christ in the vessel<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> I smile at the storm.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The world comes to us and says: ‘Do not be afraid, do not be afraid; be of good courage; pluck up your heart, man.’ The Apostle comes and says: ‘Sanctify Christ as Lord in your hearts; and then, and only then, will you be bold.’ The boldness which fronts the certain dangers and calamities and the possible dangers and calamities of this life, without Christ, is not boldness, but foolhardiness. ‘The simple passeth on, and is punished,’ says the book of Proverbs. It is easy to whistle when going through the churchyard, and to say, ‘Who’s afraid?’ But the ghosts rise all the same, and there is only one thing that lays them, and that is--the present Christ.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In like manner the sanctifying of Jesus Christ in the heart is the secret of calmness. ‘Fear not their fear, neither be troubled.’ I wonder if Peter was thinking at all of another saying: ‘Let not your heart be troubled; neither let it be afraid.’ Perhaps he was. At any rate, his thought is parallel with our Lord’s when He said, ‘Let not your heart be troubled. Believe in God, and believe in Me.’ The two alternatives are possible; we shall have either troubled hearts, or hearts calmed by faith in Christ. The ships behind the breakwater do not pitch and toss. The little town up amongst the hills, with the high cliffs around it, lies quiet, and ‘hears not the loud winds when they call.’ And the heart that has Christ for its possession has a secret peace, whatever strife may be raging round it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>‘Be not troubled; sanctify Christ as Lord in your hearts.’ Peter leaves out a clause of Isaiah’s, though he conveys the idea without reiterating the words. But Isaiah had added a sweet promise which means much the same thing as I have now been saying, when he went on to declare that to those who sanctify the Lord God in their hearts, He shall be for a sanctuary. ‘The sanctuary was an asylum where men were safe. And if we have made our hearts temples in which Christ is honoured, worshipped, and trusted, then we shall dwell in Him as in the secret place of the Most High’; and in the inner chamber of the Temple it will be quiet, whatever noises are in the camp, and there is light coming from the Shekinah, whatever darkness may lie around. If we take Christ into our hearts, and reverence and love Him there, He will take us into His heart, and we shall dwell in peace, because we dwell in Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_peter/3.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_peter/3-14.htm" title="But and if you suffer for righteousness' sake, happy are you: and be not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled;...">1 Peter 3:14-16</a></span>. <span class="ital">But if you </span>should <span class="ital">suffer </span>— If any should be so wicked as to endeavour to harm you when you are doing good; if your heathen rulers, or any others, should persecute you for righteousness’ sake; that is, upon the account of your religion, because you follow Christ, and believe and obey his gospel; this, properly speaking, will be no <span class="ital">harm </span>to you, but <span class="ital">a good: </span>yea, <span class="ital">happy are you </span>— In so suffering, in spite of all the malicious and outrageous efforts of your enemies; yea, your sufferings will be so far from lessening, that they will increase your happiness, and that in many respects. <span class="ital">Be not afraid of their terror </span>— <span class="greekheb">Τον δε φοβον αυτων μη φοβηθητε</span>, the very words of the Septuagint, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/8-12.htm" title="Say you not, A confederacy, to all them to whom this people shall say, A confederacy; neither fear you their fear, nor be afraid....">Isaiah 8:12-13</a>; <span class="ital">Fear ye not their fear: </span>the exhortation which Isaiah gave to the Jews when threatened with an invasion by the Assyrians.

What was the ground and reason of their hope? We should be able to defend our religion with meekness, in the fear of God. There is no room for any other fears where this great fear is; it disturbs not. The conscience is good, when it does its office well. That person is in a sad condition on whom sin and suffering meet: sin makes suffering extreme, comfortless, and destructive. Surely it is better to suffer for well-doing than for evil-doing, whatever our natural impatience at times may suggest. The example of Christ is an argument for patience under sufferings. In the case of our Lord's suffering, he that knew no sin, suffered instead of those who knew no righteousness. The blessed end and design of our Lord's sufferings were, to reconcile us to God, and to bring us to eternal glory. He was put to death in respect of his human nature, but was quickened and raised by the power of the Holy Spirit. If Christ could not be freed from sufferings, why should Christians think to be so? God takes exact notice of the means and advantages people in all ages have had. As to the old world, Christ sent his Spirit; gave warning by Noah. But though the patience of God waits long, it will cease at last. And the spirits of disobedient sinners, as soon as they are out of their bodies, are committed to the prison of hell, where those that despised Noah's warning now are, and from whence there is no redemption. Noah's salvation in the ark upon the water, which carried him above the floods, set forth the salvation of all true believers. That temporal salvation by the ark was a type of the eternal salvation of believers by baptism of the Holy Spirit. To prevent mistakes, the apostle declares what he means by saving baptism; not the outward ceremony of washing with water, which, in itself, does no more than put away the filth of the flesh, but that baptism, of which the baptismal water formed the sign. Not the outward ordinance, but when a man, by the regeneration of the Spirit, was enabled to repent and profess faith, and purpose a new life, uprightly, and as in the presence of God. Let us beware that we rest not upon outward forms. Let us learn to look on the ordinances of God spiritually, and to inquire after the spiritual effect and working of them on our consciences. We would willingly have all religion reduced to outward things. But many who were baptized, and constantly attended the ordinances, have remained without Christ, died in their sins, and are now past recovery. Rest not then till thou art cleansed by the Spirit of Christ and the blood of Christ. His resurrection from the dead is that whereby we are assured of purifying and peace.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_peter/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But and if ye suffer for righteousness" sake - Implying that though, in general, a holy character would constitute safety, yet that there was a possibility that they might suffer persecution.

No doubt the possibility of suffering is admitted, yet in such a way that the Christian is considered blessed on account of that suffering. <span class="greekheb">πάσχειν</span> is not identical with <span class="greekheb">κακοῦσθαι</span>, but, as Bengel rightly remarks: levius verbum quam <span class="greekheb">κακοῦσθαι</span>.

The thought here is not quite the same, the sense of the Old Testament passage being: do not share the terror of the people, and do not be moved by what alarms them. If <span class="greekheb">φόβος</span> be here taken <span class="ital">objectively</span>, then <span class="greekheb">φόβος αὐτῶν</span> is “<span class="ital">the fear emanating from them</span>,” or “the fear which they excite” (de Wette, Brückner); cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/91-5.htm" title="You shall not be afraid for the terror by night; nor for the arrow that flies by day;">Psalm 91:5</a> : <span class="greekheb">οὐ φοβηθήσῃ ἀπὸ φόβου νυκτερινοῦ</span>; cf. also in this chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-6.htm" title="Even as Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose daughters you are, as long as you do well, and are not afraid with any amazement.">1 Peter 3:6</a>. If, on the other hand, it be taken in a <span class="ital">subjective</span> sense, then <span class="greekheb">αὐτῶν</span> is equal to “of them,” therefore: “do not fear with the fear of them, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> do not be afraid of them” (Schott and Hofmann also). In both cases the meaning is substantially the same. Wiesinger is inaccurate when he takes <span class="greekheb">φόβος</span> subjectively, and interprets <span class="greekheb">αὐτῶν</span> as de Wette does.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[189] These words also are wrongly explained by Schott, since he takes <span class="greekheb">ἀλλʼ</span> as quickly denying the previous statement, and introducing a new turn of thought, separates <span class="greekheb">εἰ καί</span> from each other, and connects <span class="greekheb">καί</span> with <span class="greekheb">πάσχοιτε</span> in the sense of “even.” For the first, Schott appeals to Hartung’s <span class="ital">Partikell</span>. II. p. 37; for the second, to Hartung, I. p. 140, note; but without any right to do so. For, as to the <span class="ital">former</span>, he overlooks that <span class="greekheb">ἀλλʼ</span> here follows on a sentence <span class="ital">negative</span> in meaning; and as to the <span class="ital">latter</span>, that <span class="greekheb">καί</span> has here a position, in which a separation of it from <span class="greekheb">εἰ</span> could not for a moment be thought of. The apostle would have expressed the idea: “if for righteousness’sake you should have to experience (not only not happiness and blessing, but) even suffering,” by <span class="greekheb">εἰ διὰ δικαιοσύνην καὶ πάσχοιτε</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/1_peter/3.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-14.htm" title="But and if you suffer for righteousness' sake, happy are you: and be not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled;">1 Peter 3:14</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἀλλʼ</span> … <span class="greekheb">μακάριοι</span>. <span class="ital">Nay if ye should actually suffer</span>—if some one, despite the prophet (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-13.htm" title="And who is he that will harm you, if you be followers of that which is good?">1 Peter 3:13</a>), should harm you—<span class="ital">for the sake of righteousness, blessed are ye</span>.

The addition of <span class="greekheb">καί</span> implies that the contingency is unlikely to occur and is best represented by an emphasis on <span class="ital">should</span>.

The sense of the original, <span class="ital">fear not what they</span> (<span class="ital">the people</span>) <span class="ital">fear; Jehovah of Hosts Him shall ye count holy and let Him be the object of your fear</span>, has been in part abandoned. For it is simpler to take <span class="ital">the fear</span> as referring to the evil with which their enemies try to terrify them, than to supply the idea that their enemies employ the means by which they themselves would be intimidated.

Do not fear that fear, which the wicked both themselves entertain, and endeavour to excite in you. <span class="greekheb">Φοβεῖσθαι φόβον</span> is said, as <span class="greekheb">χαίρειν χαρὰν</span>, <span class="ital">to rejoice with joy</span>.

He recalls to their thoughts the eighth beatitude, almost reproducing the Lord's words (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-10.htm">Matthew 5:10</a>). Such suffering (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, lenius verbum quam <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>," Bengel) would do them no real harm; nay, it would bring with it a true and deep blessing. "Righteousness" here seems synonymous with "that which is good" in the last verse. Christians had often to suffer, not only because of their confession of Christ, but because of the purity of their lives, which was a standing reproach to the heathen. Compare St. Augustine's well-known saying, "Martyrem tacit non poena, sed causa." <span class="cmt_word">And be not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled</span>. From <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-12.htm">Isaiah 8:12</a>. The genitive may be taken as objective: "Be not afraid of the terror which they cause;" or as subjective, "with the terror which they feel." The former view is more suitable here. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/1_peter/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Blessed<p>See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-3.htm">Matthew 5:3</a>.<p>Be troubled (&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;)<p>The word used of Herod's trouble (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/2-3.htm">Matthew 2:3</a>); of the agitation of the pool of Bethesda (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-4.htm">John 5:4</a>); of Christ's troubled spirit (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-27.htm">John 12:27</a>). </body></html>
