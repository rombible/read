St. Peter seems rather to have argued from what every one would feel <span class= "ital">must</span> have been the case than from explicit records. Sara’s usual subjection is clearly seen in the one instance to which St. Peter refers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-12.htm" title="Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?">Genesis 18:12</a>), where Sara, though not addressing Abraham, but speaking to herself, calls him “my lord.” People show their usual habits of mind more freely in speaking to themselves.<p><span class= "bld">Whose daughters ye are.</span>—A very misleading version, following the Vulgate. What St. Peter says is, <span class= "ital">whose children ye became, </span>or <span class= "ital">were made.</span> There was a definite period in their past lives at which they came to be—what they were not before—children of Sara. Have we not here, therefore, a distinct proof that these readers of the Epistle were Gentiles and not Jewesses? Not so. The phrase, “which hoped in God,” pointing as it does to the coming of the Messiah, prepares us to understand how these Hebrew women <span class= "ital">became</span> Sara’s children. It was only by entering into her hope and attaching themselves to Jesus Christ, for whose coming she had looked. St. Peter has already been insisting on the nothingness of the fleshly descent, the “corruptible seed.” As has been pointed out on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-24.htm" title="For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass. The grass wither, and the flower thereof falls away:">1Peter 1:24</a>, this doctrine was not first taught by St. Paul, for St. Peter had heard it from the Baptist (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-9.htm" title="And think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say to you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children to Abraham.">Matthew 3:9</a>) and from our Lord Himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-39.htm" title="They answered and said to him, Abraham is our father. Jesus said to them, If you were Abraham's children, you would do the works of Abraham.">John 8:39</a>). Whether persons were naturally Jews or Gentiles, they could not be children of Abraham without voluntarily becoming so by embracing his principles—<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>by becoming Christians. The participial clauses which follow will need no change of translation, for they express not the act or process by which these ladies <span class= "ital">became</span> children of Sara, but the condition on which they would <span class= "ital">remain</span> her children. A very similar passage occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-14.htm" title="For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast to the end;">Hebrews 3:14</a> : “We have become partakers of the Christ, if (for the future) we hold,” &c. (Comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-8.htm" title="For now we live, if you stand fast in the Lord.">1Thessalonians 3:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-6.htm" title="But Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm to the end.">Hebrews 3:6</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Do well.</span>—See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-12.htm" title="Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.">1Peter 2:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-15.htm" title="For so is the will of God, that with well doing you may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men:">1Peter 2:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-20.htm" title="For what glory is it, if, when you be buffeted for your faults, you shall take it patiently? but if, when you do well, and suffer for it, you take it patiently, this is acceptable with God.">1Peter 2:20</a>. The word means, of course, general good behaviour, especially in all wifely duties. As this is a condition of remaining Sara’s children, it is implied that it was a characteristic of Sara. Some critics would even put in a parenthesis all the words from “even as” to “ye are,” and attach these participles (as they are in the Greek) to the last clause in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-5.htm" title="For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection to their own husbands:">1Peter 3:5</a>, thus: “adorned themselves, being in subjection to their own husbands (as Sara, for instance . . . whose daughters ye were made), doing well, and not being afraid,” &c. This is, however, somewhat cumbrous, and leaves the clause “whose daughters ye became” a little too bald.<p><span class= "bld">Are not afraid with any amazement.</span>—Though this translation is grammatically possible, it does not make such good sense as to translate, <span class= "ital">are not afraid of any alarm.</span> It is, in fact, a quotation from or allusion to <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-25.htm" title="Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it comes.">Proverbs 3:25</a>, as Bengel points out, where “Be not afraid of sudden fear” is rendered in the LXX. by these same peculiar words. The “Wisdom” in that passage, which brings the calmness with it, is Christ, and it is Christ who must be understood in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-26.htm" title="For the LORD shall be your confidence, and shall keep your foot from being taken.">Proverbs 3:26</a> : “the Lord shall be thy confidence.” To be afraid of sudden alarms and panics argues a lack of trust in God’s providence and power, and would, therefore, be unbecoming the daughters of Sara, who “hoped in God.” The “alarms” which they naturally might fear are, of course, quite general, but especially here, we may suppose, dread of what their unbelieving husbands might do to them. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-13.htm" title="And who is he that will harm you, if you be followers of that which is good?">1Peter 3:13</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.</span>)<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_peter/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:1-7 The wife must discharge her duty to her own husband, though he obey not the word. We daily see how narrowly evil men watch the ways and lives of professors of religion. Putting on of apparel is not forbidden, but vanity and costliness in ornament. Religious people should take care that all their behaviour answers to their profession. But how few know the right measure and bounds of those two necessaries of life, food and raiment! Unless poverty is our carver, and cuts us short, there is scarcely any one who does not desire something beyond what is good for us. Far more are beholden to the lowliness of their state, than the lowliness of their mind; and many will not be so bounded, but lavish their time and money upon trifles. The apostle directs Christian females to put on something not corruptible, that beautifies the soul, even the graces of God's Holy Spirit. A true Christian's chief care lies in right ordering his own spirit. This will do more to fix the affections, and excite the esteem of a husband, than studied ornaments or fashionable apparel, attended by a froward and quarrelsome temper. Christians ought to do their duty to one another, from a willing mind, and in obedience to the command of God. Wives should be subject to their husbands, not from dread and amazement, but from desire to do well, and please God. The husband's duty to the wife implies giving due respect unto her, and maintaining her authority, protecting her, and placing trust in her. They are heirs together of all the blessings of this life and that which is to come, and should live peaceably one with another. Prayer sweetens their converse. And it is not enough that they pray with the family, but husband and wife together by themselves, and with their children. Those who are acquainted with prayer, find such unspeakable sweetness in it, that they will not be hindered therein. That you may pray much, live holily; and that you may live holily, be much in prayer.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_peter/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Even as Sara obeyed Abraham - Sarah was one of the most distinguished of the wives of the patriarchs, and her case is referred to as furnishing one of the best illustrations of the duty to which the apostle refers. Nothing is said, in the brief records of her life, of any passion for outward adorning; much is said of her kindness to her husband, and her respect for him. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-5.htm">Genesis 12:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-6.htm">Genesis 18:6</a>.<p>Calling him Lord - See <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-12.htm">Genesis 18:12</a>. It was probably inferred from this instance, by the apostle, and not without reason, that Sarah habitually used this respectful appellation, acknowledging by it that he was her superior, and that he had a right to rule in his own house. The word lord has the elementary idea of ruling, and this is the sense here - that she acknowledged that he had a right to direct the affairs of his household, and that it was her duty to be in subjection to him as the head of the family. In what respects this is a duty, may be seen by consulting the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-22.htm">Ephesians 5:22</a>. Among the Romans, it was quite common for wives to use the appellation lord, (dominus), when speaking of their husbands. The same custom also prevailed among the Greeks. See Grotius, in loc. This passage does not prove that the term lord should be the particular appellation by which Christian wives should address their husbands now, but it proves that there should be the same respect and deference which was implied by its use in patriarchal times. The welfare of society, and the happiness of individuals, are not diminished by showing proper respect for all classes of persons in the various relations of life.<p>Whose daughters ye are - That is, you will be worthy to be regarded as her daughters, if you manifest the same spirit that she did. The margin here, as the Greek, is children. The sense is that if they demeaned themselves correctly in the relation of wives, it would be proper to look upon her as their mother, and to feel that they were not unworthy to be regarded as her daughters.<p>As long as ye do well - In respect to the particular matter under consideration.<p>And are not afraid with any amazement - This passage has been variously understood, Some have supposed that this is suggested as an argument to persuade them to do well, from the consideration that by so doing they would be preserved from those alarms and terrors which a contest with superior power might bring with it, and which would prove as injurious to their peace as to their character. Rosenmuller explains it, "If ye do well, terrified by no threats of unbelieving husbands, if they should undertake to compel you to deny the Christian faith." Doddridge supposes that it means that they were to preserve their peace and fortitude in any time of danger, so as not to act out of character, through amazement or danger. Calvin, Benson, and Bloomfield understand it of that firmness and intrepidity of character which would be necessary to support their religious independence, when united with pagan husbands; meaning that they were not to be deterred from doing their duty by any threats or terrors, either of their unbelieving husbands, or of their enemies and persecutors. Dr. Clarke supposes that it means that if they did well, they would live under no dread of being detected in improprieties of life, or being found out in their infidelities to their husbands, as those must always be who are unfaithful to their marriage vows. The word rendered "amazement" ptonsis - does not elsewhere occur in the New Testament. It means terror, trepidation, fear; and the literal translation of the Greek is, "not fearing any fear." It seems to me that the following may express the sense of the passage:<p>(1) There is undoubtedly an allusion to the character of Sarah, and the object of the apostle is to induce them to follow her example.<p>(2) the thing in Sarah which he would exhort them to imitate, was her pure and upright life, her faithful discharge of her duties as a woman fearing God. This she did constantly wherever she was, regardless of consequences. Among friends and strangers, at home and abroad, she was distinguished for doing well. Such was her character, such her fidelity to her husband and her God, such her firm integrity and benevolence, that she at all times lived to do good, and would have done it, unawed by terror, undeterred by threats, To whatever trial her piety was exposed, it bore the trial; and such was her strength of virtue, that it was certain her integrity would be firm by whatever consequences she might have been threatened for her adherence to her principles.<p>(3) they were to imitate her in this, and were thus to show that they were worthy to be regarded as her daughters. They were to do well; to be faithful to their husbands; to be firm in their principles; to adhere steadfastly to what was true and good, whatever trials they might pass through, however much they might be threatened with persecution, or however any might attempt to deter them from the performance of their duty. Thus, by a life of Christian fidelity, unawed by fear from any quarter, they would show that they were imbued with the same principles of unbending virtue which characterised the wife of the father of the faithful, and that they were not unworthy to be regarded as her daughters. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_peter/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6.

Going along with him wherever he went, as from Chaldea to Canaan, and into Egypt, and the land of the Philistines, saying the words he put into her mouth, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-5.htm">Genesis 12:5</a> and doing the things he bid her do, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-6.htm">Genesis 18:6</a> "calling him lord"; or "my lord", as the Syriac and Ethiopic versions render it, and as it appears she did from <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-12.htm">Genesis 18:12</a>. The Jews use this instance to the same purpose the apostle does, saying (p), <p>"the wife ought to take care of the family, to educate her children, to serve and minister to her husband in all things, "calling him her own lord"; which is what we learn from the example of Sarah, who called Abraham her lord, saying, "my lord is old". <p>Whose daughters ye are; meaning not by natural descent, though they were, these being Jews the apostle writes to, but by grace, and in a spiritual sense; just as those are the children of Abraham, who walk in the steps of his faith, whether they be Jews or Gentiles; so such are the daughters of Sarah, the children of the free woman, who imitate her in faith and obedience; that is, they appear, and are declared to be so: <p>as long as ye do well: do acts of beneficence and hospitality to strangers, and proper objects, as Sarah did, and all and every good work, according to the will of God, from love, and in faith, and with a view to his glory; and particularly obey and live in subjection to their husbands, as she did: and are not afraid with any amazement; are not deterred from doing well, nor scared by the terrors and menaces of wicked men, either their own husbands, or others; or who with fortitude and intrepidity of mind continue in the discharge of their duty to God and men, and particularly to their husbands, following them, and obeying their lawful commands, as Sarah did in Egypt, and in Gerar, though she exposed herself to great danger: this is said, because women are timorous, and apt to be frightened at everything, from the performance of their duty, <p>(p) Sepher Musar apud Drus. de Quaesitis, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/54.htm">Ephesians 54</a>. &amp; in loc. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_peter/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Even as Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose daughters ye are, as long as ye do well, and are <span class="cverse3">{5}</span> not afraid with any amazement.</span><p>(5) Because women are by nature fearful, he gives them to understand that he requires of them that subjection, which is not wrung out from them either by force or fear.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/1_peter/3.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-6.htm" title="Even as Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose daughters you are, as long as you do well, and are not afraid with any amazement.">1 Peter 3:6</a>. <span class="greekheb">ὡς</span> … <span class="greekheb">καλοῦσα</span>. The only evidence that can be adduced from the O.T. narrative is <span class="ital">Sarah laughed within herself and said … “but my lord is old</span>” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-12.htm" title="Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?">Genesis 18:12</a>). The phrase, if pressed, implies a nominal subjection as of a slave to her lord, but the context at any rate excludes <span class="ital">any hope in God</span>. Philo, who starts with the assumption that Sarah is Virtue, evades the difficulty; her laughter was the expression of her joy, she denied it for fear of usurping God’s prerogative of laughter (<span class="ital">de Abr.</span>, ii. p. 30 M). The Rabbinic commentaries dwell upon the title accorded to Abraham and draw the same inference as Peter; but there are also traces of a tendency to exalt Sarah “the princess” as superior to her husband in the gift of prophecy, which St. Peter may wish to correct (as St. James corrects the exaggerated respect paid to Elijah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-17.htm" title="Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain: and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months.">Jam 5:17</a>).—<span class="greekheb">ἧς</span> … <span class="greekheb">τέκνα</span>. Christian women became children of Sarah who is Virtue or Wisdom: (Philo) just as men became children of Abraham. But the fact that they were Christians is still in the background; the essential point is that they must do the works traditionally ascribed to Sarah (<span class="ital">cf.</span> Romans 4.; John 8.) and so justify their technical parentage, whether natural or acquired. Oec. compares <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-2.htm" title="Who raised up the righteous man from the east, called him to his foot, gave the nations before him, and made him rule over kings? he gave them as the dust to his sword, and as driven stubble to his bow.">Isaiah 41:2</a>, <span class="ital">Sarah your mother</span>.—<span class="greekheb">ἀγαθοποιοῦσαι</span> the present participle emphasises the need for continuance of the behaviour appropriate to children of Sarah.—<span class="greekheb">μὴ</span> … <span class="greekheb">πτόησιν</span>, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-25.htm" title="Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it comes.">Proverbs 3:25</a>, LXX. Peter regards Sarah’s falsehood (Gen. <span class="ital">l.c.</span>) as the yielding to a sudden terror for which she was rebuked by God. Fearlessness then is part of the character which is set before them for imitation and it is the result of obedience to the voice of Wisdom. Rabbinic exegesis as sociates the ideas of <span class="ital">ornament</span> with the promised child and that of peace between husband and wife with the whole incident.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/1_peter/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">6</span>. <span class="ital">even as Sara obeyed Abraham</span>] The tense which St Peter uses would seem to imply a reference to some special instance of obedience, but, as the history of Genesis supplies no such instance in act, we are left to infer that he saw in her use of “my lord,” in speaking of her husband (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-12.htm" title="Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?">Genesis 18:12</a>), a representative utterance that implied a sense of habitual subordination. It seems strange to refer to literature like that of the sixth satire of Juvenal in illustration of an Epistle of St Peter, but there can be no clearer evidence that the general corruption of the Empire had extended itself to the life of home, and that over and above the prevalence of adultery and divorce, the wives of Rome, and we may believe also, of the cities that followed in the wake of Rome, had well-nigh thrown aside all sense of the reverence which the Apostle looked on as essential to the holiness, and therefore the happiness, of married life.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">whose daughters ye are</span>] <span class="bld">whose daughters ye became</span>. If the words were addressed to women who were converts from heathenism, we might see in the words a suggestive parallel to those of St Paul, that Abraham was the father of “all them that believe though they be not circumcised” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-11.htm" title="And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed to them also:">Romans 4:11</a>), that “they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-7.htm" title="Know you therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham.">Galatians 3:7</a>). Taking this view there would be a special interest in the fact that St Peter, the married Apostle, told the female converts from among the Gentiles that they were as truly daughters of Sarah as their husbands, if believing, were sons of Abraham. On the assumption which has been adopted throughout these notes, as on the whole the most probable, that the Epistle was really addressed, as it purports to be, to the Jews of the dispersion, the words have another significance. The daughters of Sarah according to the flesh are told that they only became truly her children when they reproduced her character. The words, on this view, present a striking parallelism to those in which St Paul speaks of Abraham as being “the father not of the circumcision only, as such, but of those who walk in the steps of Abraham’s faith” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-12.htm" title="And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which he had being yet uncircumcised.">Romans 4:12</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">as long as ye do well, and are not afraid with any amazement</span>] The construction of the Greek sentence is not quite clear, and admits of being taken either (1) as in the English version, or (2) treating the words “as Sara obeyed.… whose daughters ye became” as a parenthesis, we may refer the words “doing well” to the “holy women” of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-5.htm" title="For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection to their own husbands:">1 Peter 3:5</a>. On the whole (1) seems preferable. It may be questioned whether the words “so long as” rightly represent the force of the participle. If we adopt the rendering given above (“ye <span class="ital">became</span>”) that meaning is clearly inadmissible, and we have to see in the two participles the process by which Christian women <span class="ital">became</span> daughters <span class="bld">by doing good and not being afraid</span>. The word for “amazement” does not occur elsewhere in the New Testament, but the cognate verb is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/21-9.htm" title="But when you shall hear of wars and commotions, be not terrified: for these things must first come to pass; but the end is not by and by.">Luke 21:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-37.htm" title="But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit.">Luke 24:37</a>. The noun itself meets us in the LXX. of <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-25.htm" title="Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it comes.">Proverbs 3:25</a>. It implies the crouching, shuddering fear of one who is overwhelmed with terror. In warning the women to whom he writes against such a fear, St Peter seems to be guarding them against the unwisdom of rushing from one extreme to the other. The Christian wives of unbelieving husbands, whether Jews or heathens, might often have much to bear from them, but if they were always shewing their terror, cowering as if they expected the curse or the blow, that very demeanour was certain to make matters worse. It was a tacit reproach, and therefore would but irritate and annoy. Wisely therefore does the Apostle urge on them a different line of action. “Be certain,” he seems to say, “that you are doing what is right and good, and then go about the daily tasks of your household life with a cheerful intrepidity.” Two interpretations may be noticed only to be rejected, (1) that which takes the second clause as meaning “be not afraid of anything that causes terror,” and (2) that which renders it “doing good, even though you are not afraid,” as though stress were laid on their good conduct being spontaneous and not originating in fear.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/1_peter/3.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-6.htm" title="Even as Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose daughters you are, as long as you do well, and are not afraid with any amazement.">1 Peter 3:6</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ὡς</span>, <span class="ital">even as</span>) The particle used in bringing forward an example.—<span class="greekheb">ὑλήκουσε</span>, <span class="ital">obeyed</span>) <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-6.htm" title="And Abraham hastened into the tent to Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes on the hearth.">Genesis 18:6</a>.—<span class="greekheb">κύριον</span>, <span class="ital">lord</span>) <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-12.htm" title="Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?">Genesis 18:12</a>, Septuagint, <span class="greekheb">ὁ δὲ κύριός μου</span>.

St. Peter singles out Sarah, as the mother of the chosen people. She obeyed her husband habitually (the imperfect <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> is the reading of some of the oldest manuscripts; the aorist, also well supported, would represent her obedience as a whole, the character of her life now past); she called him lord (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-12.htm">Genesis 18:12</a>,  <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b2;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>.) <span class="cmt_word">Whose daughters ye are</span>; literally, w<span class="accented">hose children ye became.</span> This is another indication that the Epistle is addressed, not only to Jewish Christians, but also, and that in large measure, to Gentile converts. Gentile women became by faith the daughters of Sarah; just as we read in St. Paul's Epistles that "they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-7.htm">Galatians 3:7</a>); and that Abraham is "the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-11.htm">Romans 4:11</a>); comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-22.htm">Galatians 4:22-31</a>, where St. Paul tells us that we, like Isaac, are the children of promise; children, "not of the bondwoman, but of the free." <span class="cmt_word">As long as ye do well</span>. This clause represents one Greek word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> ("doing good"). Some commentators regard the words from "even as Sara" to "whose daughters ye are" as a parenthesis, and refer the participle to "the holy women" mentioned in ver. 5. This does not seem natural. It is better to regard the second half of this verse as a continuous sentence, and to understand the participle as meaning "if ye do well." The doing well, etc., is a mark that Christian women have become children of Sarah by faith. <span class="cmt_word">And are not afraid with any amazement</span>. The Greek word for "amazement" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) does not occur in any other place of the New Testament, though we meet with the corresponding verb in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/21-9.htm">Luke 21:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24.htm">Luke 24</a>:87. There seems to be a reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-25.htm">Proverbs 3:25</a>, "Be not afraid of sudden fear ' (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>), <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3c4;&#x3c3;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> is "dismay, scared terrified excitement," very different from the calm thoughtful <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1f79;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, the fear lest they should fail in proper respect for their husbands, and that out of the holy fear of God, which St. Peter inculcates upon wives (ver. 2). The Christian wife might often experience cruel treatment from an unbelieving husband, but she was not to live in a flutter of excited terror; she was to be calm and quiet, trusting in God. As to the construction, the accusative may be cognate, as the Authorized Version takes it; or the accusative of the object, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-25.htm">Proverbs 3:25</a>. The last view is, perhaps, the -most suitable: "And are not afraid of any sudden terror." <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/1_peter/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Amazement (&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;)<p>Rev., terror.
