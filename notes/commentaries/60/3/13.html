The same <span class= "ital">zelotes</span> is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-14.htm" title="Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify to himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.">Titus 2:14</a> and elsewhere. The translation, “of Him which is good,” is perfectly possible, but does not quite so well suit the context. Some writers (Leighton among them) take the verse to mean, or at least to include, that when men see the goodness and loving-kindness of our lives they will not be <span class= "ital">disposed</span> to hurt us. This thought is, however, foreign to the passage. It means that men and devils may try their worst, as they did on Christ, and cannot harm us.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_peter/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:8-13 Though Christians cannot always be exactly of the same mind, yet they should have compassion one of another, and love as brethren. If any man desires to live comfortably on earth, or to possess eternal life in heaven, he must bridle his tongue from wicked, abusive, or deceitful words. He must forsake and keep far from evil actions, do all the good he can, and seek peace with all men. For God, all-wise and every where present, watches over the righteous, and takes care of them. None could or should harm those who copied the example of Christ, who is perfect goodness, and did good to others as his followers.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_peter/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And who is he that will harm you, if ye be followers of that which is good? - This question is meant to imply, that as a general thing they need apprehend no evil if they lead an upright and benevolent life. The idea is, that God would in general protect them, though the next verse shows that the apostle did not mean to teach that there would be absolute security, for it is implied there that they might be called to suffer for righteousness" sake. While it is true that the Saviour was persecuted by wicked people, though his life was wholly spent in doing good; while it is true that the apostles were put to death, though following his example; and while it is true that good people have often suffered persecution, though laboring only to do good, still it is true as a general thing that a life of integrity and benevolence conduces to safety, even in a wicked world. People who are upright and pure; who live to do good to others who are characteristically benevolent and who are imitators of God - are those who usually pass life in most tranquillity and security, and are often safe when nothing else would give security but confidence in their integrity. A man of a holy and pure life may, under the protection of God, rely on that character to carry him safely through the world and to bring him at last to an honored grave. Or should he be calumniated when living, and his sun set under a cloud, still his name will be vindicated, and justice will ultimately be done to him when he is dead. The world ultimately judges right respecting character, and renders "honor to whom honor is due."

Or "can harm you". God will not; for his eyes are upon the righteous, to protect and defend them, and, his ears are open to their cries, to avenge them; he is on their side, and he is the only lawgiver that is able to save, and to destroy. Christ will not; for when he came the first time, it was not to condemn, but to save; and when he comes a second time, though he will rule the wicked with a rod of iron, and dash them in pieces as a potter's vessel; yet his people, who are his jewels, he will spare, as a man spares his only son. Good angels will not; these rejoice at the conversion, and in the salvation of sinful men, encamp about the saints, and are ministering spirits to them: nor the devil; though he would devour, he cannot; for greater is he that is in the saints, than he that is in the world: nor can sin; for though it wars against them, it shall not have the dominion over them; and though it often breaks in upon their peace and comfort, it cannot damn and destroy their souls: nor the law; for though it pronounces guilty, and curses those that are under it, and are of the works of it, yet since Christ has fulfilled it for his people, by obeying its precepts, and bearing its penalty, the curse, it lies not against them, nor can it inflict any punishment on them: nor the men of the world; who hate and persecute the saints; these can do them no real harm; they cannot hurt their grace, which shines the brighter, being tried and proved in the furnace of affliction; they cannot destroy their peace and comfort by all the trouble they give them; all the harm they can do them is to their bodies; they can do none to their souls; and even all the evil things they do to their bodies work together for their good; and they must be very wicked men that will do harm in any respect to such as behave well in states, cities, towns, or neighbourhoods: <p>if ye be followers of that which is good; of God, who is essentially, originally, and infinitely good, and does good to all his creatures, by imitating him in holiness and righteousness, in kindness, mercy, and beneficence; and of Christ, the good Shepherd, following him in the exercise of grace, as of humility, love, patience, &amp;c. and in the discharge of duty; and of good men, the apostles of Christ, the first churches, faithful ministers, and all such who through faith and patience have inherited the promises, and that both in doctrine and practice; and of all good things, whatever is true, honest, just, pure, lovely, and of good report, particularly righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, and meekness.

A new reason, the truth of which is attested by the thought contained in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-12.htm" title="For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears are open to their prayers: but the face of the Lord is against them that do evil.">1 Peter 3:12</a>, is added in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-13.htm" title="And who is he that will harm you, if you be followers of that which is good?">1 Peter 3:13</a> to the argument advanced for the preceding exhortation of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-12.htm" title="For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears are open to their prayers: but the face of the Lord is against them that do evil.">1 Peter 3:12</a>. The sense is: Do good, for to the good God is gracious, with the wicked He is angry; <span class="ital">and</span> those who do good, for this very reason none can harm.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τίς ὁ κακώσων ὑμᾶς</span>] an impressive and passionate question (stronger than a simple negative), in which must be noted the form <span class="greekheb">ὁ κακώσων</span>, <span class="ital">sc.</span> <span class="greekheb">ἐστί</span> instead of <span class="greekheb">κακώσει</span>, as also the sharp contrast between <span class="greekheb">κακοῦν</span> and the subsequent <span class="greekheb">ἀγαθοῦ</span>. “Do harm,” as a rendering of <span class="greekheb">κακοῦν</span> (Wiesinger, de Wette), is too weak. The word is used for the most part of <span class="ital">ill-treatment</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-6.htm" title="And God spoke on this wise, That his seed should sojourn in a strange land; and that they should bring them into bondage, and entreat them evil four hundred years.">Acts 7:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-19.htm" title="The same dealt subtly with our kindred, and evil entreated our fathers, so that they cast out their young children, to the end they might not live.">Acts 7:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/12-1.htm" title="Now about that time Herod the king stretched forth his hands to vex certain of the church.">Acts 12:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-10.htm" title="For I am with you, and no man shall set on you to hurt you: for I have much people in this city.">Acts 18:10</a>), and denotes here, with reference to the preceding <span class="greekheb">κακά</span>, such evil-doing as is really harmful for him who suffers it. It is possible that the apostle had in his mind <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/50-9.htm" title="Behold, the Lord GOD will help me; who is he that shall condemn me? see, they all shall wax old as a garment; the moth shall eat them up.">Isaiah 50:9</a>, LXX.: <span class="greekheb">ἰδοὺ κύριος κύριος βοηθήσει μοι</span>, <span class="greekheb">τίς κακώσει με</span>. The interrogative form expresses the sure confidence of the apostle, that to those who do good no one either will or can do harm. Steiger’s interpretation is too pointless: “and indeed who then will seek to do you harm, as you imagine, if you really,” etc.;[187] for the reservation must be added that every proverb has this peculiarity, that it is not without exception (Benson), or that the statement in the oratio popularis must not be taken too strictly. The strong and consoling expression of an unshaken faith is thus reduced to a somewhat empty commonplace.[188]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐὰν τοῦ ἀγαθοῦ ζηλωταὶ γένησθε</span>] <span class="greekheb">τοῦ ἀγαθοῦ</span> was taken by some of the older interpreters (Lorin., Aret., etc.) to be the gen. masc., probably on account of the article (as distinguished from the anarthrous <span class="greekheb">ἀγαθόν</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-11.htm" title="Let him eschew evil, and do good; let him seek peace, and ensue it.">1 Peter 3:11</a>). Weiss also thinks that by it Christ perhaps may be understood. Most commentators, however, correctly regard it as the neuter; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-11.htm" title="Let him eschew evil, and do good; let him seek peace, and ensue it.">1 Peter 3:11</a>. The article is put, inasmuch as in this term all the single virtues, formerly mentioned, are included; it stands first by way of emphasis.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ζηλωταί</span>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-12.htm" title="Even so you, for as much as you are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek that you may excel to the edifying of the church.">1 Corinthians 14:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-14.htm" title="Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify to himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.">Titus 2:14</a>. If the reading <span class="greekheb">μιμηταί</span> be adopted, its connection with the neuter is somewhat singular, still the verb <span class="greekheb">μιμεῖσθαι</span> does occur with names of things; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-7.htm" title="Remember them which have the rule over you, who have spoken to you the word of God: whose faith follow, considering the end of their conversation.">Hebrews 13:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/3_john/1-11.htm" title="Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is good.

Although <span class="greekheb">κακοῦν</span>,—corresponding to the Hebrew הִרְשִׁיעַ,—as applied to a judge, may mean: “to condemn,” or properly: “to declare a person a <span class="greekheb">κακός</span>,” it does not follow therefrom that it may also have the meaning of “causing God to declare a person a <span class="greekheb">κακός</span>.”<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/1_peter/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">13</span>. <span class="ital">And who is he that will harm you</span>] The quotation ceases and the Apostle adds the question, the answer to which seems to him a necessary inference from it.

It is God that justifies....">Romans 8:33-35</a>, still more perhaps, of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/50-9.htm" title="Behold, the Lord GOD will help me; who is he that shall condemn me? see, they all shall wax old as a garment; the moth shall eat them up.">Isaiah 50:9</a>, where the LXX. version gives for “condemn the very word which is here rendered “harm.” It is not without interest to note that the same word is used of Herod’s <span class="ital">vexing</span> the Church in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/12-1.htm" title="Now about that time Herod the king stretched forth his hands to vex certain of the church.">Acts 12:1</a>. St Peter had learnt, in his endurance of the sufferings that then fell on him, that the persecutor has no real power to harm.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">if ye be followers of that which is good</span>] The better MSS. give the word (<span class="ital">zelôtai</span>) which is commonly rendered “zealous for,” as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-20.htm" title="And when they heard it, they glorified the Lord, and said to him, You see, brother, how many thousands of Jews there are which believe; and they are all zealous of the law:">Acts 21:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-3.htm" title="I am truly a man which am a Jew, born in Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, yet brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, and taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers, and was zealous toward God, as you all are this day.">Acts 22:3</a>. As a word in frequent use among devout Jews, (as e.g. in the name of the Apostle Simon Zelotes,) it has a special force as addressed to the Church of the Circumcision. “Be zealous,” he seems to say to them, “not as Pharisees and Scribes are zealous, as you yourselves were wont to be, for the Law as a moral and ceremonial Code, but for that which is absolutely good.” The received reading, “followers,” or better, <span class="bld">imitators</span>, probably originated in the Greek word for “good” being taken as masculine, and, as so taken, referred to Christ. In that case, “followers” suggested itself as a fitter word (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-16.htm" title="Why I beseech you, be you followers of me.">1 Corinthians 4:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-1.htm" title="Be you therefore followers of God, as dear children;">Ephesians 5:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-6.htm" title="And you became followers of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Ghost.">1 Thessalonians 1:6</a>) than “zealots.”<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/1_peter/3.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-13.htm" title="And who is he that will harm you, if you be followers of that which is good?">1 Peter 3:13</a>. <span class="greekheb">Καὶ τίς</span>, <span class="ital">and who?</span>) <span class="ital">And</span> has the force of drawing an inference, and of maintaining an assertion.—<span class="greekheb">τίς ὁ κακώσων</span>, <span class="ital">who is he that will harm you?</span>) that is, often a matter is much more easy than is supposed.

The conjunction "and" connects the question with the quotation. If God's eye is over the righteous, and his ear open to their prayers, who shall harm them? St. Peter does not mean - Who will have the heart to harm you? He knew the temper of Jews and heathens; he knew also the Savior's prophecies of coming persecution too well to say that.
