(See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-12.htm" title="To whom it was revealed, that not to themselves, but to us they did minister the things, which are now reported to you by them that have preached the gospel to you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven; which things the angels desire to look into.">1Peter 1:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-25.htm" title="But the word of the Lord endures for ever. And this is the word which by the gospel is preached to you.">1Peter 1:25</a>, and Notes.) The God who <span class= "ital">now</span> bestows all <span class= "ital">grace, </span>by the giving of that grace calls us into glory.<p>“The men of grace have found<p>Glory begun below.”<p><span class= "bld">By Christ Jesus.</span>—On the whole it seems best, with Tischendorf, to drop the name of Jesus out of the text: the title “Christ” will then stand between “the eternal glory,” which we possess “in Him” (not “<span class= "ital">by</span> Christ Jesus,” as our version has it, but <span class= "ital">by virtue of our union with the Christ</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>and the immediate mention of suffering. In Him the two are drawn inseparably together.<p><span class= "bld">Suffered a while.</span>—The Greek says distinctly, “a <span class= "ital">little</span> while,” as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-6.htm" title="Wherein you greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be, you are in heaviness through manifold temptations:">1Peter 1:6</a>. All time is short in comparison of what comes after. The original looks as if St. Peter meant not only “<span class= "ital">after</span> that ye have suffered,” but also “by the fact of your having suffered.”<p><span class= "bld">Make you perfect.</span>—Strictly these are futures, “<span class= "ital">shall</span> (or, <span class= "ital">will</span>)<span class= "ital"> make you perfect”</span> &c. This verb occurs again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-10.htm" title="Night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face, and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith?">1Thessalonians 3:10</a>, and elsewhere. It implies the reduction to order and fitness for work of what is disordered or broken. The others, which are all very similar in meaning, are heaped up after St. Peter’s manner. Bengel thus explains them: “Make you perfect, that there remain no defect in you. Stablish, that nothing shake you. Strengthen, that you may overcome all force brought against you.” The word for “to settle” means “to found,” to give a solid foundation. All this is to take place at the close of the short spell of suffering which is the means to it. St. Peter seems, therefore, to contemplate the passing off of the persecution before the end of the world; for these verbs could hardly be so naturally used to express our education in the world to come.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_peter/5.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-10.htm" title="But the God of all grace, who has called us to his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that you have suffered a while, make you perfect, establish, strengthen, settle you.">1 Peter 5:10</a></span>. <span class="ital">The God of all grace </span>— Of all mercy, compassion, and free, unmerited goodness; and the source of all those influences of the Holy Spirit, by which alone true spiritual light and life, peace, purity, and consolation, can be attained; <span class="ital">who hath called </span>— Invited; <span class="ital">us unto his eternal glory </span>— And not merely to behold, but to possess it; and hath sent us the invitation <span class="ital">by Christ Jesus </span>— His <span class="ital">Word made flesh; </span>that is, not only <span class="ital">through him, </span>as Mediator, who hath procured the inestimable blessing for us by his obedience unto death, but <span class="ital">by him </span>as a Divine Messenger, the greatest that ever appeared among men, confirming and enforcing his message by a most holy life, by extreme sufferings, by mighty miracles, by an ignominious, painful death, and a most glorious resurrection. <span class="ital">After that ye have suffered a while </span>— Such trials as his infinite wisdom shall see fit to appoint.

Or, inverting the order of the words, and taking the last particular first, as preparatory to the others, (which the sense of the several expressions seems to require, according to the usual progress of the work of grace in the hearts of believers,) the meaning will be, 1st, May he place you on your foundation, (so the word <span class="greekheb">θεμελιωσαι</span>, here rendered <span class="ital">settle you, </span>properly signifies,) even on the foundation which God hath laid in Zion, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-11.htm" title="For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.">1 Corinthians 3:11</a>,) Christ Jesus, or on <span class="ital">the foundation of the apostles and prophets, </span>(<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-20.htm" title="And are built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone;">Ephesians 2:20</a>,) namely, the fundamental doctrines attested by them. 2d, May he <span class="ital">strengthen </span>you, that no power of earth or hell may move you from that foundation.

And in this way, 4th, May he make you <span class="ital">perfect, </span>or complete Christians, lacking nothing, destitute of no grace or virtue, and possessing every one in a mature state, a state of meetness for the inheritance of the saints in light.

Perfect implies their progress towards perfection. Stablish imports the curing of our natural lightness and inconstancy. Strengthen has respect to the growth of graces, especially where weakest and lowest. Settle signifies to fix upon a sure foundation, and may refer to Him who is the Foundation and Strength of believers. These expressions show that perseverance and progress in grace are first to be sought after by every Christian. The power of these doctrines on the hearts, and the fruits in the lives, showed who are partakers of the grace of God. The cherishing and increase of Christian love, and of affection one to another, is no matter of empty compliment, but the stamp and badge of Jesus Christ on his followers. Others may have a false peace for a time, and wicked men may wish for it to themselves and to one another; but theirs is a vain hope, and will come to nought. All solid peace is founded on Christ, and flows from him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_peter/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But the God of all grace - The God who imparts all needful grace. It was proper in their anticipated trials to direct them to God, and to breathe forth in their behalf an earnest and affectionate prayer that they might be supported. A prayer of this kind by an apostle would also be to them a sort of pledge or assurance that the needed grace would be granted them.<p>Who hath called us unto his eternal glory - And who means, therefore, that we shall be saved. As he has called us to his glory, we need not apprehend that he will leave or forsake us. On the meaning of the word called, see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-1.htm">Ephesians 4:1</a>.<p>After that ye have suffered a while - After you have suffered as long as he shall appoint. The Greek is, "having suffered a little," and may refer either to time or degree. In both respects the declaration concerning afflictions is true. They are short, compared with eternity; they are light, compared with the exceeding and eternal weight of glory. See the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-16.htm">2 Corinthians 4:16-18</a>.<p>Make you perfect - By means of your trials.

Comforting assurance that God will finally "perfect" His work of "grace" in them, after they have undergone the necessary previous suffering.<p>But&#8212;Only do you watch and resist the foe: God will perform the rest [Bengel].<p>of all grace&#8212;(Compare 1Pe 4:10). The God to whom as its source all grace is to be referred; who in grace completes what in grace He began. He from the first "called (so the oldest manuscripts read for "us") unto (with a view to) glory." He will not let His purpose fall short of completion. If He does so in punishing, much more in grace. The three are fitly conjoined: the call, the glory to which we are called, and the way (suffering); the fourth is the ground of the calling, namely, the grace of God in Christ.<p>by&#8212;Greek, "in." Christ is He in virtue of whom, and in union with whom, believers are called to glory. The opposite is "in the world" (1Pe 5:9; Joh 16:33).<p>after that ye have suffered&#8212;Join to "called you": suffering, as a necessary preliminary to glory, was contemplated in God's calling.<p>a while&#8212;short and inconsiderable, as compared with the glory.<p>perfect, &c.&#8212;The two oldest manuscripts, and Vulgate and Coptic versions, read, "shall perfect (so that there shall be nothing defective in you), stablish, strengthen," and omit "settle," literally, "ground," or "fix on a foundation." Alford reads it in spite of the oldest manuscripts The authority of the latter I prefer; moreover the climax seems to require rather a verb of completing the work of grace, than, as the Greek means, founding it. The Greek has, "shall HIMSELF perfect you": though you are called on to watch and resist the foe, God Himself must really do all in and through you. The same God who begins must Himself complete the work. The Greek for "stablish" (so as to be "steadfast in the faith," 1Pe 5:9) is the same as "strengthen," Lu 22:32. Peter has in mind Christ's charge, "When thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren." His exhortation accords with his name Peter, "Thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build My Church." "Stablish," so as not to waver. "Strengthen" with might in the inner man by His Spirit, against the foe.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_peter/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">But the God of all grace; </span> i.e. the author and giver of all grace, from whom ye have received what you have, and expect what you want. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Who hath called us unto his eternal glory; </span> that eternal glory whereof believers at the last day shall be made partakers, which is called God’s glory, because it is that which he hath promised to them, and will at last put them in possession of: see <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-1.htm" title="The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed:">1 Peter 5:1</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-2.htm" title="By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.">Romans 5:2</a></span>; and because they shall after a sort partake of the Divine glory which they behold. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">By Christ Jesus; </span> for Christ’s sake, as the meritorious cause of our effectual calling, and by him as the great Apostle of our profession, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-1.htm" title="Why, holy brothers, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus;">Hebrews 3:1</a></span>.

These four words may be but different expressions whereby the apostle sets forth the same thing, viz.

Who has riches of grace, an immense plenty of it in himself, has treasured up a fulness of grace in his Son; is the author of all the blessings of grace, of electing, adopting, justifying, pardoning, and regenerating grace; and is the giver of the several graces of the Spirit, as faith, hope, love, repentance, &amp;c. and of all the supplies of grace; and by this character is God the Father described as the object of prayer, to encourage souls to come to the throne of his grace, and pray, and hope for, and expect a sufficiency of his grace in every time of need; as well as to show that the sufferings of the saints here are but for a while; that they are in love and kindness; and that they shall certainly enjoy the glory they are called unto by him; and which is the next thing by which he stands described, <p>who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Jesus Christ. This "call" is not a mere external one by the ministry of the word, which is not always effectual and unto salvation; but an internal, special, and efficacious one, and which is high, holy, heavenly, and unchangeable. The persons who are the subjects of it are us, whom God has chosen in Christ, and are preserved in him, and redeemed by him; and who are a select people, and distinguished from others, and yet in themselves no better than others; nay, often the vilest, meanest, and most contemptible. Some ancient copies read "you", and so do the Arabic and Ethiopic versions: what they are called to is "his eternal glory"; that which is glorious in itself, and is signified by what is the most glorious in this world, as a kingdom, crown, throne, inheritance, &amp;c. and lies in constant and uninterrupted communion with Father, Son, and Spirit; in a complete vision of the glory of Christ, and in perfect conformity to him; in a freedom from all evil, and in a full enjoyment of all happiness: and this is "his", God the Father's; which he has prepared and provided for his people of his own grace, and which he freely gives unto them, and makes them meet for: and it is "eternal"; it will last for ever, and never pass away, as does the glory of this world; it is a continuing city, a never fading inheritance, an eternal weight of glory: and to this the saints are called "by", or "in Jesus Christ"; the glory they are called to is in his hands; and they themselves, by being called unto it, appear to be in him, and as such to belong unto him, or are the called of Christ Jesus; and besides, they are called by him, by his Spirit and grace, and into communion with him, and to the obtaining of his glory. <p>After that ye have suffered awhile, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle you; some copies, and also the Vulgate Latin and Ethiopic versions, read these words in the future tense, not as a prayer, but as a promise, "shall make you perfect", &amp;c. the sense is the same; for if it is a prayer, it is a prayer in faith, for what shall be done; for God will make his people "perfect": and which respects not their justification; for in that sense they are perfect already in Christ, their head, who has perfectly fulfilled the law for them, and fully expiated their sins; has completely redeemed them, and procured for them the pardon of all their trespasses; and has justified them from all their iniquities: but their sanctification; for though all grace is implanted in them at once, yet it is gradually brought to perfection; there is a perfection of parts, of all the parts of the new man, or creature, but not of degrees; and there is a comparative perfection with respect to themselves, before conversion, or with respect to hypocrites; for perfection oftentimes means no other than integrity and sincerity; or with respect to other Christians, who are weaker in knowledge and experience: and there is a perfection of holiness in Christ, who is their sanctification, but not in themselves; for every part of the work of grace is imperfect, as faith, love, knowledge, &amp;c. and sin dwells in them, and they stand in need of fresh supplies of grace; and even the best of them disclaim perfection, though they greatly desire it, as here the apostle prays for it; and which shows that, as yet, they had it not, though they will have it hereafter in heaven, where there will be perfect knowledge, and perfect holiness, and perfect happiness. He also prays that God would "stablish" them, or believes and promises that he would. The people of God are in a safe and established state and condition already; they are in the arms of everlasting love, and in the hands of Christ, and in a sure and inviolable covenant of grace, and are built on the rock of ages; and are in a state of grace, of justifying, adopting, and sanctifying grace, from whence they can never finally and totally fall; and yet they are very often unstable in their hearts and frames, and in the exercise of grace, and discharge of duty, and in their adherence to the doctrines of the Gospel; and need to be established, and to have a more firm persuasion of their interest in the love of God, and a more steady view of their standing in Christ, and the covenant of his grace, and a more lively and comfortable exercise grace on him, and a more constant discharge of duty, and a more firm and closer adherence to the truths and ordinances of the Gospel; and they will have a consummate stability in heaven, where are sure dwelling places. Another petition, or promise, is, that God would "strengthen" them; which supposes them to be weak and feeble, not as to their state and condition, for their place of defence is the munition of rocks; nor in the same sense as natural men are, or as they themselves were before conversion; nor are they all alike weak, some are weaker in faith and knowledge, and of a more weak and scrupulous conscience than others, and are more easily drawn aside by corruptions and temptations, and are in greater afflictions: and this is to be understood, not of bodily, but spiritual strength; that God would strengthen their souls, and the work of his grace in them, their faith, hope, and love; and strengthen them to perform their duties, to withstand temptations, oppose their own corruptions, bear the cross, reproaches, and persecutions, and do their generation work: and he further adds, and "settle" you, or "found" you; not that God would now lay the foundation, Christ, for he had been laid by him ready in his counsels and decrees, and in the covenant of his grace, in the mission of him into this world, and by his Spirit in their hearts; nor that he would afresh lay them on Christ, the foundation, for they were there laid already, and were safe; but that he would build them up, and settle their faith on this foundation, that they might be rooted and grounded in the love of God, have a lively sense and firm persuasion of their interest in it, and be grounded and settled in the faith of the Gospel; be settled under a Gospel ministry, have a fixed abode in the house of God, enjoy the spiritual provisions of it, and have fellowship with Christ, and his people here; and at last enter and dwell in the city which has foundations, where they will be never more subject to wavering, instability, and inconstancy, and from whence they will never be removed; this will be their last and eternal settlement: and this will be "after" they have "suffered awhile"; in their bodies, characters, and estates, through the malice and wickedness of men; and in their souls, from their own corruptions, the temptations of Satan, and the hidings of God's face; which will be but for a very little while, for a moment, as it were; these are only the sufferings of this present time, and in the present evil world; nor are they inconsistent with God being the God of all grace unto them, or with their being called to eternal glory, the way to which lies through them; and they are the means of perfecting, establishing, strengthening, and settling them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_peter/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{13}</span> But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle <i>you</i>.</span><p>(13) He seals up as with a seal the former exhortation with a solemn prayer, again willing them to ask increase of strength at his hands, of whom they had the beginning, and hope to have the accomplishment: that is, of God the Father in Christ Jesus, in whom we are sure of the glory of eternal life.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/1_peter/5.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_peter/5-10.htm" title="But the God of all grace, who has called us to his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that you have suffered a while, make you perfect, establish, strengthen, settle you....">1 Peter 5:10-11</a>.

God possesses the glory not first in Christ, as Hofmann says, but He has had it from all eternity, although in Christ it is first revealed. Gerhard interprets incorrectly: propter meritum Christi. <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span> is by several interpreters inaccurately taken as equivalent to <span class="greekheb">διά</span>; but though <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span> denote instrumentality, this is of a more inward nature than that expressed by <span class="greekheb">διά</span>.

(Steiger, de Wette, Wiesinger), but in such a way that in sense it does not apply so much to <span class="greekheb">καλέσας</span>, as to the obtaining of the <span class="greekheb">δόξα</span> of God, since the aorist must not arbitrarily be interpreted as a present. Hofmann rightly observes: “Peter subjoins this aorist participle as if it had been preceded by <span class="greekheb">εἰς τὸ δοξάζεσθαι</span>.”[281] Lachmann and Tischendorf (om. <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὙΜᾶς</span></span></span> after <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑΤΑΡΤΊΣΕΙ</span></span></span>) have connected these words with what follows, as also the Vulg. translates: modicum passos ipse perficiet (so also Wichelhaus).

In connexion with this attribute of God, there follows the fact that He had called those to whom the Apostle writes to nothing less than a share in His “eternal glory.” It may be noted, as bearing on the question as to the authorship of the Second Epistle, that the same description occurs there also (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-3.htm" title="According as his divine power has given to us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that has called us to glory and virtue:">2 Peter 1:3</a>).

"Digna <span class="accented">Petro</span> oratio, 'Confirmat fratres sues,'" says Bengel (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-17.htm">Ephesians 3:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-19.htm">2 Timothy 2:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-11.htm">1 Corinthians 3:11</a>). The word is omitted in the Vatican and Alexandrine Manuscripts; but it is found in the Sinaitic and other manuscripts and versions, and ought to be retained. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/1_peter/5.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Who hath called us (&#x3bf;&#788; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c2;)<p>But the tense is the aorist, and the true reading is &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c2;, you, instead of us. Render, therefore, as Rev., who called you; before the foundation of the world. See <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/8-29.htm">Romans 8:29</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/8-30.htm">Romans 8:30</a>, and compare unto his eternal glory and them he also glorified.<p>By Christ Jesus (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3a7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x399;&#787;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;)<p>The best texts omit Jesus.

So the A. V. But the best texts make them all indicative future, and thus convert the wish or prayer into an assurance.

Rev. reads restore, in margin. The root of this word appears in &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c9; or &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;, to fit or join together. So &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; means a joint. The radical notion of the verb is, therefore, adjustment - the putting of all the parts into right relation and connection. We find it used of mending the nets (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-21.htm">Matthew 4:21</a>), and of restoring an erring brother (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-1.htm">Galatians 6:1</a>); of framing the body and the worlds (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-5.htm">Hebrews 10:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-3.htm">Hebrews 11:3</a>); of the union of members in the church (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-10.htm">1 Corinthians 1:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-11.htm">2 Corinthians 13:11</a>). Out of this comes the general sense of perfecting (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-16.htm">Matthew 21:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-40.htm">Luke 6:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-10.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:10</a>).<p>Shall stablish (&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;)<p>The word is akin at the root to &#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;, steadfast (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-9.htm">1 Peter 5:9</a>), and is the very word used by Christ in his exhortation to Peter, "strengthen thy brethren" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-32.htm">Luke 22:32</a>).
