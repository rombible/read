Anxiety implies not only some distrust of God’s providence, but also some kind of belief that we may be able to manage better for ourselves; therefore here, as in the Sermon on the Mount, we are exhorted, especially in time of danger, simply to do what we know we ought to do, and to be unheeding about the rest.<p>“Lord, it belongs not to my care<p>Whether I die or live.”<p>The confidence cannot be misplaced, for God is not forgetful of us. The play of words in the English does not represent anything in the original, where the two words for “care” are quite different.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_peter/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:5-9 Humility preserves peace and order in all Christian churches and societies; pride disturbs them. Where God gives grace to be humble, he will give wisdom, faith, and holiness. To be humble, and subject to our reconciled God, will bring greater comfort to the soul than the gratification of pride and ambition. But it is to be in due time; not in thy fancied time, but God's own wisely appointed time. Does he wait, and wilt not thou? What difficulties will not the firm belief of his wisdom, power, and goodness get over! Then be humble under his hand. Cast all you care; personal cares, family cares, cares for the present, and cares for the future, for yourselves, for others, for the church, on God. These are burdensome, and often very sinful, when they arise from unbelief and distrust, when they torture and distract the mind, unfit us for duties, and hinder our delight in the service of God. The remedy is, to cast our care upon God, and leave every event to his wise and gracious disposal. Firm belief that the Divine will and counsels are right, calms the spirit of a man. Truly the godly too often forget this, and fret themselves to no purpose. Refer all to God's disposal. The golden mines of all spiritual comfort and good are wholly his, and the Spirit itself. Then, will he not furnish what is fit for us, if we humbly attend on him, and lay the care of providing for us, upon his wisdom and love? The whole design of Satan is to devour and destroy souls. He always is contriving whom he may insnare to eternal ruin. Our duty plainly is, to be sober; to govern both the outward and the inward man by the rules of temperance. To be vigilant; suspicious of constant danger from this spiritual enemy, watchful and diligent to prevent his designs. Be stedfast, or solid, by faith. A man cannot fight upon a quagmire, there is no standing without firm ground to tread upon; this faith alone furnishes. It lifts the soul to the firm advanced ground of the promises, and fixes it there. The consideration of what others suffer, is proper to encourage us to bear our share in any affliction; and in whatever form Satan assaults us, or by whatever means, we may know that our brethren experience the same.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_peter/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Casting all your care upon him - Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/55-22.htm">Psalm 55:22</a>, from whence this passage was probably taken. "Cast thy burden upon the Lord, and he shall sustain thee; he shall never suffer the righteous to be moved." Compare, for a similar sentiment, <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/6-25.htm">Matthew 6:25-30</a>. The meaning is, that we are to commit our whole cause to him. If we suffer heavy trials; if we lose our friends, health, or property; if we have arduous and responsible duties to perform; if we feel that we have no strength, and are in danger of being crushed by what is laid upon us, we may go and cast all upon the Lord; that is, we may look to him for grace and strength, and feel assured that he will enable us to sustain all that is laid upon us. The relief in the case will be as real, and as full of consolation, as if he took the burden and bore it himself. He will enable us to bear with ease what we supposed we could never have done; and the burden which he lays upon us will be light, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-30.htm">Matthew 11:30</a>. Compare the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/4-6.htm">Philippians 4:6-7</a>.<p>For he careth for you - See the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/10-29.htm">Matthew 10:29-31</a>. He is not like the gods worshipped by many of the pagan, who were supposed to be so exalted, and so distant, that they did not interest themselves in human affairs; but He condescends to regard the needs of the meanest of his creatures. It is one of the glorious attributes of the true God, that he can and will thus notice the needs of the mean as well as the mighty; and one of the richest of all consolations when we are afflicted, and are despised by the world, is the thought that we are not forgotten by our heavenly Father. He who remembers the falling sparrow, and who hears the young ravens when they cry, will not be unmindful of us. "Yet the Lord thinketh on me," was the consolation of David, when he felt that he was "poor and needy," <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-17.htm">Psalm 40:17</a>. "When my father and my mother forsake me, then the Lord will take me up," <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-10.htm">Psalm 27:10</a>.<p>Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-15.htm">Isaiah 49:15</a>. What more can one wish than to be permitted to feel that the great and merciful Yahweh thinks on him? What are we - what have we done, that should be worthy of such condescension? Remember, poor, despised, afflicted child of God, that you will never be forgotten. Friends on earth, the great, the frivilous, the noble, the rich, may forget you; God never will. Remember that you will never be entirely neglected. Father, mother, neighbor, friend, those whom you have loved, and those to whom you have done good, may neglect you, but God never will. You may become poor, and they may pass by you; you may lose your office, and flatterers may no longer throng your path; your beauty may fade, and your admirers may leave you; you may grow old, and be infirm, and appear to be useless in the world, and no one may seem to care for you; but it is not thus with the God whom you serve. When he loves, he always loves; if he regarded you with favor when you were rich, he will not forget you when you are poor; he who watched over you with a parent's care in the bloom of youth, will not cast you off when you are "old and grey-headed," <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/71-18.htm">Psalm 71:18</a>. If we are what we should be, we shall never be without a friend as long as there is a God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_peter/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7.

Hofmann, without reason, assumes that in this passage <span class="greekheb">μέριμνα</span> does not mean care itself, but the object which causes care. The context shows that the care specially meant here is that which is occasioned by the sufferings; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-25.htm" title="Therefore I say to you, Take no thought for your life, what you shall eat, or what you shall drink; nor yet for your body, what you shall put on.

St. Peter is quoting, with slight alterations, the Septuagint Version of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55-22.htm">Psalm 55:22</a>. We cast our anxiety upon God when we fulfill the Lord's commandment, "Take no thought [rather, 'be not anxious'], saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed? For your heavenly Fat. her knoweth that ye have need of all these things." God cares for us; therefore we must not be over-anxious, but trust in him. The participle is aorist, as if implying that we are to cast the whole burden of all our anxieties <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> by one act of faith upon the Lord. <span class="cmt_word">For he careth for you</span>.

The care which is forbidden is that anxiety about worldly things which harasses a man and distracts his mind, so that he cannot compose himself to prayer and holy meditation. God's care for us is calm, holy, thoughtful providence. He "knoweth that we have need of all these things;" and he maketh all things work together for good to his chosen, to them that love him. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/1_peter/5.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Casting (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;)<p>The aorist participle denoting an act once for all; throwing the whole life with its care on him.<p>All your care (&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;)<p>The whole of your care.
