So contemptible was the name that, as M. Renan says (p. 37), “Well-bred people avoided pronouncing the name, or, when forced to do so, made a kind of apology.” Tacitus, for instance, says: “Those who were <span class= "ital">vulgarly</span> known by the name of Christians.” In fact, it is quite an open question whether we ought not here (as well as in the two places of Acts above cited) to read the nickname in its barbarous form: <span class= "ital">Chrestian.</span> The Sinaitic manuscript has that form, and the Vatican has the form <span class= "ital">Chreistian</span>; and it is much harder to suppose that a scribe who commonly called himself a <span class= "ital">Christian</span> would intentionally alter it into this strange form than to suppose that one who did not understand the irony of saying a <span class= "ital">Chrestian</span> should have written the word with which he was so familiar.<p><span class= "bld">Let him not be ashamed.</span>—Although the name sounds worse to the world than “murderer,” or “thief,” or “malefactor.”<p><span class= "bld">On this behalf.</span>—This is a possible rendering, but it is more pointed to translate literally, <span class= "ital">but let him glorify God in this name</span>—<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>make even this name of ridicule the ground of an act of glory to God.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_peter/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:12-19 By patience and fortitude in suffering, by dependence on the promises of God, and keeping to the word the Holy Spirit hath revealed, the Holy Spirit is glorified; but by the contempt and reproaches cast upon believers, he is evil spoken of, and is blasphemed. One would think such cautions as these were needless to Christians. But their enemies falsely charged them with foul crimes. And even the best of men need to be warned against the worst of sins. There is no comfort in sufferings, when we bring them upon ourselves by our own sin and folly. A time of universal calamity was at hand, as foretold by our Saviour, Mt 24:9,10. And if such things befall in this life, how awful will the day of judgment be! It is true that the righteous are scarcely saved; even those who endeavour to walk uprightly in the ways of God. This does not mean that the purpose and performance of God are uncertain, but only the great difficulties and hard encounters in the way; that they go through so many temptations and tribulations, so many fightings without and fears within. Yet all outward difficulties would be as nothing, were it not for lusts and corruptions within. These are the worst clogs and troubles. And if the way of the righteous be so hard, then how hard shall be the end of the ungodly sinner, who walks in sin with delight, and thinks the righteous is a fool for all his pains! The only way to keep the soul well, is, to commit it to God by prayer, and patient perseverance in well-doing. He will overrule all to the final advantage of the believer.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_peter/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Yet if any man suffer as a Christian - Because he is a Christian; if he is persecuted on account of his religion. This was often done, and they had reason to expect that it might occur in their own case. Compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-17.htm">1 Peter 3:17</a>. On the import of the word Christian, and the reasons why the name was given to the disciples of the Lord Jesus, see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-26.htm">Acts 11:26</a>.<p>Let him not be ashamed - <p>(1) Ashamed of religion so as to refuse to suffer on account of it.<p>(2) ashamed that he is despised and maltreated.<p>He is to regard his religion as every way honorable, and all that fairly results from it in time and eternity as in every respect desirable. He is not to be ashamed to be called a Christian; he is not to be ashamed of the doctrines taught by his religion; he is not to be ashamed of the Saviour whom he professes to love; he is not to be ashamed of the society and fellowship of those who are true Christians, poor and despised though they may be; he is not to be ashamed to perform any of the duties demanded by his religion; he is not to be ashamed to have his name cast out, and himself subjected to reproach and scorn. A man should be ashamed only of that which is wrong. He should glory in that which is right, whatever may be the consequences to himself. Christians now, though not subjected to open persecution, are frequently reproached by the world on account of their religion; and though the rack may not be employed, and the fires of martyrdom are not enkindled, yet it is often true that one who is a believer is called to "suffer as a Christian." He may be reviled and despised. His views may be regarded as bigoted, narrow, severe. Opprobrious epithets, on account of his opinions, may be applied to him. His former friends and companions may leave him because he has become a Christian. A wicked father, or a frivilous and worldly mother, may oppose a child, or a husband may revile a wife, on account of their religion. In all these cases, the same spirit essentially is required which was enjoined on the early Christian martyrs. We are never to be ashamed of our religion, whatever results may follow from our attachment to it.

Ac 11:26; 26:28; the only three places where the term occurs. At first believers had no distinctive name, but were called among themselves "brethren," Ac 6:3; "disciples," Ac 6:1; "those of the way," Ac 9:2; "saints," Ro 1:7; by the Jews (who denied that Jesus was the Christ, and so would never originate the name Christian), in contempt, "Nazarenes." At Antioch, where first idolatrous Gentiles (Cornelius, Ac 10:1, 2, was not an idolater, but a proselyte) were converted, and wide missionary work began, they could be no longer looked on as a Jewish sect, and so the Gentiles designated them by the new name "Christians." The rise of the new name marked a new epoch in the Church's life, a new stage of its development, namely, its missions to the Gentiles. The idle and witty people of Antioch, we know from heathen writers, were famous for inventing nicknames. The date of this Epistle must have been when this had become the generally recognized designation among Gentiles (it is never applied by Christians to each other, as it was in after ages&#8212;an undesigned proof that the New Testament was composed when it professes), and when the name exposed one to reproach and suffering, though not seemingly as yet to systematic persecution.<p>let him not be ashamed&#8212;though the world is ashamed of shame.

Its Latin form, analogous to that of <span class="ital">Pompeiani, Mariani</span>, for the followers of Pompeius or Marius, indicated that the new society was attracting the attention of official persons and others at Antioch. The word naturally found acceptance.

Soon it came to be claimed by those believers. The question, Are you a Christian? became the crucial test of their faith.

"The disciples were called Christians first in Antioch."

The name was probably invented by the heathen, and used at first as a term of derision; there is something of scorn in Agrippa's use of it. It did not at once become common among the disciples of the Lord. St. Peter (who preached at Antioch (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-11.htm">Galatians 2:11</a>), and is said to have been Bishop of Antioch) is the only sacred writer who adopts it instead of the older names, and that only ones, and in connection with threatened persecution. St. James may possibly allude to it in <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-7.htm">James 2:7</a>. But it was not commonly used among' believers till after New Testament times. Then they began to discern its admirable suitableness. It reminded them that the center of their religion was not a system of doctrines, but a Person, and that Person the Messiah, the Anointed of God. The Hebrew origin of the word, the Greek dress, the Latin termination, seemed to point, like the threefold inscription on the cross, to the universality of Christ's religion to its empire, first over all the civilized nations, and through them, by continually increasing triumphs, over the whole world. It reminded them that they too were anointed, that they had an unction from the Holy One. Its very corruption through heathen ignorance, <span class="accented">Christian</span> from <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, good (the Sinaitic Manuscript has <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> in this place) had its lesson - it spoke of sweetness and of goodness. See the oft-quoted passage from Tertullian: "Sed quum et perperam Chres-tiani nuncupamur a vobis (nam nec nominis certa est notitia penes yes) de suavitate et benignitate compositum est." <span class="cmt_word">Let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God on this behalf.</span> The best-supported reading is <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x1ff3;</span>. This may be understood as an idiom, in the same sense as the reading of the Authorized Version; but it is better to translate it literally, <span class="accented">in this name, i.e.</span> either the name of Christ, or (more probably, perhaps) that of Christian. <span class="cmt_word">The heathen blasphemed that worthy Name</span>; suffering  Christians must not be ashamed of it, but, as the holy martyrs did, utter their "Christianus sum" with inward peace and thanksgiving, glorifying God that he had given them grace to bear that honored Name and to suffer for Christ. Bengel says here, "Poterat Petrus dicere, honori sibi ducat: sed honorem Dee resignandum esse docet." <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/1_peter/4.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>A Christian<p>Only three times in the New Testament, and never as a name used by Christians themselves, but as a nickname or a term of reproach. See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-26.htm">Acts 11:26</a>. Hence Peter's idea is, if any man suffer from the contumely of those who contemptuously style him Christian. </body></html>
