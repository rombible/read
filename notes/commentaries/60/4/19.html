And the clause, “according to the will of God,” seems not intended to mean “in a godly and unblameable manner,” as opposed to the “suffering as a murderer” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-15.htm" title="But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as an evildoer, or as a busybody in other men's matters.">1Peter 4:15</a>); rather, it brings out that such a death is no accident, no sudden calamity, but in strict accordance with God’s prearranged design. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-17.htm" title="For it is better, if the will of God be so, that you suffer for well doing, than for evil doing.">1Peter 3:17</a> : “if the will of God will it.”) Thus it harmonises with the following: “faithful Creator,” “commit their souls.”<p><span class= "bld">Commit the keeping of their souls</span>.—The beautiful verb rendered “commit the keeping of” is a technical term for <span class= "ital">depositing</span> a deed, or sum of money, or other valuable, with any one in trust. In the literal sense it occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-48.htm" title="But he that knew not, and did commit things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few stripes. For to whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required: and to whom men have committed much, of him they will ask the more.">Luke 12:48</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-12.htm" title="For the which cause I also suffer these things: nevertheless I am not ashamed: for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed to him against that day.">2Timothy 1:12</a> : in a metaphorical sense, of <span class= "ital">doctrines</span> committed in trust to the safe keeping of the Episcopate, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-18.htm" title="This charge I commit to you, son Timothy, according to the prophecies which went before on you, that you by them might war a good warfare;">1Timothy 1:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-20.htm" title="O Timothy, keep that which is committed to your trust, avoiding profane and vain babblings, and oppositions of science falsely so called:">1Timothy 6:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-14.htm" title="That good thing which was committed to you keep by the Holy Ghost which dwells in us.">2Timothy 1:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-2.htm" title="And the things that you have heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit you to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.">2Timothy 2:2</a> : of leaving <span class= "ital">persons</span> whom you love in trust, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-23.htm" title="And when they had ordained them elders in every church, and had prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom they believed.">Acts 14:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-32.htm" title="And now, brothers, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified.">Acts 20:32</a>. But the words which St. Peter probably has ringing in his ears when he thus writes are the words of our Lord on the cross (where the same verb is used): “Father, into Thy hands I commend My spirit” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-46.htm" title="And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into your hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up the ghost.">Luke 23:46</a>). “Their souls” might, perhaps, with still more propriety, be here translated <span class= "ital">their lives.</span> The connection will then be: “Consider the mildness of these trials compared with the terrors overhanging the sinful. Even if the worst should come to the worst, and you must die a martyr’s death, it is but the execution of God’s plan for you. View your life as a deposit: lay it confidently in His hands, to be returned to you again when the time comes: and you will find Him faithful to what a Creator ought to be.”<p><span class= "bld">A faithful Creator.</span>—The word “faithful” is used in reference to the “deposit” placed in His hands; and the title “Creator” seems to be chosen here rather than “Father,” or the like, because creation of the soul includes not only the giving of its existence but the shaping of its destiny. “The will of God,” in accordance with which they “suffer,” is part of the act of creation. The noble expression, however, contains the idea that the act of creation imposes duties and responsibilities upon the Creator. It is conceivable that some powerful being (not our God) might create, and be careless of the happiness or of the moral welfare or of the mutual relations of his creatures. Such a creator would be “unfaithful:” we should have a right to expect differently of him. But God is a “faithful Creator.” “Though He slay me, yet will I trust Him.”<p><span class= "bld">In well doing.</span>—In the Greek these words come emphatically last. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-17.htm" title="For it is better, if the will of God be so, that you suffer for well doing, than for evil doing.">1Peter 3:17</a>.)<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_peter/4.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-19.htm" title="Why let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls to him in well doing, as to a faithful Creator.">1 Peter 4:19</a></span>. <span class="ital">Wherefore let them that suffer </span>— This temporary chastisement; <span class="ital">according to the will of God </span>— Namely, for a good cause, and in a right spirit; <span class="ital">commit the keeping of their souls to him </span>— Intrust themselves to God’s care, either to preserve their lives, if he see good, or to save their souls if they suffer death; or, <span class="ital">whatever becomes of their bodies, </span>let them commit their souls to him as a sacred depositum: <span class="ital">in well-doing </span>— Persevering to the end in the way of duty and obedience, notwithstanding all the sufferings to which they are exposed. In other words, let it be their care to do well, and suffer patiently, and God will take care of the rest. <span class="ital">As unto a faithful Creator </span>— In whose wisdom, power, goodness, truth, and faithfulness to his promises, they may safely trust: for as he called them into existence when they were not, he is able to preserve them without any visible means, and will dispose of them as he sees will conduce most to their eternal welfare. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_peter/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:12-19 By patience and fortitude in suffering, by dependence on the promises of God, and keeping to the word the Holy Spirit hath revealed, the Holy Spirit is glorified; but by the contempt and reproaches cast upon believers, he is evil spoken of, and is blasphemed. One would think such cautions as these were needless to Christians. But their enemies falsely charged them with foul crimes. And even the best of men need to be warned against the worst of sins. There is no comfort in sufferings, when we bring them upon ourselves by our own sin and folly. A time of universal calamity was at hand, as foretold by our Saviour, Mt 24:9,10. And if such things befall in this life, how awful will the day of judgment be! It is true that the righteous are scarcely saved; even those who endeavour to walk uprightly in the ways of God. This does not mean that the purpose and performance of God are uncertain, but only the great difficulties and hard encounters in the way; that they go through so many temptations and tribulations, so many fightings without and fears within. Yet all outward difficulties would be as nothing, were it not for lusts and corruptions within. These are the worst clogs and troubles. And if the way of the righteous be so hard, then how hard shall be the end of the ungodly sinner, who walks in sin with delight, and thinks the righteous is a fool for all his pains! The only way to keep the soul well, is, to commit it to God by prayer, and patient perseverance in well-doing. He will overrule all to the final advantage of the believer.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_peter/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Wherefore, let them that suffer according to the will of God - That is, who endure the kind of sufferings that he, by his providence, shall appoint. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-17.htm">1 Peter 3:17</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-15.htm">1 Peter 4:15-16</a>.<p>Commit the keeping of their souls - to him. Since there is so much danger; since there is no one else that can keep them; and since he is a Being so faithful, let them commit all their interests to him. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-5.htm">Psalm 37:5</a>. The word "souls" here (&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3c2;  psuchas) is equivalent to themselves. They were to leave everything in his hand, faithfully performing every duty, and not being anxious for the result.<p>In well doing - Constantly doing good, or seeking to perform every duty in a proper manner. Their business was always to do right; the result was to be left with God. A man who is engaged always in well-doing, may safely commit all his interest to God.<p>As unto a faithful Creator - God may be trusted, or confided in, in all His attributes, and in all the relations which He sustains as Creator, Redeemer, Moral Governor, and Judge. In these, and in all other respects, we may come before Him with confidence, and put unwavering trust in Him. As Creator particularly; as one who has brought us, and all creatures and things into being, we may be sure that he will be "faithful" to the design which he had in view. From that design he will never depart until it is fully accomplished. He abandons no purpose which he has formed, and we may be assured that he will faithfully pursue it to the end. As our Creator we may come to Him, and look to Him for His protection and care. He made us. He had a design in our creation. He so endowed us that we might live forever, and so that we might honor and enjoy Him. He did not create us that we might be miserable; nor does He wish that we should be. He formed us in such a way that, if we choose, we may be eternally happy. In that path in which He has appointed us to go, if we pursue it, we may be sure of His help and protection. If we really aim to accomplish the purposes for which we were made, we may be certain that He will show Himself to be a "faithful Creator;" one in whom we may always confide. And even though we have wandered from Him, and have long forgotten why we were made, and have loved and served the creature more than the Creator, we may be sure, if we will return to Him, that He will not forget the design for which He originally made us. As our Creator we may still confide in Him. Redeemed by the blood of His Son, and renewed by His Spirit after the image of Him who erected us, we may still go to Him as our Creator, and may pray that even yet the high and noble ends for which we were made may be accomplished in us. Doing this, we shall find Him as true to that purpose as though we had never sinned. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_peter/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19. General conclusion from 1Pe 4:17, 18. Seeing that the godly know that their sufferings are by God's will, to chasten them that they may not perish with the world, they have good reason to trust God cheerfully amidst sufferings, persevering in well-doing.<p>let them&#8212;Greek, "let them also," "let even them," as well as those not suffering. Not only under ordinary circumstances, but also in time of suffering, let believers commit. (Compare Note, see on [2623]1Pe 3:14).<p>according to the will of God&#8212;(See on [2624]1Pe 3:17). God's will that the believer should suffer (1Pe 4:17), is for his good. One oldest manuscript and Vulgate read, "in well-doings"; contrast ill-doings, 1Pe 4:15. Our committing of ourselves to God is to be, not in indolent and passive quietism, but accompanied with active well-doings.<p>faithful&#8212;to His covenant promises.<p>Creator&#8212;who is therefore also our Almighty Preserver. He, not we, must keep our souls. Sin destroyed the original spiritual relation between creature and Creator, leaving that only of government. Faith restores it; so that the believer, living to the will of God (1Pe 4:2), rests implicitly on his Creator's faithfulness.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_peter/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Let them that suffer; </span> viz. any manner of affliction or persecution for righteousness’ sake. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">According to the will of God; </span> according to that will of God, whereby he hath appointed them to suffer such things, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-17.htm" title="For it is better, if the will of God be so, that you suffer for well doing, than for evil doing.">1 Peter 3:17</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-3.htm" title="That no man should be moved by these afflictions: for yourselves know that we are appointed thereunto.">1 Thessalonians 3:3</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Commit; </span> commend into his hands, or lay up, or intrust with him as a depositum, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-5.htm" title="Into your hand I commit my spirit: you have redeemed me, O LORD God of truth.">Psalm 31:5</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-12.htm" title="For the which cause I also suffer these things: nevertheless I am not ashamed: for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed to him against that day.">2 Timothy 1:12</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The keeping of their souls; </span> as the most precious things while they live, and most to be cared for when they die; that they may be kept from sin under afflictions, and from perishing in death: or rather, <span class="ital">their souls</span> here includes their bodies, and so committing their souls is committing their whole selves to God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">In well-doing; </span> not being deterred from well-doing by the evils they suffer, but by persevering in holiness notwithstanding their afflictions, making it appear to the last, that they do not suffer as evil-doers. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">As unto a faithful Creator; </span> one who, as Creator, is able to keep what they commit to him; and being faithful to his promises, certainly will do it. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_peter/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God,.... This is the conclusion made from the foregoing premises; that seeing the state and condition of the saints in this world, at worst, and which is but for a time, is infinitely preferable to the dreadful state and condition of disobedient persons, ungodly men, and sinners, and which will endure to all eternity; they should not think strange of their sufferings, or complain of them, but patiently endure them; and especially when they consider that these are not the effects of chance, or merely owing to the malice and wickedness of men, or to any second cause only; but they are the will of God, are by his appointment, under his direction, and by his order, and for their good, and his own glory; and therefore it becomes them to <p>commit the keeping of their souls to him, in well doing, as unto a faithful Creator: and which is not only their duty, but their privilege: and the sense is, that when they are called to suffer for Christ, they should commit their cause to God, who, as he is the Creator, is the Governor of the universe, and will judge righteously; and when they are even called to lay down their lives for his sake, they shall not lose them; though their bodies are killed, they may and should commit their souls, when departing from their bodies, into the hands of God; as Stephen, the first martyr, committed his into the hands of Christ, in imitation of him; where he that made them, as he is able to keep them, will faithfully preserve them in happiness and glory, till the resurrection morn, when their bodies shall be raised and reunited to them: and this is to be performed, in "well doing"; for which they suffer, and in which they should continue to the last; not rendering evil for evil, but blessing; and in imitation of Christ, and his servant Stephen, pray for their worst enemies, and wish them all the good, and do them all the acts of kindness that lie in their power. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_peter/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{18}</span> Wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls <i>to him</i> in well doing, as unto a faithful Creator.</span><p>(18) The conclusion: seeing the godly are not afflicted by chance, but by the will of God, they ought not to despair, but go forward nonetheless in the way of holiness and well doing, commending themselves to God their faithful creator, that is to say, their Father.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/1_peter/4.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-19.htm" title="Why let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls to him in well doing, as to a faithful Creator.">1 Peter 4:19</a>.

The Christian must still follow the pattern. It is God’s will that he share Christ’s sufferings in whatever degree; let him in this also copy Christ, who said, <span class="ital">Father into thy hands I commit my spirit</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-46.htm" title="And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into your hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up the ghost.">Luke 23:46</a> = <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-6.htm" title="I have hated them that regard lying vanities: but I trust in the LORD.">Psalm 31:6</a>) and bade His disciples lose their souls that they might find them unto life eternal. With this teaching Peter combines that of the Psalmist which is assumed by Jesus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-25.htm" title="Therefore I say to you, Take no thought for your life, what you shall eat, or what you shall drink; nor yet for your body, what you shall put on.

If we really think of pain and persecution as working out God’s will, permitted and controlled by Him, we know that that Will is righteous and loving; planning nothing less than our completeness in holiness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-3.htm" title="For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that you should abstain from fornication:">1 Thessalonians 4:3</a>), the Will of which we daily pray that it may be done on earth as it is in heaven. The Greek word for “Creator” is not found elsewhere in the New Testament, but is found in the LXX. of <a href="http://apocrypha.org/judith/9-12.htm" title="I pray thee, I pray thee, O God of my father, and God of the inheritance of Israel, Lord of the heavens and earth, Creator of the waters, king of every creature, hear thou my prayer:">Jdt 9:12</a>, <a href="http://apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/1-24.htm" title="And the prayer was after this manner; O Lord, Lord God, Creator of all things, who art fearful and strong, and righteous, and merciful, and the only and gracious King,">2Ma 1:24</a>. Stress is laid on the attribute, or act, of creation as the ground of confidence. He who made the soul is also He who hateth nothing that He hath made. Here, also, we can scarcely doubt the example of the Great Sufferer was present to the Apostle’s mind, and his words were therefore echoes of those spoken on the Cross, “Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-46.htm" title="And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into your hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up the ghost.">Luke 23:46</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/1_peter/4.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-19.htm" title="Why let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls to him in well doing, as to a faithful Creator.">1 Peter 4:19</a>. <span class="greekheb">Καὶ οἱ πάσχοντες</span>, <span class="ital">even those who suffer</span>) <span class="greekheb">Καὶ</span>, <span class="ital">even</span>, with the force of a concession. <span class="greekheb">Καὶ</span>, <span class="ital">even</span>, with a participle, is the same as <span class="greekheb">εἰ καὶ</span>, <span class="ital">and if</span> [even though]; with a verb, <span class="greekheb">εἰ καὶ πάσχοιτε</span>, <span class="ital">and if</span> [<span class="ital">even though</span>] <span class="ital">ye suffer</span>, ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-14.htm" title="But and if you suffer for righteousness' sake, happy are you: and be not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled;">1 Peter 3:14</a>. We ought not to conceive distrust from suffering.—<span class="greekheb">κατὰ τὸ θέλημα τοῦ Θεοῦ</span>, <span class="ital">according to the will of God</span>) on account of doing the will of God in a different manner from evil-doers, who suffer according to the will of God, inasmuch as God wills them to be punished: <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-15.htm" title="But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as an evildoer, or as a busybody in other men's matters.">1 Peter 4:15</a>.

Let the supra-Lapsarians see how they recognise a Creator faithful towards all.—<span class="greekheb">παρατιθέσθωσαν</span>, <span class="ital">let them commit</span>) as <span class="ital">a deposit</span>, not alarmed, but rather gladdened by sufferings, since they receive them to their advantage.—<span class="greekheb">ψυχὰς</span>, <span class="ital">their souls</span>) although the body appears to perish.—<span class="greekheb">ἐν ἀγαθοποιΐα</span>, <span class="ital">in well-doing</span>) This should be the one and only care of those who suffer, both <span class="ital">to act well</span> and to suffer well: He will take care of the rest. To be taken with <span class="ital">let them commit</span>. Well-doing always has confidence united to it: ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-6.htm" title="Even as Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose daughters you are, as long as you do well, and are not afraid with any amazement.">1 Peter 3:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-22.htm" title="And whatever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight.">1 John 3:22</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God</span>; rather, <span class="accented">let them also that suffer.</span> St. Peter sums up his exhortation; he returns to the thought of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-17.htm">1 Peter 3:17</a>, "It is better, if the will of God be so, that ye suffer for well-doing, than for evil-doing." In the hour of suffering, as well as in times of prosperity, we are in the hands of a merciful and loving Father; we are to learn submission, not because the suffering is inevitable, but because it is according to his will, and his will is our sanctification and salvation. Commit the keeping of their souls to him in well-doing, as unto a faithful Creator; rather, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">commit their souls in well-doing unto a faithful Creator.</span> The conjunction "as" must be omitted, not being found in any of the best manuscripts. The word rendered "Creator" (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>) Occurs nowhere else in the Greek Testament. <span class="cmt_word">God is our Creator, the Father of spirits, He gave the spirit; to him it returneth</span>. We must imitate our dying Lord, and, like him, commit our souls to the keeping of our heavenly Father as a deposit which may be left with perfect confidence in the hands of a faithful Creator (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-12.htm">2 Timothy 1:12</a>). There is an evident reference here to our Lord's words upon the cross (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-46.htm">Luke 23:46</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-5.htm">Psalm 31:5</a>). St. Peter adds, "in well-doing." The Christian's faith must bring forth the fruits of holy living; even in the midst of suffering he must "be careful to maintain good works." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/1_peter/4.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Commit (&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;)<p>Give in charge as a deposit.
