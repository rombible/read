This seems necessitated by the comparison of the <span class= "ital">trial</span> with the <span class= "ital">gold</span> itself, as we shall see. You cannot compare an act or process with gold, but you can compare “the genuine character” brought out by the process properly enough. Besides, that which you wish to “praise” at Christ’s coming is not the process by which the faith was proved, but the worth of the faith itself. “Faith” seems to mean the same as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-5.htm" title="Who are kept by the power of God through faith to salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.">1Peter 1:5</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Being much more precious than of gold.</span>—There is no reason, or indeed any grammatical right, to insert the “of.” It should be, <span class= "ital">more exceedingly valuable than gold.</span> He does not say “your <span class= "ital">faith</span> is more valuable than gold,” but “your faith’s <span class= "ital">genuineness</span> is more valuable than gold.” It is worth anything to establish the <span class= "ital">true character</span> of your faith; it would be a most serious loss to leave a chance of an imputation upon your Christianity.<p><span class= "bld">That perisheth, though it be tried with fire.</span>—Rather, <span class= "ital">which is a thing that perisheth, and yet is tried through fire.</span> The argument is this. Gold is a perishable thing, and comes to an end with the rest of the world, or is worn away with handling and is lost; and yet men take great pains to test it and show that it contains no dross, and do so by means of fire. How much more may we expect a fiery trial (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-12.htm" title="Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened to you:">1Peter 4:12</a>) to test the character of our belief in the unseen Christ, when that belief is never to come to an end (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-13.htm" title="And now stays faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity.">1Corinthians 13:13</a>), and on its freedom from alloy everything depends!<p><span class= "bld">Might be found.</span>—That is, <span class= "ital">might clearly prove to be.</span> The time will come when the gold will be <span class= "ital">inspected, </span>and the Judge, and all the spectators, will “find” that the testing was sufficient and the character satisfactory. “Found <span class= "ital">unto</span> praise,” or, <span class= "ital">found for a praise, </span>is a Hebraism, meaning “found to be a matter of praise.” St. Peter is fond of heaping up words of like signification. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-4.htm" title="To an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fades not away, reserved in heaven for you,">1Peter 1:4</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-10.htm" title="But the God of all grace, who has called us to his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that you have suffered a while, make you perfect, establish, strengthen, settle you.">1Peter 5:10</a>.) “Praise” is the <span class= "ital">language</span> that will be used about these men’s faith; “honour,” the <span class= "ital">rank</span> in which they will be placed; “glory,” the fervent <span class= "ital">admiration</span> accorded to them: the three words correspond to the regions of word, act, and feeling.<p><span class= "bld">At the appearing of Jesus Christ.</span>—<span class= "ital">Revelation</span> would have been better, as the word in the Greek is the same as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-5.htm" title="Who are kept by the power of God through faith to salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.">1Peter 1:5</a>. This gives the date at which the trial will have done its work: it is the same as the “last time” when the “deliverance” will be revealed. Remember that all through the afflictions and assaults the men are “being guarded by the power of God.” There are several words and thoughts in this whole passage which would suggest that Daniel 12 was before the mind of the Apostle more or less consciously.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/maclaren/1_peter/1.htm">MacLaren's Expositions</a></div><span class="bld">1 Peter<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>THE TRUE GOLD AND ITS TESTING</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-7.htm" title="That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perishes, though it be tried with fire, might be found to praise and honor and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ:">1 Peter 1:7</a>The Apostle is fond of that word ‘precious.’ In both his letters he uses it as an epithet for diverse things. According to one translation, he speaks of Christ as ‘precious to you which believe.’ He certainly speaks of ‘the precious blood of Christ,’ and of ‘exceeding great and precious promises,’ and here in my text, as well as in the Second Epistle, he speaks about ‘precious faith.’ It is a very wide general term, not expressing anything very characteristic beyond the one notion of value. But in the text, according to our Authorised Version, it looks at first sight as if it were not the faith, but the trial of the faith that the Apostle regards as thus valuable. There are difficulties of rendering which I need not trouble you with. Suffice it to say that, speaking roughly and popularly, the ‘trial of your faith’ here seems to mean rather the result of that trial, and might be fairly represented by the slightly varied expression, ‘your faith having been tried, might be found,’ etc.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>I must not be tempted to discourse about the reasons why such a rendering seems to express the Apostle’s meaning more fully, but, taking it for granted, there are just three things to notice--the true wealth, the testing of the wealth, and the discovery at last of the preciousness of the wealth.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. Peter pits against each other faith that has been tried, and ‘gold that perisheth’; he puts away all the other points of comparison and picks out one, and that is that the one lasts and the other does not. </span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Now I must not be seduced into going beyond the limits of my text to dilate upon the other points of contrast and pre-eminence; but I would just notice in a sentence that everybody admits, yet next to nobody acts upon, the admission that inward good is far more valuable than outward good. ‘Wisdom is more precious than rubies,’ say people, and yet they will choose the rubies, and take no trouble to get the wisdom. Now the very same principles of estimating value which set cultivated understandings and noble hearts above great possessions and large balances at the bankers, set the life of faith high above all others. And the one thought which Peter wishes to drive into our heads and hearts is that there is only one kind of wealth that will never be separated from its possessor. Nothing is truly ours that remains outside of us.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> ‘‘Twas mine, ‘tis his, and has been slave to thousands.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Nothing that is there whilst I am here is really mine. I do not own it if it is possible that I shall lose it. And so with profound meaning our Lord speaks about ‘that which is another’s’ in comparison with ‘that which is your own.’ It is another’s because it passes, like quicksilver under pressure, from hand to hand, and no man really holds it, but it leaps away from his grasp. And if a man retains it all his days, still, according to the grim old proverb, ‘shrouds have no pockets,’ and when he dies his hands open, or sometimes they clutch together, but there is nothing inside the palms, and they only close upon themselves. Dear brethren, if there is anything that can be filched away from us, anything about which it is true that, on the one hand, ‘moth and rust’--natural processes--’do corrupt’ it, on the other hand, ‘thieves break through and steal’--accidents of human conduct can deprive us of it, then we may call it ours, but it is not ours. It possesses us, if we are devoted to it as our best good, and fighting and toiling, and sometimes lying and cheating, and flinging the whole fierce energy of our nature into first gripping and then holding it; it possesses us; we do not possess it. But if there is anything that can become so interwoven and interlaced with the very fibres of a man’s heart that they and it cannot be parted, if there is anything that empty hands will clasp the closer, because they are emptied of earth’s vanities, then that is truly possessed by its possessor. And our faith, which will not be trodden in the grave, but will go with us into the world beyond, and though it be lost in one aspect, in sight, it will be eternal as trust, will be ours, imperishable as ourselves, and as God. Therefore, do not give all the energy of your lives to amassing the second-best riches. Seek the highest things most. ‘Covet earnestly the best gifts,’ and let the coveting regulate your conduct. And do not be put off with wealth that will fail you sooner or later.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. Note, again, the testing of the wealth.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>I need not dwell upon that very familiar metaphor of the furnace for gold, and the fining-pot for silver, only remember that there are two purposes for which metallurgists apply fire to metals. The one is to test them, and the other is to cleanse them, or, to use technical words, one is for the purpose of assaying them, and the other is for the purpose of refining them. And so, linking the words of my text with the words of the previous verse, we find that the Apostle lays it down that the purpose of all the diverse trials, or ‘temptations’ as he calls them, that come to us, is this one thing, that our faith should be ‘tried,’ and ‘found, unto praise and honour and glory.’ The fire carries away the dross; it makes the pure metal glow in its lustre. It burns up the ‘wood, hay, stubble’; it makes the gold gleam and the precious stones coruscate and flash.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And so note this general notion here of the intention of all life’s various aspects being to test character is specialised into this, that it is meant to test faith, first of all. Of course it is meant to test many other things. A man’s whole character is tested by the experiences of his daily life, all that is good and all that is evil in him, and we might speak about the effect of life’s discipline upon a great many different sides of our nature. But here the whole stress is put upon the effect of life in testing and clarifying and strengthening one part of a Christian’s character, and that is his faith. Why does Peter pick out faith? Why does he not say ‘trial of your hope,’ of your ‘love,’ of your ‘courage,’ of half a dozen other graces? Why ‘the trial of your faith?’ For this reason, because as the man’s faith is, so is the man. Because faith is the tap-root, in the view of the New Testament, of all that is good and strong and noble in humanity. Because if you strengthen a man’s trust you strengthen everything that comes from it. Reinforce the centre and all is reinforced. Your faith is the vital point from which your whole life as Christians is developed, and whatever strengthens that strengthens you. And, therefore, although everything that befalls you calls for the exercise of, and therefore tests, and therefore, rightly undergone, strengthens a great many various virtues and powers and beauties in a human character, the main good of it all is that it deepens, if the man is right, his simple trust in God manifested by his trust in and love to Jesus Christ: and so it reinforces the faith which works by love, and thus tends to make all things in life good and fair.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Now if thus the main end of life is to strengthen faith, let us remember that we have to give a wider meaning to the word ‘trials’ than ‘afflictions.’ Ah! there is as sharp a trial of my faith in prosperity as in any adversity. People say, ‘It is easy to trust God when things are going well with us.’ That is quite true. But it is a great deal easier to stop trusting God, or thinking about Him, when things are going well with us, and we do not seem to need Him so much, as in the hours of darkness. You remember the old story about the traveller, when the sun and the wind tried which could make him take off his cloak; and the sun did it. Some of us, I daresay, have found out that the faith which gripped God when we felt we needed Him, because we had not anything else but Him, is but too apt to lose hold of Him when fleeting delights and apparent treasures come and whisper invitations in our hearts. There are diseases that are proper to the northern, dark, ice-bound regions of the earth. Yes! and there are a great many more that belong to the tropics; as there is such a thing as sunstroke, which is, perhaps, as dangerous as the cramping cold from the icebergs of the north. Some of us should understand what that Scripture means: ‘Because they have no changes, therefore they fear not God.’ Prosperity, untroubled lives, lives even as the lives of those of the majority of mankind now, have their own most searching trials of faith.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But on the other hand, if there are ‘ships that have gone down at sea, when heaven was all tranquillity,’ there come also dark and nights of wild tempest when we have to lay to and ride out the gale with a tremendous strain on the cable. Our sorrows, our disappointments, our petty annoyances, and the great irrevocable griefs that sooner or later darken the very earth, are all to be classified under this same purpose, ‘that the trial of your faith ... might be found unto praise and honour and glory.’ And so, I beseech you, open your eyes to the meaning of life, and do not suppose that you have found the last word to say about it when you say ‘I am afflicted,’ or ‘I am at ease.’ The affliction and the ease, like two wheels in some great machine working in opposite directions, fit with their cogs into one another and move something beyond them in one uniform direction. And affliction and ease cooperate to this end, that we might be partakers of His holiness.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>I believe experience teaches the most of us, if we will lay its lessons to heart, that the times when Christian people grow most in the divine life is in their times of sorrow. One of the old divines says, ‘Grace grows best in winter’; and there are edible plants which need a touch of frost before they are good to eat. So it is with our faith. Only let us take care that the fire does not burn it up, as ‘wood, hay, stubble,’ but irradiates it and glorifies it, as ‘gold, silver, and precious stones.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">III. Now a word, lastly, about the ultimate discovery.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>‘Might be found unto praise and honour and glory.’ Note these three words, which I think are often neglected, and sometimes misunderstood--’praise, honour, glory.’ Whose? People sometimes say ‘God’s,’ since His people’s ultimate salvation redounds to His praise; but it is much better to understand the praise as given to the Christians whose faith has stood the testing fires. ‘Well done, good and faithful servant’--is not that praise from lips, praise from which is praise indeed? As Paul says, ‘then shall every man have praise of God.’ We are far too much afraid of recognising the fact that Jesus Christ in Heaven, like Jesus Christ on earth, will praise the deeds that come from love to Him, though the deeds themselves may be very imperfect. Do you remember ‘She hath wrought a good work on Me,’ said about a woman that had done a perfectly useless thing, which was open to a great many very shrewd objections? But Jesus Christ accepted it. Why? Because it was the pure utterance of a loving heart. And, depend upon it, though we have to say ‘Unclean! unclean! We are unprofitable servants,’ He will say ‘Come! ye blessed of My Father.’ Praise from Christ is praise indeed.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>‘Honour.’ That suggests bystanders, a public opinion, if I may so say; it suggests ‘have thou authority over ten cities,’ and that men will have their deeds round them as a halo, in that other world. As ‘praise’ suggests the redeemed man’s relation to his Lord, so ‘honour’ suggests the redeemed man’s relation to the fellow-citizens of the New Jerusalem. ‘Glory’ speaks of the man himself as transfigured and lifted up into the light and lustre of communion with, and conformity to, the image of the Lord. ‘Then shall we appear with Him in glory. Then shall the righteous blaze forth like the sun in My heavenly Father’s Kingdom.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>‘Shall be found.’ Ah! there will be many surprises yonder. Do you remember that profound revelation of our Master when He represents those on whom He lavishes His eulogies as the Judge, as turning to Him and saying, ‘Lord! when saw we Thee in ... prison and visited thee?’ They do not recognise themselves or their acts in Christ’s account of them. They have found that their lives were diviner than they knew. There will be surprises there. As one of the prophets represents the ransomed Israel, to her amazement, surrounded by clinging troops of children, and asking, ‘These! Where have they been? I was left alone,’ so many a poor, humble soul, fighting along in this world, having no recognition on earth, and the lowliest estimate of all its own actions, will be astonished at the last when it receives ‘praise, and honour, and glory, at the appearing of Jesus Christ.’<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_peter/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:1-9 This epistle is addressed to believers in general, who are strangers in every city or country where they live, and are scattered through the nations. These are to ascribe their salvation to the electing love of the Father, the redemption of the Son, and the sanctification of the Holy Ghost; and so to give glory to one God in three Persons, into whose name they had been baptized. Hope, in the world's phrase, refers only to an uncertain good, for all worldly hopes are tottering, built upon sand, and the worldling's hopes of heaven are blind and groundless conjectures. But the hope of the sons of the living God is a living hope; not only as to its object, but as to its effect also. It enlivens and comforts in all distresses, enables to meet and get over all difficulties. Mercy is the spring of all this; yea, great mercy and manifold mercy. And this well-grounded hope of salvation, is an active and living principle of obedience in the soul of the believer. The matter of a Christian's joy, is the remembrance of the happiness laid up for him. It is incorruptible, it cannot come to nothing, it is an estate that cannot be spent. Also undefiled; this signifies its purity and perfection. And it fadeth not; is not sometimes more or less pleasant, but ever the same, still like itself. All possessions here are stained with defects and failings; still something is wanting: fair houses have sad cares flying about the gilded and ceiled roofs; soft beds and full tables, are often with sick bodies and uneasy stomachs. All possessions are stained with sin, either in getting or in using them. How ready we are to turn the things we possess into occasions and instruments of sin, and to think there is no liberty or delight in their use, without abusing them! Worldly possessions are uncertain and soon pass away, like the flowers and plants of the field. That must be of the greatest worth, which is laid up in the highest and best place, in heaven. Happy are those whose hearts the Holy Spirit sets on this inheritance. God not only gives his people grace, but preserves them unto glory. Every believer has always something wherein he may greatly rejoice; it should show itself in the countenance and conduct. The Lord does not willingly afflict, yet his wise love often appoints sharp trials, to show his people their hearts, and to do them good at the latter end. Gold does not increase by trial in the fire, it becomes less; but faith is made firm, and multiplied, by troubles and afflictions. Gold must perish at last, and can only purchase perishing things, while the trial of faith will be found to praise, and honour, and glory. Let this reconcile us to present afflictions. Seek then to believe Christ's excellence in himself, and his love to us; this will kindle such a fire in the heart as will make it rise up in a sacrifice of love to him. And the glory of God and our own happiness are so united, that if we sincerely seek the one now, we shall attain the other when the soul shall no more be subject to evil. The certainty of this hope is as if believers had already received it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_peter/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>That the trial of your faith - The putting of your religion to the test, and showing what is its real nature.

More important results were to be arrived at by it, and it was more desirable that it should be done.<p>That perisheth - Not that gold perishes by the process of being tried in the fire, for this is not the fact, and the connection does not demand this interpretation. The idea is, that gold, however valuable it is, is a perishable thing. It is not an enduring, imperishable, indestructible thing, like religion. It may not perish in the fire, but it will in some way, for it will not endure forever.<p>Though it be tried with fire - This refers to the gold. See the Greek. The meaning is, that gold, though it will bear the action of fire, is yet a destructible thing, and will not endure forever. It is more desirable to test religion than it is gold, because it is more valuable. It pertains to that which is eternal and indestructible, and it is therefore of more importance to show its true quality, and to free it from every improper mixture.<p>Might be found unto praise - That is, might be found to be genuine, and such as to meet the praise or commendation of the final judge.<p>And honor - That honor might be done to it before assembled worlds.<p>And glory - That it might be rewarded with that glory which will be then conferred on all who have shown, in the various trials of life, that they had true religion.<p>At the appearing of Jesus Christ - To judge the world.

From these two verses <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-6.htm">1 Peter 1:6-7</a> we may learn:<p>I. That it is desirable that the faith of Christians should be tried:<p>(a) It is desirable to know whether that which appears to be religion is genuine, as it is desirable to know whether that which appears to be gold is genuine. To gold we apply the action of intense heat, that we may know whether it is what it appears to be; and as religion is of more value than gold, so it is more desirable that it should be subjected to the proper tests, that its nature may be ascertained. There is much which appears to be gold, which is of no value, as there is much which appears to be religion, which is of no value. The one is worth no more than the other, unless it is genuine.<p>(b) It is desirable in order to show its true value. It is of great importance to know what that which is claimed to be gold is worth for the purposes to which gold is usually applied; and so it is in regard to religion. Religion claims to be of more value to man than anything else. It asserts its power to do that for the intellect and the heart which nothing else can do; to impart consolation in the various trials of life which nothing else can impart; and to give a support which nothing else can on the bed of death. It is very desirable, therefore, that in these various situations it should show its power; that is, that its friends should be in these various conditions, in order that they may illustrate the true value of religion.<p>(c) It is desirable that true religion should be separated from all alloy. There is often much alloy in gold, and it is desirable that it should be separated from it, in order that it may be pure. So it is in religion. It is often combined with much that is unholy and impure; much that dims its lustre and mars its beauty; much that prevents its producing the effect which it would otherwise produce. Gold is, indeed, often better, for some purposes, for having some alloy mixed with it; but not so with religion. It is never better for having a little pride, or vanity, or selfishness, or meanness, or worldliness, or sensuality mingled with it; and that which will remove these things from our religion will be a favor to us.<p>II. God takes various methods of trying his people, with a design to test the value of their piety, and to separate it from all impure mixtures:<p>(1) He tries his people by prosperity - often as decisive a test of piety as can be applied to it. There is much pretended piety, which will bear adversity, but which will not bear prosperity. The piety of a man is decisively tested by popularity; by the flatteries of the world; by a sudden increase of property; and in such circumstances it is often conclusively shown that there is no true religion in the soul.<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_peter/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7.

This is the principal end which God has in afflictive providences, to try the faith of his people; so the faith of Abraham, Job, Habakkuk, and others, have been tried: <p>being much more precious than of gold that perisheth: the grace of faith is much more precious than gold; since that perisheth by using, but faith does not; and since it is so valuable as not to be obtained by it; and since those that have it, though poor in this world, are rich, and heirs of a kingdom: but the trying of it is abundantly more precious than gold; for not only as gold being tried in the fire is purged from its dross, and is proved to be genuine and shines the brighter, so faith, being tried in the fire of afflictions, is purged from unbelief; and the believer is purged from his dross and tin, and his iniquity is purged, and the fruit of all is to take away sin; and he is tried and proved to be a true believer, and his faith shines the more illustriously, as in the above instances; yea, the very trying of it has an influence on other graces, for great usefulness; for the trying of faith works patience, and that, experience, and that, hope: <p>though it be tried with fire: either though gold be tried with fire, and so is greatly refined, yet it is more precious than that; or though faith be tried with the fire of afflictions, yet it is precious, and more precious than gold: and it is tried for this purpose, <p>that it might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ; who is now in the highest heavens, and out of sight, but will appear a second time without sin unto salvation, and every eye shall see him; and when the believer will be found in him, and his faith be found unto praise by him, he will have praise of him himself; it will be said unto him, "Well done, good and faithful servant"; his faith will be praised for its steadiness and constancy, notwithstanding all persecutions and tribulations; and his good works, the fruits of faith, will be taken notice of by him with commendation; he will be honoured, by being placed on the right hand of Christ, and by being set down with him in his throne, and having a crown of righteousness given to him; and he will be glorified both in soul and body; his body will be made like to Christ's glorious body, and his soul will have a glory revealed in it; and in his whole person he shall appear, when Christ does, with him in glory. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_peter/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> appearing of Jesus Christ:</span><p>(e) He speaks of the second coming of Christ.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/1_peter/1.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-7.htm" title="That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perishes, though it be tried with fire, might be found to praise and honor and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ:">1 Peter 1:7</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἵνα</span>] states the aim of the <span class="greekheb">λυπηθῆναι ἐν</span> … <span class="greekheb">πειρασμοῖς</span>, in order to console the readers with respect to it, “<span class="ital">that the approvedness of your faith may be found more precious than (that) of gold, which perisheth, yet it is tried by fire, to (your) praise, and glory, and honour at the revelation of Jesus Christ</span>.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">δοκίμιον</span> here, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-3.htm" title="Knowing this, that the trying of your faith works patience.">Jam 1:3</a> (cf. <span class="ital">in loco</span>), equal to <span class="greekheb">δοκιμή</span>, the approvedness as the result of the trial (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/5-3.htm" title="And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation works patience;...">Romans 5:3-4</a>;

This substitution of ideas is not justifiable, inasmuch as the <span class="ital">process</span> applied to an object cannot be put for the object itself to which it is applied. Only if <span class="greekheb">δοκίμιον</span> denote a <span class="ital">quality</span> of faith, can a substitution of this kind take place. <span class="greekheb">δοκίμιον</span> must be taken as: “<span class="ital">approvedness</span>,” and by approvedness of faith, the “approved,” or rather “the faith approving itself.”[65]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[64] <span class="greekheb">δοκιμή</span> in the N.

But against this it must be observed that <span class="greekheb">δοκίμιον</span> has <span class="ital">only</span> the signification of “means of proof,” not of trial; and (3) That in the above interpretation it is not the already approved faith, but that faith which is being approved, or approving itself in tribulation, which is contrasted with gold which is being tried.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>REMARK.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>What Schott had formerly alleged with respect to <span class="greekheb">δοκίμιον</span> is repeated by Hofmann, only by him it is carried further. By an highly artificial interpretation of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/11-7.htm" title="For the righteous LORD loves righteousness; his countenance does behold the upright.">Psalm 11:7</a>, LXX., and by the application of the rule established by him, “that the neuter of the adjective does not stand in the place of an abstract attributive, but expresses the condition of something as a concrete reality, and in conjunction with a genitive denotes the object thereby named in this its condition,” Hofmann makes out that it is here affirmed that “at the revelation of Christ it will be found that the faith of the readers has been subjected to purification, and is in consequence free from dross.” This whole interpretation is a pure matter of fancy, for <span class="greekheb">δοκίμιον</span>—a circumstance which both Schott and Hofmann have left unnoticed—is <span class="ital">not</span> an adjective, but a real substantive; for <span class="greekheb">δοκιμεῖον</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Cremer explains: “<span class="greekheb">δοκ</span>. is not the touchstone only, in and for itself, but the trace left behind on it by the metal; therefore <span class="greekheb">τὸ δοκ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τῆς πίστεως</span> is that which results from the contact of <span class="greekheb">πίστις</span> with <span class="greekheb">πειρασμοῖς</span>, that by which faith is recognised as genuine, equal to the proof of faith.” But in opposition to this it must be remarked that fire and not touchstone is here conceived as the means of testing.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">πολυτιμότερον κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.] is by most interpreters closely connected with <span class="greekheb">εὑρεθῇ</span>, by others again (Wolf, Pott, Steinmeyer, Wiesinger, Hofmann) separated from it, and considered as in apposition to <span class="greekheb">τὸ δοκίμιον ὑμ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">πιστ</span>. The following facts, however, are decisive against the latter construction: (1) That—as Wiesinger admits—this appositional clause expresses “something understood of itself.” (2) That the intention here is not to make an observation on faith, but to state what is the design of sorrow, namely, that the faith which is approving itself may be found to be one <span class="greekheb">πολύτιμος</span>. (3) That thus <span class="greekheb">εὑρεθῇ</span> would be deprived of any nearer definition, in that the subsequent <span class="greekheb">εἰς</span> has reference not to <span class="greekheb">εὑρεθῇ</span> alone, but to the whole idea expressed. Yet it cannot well dispense with a nearer definition (in opposition to Hofmann).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The genitive <span class="greekheb">χρυσίου</span> is, as almost all the interpreters take it, to be joined in sense directly with the comparative: “<span class="ital">than the gold</span>,” so that the <span class="greekheb">δοκίμιον</span> of the faith is compared with the gold. Some commentators, like Beza, Grotius, Vorstius, Steinmeyer, Hofmann, assume an ellipsis (cf. Winer, p. 230 [E. T. 307]), supplying before <span class="greekheb">χρυσίου</span> the words <span class="greekheb">ἢ τὸ δοκίμιον</span>. In opposition it may be urged, however, not precisely “that this is cumbrous” (Brückner), but that the point of comparison is not properly the approval of faith, but the faith in the act of approving itself. Whilst comparing the faith with the gold, the apostle places the former above the latter; the reason of this he states in the attribute <span class="greekheb">τοῦ ἀπολλυμένου</span> connected with <span class="greekheb">χρυσίου</span>, by which reference is made to the imperishable nature of faith. To this first attribute he subjoins the second: <span class="greekheb">διὰ πυρὸς δὲ δοκιμαζομένου</span>, in order to name here also the medium of proving, to which the <span class="greekheb">πειρασμοί</span>, with respect to faith, correspond. Accordingly Wiesinger and Steinmeyer are wrong in asserting that in the interpretation here given the attribute <span class="greekheb">τοῦ ἀπολλυμένου</span> is inappropriate.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἀπολλύμενος</span>: <span class="greekheb">φθαρτός</span>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-18.htm" title="For as much as you know that you were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers;">1 Peter 1:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-23.htm" title="Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which lives and stays for ever.">1 Peter 1:23</a>; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-27.htm" title="Labor not for the meat which perishes, but for that meat which endures to everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give to you: for him has God the Father sealed.">John 6:27</a>.

T. 174].<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">διὰ πυρὸς δὲ δοκιμαζομένου</span>] The particle <span class="greekheb">δέ</span> seems to place this second adjunct in antithesis to the first (<span class="greekheb">ἀπολλυμένου</span>) (thus de Wette: “which is perishable, and <span class="ital">yet</span> is proved by fire;” so also Hofmann). But opposed to this view is the circumstance that the trial and purification of what is perishable is by no means anything to occasion surprise; it is therefore more correct to find the purpose of the adjunct in this, that by it the idea of the <span class="greekheb">δοκιμάζεσθαι</span> is brought prominently forward. Vorstius remarks to the point: aurum igni committitur non ad iteritum, sed ad gloriam, sic fides cruci ad gloriam subjicitur.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>For this comparison, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/23-10.htm" title="But he knows the way that I take: when he has tried me, I shall come forth as gold.">Job 23:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-3.htm" title="The fining pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold: but the LORD tries the hearts.">Proverbs 17:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/13-9.htm" title="And I will bring the third part through the fire, and will refine them as silver is refined, and will try them as gold is tried: they shall call on my name, and I will hear them: I will say, It is my people: and they shall say, The LORD is my God.">Zechariah 13:9</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">εὑρεθῇ εἰς ἔπαινον καὶ δόξαν καὶ τιμήν</span>] The verb <span class="greekheb">εὑρεθῆναι</span>, “<span class="ital">to be found to be</span>,” is more significant than <span class="greekheb">εἶναι</span> (cf. Winer, p. 572 f. [E. T. 769 f.]), and has reference to the judicial investigation on the last day of judgment. The words following form an adjunct to the whole preceding thought: <span class="greekheb">ἵνα</span> … <span class="greekheb">εὑρεθῇ</span>. Beza rightly: hic agitur de ipsorum electorum laude, etc.; thus: “to <span class="ital">your</span> praise, glory, and honour.” Schott quite arbitrarily interprets <span class="greekheb">ἔπαινος</span> as in itself: “the <span class="ital">judicial</span> recognition” (as opposed to this, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-11.htm" title="Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.">Php 1:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-8.htm" title="Finally, brothers, whatever things are true, whatever things are honest, whatever things are just, whatever things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.">Php 4:8</a>); <span class="greekheb">τιμή</span>: “the moral estimation of the person arising therefrom” (as opposed to this, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-7.htm" title="Likewise, you husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge, giving honor to the wife, as to the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life; that your prayers be not hindered.">1 Peter 3:7</a>), and <span class="greekheb">δόξα</span>: “the form of glory” (as opposed to this, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-5.htm" title="To whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.">Galatians 1:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-11.htm" title="Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.">Php 1:11</a>). Steinmeyer incorrectly applies the words not to the persons, but to their faith. <span class="greekheb">δόξα</span> and <span class="greekheb">τιμή</span> in the N. T. stand frequently together; in connection with <span class="greekheb">ἔπαινος</span>, here only. The juxtaposition of these synonymous expressions serves to give prominence to the <span class="ital">one</span> idea of honourable recognition common to them all. Standing as <span class="greekheb">δίξα</span> does between <span class="greekheb">ἔπαινος</span> and <span class="greekheb">τιμή</span>, it cannot signify: “the allotment of the possession of glory” (Wiesinger), but it is: “glory, praise.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐν ἀποκαλύψει Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ</span>] not: “<span class="ital">through</span>,” but: “<span class="ital">at</span>,” the revelation of Jesus Christ, that is, on the day of His return, which is at once the <span class="greekheb">ἀποκάλυψις δικαιοκρισίας τοῦ Θεοῦ</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-5.htm" title="But after your hardness and impenitent heart treasure up to yourself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God;">Romans 2:5</a>) and the <span class="greekheb">ἀποκάλυψις τῶν υἱῶν τοῦ Θεοῦ</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-19.htm" title="For the earnest expectation of the creature waits for the manifestation of the sons of God.">Romans 8:19</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/1_peter/1.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-7.htm" title="That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perishes, though it be tried with fire, might be found to praise and honor and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ:">1 Peter 1:7</a>. <span class="greekheb">τὸ δοκίμιον</span>. The evidence of the papyri (Deissmann, <span class="ital">Bible Studies</span>, pp. 259 ff.) shows that <span class="greekheb">δοκίμιος</span> is a bye form of the adjective <span class="greekheb">δόκιμος</span> <span class="ital">approved</span>; so <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/12-7.htm" title="You shall keep them, O LORD, you shall preserve them from this generation for ever.">Psalm 12:7</a>, <span class="greekheb">ἀργύριον πεπυρωμένον δοκίμιον</span> (<span class="ital">cf.</span> 1 Chron. 39:4; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/11-3.htm" title="There is a voice of the howling of the shepherds; for their glory is spoiled: a voice of the roaring of young lions; for the pride of Jordan is spoiled.">Zechariah 11:3</a>, where it occurs as v.l. for <span class="greekheb">δόκιμον</span>). Hence the phrase (here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-3.htm" title="Knowing this, that the trying of your faith works patience.">Jam 1:3</a>?) corresponds exactly to St. Paul’s <span class="greekheb">τὸ τῆς ὑμετέρας ἀγάπης γνήσιον</span>—“the genuineness of your faith or “the approvedness”). So Arethas on <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/9-4.htm" title="And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree; but only those men which have not the seal of God in their foreheads.">Revelation 9:4</a>, <span class="greekheb">οἱ δὲ τὸ δοκίμιον ἑαυτῶν διὰ πυρὸς παρεχόμενοι</span>.

St. Peter proceeds to develop his meaning. The word rendered "trial" (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) means rather "test or proof;" it is explained by Dionysius of Halicarnassus ('Rhet.,' I1) as that at which, when one looks, he is able to form a judgment. Cremer says it is "not only the means of proof itself, e.g. the touchstone, but also the trace of the metal left thereon. Hence here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-3.htm">James 1:3</a> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> is the result of the contact of faith with temptations, that in virtue of which faith is recognized as genuine - the verification of faith." Dr. Heft ('Notes on Select Readings') prefers the reading <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, which is given by two of the better cursives.

Being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire; rather, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">more precious than gold</span>. Gold is the most precious of metals, faith is more precious far; the proof of faith is more momentous beyond all comparison than the proof of gold. Gold perishes; "Consumitur annulus usu," says the poet; "Aurum cummundo perit," says Bengel; but "Now abideth faith, hope, charity," says the apostle. Gold is tried with fire; as by the purifying fire gold is purged of dross (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-25.htm">Isaiah 1:25</a>), so by the refining fire of temptations the faithful are cleansed from pride and self-reliance and the pollutions of sin.

Rev., proof. The word means a test. As the means of proof, however, is not only the touchstone itself, but the trace of the metal left upon it, the sense here is the result of the contact of faith with trial, and hence the verification of faith. The expression is equivalent to your approved faith. Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/2-7.htm">Romans 2:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-10.htm">Romans 2:10</a>.<p>Than of gold<p>Omit the of, and read than gold.

The verb is used in classical Greek of assaying or testing metals, and means, generally, to approve or sanction upon test. It is radically akin to &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, to receive, and hence implies a proof with a view to determine whether a thing be worthy to be received. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-13.htm">1 Corinthians 3:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-4.htm">Galatians 6:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-1.htm">1 John 4:1</a>. It thus differs from &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, to try or tempt (see on &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-6.htm">1 Peter 1:6</a>), in that that verb indicates simply a putting to proof to discover what good or evil is in a person; and from the fact that such scrutiny so often develops the existence and energy of evil, the word acquired a predominant sense of putting to the proof with the design or hope of breaking down the subject under the proof - in other words, of temptation in the ordinary sense. Hence Satan is called &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;, the tempter, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-3.htm">Matthew 4:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-5.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:5</a>.
