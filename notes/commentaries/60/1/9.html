The reason is, he says, because we receive already, in the present life, the object of all this trusting without sight; we need not wait till the next world to attain our glorification.<p><span class= "bld">The salvation of your souls.</span>—It might be simply, <span class= "ital">salvation of souls, </span>including other men’s besides our own, but the context is against it, and the absence of articles is characteristic of St. Peter. It seems at first sight not a very exalted object for our faith to work to, the deliverance, or safety, of our own souls. And yet our Lord fully recognises the instinct of the higher self-preservation as that to which the ultimate appeal must be made (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/16-25.htm" title="For whoever will save his life shall lose it: and whoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it.">Matthew 16:25-26</a>). He could give His own soul a ransom for many (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-28.htm" title="Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered to, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.">Matthew 20:28</a>); He could save others and not Himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-42.htm" title="He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him.">Matthew 27:42</a>); St. Paul could wish himself accursed from Christ for his brethren’s sake, “that they might be saved” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-3.htm" title="For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my brothers, my kinsmen according to the flesh:">Romans 9:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-1.htm" title="Brothers, my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is, that they might be saved.">Romans 10:1</a>); Moses could ask to be “blotted out of the book” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-32.htm" title="Yet now, if you will forgive their sin--; and if not, blot me, I pray you, out of your book which you have written.">Exodus 32:32</a>); and yet the fact remains, that in seeking our own welfare, in the highest sense, we are fulfilling a primal law of our being, imposed upon us by the Creator. We are bound to make that our first object, if it were only to gratify Him who has no pleasure in the death of him that dieth, even if we could possibly divest ourselves of all “selfish” interest in the matter.<p>“A charge to keep I have,<p><span class= "ital">A God to glorify</span>;<p>A never-dying soul to save,<p>And fit it for the sky.”<p>The Buddhist longing for Nirvana is as far as possible removed from the healthy spirit of Christianity. “Salvation” here seems to have widened its meaning since <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-5.htm" title="Who are kept by the power of God through faith to salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.">1Peter 1:5</a>; while <span class= "ital">there</span> the main thought was final deliverance from the afflictions of life, <span class= "ital">here</span> the salvation is said to be received in the very midst of all these afflictions. The addition of the word “souls,” appears to make the difference. For the soul, there is <span class= "ital">present</span> salvation, because persecutions, &c., do not touch it, and it is <span class= "ital">capable</span> of the most complete emancipation from the evils of <span class= "ital">sin</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-21.htm" title="And she shall bring forth a son, and you shall call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins.">Matthew 1:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-69.htm" title="And has raised up an horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David;">Luke 1:69</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-71.htm" title="That we should be saved from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us;">Luke 1:71</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-75.htm" title="In holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of our life.">Luke 1:75</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-14.htm" title="For sin shall not have dominion over you: for you are not under the law, but under grace.">Romans 6:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/7-24.htm" title="O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?">Romans 7:24-25</a>.) Salvation, then, is the restoration of man to the ideal excellence from which he was fallen: it contains—here, at any rate—no allusion to “damnation” as an opposite.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_peter/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:1-9 This epistle is addressed to believers in general, who are strangers in every city or country where they live, and are scattered through the nations. These are to ascribe their salvation to the electing love of the Father, the redemption of the Son, and the sanctification of the Holy Ghost; and so to give glory to one God in three Persons, into whose name they had been baptized. Hope, in the world's phrase, refers only to an uncertain good, for all worldly hopes are tottering, built upon sand, and the worldling's hopes of heaven are blind and groundless conjectures. But the hope of the sons of the living God is a living hope; not only as to its object, but as to its effect also. It enlivens and comforts in all distresses, enables to meet and get over all difficulties. Mercy is the spring of all this; yea, great mercy and manifold mercy. And this well-grounded hope of salvation, is an active and living principle of obedience in the soul of the believer. The matter of a Christian's joy, is the remembrance of the happiness laid up for him. It is incorruptible, it cannot come to nothing, it is an estate that cannot be spent. Also undefiled; this signifies its purity and perfection. And it fadeth not; is not sometimes more or less pleasant, but ever the same, still like itself. All possessions here are stained with defects and failings; still something is wanting: fair houses have sad cares flying about the gilded and ceiled roofs; soft beds and full tables, are often with sick bodies and uneasy stomachs. All possessions are stained with sin, either in getting or in using them. How ready we are to turn the things we possess into occasions and instruments of sin, and to think there is no liberty or delight in their use, without abusing them! Worldly possessions are uncertain and soon pass away, like the flowers and plants of the field. That must be of the greatest worth, which is laid up in the highest and best place, in heaven. Happy are those whose hearts the Holy Spirit sets on this inheritance. God not only gives his people grace, but preserves them unto glory. Every believer has always something wherein he may greatly rejoice; it should show itself in the countenance and conduct. The Lord does not willingly afflict, yet his wise love often appoints sharp trials, to show his people their hearts, and to do them good at the latter end. Gold does not increase by trial in the fire, it becomes less; but faith is made firm, and multiplied, by troubles and afflictions. Gold must perish at last, and can only purchase perishing things, while the trial of faith will be found to praise, and honour, and glory. Let this reconcile us to present afflictions. Seek then to believe Christ's excellence in himself, and his love to us; this will kindle such a fire in the heart as will make it rise up in a sacrifice of love to him. And the glory of God and our own happiness are so united, that if we sincerely seek the one now, we shall attain the other when the soul shall no more be subject to evil. The certainty of this hope is as if believers had already received it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_peter/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls - The result or object of your faith; that is, what your faith is designed and adapted to secure.

Receiving&#8212;in sure anticipation; "the end of your faith," that is, its crowning consummation, finally completed "salvation" (Peter here confirms Paul's teaching as to justification by faith): also receiving now the title to it and the first-fruits of it. In 1Pe 1:10 the "salvation" is represented as already present, whereas "the prophets" had it not as yet present. It must, therefore, in this verse, refer to the present: Deliverance now from a state of wrath: believers even now "receive salvation," though its full "revelation" is future.<p>of &#8230; souls&#8212;The immortal soul was what was lost, so "salvation" primarily concerns the soul; the body shall share in redemption hereafter; the soul of the believer is saved already: an additional proof that "receiving &#8230; salvation" is here a thing present.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_peter/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Receiving; </span> either this word is to be taken improperly, and by an enallage, the future being put for the present tense; q.d.

Which is a just and sufficient ground of joy and rejoicing. "Salvation" intends spiritual and eternal salvation; that which God appointed his people to from all eternity, which is obtained by Christ, applied by the Spirit, and will be fully enjoyed in heaven: this is the salvation "of souls": which are of more worth than a world; and the redemption of which is precious, and requires a great price, and for which a great price is paid, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-18.htm">1 Peter 1:18</a>. It is rightly supplied in our version by "your", as in the Syriac, Arabic, and Ethiopic versions; though the Vulgate Latin version only reads, "the salvation of souls"; and which is to be understood, not to the exclusion of bodies, for God has designed the salvation of them; and Christ has procured the redemption of them; and these will be preserved unto the coming of Christ, being united to him; and will be raised by him, and with their souls enjoy everlasting happiness with him; though, in the present state of things, salvation rather takes place in the soul than in the body, which is exposed to various labours, afflictions, and diseases; but the chief design of the phrase is, to distinguish this salvation from a corporeal and temporal one: and so the Jews use the phrase , "the salvation of the soul" (z), in opposition to, and distinction from, a mere bodily one; and it intends a salvation from sin, Satan, the law, and its curses; from hell, the second death, and wrath to come, and every spiritual enemy: which is the end of faith; or, as the Syriac version renders it,  "the reward of faith"; not that faith is the cause of salvation, or meritorious of it; for that itself is the gift of God, and is rather a part of salvation, and, at most, but the means of perceiving an interest in it, and of enjoying the comfort of it; and is what will issue in it, and in the full enjoyment of it; when faith will both have its end and scope, and be at an end, being exchanged for fruition; just as a reward is given at the end of a man's labours: hence it is called  "the end", <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-18.htm">Proverbs 23:18</a> and even now salvation is the end of faith, in like sense as Christ is the end of the law: as the law has its full accomplishment, and all its ends answered in Christ, so faith has its end, and all it looks for, desires, and wants, in salvation by Christ: and which is now "receiving"; for the saints not only shall receive, and enjoy the full possession of it hereafter, but they have it now; it is not only appointed to them, and wrought out for them, but is brought near, set before them, and applied to them, and put into the hands of faith by the Spirit of God; they have it in faith and hope, by which they are already saved; and in Christ their head and representative, in whom they are set down in heavenly places; and besides, they have the beginning, firstfruits, earnest, and pledge of it in their own hearts, as well as a right unto, and a meetness for the perfect possession of it hereafter; all which is matter of joy unspeakable, and full of glory, <p>(z) Tzeror Hammor, fol. 168. 4. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_peter/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/1_peter/1.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-9.htm" title="Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls.">1 Peter 1:9</a>. <span class="greekheb">κομιζόμενοι τὸ τέλος κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.] gives the reason of that joy; the participle links itself simply on to <span class="greekheb">ἀγαλλιᾶσθε</span>, “<span class="ital">inasmuch as ye obtain</span>,” etc., and supplies confirmation that what is here spoken of is not present, but future joy.

The connexion with mention of persecution suggests that the writer is here thinking of the saying, <span class="ital">in your patience ye shall win your souls</span> and perhaps also of the contrast between the persecuton who has only power over the body. Whatever happen to the body the conclusion—the consummation of their faith—is assured them.—<span class="greekheb">κομιζόμενοι</span> implies that already they are receiving what is due to them (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-4.htm" title="And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, you shall receive a crown of glory that fades not away.">1 Peter 5:4</a>) and therefore they rejoice with Hannah in God the Saviour.

St. Paul applies it to future recompense (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-10.htm" title="For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he has done, whether it be good or bad.">2 Corinthians 5:10</a>, <span class="greekheb">ἵνα κομίσηται ἕκαστος τὰ διὰ τοῦ σώματος</span>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-8.htm" title="Knowing that whatever good thing any man does, the same shall he receive of the Lord, whether he be bond or free.">Ephesians 6:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-25.htm" title=" But he that does wrong shall receive for the wrong which he has done: and there is no respect of persons.">Colossians 3:25</a>; <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="http://apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/8-33.htm" title="Furthermore at such time as they kept the feast for the victory in their country they burnt Callisthenes, that had set fire upon the holy gates, who had fled into a little house; and so he received a reward meet for his wickedness.">2Ma 8:33</a>, <span class="greekheb">τὸν ἄξιον τῆς δυσσεβείας ἐκομίσατο μισθόν</span>); in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-4.htm" title="For every house is built by some man; but he that built all things is God.">Hebrews 3:4</a>, it is used of receiving promises.—<span class="greekheb">τὸ τέλος</span>. The common meaning <span class="ital">fulfilment</span> or <span class="ital">consummation</span> gives a fair sense but the connection with <span class="greekheb">κομιζόμενοι</span> is thus somewhat strange. The parallel of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-4.htm" title="To an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fades not away, reserved in heaven for you,">1 Peter 1:4</a>, taken with Pindar, Ol. x(xi.) 81, <span class="greekheb">Δόρυκλος δʼ ἔφερε πυγμᾶς τέλος</span>, suggests as a possible rendering <span class="ital">because ye receive the reward</span>. The Septuagint, again (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/31-28.htm" title="And levy a tribute to the Lord of the men of war which went out to battle: one soul of five hundred, both of the persons, and of the beeves, and of the asses, and of the sheep:">Numbers 31:28</a>, etc.), uses <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. to translate <span class="greekheb">מבס</span> = <span class="ital">proportion to be paid, tax</span>. And this use is well established in Greek literature for <span class="greekheb">τὰ τέλη</span>, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <span class="greekheb">λυσιτελεῖν</span>, etc. Accordingly Suidas defines <span class="greekheb">τέλος</span> as <span class="greekheb">τὸ διδόμενον τοῖς βασιλεῦσι</span>. The particular connotations can hardly be pressed here but these uses give some colour of support to the Syriac rendering <span class="ital">recompense</span> and the <span class="ital">mercedem</span> of Augustine; <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-22.htm" title="But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, you have your fruit to holiness, and the end everlasting life.">Romans 6:22</a>.—<span class="greekheb">σωτηρίαν ψυχῶν</span> ͂ = <span class="greekheb">σωτηρίαν</span> above. <span class="greekheb">ψυχῶν</span> is added to console the readers for their sufferings in accordance with <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/8-35.htm" title="For whoever will save his life shall lose it; but whoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel's, the same shall save it.">Mark 8:35</a>, <span class="greekheb">ὃς δʼ ἂν ἀπολέσει τὴν ψυχὴν αὐτοῦ ἕνεκεν τοῦ εὐαγγελίου σώσει αὐτήν</span> = <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-25.htm" title="He that loves his life shall lose it; and he that hates his life in this world shall keep it to life eternal.">John 12:25</a>; <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/21-19.htm" title="In your patience possess you your souls.">Luke 21:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-21.htm" title="Why lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls.">Jam 1:21</a>.

It has been urged on the one hand that the word for “receiving” applied in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-10.htm" title="For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he has done, whether it be good or bad.">2 Corinthians 5:10</a>, and perhaps in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-36.htm" title="For you have need of patience, that, after you have done the will of God, you might receive the promise.">Hebrews 10:36</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-8.htm" title="Knowing that whatever good thing any man does, the same shall he receive of the Lord, whether he be bond or free.">Ephesians 6:8</a>, to the ultimate issue of God’s judgment, excludes the former. On the other hand, it may be replied that it is arbitrary to limit the last two passages to the final judgment, and that the tense both of “rejoice” and “receiving” is definitely present. On the whole therefore there is no adequate reason against taking the words in their natural and obvious meaning. Those to whom the Apostle wrote were thought of as already receiving, very really, though not, it might be, in its ultimate fulness, that which was the “end” or “goal” of their faith, and that goal was found in the “salvation” of their “souls”—the deliverance of their moral being (in this instance the word includes “spirit,” though elsewhere it is distinguished from it) from the burden of guilt, the sense of condemnation, the misery and discord of alienation from God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/1_peter/1.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-9.htm" title="Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls.">1 Peter 1:9</a>. <span class="greekheb">Κομιζόμενοι</span>, <span class="ital">receiving</span>) now, at present.—<span class="greekheb">τῆς πίστεως</span>, <span class="ital">of faith</span>) <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-8.htm" title="Whom having not seen, you love; in whom, though now you see him not, yet believing, you rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory:">1 Peter 1:8</a>.—<span class="greekheb">ψυχῶν</span>, <span class="ital">of your souls</span>) It is <span class="ital">the soul</span> especially which is saved: the body shares in the resurrection.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls.

Salvation is present as well as future. "By grace ye are saved through faith" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8</a>); "According to his mercy he saved us" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-5.htm">Titus 3:5</a>). God's elect receive it in various measures now; in its blessed fullness it will be manifested hereafter. It is the end which faith ever holds in view, pressing towards it as the prize of the high calling. It is the salvation especially of souls; for, as Bengel says," Anima praecipue salvatur; corpus in resurreetione participat." <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/1_peter/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Receiving (&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;)<p>The verb originally means to take care of or provide for; thence to receive hospitably or entertain; to bring home with a view to entertaining or taking care of. Hence, to carry away so as to preserve, to save, rescue, and so to carry away as a prize or booty. Generally, to receive or acquire. Paul uses it of receiving the awards of judgment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-10.htm">2 Corinthians 5:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-8.htm">Ephesians 6:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-25.htm">Colossians 3:25</a>). In Hebrews it is used of receiving the promise (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-36.htm">Hebrews 10:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-39.htm">Hebrews 11:39</a>), and of Abraham receiving back Isaac (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-19.htm">Hebrews 11:19</a>). Peter uses it thrice, and in each case of receiving the rewards of righteousness or of iniquity.
