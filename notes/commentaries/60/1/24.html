And he said, What shall I cry? All flesh is grass, and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field:">Isaiah 40:6-8</a>, and varies between the Hebrew and the LXX. in the kind of way which shows that the writer was familiar with both. But the passage is by no means quoted only to support the assertion, in itself ordinary enough, that the Word of the Lord abideth for ever. It is always impossible to grasp the meaning of an Old Testament quotation in the mouth of a Hebrew without taking into account the context of the original. Nothing is commoner than to omit purposely the very words which contain the whole point of the quotation. Now these sentences in Isaiah stand in the forefront of the herald’s proclamation of the return of God to Sion, always interpreted of the establishment of the Messianic kingdom. This proclamation of the Messianic kingdom comprises words which St. Peter has purposely omitted, and they contain the point of the quotation. The omitted words are, “the Spirit of the Lord bloweth upon it: surely <span class= "ital">the people”</span>—<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>Israel—“is grass.” Immediately before our quotation went the words, “the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and <span class= "ital">all flesh</span> shall see it together;” statements which so shocked the LXX. translator that he entirely omitted <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-7.htm" title="That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perishes, though it be tried with fire, might be found to praise and honor and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ:">1Peter 1:7</a>, and changed the previous verse so as to make <span class= "ital">some</span> difference between Jew and Gentile (as Godet points out on <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-6.htm" title="And all flesh shall see the salvation of God.">Luke 3:6</a>), into “the glory of the Lord shall be revealed.” <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>to Israel, “and all flesh shall see <span class= "ital">the salvation</span> of God.” The comment of Bishop Lowth on the original passage will well bring out what St. Peter means here: “What is the import of [the proclamation]? that the people, the flesh, is of a vain temporary nature; that all its glory fadeth, and is soon gone; but that the Word of God endureth for ever. What is this but a plain opposition of the flesh to the Spirit; of the carnal Israel to the spiritual; of the temporary Mosaic economy to the eternal Christian dispensation?” Here, then, St. Peter is quoting one of the greatest of Messianic prophecies; and his Hebrew readers would at once understand the Hebrew method of the quotation, and see that he was calling attention to the absolute equality of Jew and Gentile there proclaimed. Generation of the corruptible seed, physical descent from Abraham, was “the glory of the flesh” (observe that according to the best text St. Peter does <span class= "ital">not</span> follow the LXX., and insert “of man,” but follows the Hebrew, and says “all the glory thereof,” <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>of the flesh). On this “the <span class= "ital">Spirit</span> of the Lord” had breathed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-30.htm" title="You send forth your spirit, they are created: and you renew the face of the earth.">Psalm 104:30</a>); and the merely fleshly glory had withered like grass. But “the word of our God,” which, mark well, St. Peter purposely changes into “the Word of the Lord,” <span class= "ital">i.e., of Jesus Christ, </span>incidentally showing his Hebrew readers that he believed Jesus Christ to <span class= "ital">be </span>“our God”—this “abideth for ever.” The engendering by <span class= "ital">this</span> is imperishable, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>involves a privilege which is not, like that of the Jewish blood, transitory: it will never become a matter of indifference whether we have been engendered with this, as is the case now (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-15.htm" title="For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision avails any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.">Galatians 6:15</a>) with regard to the “corruptible seed;” no further revelation will ever level up the unregenerate to be the equals of the regenerate. And in this regeneration “all flesh” share alike. The teaching of the Baptist, who fulfilled this prophecy, is here again apparent. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-9.htm" title="And think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say to you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children to Abraham.">Matthew 3:9</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_peter/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_peter/1-24.htm" title="For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass.

All flesh is grass, and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field:...">Isaiah 40:6-8</a>; “where the preaching of the gospel is foretold and recommended, from the consideration that every thing which is merely human, and among the rest the noblest races of mankind, with all their glory and grandeur, their honour, riches, beauty, strength, and eloquence; as also the arts which men have invented, and the works they have executed, all decay as the flowers of the field.

If believers do evil, God will visit them with corrections. Then, let Christians not doubt God's faithfulness to his promises, nor give way to enslaving dread of his wrath, but let them reverence his holiness. The fearless professor is defenceless, and Satan takes him captive at his will; the desponding professor has no heart to avail himself of his advantages, and is easily brought to surrender. The price paid for man's redemption was the precious blood of Christ. Not only openly wicked, but unprofitable conversation is highly dangerous, though it may plead custom. It is folly to resolve, I will live and die in such a way, because my forefathers did so. God had purposes of special favour toward his people, long before he made manifest such grace unto them. But the clearness of light, the supports of faith, the power of ordinances, are all much greater since Christ came upon earth, than they were before. The comfort is, that being by faith made one with Christ, his present glory is an assurance that where he is we shall be also, Joh 14:3. The soul must be purified, before it can give up its own desires and indulgences. And the word of God planted in the heart by the Holy Ghost, is a means of spiritual life, stirring up to our duty, working a total change in the dispositions and affections of the soul, till it brings to eternal life. In contrast with the excellence of the renewed spiritual man, as born again, observe the vanity of the natural man. In his life, and in his fall, he is like grass, the flower of grass, which soon withers and dies away. We should hear, and thus receive and love, the holy, living word, and rather hazard all than lose it; and we must banish all other things from the place due to it. We should lodge it in our hearts as our only treasures here, and the certain pledge of the treasure of glory laid up for believers in heaven.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_peter/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For all flesh is as grass - That is, all human beings, all men. The connection here is this: The apostle, in the previous verse, had been contrasting that which is begotten by man with that which is begotten by God, in reference to its permanency. The forher was corruptible and decaying; the latter abiding. The latter was produced by God, who lives forever; the former by the agency of man, who is himself corruptible and dying. It was not unnatural, then, to dwell upon the feeble, frail, decaying nature of man, in contrast with God; and the apostle, therefore, says that "all flesh, every human being, is like grass. There is no stability in anything that man does or produces. He himself resembles grass that soon fades and withers; but God and his word endure forever the same." The comparison of a human being with grass, or with flowers, is very beautiful, and is quite common in the Scriptures. The comparison turns on the fact, that the grass or the flower, however green or beautiful it may be, soon loses its freshness; is withered; is cut down, and dies. Thus, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/103-15.htm">Psalm 103:15-16</a>;<p>"As for man, his days are as grass;<p>As a flower of the field, so he flourisheth;<p>For the wind passeth over it and it is gone,<p>And the place thereof shall know it no more."<p>So in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-6.htm">Isaiah 40:6-8</a>; a passage which is evidently referred to by Peter in this place:<p>"The voice said, Cry.<p>And he said, What shall Icry?<p>All flesh is grass,<p>And all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field.<p>The grass withereth,<p>The flower fadeth,<p>When the wind of Jehovah bloweth upon it:<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_peter/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>24.

And he said, What shall I cry? All flesh is grass, and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field:...">Isaiah 40:6-8</a>) with which the Apostle must have been familiar in connexion with the ministry of the Baptist, and (2) as presenting another coincidence with the thoughts and language of the Epistle of St James (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/james/1-10.htm" title="But the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away....">James 1:10-11</a>), itself, in all probability, an echo of that prophecy. The passage is quoted almost verbally from the LXX. translation, the words “of man” taking the place of the “thereof” of the Hebrew. In “the word (<span class="ital">rhêma</span>) of the Lord” we have a different term from the <span class="ital">Logos</span> of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-23.htm" title="Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which lives and stays for ever.">1 Peter 1:23</a>. It has, perhaps, a slightly more concrete significance and may thus be thought of as pointing more specifically to the spoken message of the Gospel. It is doubtful, however, looking to the use of the word in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-3.htm" title="Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high:">Hebrews 1:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-5.htm" title="And have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come,">Hebrews 6:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-3.htm" title="Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.">Hebrews 11:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-17.htm" title="And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:">Ephesians 6:17</a>, whether any such distinction was intended, and it is more probable that St Peter thought of the two terms as equivalents, using the word <span class="ital">rhêma</span> here, because he found it in the LXX.

In like manner presently, the reading <span class="greekheb">αὐτῆς</span> is preferred to the reading <span class="greekheb">ἀνθρώπου</span>, which was held in more esteem by the larger Ed., in the margin of Ed. 2, and in the Germ.

St. Peter quotes <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-6.htm">Isaiah 40:6-8</a>, in illustration of his assertion that the Word of God abideth forever. The quotation is from the Septuagint. St. Peter follows that version in omitting part of ver. 7; but he slightly varies the words, writing (according to the most ancient manuscripts), "all the glory thereof," instead of "all the glory of man;" and in the next verse, "the Word of the <span class="accented">Lord</span>," instead of "the Word of our God." The first variation shows an acquaintance with the original Hebrew. St. James refers to the same passage from Isaiah in <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-10.htm">James 1:10, 11</a>. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/1_peter/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Of man<p>Following the reading &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;, in the Septuagint, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/50-6.htm">Isaiah 50:6</a>, which Peter quotes here.
