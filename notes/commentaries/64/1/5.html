Soul prosperity is the greatest blessing on this side heaven. Grace and health are rich companions. Grace will employ health. A rich soul may be lodged in a weak body; and grace must then be exercised in submitting to such a dispensation. But we may wish and pray that those who have prosperous souls, may have healthful bodies; that their grace may shine where there is still more room for activity. How many professors there are, about whom the apostle's words must be reversed, and we must earnestly wish and pray that their souls might prosper, as their health and circumstances do! True faith will work by love. A good report is due from those who receive good; they could not but testify to the church, what they found and felt. Good men will rejoice in the soul prosperity of others; and they are glad to hear of the grace and goodness of others. And as it is a joy to good parents, it will be a joy to good ministers, to see their people adorn their profession. Gaius overlooked petty differences among serious Christians, and freely helped all who bore the image, and did the work of Christ. He was upright in what he did, as a faithful servant. Faithful souls can hear their own praises without being puffed up; the commendation of what is good in them, lays them at the foot of the cross of Christ. Christians should consider not only what they must do, but what they may do; and should do even the common actions of life, and of good-will, after a godly sort, serving God therein, and designing his glory. Those who freely make known Christ's gospel, should be helped by others to whom God gives the means. Those who cannot themselves proclaim it, may yet receive, help, and countenance those who do so.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/3_john/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Beloved, thou doest faithfully - In the previous verses the writer had commended Gaius for his attachment to truth, and his general correctness in his Christian life.

By <span class="greekheb">καὶ τοῦτο</span> it is brought out that the <span class="greekheb">ἀδελφοί</span> to whom Caius is showing his love are <span class="greekheb">ξένοι</span>; even with the reading <span class="greekheb">καὶ εἰς τοὺς ξένους</span> the thought remains the same: <span class="greekheb">καί</span>, namely, is epexegetically used = “and that too;” as the <span class="greekheb">ξένοι</span> were Christians, they cannot be distinguished from the <span class="greekheb">ἀδελφοί</span>; Lücke takes <span class="greekheb">καί</span> in a specializing sense: “and particularly or especially;” but it is not brotherly love in general, but just the <span class="greekheb">φιλοξενία</span>, that is the subject here.

This has not been properly noticed by the commentators. The explanation of Düsterdieck: “The aorist form is to be explained by the fact that the good deed will consist in this, that Caius will have worthily brought the brethren forward,” does not solve the difficulty, as the good deed consists in the bringing them forward itself. The apostle may have used the aorist, however, in the feeling that “the action of Caius is only completed when he has accomplished the equipment and escort of the brethren” (Braune). The same connection is found in Eurip. <span class="ital">Orest.</span> 1210 ff.: <span class="greekheb">εὐτυχήσομεν</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἑλόντες</span>, which Matthiae (<span class="ital">Ausf.

The good report, which caused the Apostle such joy, testified in particular to the Christian hospitality of Gaius.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">thou doest faithfully</span>] So the Vulgate; <span class="ital">fideliter facis</span>: Wiclif, Tyndale, and other English Versions take the same view. So also Luther: <span class="ital">du thust treulich</span>. The Greek is literally, <span class="ital">thou doest</span> <span class="bld">a faithful (thing)</span>, <span class="ital">whatsoever thou</span> <span class="bld">workest</span> (same verb as is rendered ‘wrought’ in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_john/1-8.htm" title="Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have worked, but that we receive a full reward.">2 John 1:8</a>) <span class="ital">unto the brethren</span>: which is intolerably clumsy as a piece of English. R.V. makes a compromise; <span class="ital">thou doest a faithful work in whatsoever thou doest</span>; which is closer to the Greek than A.V., but not exact. ‘To do a faithful act’ (<span class="greekheb">πιστὸν ποιεῖν</span>) <span class="ital">possibly</span> means to do what is worthy of a faithful man or of a believer, <span class="ital">ostendens ex operibus fidem</span> (Bede); and ‘to do faithfully’ expresses this fairly well: <span class="ital">thou doest faithfully</span> <span class="bld">in all</span> <span class="ital">thou</span> <span class="bld">workest towards</span> <span class="ital">the brethren</span>.

Here we have three difficulties: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> to determine the meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> to bring out the meaning of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;</span>; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> to translate <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> without awkwardness. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The reading <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span> (K, L) for <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, B, C, and versions) has probably arisen from a wish to avoid this last difficulty. Thou doest a faithful act in all that thou workest towards the brethren, and that towards strangers, is a fairly literal and intelligible rendering. But "to do a faithful act" is somewhat obscure. Probably it means "to act as a faithful man would." All his conduct towards the brethren, even when they were not previously known to him, was such as became a faithful Christian. This was his special merit; he treated brethren who were entire strangers to him, not as strangers, but as brethren. He did not pick and choose, showing hospitality to those whom he liked and neglecting the rest. Every missionary was sure of a welcome from Gains. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/3_john/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Thou doest faithfully (&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2;)<p>Rev., thou doest a faithful work. A third interpretation is thou givest a pledge or guaranty, and a fourth, akin to this, thou makest sure. The Rev. is best. There is no parallel to justify the third and fourth.<p>Thou doest (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#837;)<p>Or lit., according to the eymology, workest (&#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; work). See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-9.htm">James 2:9</a>. The distinction between this verb and others signifying to do, such as &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;, &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, &#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3bd;, which last does not occur in the New Testament, is not sharply maintained in Attic Greek. In certain connections the difference between them is great, in others, it is hardly perceptible. On &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd; and &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;.&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-21.htm">John 3:21</a>. &#x395;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, like &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, contemplates the process rather than the end of action, carrying the ideas of continuity and repetition. It means to labor, to be active, to perform, with the idea of continued exertion, and therefore is used of servants, or of those who have an assigned business or office.
