But the better a man’s health, the more thoroughly he can do the work of God. Sickness may be allowed to chasten the erring or rebellious heart, but a Christian whose faith is firm and character established, can ill afford to despise the inestimable blessing of a sound body. Functional and organic disorder or enervation proportionately lessen the capacity for thought, resolution, and activity.<p><span class= "bld">Even as thy soul prospereth.</span>—The word “prospereth” is literally <span class= "ital">makes good way, </span>and so links on to the idea of walking, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/3_john/1-3.htm" title="For I rejoiced greatly, when the brothers came and testified of the truth that is in you, even as you walk in the truth.">3John 1:3-4</a>.

The comparative is double—a comparative formed on a comparative; it may be only irregular, an evidence that the writer was not a classical Greek scholar, or it may be for intensity. There is a similar comparative in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-8.htm" title="To me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ;">Ephesians 3:8</a>, where the force is evidently intensive.<p><span class= "bld">My children</span> means the members of the churches specially under the care of St. John.<p>(5) <span class= "bld">Thou doest faithfully</span>—<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, worthily of a faithful man, consistently with the Christian character. It may be translated, “Thou doest a faithful work in whatsoever. . . .”<p><span class= "bld">Whatsoever thou doest.</span>—Done from right motives, as unto Christ. Whatever form (it is hinted that the form would be various) the activity of Caius might take, so high was the Apostle’s opinion of his character, that he was sure it would be done wisely and well.<p><span class= "bld">And to strangers.</span>—According to another reading it is, “And that, strangers,” as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-6.htm" title="But brother goes to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers.">1Corinthians 6:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-8.htm" title="For by grace are you saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:">Ephesians 2:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-28.htm" title="And in nothing terrified by your adversaries: which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that of God.">Philippians 1:28</a>. Either way, the strangers would be Christians; but, according to the reading in the text, the brethren would be more or less acquaintances of their host. The duty of entertaining Christians on their travels was of peculiar importance in early times, (1) from the length of time which travelling required, (2) from the poverty of the Christians, (3) from the kind of society they would meet at public inns. The duty is enforced in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-13.htm" title="Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality.">Romans 12:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-2.htm" title="A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of good behavior, given to hospitality, apt to teach;">1Timothy 3:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-8.htm" title="But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, holy, temperate;">Titus 1:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-2.htm" title="Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares.">Hebrews 13:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-9.htm" title="Use hospitality one to another without grudging.">1Peter 4:9</a>.<p>(6) Charity might be translated “love.”<p><span class= "bld">Before the church.</span>—That where the Apostle then was, and from which they had probably been sent forth as missionaries, or, at any rate, with some definite religious object.<p><span class= "bld">Whom if thou bring forward.</span>—Perhaps while they were still staying with Caius, the emissaries sent back a report to the church whence they came. St. John seems to imply that there was still something which Caius could do for them. “If thou bring forward” is in the Greek in the past; “when thou hast sent them on, it will be a good work.”<p><span class= "bld">After a godly sort.</span>—Rather, <span class= "ital">worthily of God.</span> (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-13.htm" title="Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently, that nothing be wanting to them.">Titus 3:13</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-11.htm" title="Let no man therefore despise him: but conduct him forth in peace, that he may come to me: for I look for him with the brothers.">1Corinthians 16:11</a>.) It would imply journey money, provisions, love, care, encouragement, prayer, a humble and reasonable imitation of God’s providence to Caius, proportional to his means, the occasion, and the recipients.<p>(7) <span class= "bld">Because that for his name’s sake they went forth.</span>—Their object was the highest possible—the glory of God’s name. Hence there must have been some kind of missionary character in their journey.

From settled churches, or wealthy Christians of long standing, there would be nothing inimical to the interests of the message in receiving material support.

The principle of co-operation was one of the earliest and leading ideas of the kingdom of Christ. Those who try to work alone lose the mighty force of sympathy, are sure to make mistakes, cannot help arousing opposition, and run the risk of nursing in their own souls an unsuspected spirit of self-will, self-confidence, and spiritual pride. Those who do not care to help the good works of others are at best cold Christians, feeble believers; they fail in the great critical testing virtue of Christian love; they limit the operation of God, who has chosen to work by human means; they hinder the spread of the gospel, and delay the second coming of Christ.

The Church was that of the place where Caius and Diotrephes lived. Nothing whatever can be said of Diotrephes, except that his personal ambition led him into the grievous sin of rejecting the authority of the bosom friend of the Saviour; that he talked malignantly against St. John and his friends; that he refused to entertain the emissaries of the Church in which St. John was residing; and that he actually went so far as to eject from the local congregation those who were willing to entertain them. We may conjecture that, on account of the loyalty of Caius to St. John, there was so little intercourse between him and Diotrephes, that he would not even hear that St. John had written; that the greater part of the people of the place adhered for the present to Diotrephes, so that in addressing Caius St. John calls them “the church,” and “them;” and, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/3_john/1-11.htm" title="Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is good.

(11) <span class= "bld">Follow not that which is evil.</span>—One of those simple exhortations so characteristic of St. John, which derive an intense meaning from the circumstances and the context. There was probably every reason why Caius should follow Diotrephes: peace, good-fellowship, the dislike of singularity, popular example, and the indolent indifference which ordinary men feel for truth and right. But the difference between right and wrong is eternal and irreconcilable. The conduct of Diotrephes was of the devil; and mighty moral consequences might follow if Caius gave way from good-natured pliability.

It is the outpouring of the Christian love of the old Apostle to a brother about whom we know nothing else except that John, the beloved, loved him in the truth. And this prayer-for it is a prayer rather than a mere wish, since a good man like John turned all his wishes into prayers-this prayer in the original is even more emphatic and beautiful than in our version. ‘Beloved, I pray that in all things thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth,’ says the Revised Version, and that slight change in the position of one clause is at once felt to be an improvement. We can scarcely suppose an Apostle praying for anybody ‘above all things’ that he might get on in the world. But the wish that Gaius may prosper outwardly in all things, as his soul prospers, is eminently worthy of John. He sets these two types of prosperity over against one another, and says, ‘My wish for you is that you may be as prosperous and robust in spiritual matters as you are in bodily, and material things’.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. Now note-in the; first place, What makes a prosperous soul? </span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>That question might be answered in a great variety of ways, but I purpose for the present to answer it by confining myself to this letter, and seeing what we can find out about the man to whom it was addressed. ‘I rejoiced greatly when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee.’ There is the starting-point of true health of soul. That soul, and only that soul, is prosperous, in which what the Apostle calls here ‘ the truth’ is lodged and rooted; and by ‘ the truth’ he means, of course, the whole great revelation of God in Jesus Christ; and eminently Jesus Christ Himself who is the embodied Truth. Whether we take the phrase as meaning the abiding of Jesus Christ in the heart, or whether we take it as meaning more simply the incorporation into the very substance of the being, of the motives and principles that lie in the Gospel, comes to pretty much the same thing. The one thing which makes a man’s soul healthy is to get Jesus Christ into it. That acts like an amulet that banishes all diseases and corruptions. That is like the preserving salt which, rubbed into a perishable substance, arrests corruption and makes food sweet and savory. It is the engrafted word that is able to save the soul, and howsoever many other things may contribute to the inner well-being and prosperity of a man, such as intellectual acquirements, refined tastes, the gratification of pure affections, the fulfilment of innocent and legitimate hopes, and the like, the one thing that makes the soul prosperous is to have Christ in His word deeply planted and inseparably enshrined in its personality and being.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And how is that enshrining to be brought about? Alas, we all know the way a great deal better than we practice it. The prosperous soul is the soul that has opened itself in docile obedience for the entrance of the quickening and cleansing word. And just as a flower will open its calyx in the sunshine, and being opened by the sunshine playing upon its elastic filaments, will, because it is opened, receive into itself the sun that opened it and so grow; in like manner, that heart that disparts itself at the touch of Christ’s hand, and welcomes Him into the inner chambers and shrine of its being, will find that where He comes He brings warmth and fragrance and growth and all blessing. The prosperous soul is the Christ-inhabited soul. By willing reception, by patient waiting, by the study of God’s word, by the endeavour to bring ourselves more and more under the influence of the truth as it is in Jesus, does that truth that makes prosperity take up its abode within us.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But the letter gives another of the characteristics of the truly prosperous and healthy soul. ‘Thy brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee, even as thou walkest in the truth.’ The Apostle is not afraid of a confusion of metaphors which shocks sticklers for rhetorical propriety. The truth is, first of all, regarded as being in the man; and then it is regarded as being a road on which, and within the limits of which he walks, or an atmosphere in which he moves. The incongruity is no real incongruity, but it strikingly brings out the great and blessed fact of the Gospel that the man who has the grace of God, the truth as it is in Jesus, within him, thereby finds that there is prepared for him a path within the limits of that truth in which he can safely walk. There will be progress if there be prosperity. The prosperous spirit is the active and advancing spirit, not content merely with sitting and saying, ‘I have the truth in my soul. Thy word have I hid in my heart that I sin not against Thee’; but recognizing that that truth is the law of his life, and prescribes for him a course of conduct. The prosperous soul is the soul that confines its activity within the fence which ‘the truth as it is in Jesus,’ who is the pattern, and the motive, and the law, and the power, has laid down for us; and within those limits makes daily and hourly advance to a more entire conformity with the example of the Lord. The prosperous soul is the soul that walks-not that sits idle-for action is the end of thought, and the purpose of the truth is to make men good, and not merely wise-a soul that acts and advances, yet never passing out of the atmosphere of the Gospel, nor going beyond the principles and motives that are laid down there.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>There is a third characteristic in this letter, which we may also take for an illustration of the Apostle’s idea. For he says: ‘Thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Now ‘faithfully’ is not here used in the sense of righteously discharging all obligations and fulfilling one’s stewardship, but it means something deeper than that. The root idea is ‘whatever thou doest thou doest as a work of Christian faith’; or, to put it into other words, the prosperous soul is the soul all whose activity is based upon that one great truth made its own by faith, that Jesus Christ loves it, and so is all the result of trust in Him. Faith in Christ is the mother-tincture, out of which every virtue can be compounded, according to the liquid to which you add it. The basis of all, the ‘stock’ from which all the rest is really made, is the act of faith in Jesus Christ. And so the prosperous soul is the soul that has the truth in it, and walks in the truth which it has, and does everything because it trusts in the living God and in Jesus Christ His Son.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Is that your notion of the ideal of human nature, of the true and noble prosperity of an immortal spirit? Unless it be you have yet to learn the loftiest elevation and the fairest beauty that are possible for men. The prosperous soul filled with Christ within, and walking with Christ by its side, and drawing laws and motives, pattern and power from Him, is the soul that truly has fulfilled its ideal, and is journeying on the right road. For that is the literal meaning of the word that is rendered here ‘prosper’; journeying on the right road to the true goal of human nature.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. Look at the wished-for correspondence between this soul-prosperity and outward prosperity. ‘Beloved,’ says John, ‘I wish above all things,’ or rather, ‘I wish that in regard to all things, thou mayest prosper and be in health as thy soul prospereth.’</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>How would you like that standard applied to your worldly prosperity? Would you like not to get on any better in business than you do in religion? Would you be content that your limbs should be no more healthy than your soul, or that you should be making no more advances in worldly happiness and material prosperity than you are in the Divine life? Would you be content to have your worldly prosperity doled out to you out of the same spoon, of the same dimensions, with which you are content to receive your spiritual prosperity? ‘As thy soul prospereth’-that would mean a very Lenten diet for a good many of us, and a very near approach to insolvency for some commercial men. Brethren, there is a sharp test in these words. I suppose this good Gaius to whom the letter was written was very likely in humble circumstances, and not improbably in enfeebled health. And John was probably wishing for him more than he had, when he wished him to get on as well in the world as he did in his spiritual life, and desired that his soul might prosper as much as his body. It would be a bad thing for some of us if the same standard of proportion were applied to us.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Another consideration is suggested by this correspondence, and that is that it is always a disastrous thing for Christian people when outward prosperity gets ahead of inward. It is the ruin of a good many so-called Christian people. When a man gets on in the world he begins, too often, to decline in the truth. It is difficult for us to carry a full cup without spilling it. And the worst thing that could happen to many Christian people would be what they fret, and fume, and work themselves into a fever, and live careful days and sleepless nights in order to secure-and that is, outward prosperity. The best thing is that the soul should be more prosperous than the body, and the worst adversity is the outward prosperity that ruins or harms the inward life.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">III. So, lastly, note the superiority of the inward prosperity. </span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>There is no overstrained spiritualism here. John has set us an example that we need not be afraid to follow. If he that leaned upon Christ’s bosom, and had drunk in more of the spirit of his Master than any of the Twelve, was not afraid to pray for this good brother that he might have worldly good and health, we need not doubt that for ourselves, and for those that are dear to us, it is perfectly legitimate and right that we should desire and pray for both things. There is no unnatural, artificial, hypocritical pretence of despising the present and the outward in the words here. Although the Apostle does put the two things side by side, he does not fall into the error of casting contempt upon either. He is a true disciple of the Master who said, ‘ Your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things.’ And if your Father knows that you have need, then you may be quite sure that you will get them, and it is a lie to pretend that you do not want them when you do.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But then, that being admitted, look how the higher towers above the legitimate lower. It will always be the case that if a man seeks first the Kingdom of God and His righteousness, there will be-in his simple devotion to the truth, and walking within the limits that it prescribes, and making all his life an act of faith-a direct tendency in a great many directions to secure the best possible use, and the largest possible enjoyment, from the things that are seen and temporal. ‘Godliness hath promise of the life which now is’; and the first Psalm, which perhaps may have been in the Apostle’s mind here, contains a truth that was not exhausted in the Old Testament days, because the man whose heart is set on the law of God, and who meditates upon that law day and night, all that he doeth shall prosper. There is in godliness a distinct and constant tendency to make the best of both worlds; but the best is not made of the present world unless we subordinate it and feel distinctly its insignificance in comparison with the future, which is also the present, unseen world.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And even when, as is often the case, the devout and inwardly prosperous soul is compassed about with sorrows that never can be stanched, with griefs through which anything but an immortal life would bleed itself away; or with poverty and want and anxiety arising from causes which no personal devotion can ever touch or affect-even then if the soul prospers it has the power, the magic power, of converting poison into food, and sorrow into a means of growth; and they whose spirits are joined to Jesus Christ, and whose souls ever move in harmony with Him-and therefore are prosperous souls-will find that there is nothing in this world that is really adverse to them. For ‘all things work together for good to them that love God,’ since he who loves God thinks nothing bad that helps him to love Him better; and since he who loves God finds occasion for loving and trusting Him more in every variety and vicissitude of earthly fortune.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Therefore, brethren, if we will follow the directions that this Apostle gives us as to how to secure the prosperity of our souls, God is faithful and He will measure to us prosperity in regard of outward things by the proportion which our faith in Him bears to His faithfulness. The more we love Him, the more certainly will all things be our servants. If we can say ‘We are Christ’s,’ then all things are ours.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/3_john/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/3_john/1-2.htm" title="Beloved, I wish above all things that you may prosper and be in health, even as your soul prospers....">3 John 1:2-4</a></span>. <span class="ital">Beloved, I wish </span>— Or, <span class="ital">I pray, </span>as <span class="greekheb">ευχομαι </span>is translated by Beza, Estius, Erasmus, Schmidius, Doddridge, and others. <span class="ital">Above all things</span> — Or, <span class="ital">with respect to all things, </span>as <span class="greekheb">περι παντων </span>rather signifies; <span class="ital">that thou mayest prosper and be in health </span>— Namely, of body; <span class="ital">even as, </span>I doubt not, <span class="ital">thy soul prospereth </span>— In faith, love, and every virtue. <span class="ital">For I rejoiced greatly when the brethren </span>— Who went to the church, of which thou art a member; <span class="ital">came </span>back <span class="ital">and testified of the truth that is in thee </span>— Thy faith, love, and other Christian graces; <span class="ital">even as thou walkest in the truth </span>— Adornest the gospel by an exemplary conduct, and all good works. The apostle emphatically terms Gaius’s joining works of charity with faith in the doctrines of the gospel, <span class="ital">the truth that was in him. </span>For there is no true faith without good works: it always produces good works: neither are any works good but such as proceed from faith. These two joined constitute the truth of religion. For <span class="ital">I have, </span>&c. — That is, nothing gives me greater <span class="ital">joy, than to hear that my children walk in the truth — </span>Such is the spirit of every true Christian pastor. It seems probable by this, as has been intimated above, that Gaius was converted by St. John. Hence, in speaking to him, he uses the tender style of paternal love, and his calling him one of his children, when writing under the character of the <span class="ital">elder, </span>has peculiar beauty and propriety.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/3_john/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:1-8 Those who are beloved of Christ, will love the brethren for his sake. Soul prosperity is the greatest blessing on this side heaven. Grace and health are rich companions. Grace will employ health. A rich soul may be lodged in a weak body; and grace must then be exercised in submitting to such a dispensation. But we may wish and pray that those who have prosperous souls, may have healthful bodies; that their grace may shine where there is still more room for activity. How many professors there are, about whom the apostle's words must be reversed, and we must earnestly wish and pray that their souls might prosper, as their health and circumstances do! True faith will work by love. A good report is due from those who receive good; they could not but testify to the church, what they found and felt. Good men will rejoice in the soul prosperity of others; and they are glad to hear of the grace and goodness of others. And as it is a joy to good parents, it will be a joy to good ministers, to see their people adorn their profession. Gaius overlooked petty differences among serious Christians, and freely helped all who bore the image, and did the work of Christ. He was upright in what he did, as a faithful servant. Faithful souls can hear their own praises without being puffed up; the commendation of what is good in them, lays them at the foot of the cross of Christ. Christians should consider not only what they must do, but what they may do; and should do even the common actions of life, and of good-will, after a godly sort, serving God therein, and designing his glory. Those who freely make known Christ's gospel, should be helped by others to whom God gives the means. Those who cannot themselves proclaim it, may yet receive, help, and countenance those who do so.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/3_john/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Beloved, I wish above all things - Margin, "pray." The word used here commonly means in the New Testament to pray; but it is also employed to express a strong and earnest desire for anything, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-29.htm">Acts 27:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-3.htm">Romans 9:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-9.htm">2 Corinthians 13:9</a>. This is probably all that is implied here. The phrase rendered "above all things" - &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;  peri panto&#772;n - would be more correctly rendered here "concerning, or in respect to all things;" and the idea is, that John wished earnestly that "in all respects" he might have the same kind of prosperity which his soul had. The common translation "above all things" would seem to mean that John valued health and outward prosperity more than he did anything else; that he wished that more than his usefulness or salvation. This cannot be the meaning, and is not demanded by the proper interpretation of the original. See this shown by Lucke, in loc. The sense is, "In every respect, I wish that it may go as well with you as it does with your soul; that in your worldly prosperity, your comfort, and your bodily health, you may be as prosperous as you are in your religion." This is the reverse of the wish which we are commonly constrained to express for our friends; for such is usually the comparative want of prosperity and advancement in their spiritual interests, that it is an expression of benevolence to desire that they might prosper in that respect as much as they do in others.<p>That thou mayest prosper - &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;  euodousthai. This word occurs in the New Testament only in the following places: <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/1-10.htm">Romans 1:10</a>, rendered "have a prosperous journey;" <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-2.htm">1 Corinthians 16:2</a>, rendered "hath prospered;" and in the passage before us. It means, properly, "to lead in a good way; to prosper one's journey;" and then to make prosperous; to give success to; to be prospered. It would apply here to any plan or purpose entertained. It would include success in business, happiness in domestic relations, or prosperity in any of the engagements and transactions in which a Christian might lawfully engage. It shows that it is right to wish that our friends may have success in the works of their hands and their plans of life.<p>And be in health - To enjoy bodily health. It is not necessary to to suppose, in order to a correct interpretation of this, that Gaius was at that time suffering from bodily indisposition, though perhaps it is most natural to suppose that, as John makes the wish for his health so prominent. But it is common, in all circumstances, to wish for the health and prosperity of our friends; and it is as proper as it is common, if we do not give that a degree of prominence above the welfare of the soul.<p>Even as thy soul prospereth - John had learned, it would seem, from the "brethren" who had come to him, <a href="http://biblehub.com/3_john/1-3.htm">3 John 1:3</a>, that Gaius was living as became a Christian; that he was advancing in the knowledge of the truth, and was exemplary in the duties of the Christian life; and he prays that in all other respects he might be prospered as much as he was in that. It is not very common that a man is more prospered in his spiritual interests than he is in his other interests, or that we can, in our wishes for the welfare of our friends, make the prosperity of the soul, and the practice and enjoyment of religion, the standard of our wishes in regard to other things. It argues a high state of piety when we can, as the expression of our highest desire for the welfare of our friends, express the hope that they may be in all respects as much prospered as they are in their spiritual concerns. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/3_john/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. above all things&#8212;Greek, "concerning all things": so Alford: in all respects. But Wahl justifies English Version (compare 1Pe 4:8). Of course, since his soul's prosperity is presupposed, "above all things" does not imply that John wishes Gaius' bodily health above that of his soul, but as the first object to be desired next after spiritual health. I know you are prospering in the concerns of your soul. I wish you similar prosperity in your body. Perhaps John had heard from the brethren (3Jo 3) that Gaius was in bad health, and was tried in other ways (3Jo 10), to which the wish, 3Jo 2, refers.<p>prosper&#8212;in general.<p>be in health&#8212;in particular.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/3_john/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="https://biblehub.com/3_john/1-1.htm" title="The elder to the well beloved Gaius, whom I love in the truth.">3Jo 1:1</a>"</span> <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/3_john/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper,....

The rule and measure of this wish is according to the prosperity of his soul, <p>even as thy soul prospereth: the soul is diseased with sin, and may be said to be in good health, when all its iniquities are forgiven; and may be said to prosper, when having a spiritual appetite for the Gospel, the sincere milk of the word, it feeds upon it, is nourished by it, and grows thereby; when it is in the lively exercise of faith, hope, and love; when spiritual knowledge is increased, or it grows in grace, and in the knowledge of Christ Jesus; when the inward man is renewed day by day with fresh strength; and when it enjoys communion with God, has the light of his countenance, and the joys of his salvation; and when it is fruitful in every good work. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/3_john/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/3_john/1.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/3_john/1-2.htm" title="Beloved, I wish above all things that you may prosper and be in health, even as your soul prospers.">3 John 1:2</a>.

Its meaning, therefore, constantly rises above life or the living individual, and takes color from its relation to either the emotional or the spiritual side of life, from the fact of its being the seat of the feelings, desires, affections, aversions, and the bearer and manifester of the divine life-principle (&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;). Consequently &#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#769; is often used in our sense of heart (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-46.htm">Luke 1:46</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-35.htm">Luke 2:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-24.htm">John 10:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-2.htm">Acts 14:2</a>); and the meanings of &#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#769; soul and &#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; spirit, occasionally approach each other very closely.
