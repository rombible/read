(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-19.htm" title="Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the middle, and said to them, Peace be to you.">John 20:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-26.htm" title="And after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them: then came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the middle, and said, Peace be to you.">John 20:26</a>; Rom. 5:33; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-16.htm" title="And as many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them, and mercy, and on the Israel of God.">Galatians 6:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-23.htm" title="Peace be to the brothers, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.">Ephesians 6:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-16.htm" title="Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace always by all means.

In a short private Letter it would be unsuitable to have a long list of special messages as in a Pauline Epistle, especially as the Apostle hoped shortly to see them. John perhaps thinks of his Master’s ideal in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-3.htm" title="To him the porter opens; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calls his own sheep by name, and leads them out.">John 10:3</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/3_john/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/3_john/1-13.htm" title="I had many things to write, but I will not with ink and pen write to you:...">3 John 1:13-14</a>. </span><span class="ital">I had many </span>other <span class="ital">things to write </span>— To communicate to thee concerning the affairs of your church, and concerning Diotrephes; <span class="ital">but I will not — </span>I am not minded; <span class="ital">to write unto thee with ink and pen </span>— Meaning, probably, lest this letter should fall into hands who might make an improper use of it. <span class="ital">But I trust I shall shortly see thee </span>— Lardner conjectures that John did actually visit Gaius; and adds, I please myself with the supposition that his journey was not in vain, but that Diotrephes submitted and acquiesced in the advices and admonitions of the apostle. <span class="ital">Peace be to thee </span>— And every desirable blessing, from God our Father, and Christ Jesus our Lord. <span class="ital">Our friends salute thee </span>— Our translators have inserted the word <span class="ital">our </span>in this clause without any authority. The apostle’s words are <span class="greekheb">οι φιλοι</span>, <span class="ital">the friends, </span>an expression nowhere else found in Scripture; but it applies excellently to the primitive Christians, as it denotes, in the strongest manner, the love which, in the first ages, subsisted among the true disciples of Christ. <span class="ital">Greet the friends by name </span>— That is, in the same manner as if I had named them one by one. The apostle, by sending a salutation to the faithful disciples of Christ, who were in the church of which Gaius was a member, and who were living together in great love, showed his paternal and affectionate regard for them, and encouraged them to be steadfast in their adherence to the truth and grace of the gospel, and to walk worthy of it. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/3_john/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:13,14 Here is the character of Demetrius. A name in the gospel, or a good report in the churches, is better than worldly honour. Few are well spoken of by all; and sometimes it is ill to be so. Happy those whose spirit and conduct commend them before God and men. We must be ready to bear our testimony to them; and it is well when those who commend, can appeal to the consciences of such as know most of those who are commended. A personal conversation together often spares time and trouble, and mistakes which rise from letters; and good Christians may well be glad to see one another. The blessing is, Peace be to you; all happiness attend you. Those may well salute and greet one another on earth, who hope to live together in heaven. By associating with and copying the example of such Christians, we shall have peace within, and live at peace with the brethren; our communications with the Lord's people on earth will be pleasing, and we shall be numbered with them in glory everlasting.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/3_john/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I had many things to write ... - This Epistle closes, as the second does, with a statement that he had many things to say, but that he preferred waiting until he should see him rather than put them on paper.

The similarity of the conclusions suggests that the two epistles were written at the same time. The Apostle meditated a visitational circuit (see Introd. p. 155) in the course of which he would see both Kyria and Gaius.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/3_john/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">13</span>. <span class="ital">I had many things to write</span>] With R.

CONCLUSION (see notes on 2 John 12, 13). Here the pen or reed <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is mentioned instead of the paper, as a means of writing. The word is found nowhere else in the New Testament in this sense Note the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;</span> and the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;</span>, each with its right force, the former expressing a strongcr opposition than the latter: "I had many things to write to thee; <span class="accented">nevertheless</span>, I do not care <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;</span> with ink and pen to write to thee: <span class="accented">but</span> I hope <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;</span> straightway to see thee, and we shall speak mouth to mouth." "The friends" are perhaps so called in contrast to the hostility of Diotrephes and his party. Instead of warfare, "peace be to thee;" instead of the wicked prating of enemies, the salutations of friends. The elder concludes with his own personal salutation to all the members of his flock who reside near to Gaius (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-3.htm">John 10:3</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/3_john/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>I had (&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#788;&#834;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;)<p>The imperfect tense: I was having, when I began to write.<p>Pen (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;)<p>Lit., reed.
