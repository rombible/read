"And the charity of every one of you all toward each other."

We are bound&#8212;Greek, "We owe it as a debt" (2Th 2:13). They had prayed for the Thessalonians (1Th 3:12) that they might "increase and abound in love"; their prayer having been heard, it is a small but a bounden return for them to make, to thank God for it. Thus, Paul and his fellow missionaries practice what they preach (1Th 5:18). In 1Th 1:3, their thanksgiving was for the Thessalonians' faith, love, and patience"; here, for their exceeding growth in faith, and for their charity abounding. "We are bound" expresses the duty of thanksgiving from its subjective side as an inward conviction. "As it is meet," from the objective: side as something answering to the state of circumstances [Alford]. Observe the exact correspondence of the prayer (1Th 3:12, "The Lord make you to abound in love") and the answer, "The love of every one of you all toward each other aboundeth" (compare 1Th 4:10).<p>meet&#8212;right.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_thessalonians/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The apostle begins this Epistle as the former, with thanksgiving; only there he gave thanks for their faith, hope, and love, here he only mentions their faith and love; there for the efficacy of their grace, here for the growth of it. There he said only: <span class="ital">We give thanks</span> here he addeth: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">We are bound, </span> and <span class="ital">as it is meet; </span> as if he was obliged to give thanks for them now somewhat more than before, perceiving their grace did not only yet abide, notwithstanding all their persecutions, but increase and grow. But the apostle’s thanksgiving here respects particularly these Thessalonians’ growth. Not only the beginning, but growth of grace is from God; else why doth the apostle give thanks for it? As <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-6.htm" title="Being confident of this very thing, that he which has begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ:">Philippians 1:6</a></span>. Hence he is styled <span class="ital">the God of all grace, </span> <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-10.htm" title="But the God of all grace, who has called us to his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that you have suffered a while, make you perfect, establish, strengthen, settle you.">1 Peter 5:10</a></span>, weak and strong, first or second. The manner of its growth, whether by infusion of new degrees, as the first grace is infused, or by co-operating only with it, and so it is increased by exercise, is a question I leave to the schoolmen. However, growth is a duty, and commendable in churches. And the apostle mentions particularly: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. Their growth in faith; and that a great degree, uperauzanei, it <span class="bld">groweth exceedingly; </span> it grows over and above, above the ordinary rate of growth, or the common pitch of faith. Their progress was from faith to faith, their assent to the doctrine of the gospel grew more firm and rooted, and the persuasion of their happy state in Christ was much confirmed and strengthened, with a more confident reliance on him; or their faith was extended to more objects by the increase of their knowledge. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. Their increase in love; which he also expresseth by an emphatical word, pleonazei, which signifies increasing to more and more; their love grew in the habit, and abounded in the fruits of it. And this love he sets forth by the universality of it, and the reciprocalness of it, it was <span class="ital">the love of all to each other; </span> they all did love, and were all beloved of one another: there was no schism among them, as in some other churches. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Faith and love are two sister graces, and are always more or less together; only in the order of nature, faith is first, and worketh by love; but not first in time; and then afterwards, when it brings forth, love is <span class="ital">fides formata, </span> faith formed, as the papists speak. Hence some have said, that there was not one hypocrite or false Christian in this whole church. Now the apostle and his fellow ministers hereupon judged themselves bound to give thanks. Christians are obliged to give God thanks for the grace of God in others as well as in themselves; and especially the ministers of the gospel, for the people that have been converted by them, or are committed to them. Hereby the apostle’s joy was increased at present, and his future glory might be advanced also. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_thessalonians/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>We are bound to thank God,.... Since all blessings, temporal and spiritual, come from him: and that always: seeing he is ever giving out fresh favours, or continuing former ones; and because those, especially which are of a spiritual nature, always abide, such as faith and love; which the apostle particularly takes notice of, the members of this Church had, and were increasing in them: for it was not for himself, but for them he gives thanks, <p>for you, brethren: who were so, not in a natural or civil relation, but in a spiritual one, being the children of God, and brethren of Christ; and to do this for them, he looked upon himself with others under an obligation: <p>as it is meet; just, proper, and fitting; it not only becomes the persons who have received mercies from God to be thankful for them; but it is very right for others to join with them in it, and especially the ministers of the Gospel, who are bound, and whom it becomes: it is agreeable to their office and profession to give God the praise and glory of all the grace, and the increase of it, which those, who attend their labours, are favoured with, since this is not of them, but of God; and it was for an increase of grace the apostle here gives thanks, as he judged he was obliged to do, and it was fit he should. <p>Because that your faith groweth exceedingly. Their faith was not a faith of miracles, nor a mere historical faith, or a counterfeit and temporary one, but the faith of God's elect; which is the evidence of things not seen, of an unseen Christ, and the glories of another world; that grace by which a man goes out of himself to Christ for righteousness, life, and salvation; by which he is justified, and by which he lives on Christ, and walks on in him as he has received him. This was theirs; it was not of themselves, the produce of nature, or the fruit of their natural power and free will; but it was the gift of God, and of his operation; a fruit of the Spirit of God, and of which Christ was the author and finisher; and was only theirs, as being given unto them, implanted in them, and exercised by them under the influence of the Spirit of God, and for their use, comfort, and advantage. This was, at first, but like a grain of mustard seed, very small, but gradually increased, and grew exceedingly; and from seeing of Christ, and looking at him, and which at first might be very dim and obscure, it proceeded to going or coming to him; and which might be in a very feeble manner, and was not without being drawn and led, and great encouragements, many invitations, and large assurances; and from thence to a laying hold upon him, though it may be but in a trembling way, and not without being called to stretch forth the hand of faith, and be no more faithless, but believing; and from thence to a leaning and relying on him, trusting in him with all, and for all; and from thence to claiming an interest in him, saying, my Lord, and my God, which is the full assurance of faith; and when it is come to this, it is grown exceedingly, which might be the case of these Thessalonians; which the apostle knew by the aboundings of their love, for faith works by love; and by their patience, firmness, and resolution in suffering for Christ; all which are in proportion to faith, and the growth of it; and for this he gives thanks to God, for faith is a precious thing; and as that itself, so the increase of it is from God, and therefore to him the praise belongs: <p>and the charity of everyone of you towards each other aboundeth; as their faith in Christ, so their love to one another was increasing, and showed itself in serving one another both in temporals and spirituals; and this was not the case of a few only, or of the greater part, but of everyone of them; which made their communion with one another very comfortable and delightful. For what is more pleasant than for brethren to dwell together in unity? <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_thessalonians/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{1}</span> We are bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is meet, because that your faith <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> groweth exceedingly, and the charity of every one of you all toward each other aboundeth;</span><p>(1) The first part of the epistle, in which he rejoices that through the grace of God, they have bravely sustained all the assaults of their enemies.

However, as the discourse afterwards follows quickly on <span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span>, so <span class="greekheb">καθὼς ἄξιόν ἐστιν</span> would sink into a mere entirely meaningless interjection and parenthesis; but as such, on account of the preceding <span class="greekheb">ὀφείλομεν</span>, it would be aimless and superfluous. In direct contrast to this view, Schott places the <span class="ital">chief</span> emphasis on <span class="greekheb">καθὼς ἄξιόν ἐστιν</span>, which he rightly refers back to <span class="greekheb">εὐχαριστεῖν</span> instead of to <span class="greekheb">ὀφείλομεν</span>. According to Schott, <span class="greekheb">καθώς</span> is designed to denote “<span class="ital">modum eximium</span>, quo animus gratus declarari debeat,” and the thought to be expressed is “oportet nos deo gratias agere, quales conveniant <span class="ital">praestantiae</span> beneficii, i. e. <span class="ital">eximias</span>.”[32] But neither can this interpretation be the correct one. For (1) <span class="greekheb">καθώς</span> is <span class="ital">never</span> used as a statement of gradation; (2) it is hardly conceivable that Paul should have concentrated the emphasis of the sentence on <span class="greekheb">καθὼς ἄξιόν ἐστιν</span>. If he had wished to do so, he would at least have written <span class="greekheb">Εὐχαριστεῖν ὀφείλομεν τῷ Θεῷ περὶ ὑμῶν</span>, <span class="greekheb">καθὼς ἄξιόν ἐστιν</span>, but would not have inserted <span class="greekheb">πάντοτε</span> and <span class="greekheb">ἀδελφοί</span>. Taking this insertion into consideration, we are obliged to decide that after <span class="greekheb">ἀδελφοί</span> a certain pause in the discourse commences, so that <span class="greekheb">Εὐχαριστεῖν</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἀδελφοί</span> is placed first as an independent general expression, to which <span class="greekheb">καθὼς ἄξιόν ἐστιν</span> is added as a connecting clause, for the explanation and development of the preceding by what follows. But from this it follows that <span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span> belongs not to <span class="greekheb">εὐχαριστεῖν</span>, but to <span class="greekheb">καθὼς ἄξιόν ἐστιν</span>, and denotes not <span class="ital">that</span>, but <span class="ital">because</span>. The meaning is: We ought <span class="ital">to thank</span> God <span class="ital">always</span> on your behalf, as it (<span class="ital">sc.</span> the <span class="greekheb">εὐχαριστεῖν</span>) is right and proper, because, etc. As by this interpretation <span class="greekheb">καθὼς ἄξιόν ἐστιν</span> is neither unduly brought forward nor unduly placed in the shade, so also every appearance of pleonasm vanishes. For <span class="greekheb">ὀφείλομεν</span> expresses the duty of thanksgiving from its <span class="ital">subjective</span> side, as an internal conviction; <span class="greekheb">καθὼς ἄξιόν ἐστιν</span>, on the other hand, from the <span class="ital">objective</span> side, as something answering to the state of circumstances, since it is meet, since it is fit and proper, to give thanks to God for the divine proof of His grace.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὑπεραυξάνει</span>] <span class="ital">grows above measure</span>, exceedingly. The compound verb is an <span class="greekheb">ἅπαξ λεγόμενον</span> in the N. T. But Paul loves such intensifying compounds with <span class="greekheb">ὑπέρ</span>. They are an involuntary expression of his overflowing feelings. Comp. Fritzsche, <span class="ital">ad Rom.</span> I. p. 351. Olshausen certainly represents it otherwise. He finds in the compound verb a forbearing allusion to the fact that the Thessalonians were guilty of <span class="ital">extravagance</span> in their religious zeal,—an allusion which, as at all events it would contain a certain degree of irony, it is impossible to assume <span class="ital">here</span>, where Paul speaks of the reasons of his <span class="ital">thanksgiving to God</span>. Such an interpretation is not <span class="ital">ingenious</span>, as Baumgarten-Crusius judges, but meaningless.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἑνὸς ἑκάστου πάντων ὑμῶν</span>] instead of the simple <span class="greekheb">ὑμῶν</span>, emphatically strengthens the praise bestowed. Fromond.: non tam totius ecclesiastici corporis, sed uniuscujusque membri, quod mirum est et rarissimae laudis. But Hofmann, in a strangely erroneous manner, thinks that <span class="greekheb">πάντων ὑμῶν</span> does not depend on <span class="greekheb">ἑνὸς ἑκάστου</span>, but is in apposition to it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">εἰς ἀλλήλους</span>] does not belong to <span class="greekheb">πλεονάζει</span>. It is the further <span class="ital">objective</span> specification of <span class="greekheb">ἀγάπη</span>, as <span class="greekheb">ἑνὸς ἑκ</span>. <span class="greekheb">πάντ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὑμ</span>. is the subjective. <span class="greekheb">ἀλλήλους</span> denotes the fellow-Christians in Thessalonica. Therefore erroneously, Pelt: Nec vero sine causa Paulus tam multus est in commendanda eorum caritate in <span class="ital">omnes</span> effusa; quum enim sciret, quam facile turn temporis accideret, ut Christiani se invicem diligerent, <span class="ital">exteros</span> vero aspernarentur, hac potissimum laude ad omnium hominum amorem eos excitare studuit.[33]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[32] Comp. already Ambrosiaster: ut non <span class="ital">qualecumque</span> esse debitum ostenderet, sicut dignum est, ait, ut pro tam infinito dono <span class="ital">magnas</span> gratias referendas deo testarentur.—Oecumenius: <span class="greekheb">ἤ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὅτι φησὶ δίκαιόν ἐστι</span>, <span class="greekheb">νοήσεις</span>· <span class="greekheb">ἢ τὸ μεγάλως ἐξακουστεόν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἵνα ᾖ μεγάλως καθὼς ἄξιον τῷ μεγάλα παρέχοντι</span>.—Theophylact: <span class="greekheb">ἢ ὅτι καὶ διὰ λόγων καὶ διʼ ἔργων</span>· <span class="greekheb">αὕτη γὰρ ἡ ἀξία εὐχαριστία</span>.

Paul is glad and grateful that suffering was drawing his friends together and binding them more closely to their Lord, instead of stunting the growth of their faith and drying up the flow of their mutual charity. Praise comes as usual before blame. Paul is proud of his friends, because suffering has not spoiled their characters, as suffering, especially when due to oppression and injustice, is too apt to do.—<span class="greekheb">ὀφείλομεν</span> (so Cic. <span class="ital">ad.

This is explained by <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_thessalonians/3-6.htm" title="But now when Timotheus came from you to us, and brought us good tidings of your faith and charity, and that you have good remembrance of us always, desiring greatly to see us, as we also to see you:...">1 Thessalonians 3:6-9</a> (see notes), where it appears that the faithfulness of this Church had cheered and sustained the Apostle in a season of peculiar trial, perhaps even of discouragement to himself; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/18-9.htm" title="Then spoke the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not your peace:...">Acts 18:9-10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-3.htm" title="And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.">1 Corinthians 2:3</a> : “Now we live, if you stand fast in the Lord!”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">even as it is meet</span>] For this thanksgiving is matter of intrinsic fitness, not due from personal feeling only. “Your growth in grace <span class="ital">deserves</span> such acknowledgement to God.” Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-7.htm" title="Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart; inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel, you all are partakers of my grace.">Php 1:7</a>, “even as it is right for me to think this of you all;” and the pleonasm of the Liturgy, “It is very meet, right, and our bounden duty.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">because that your faith groweth exceedingly</span>] This was the essential point, about which St Paul was anxious when he sent Timothy “to establish you and exhort you <span class="ital">about your faith</span>,” and on which Timothy had brought back reassuring news (see notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-2.htm" title="And sent Timotheus, our brother, and minister of God, and our fellow laborer in the gospel of Christ, to establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith:">1 Thessalonians 3:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-6.htm" title="But now when Timotheus came from you to us, and brought us good tidings of your faith and charity, and that you have good remembrance of us always, desiring greatly to see us, as we also to see you:">1 Thessalonians 3:6</a>); subsequent tidings confirmed Timothy’s report, and testified to an extraordinary growth in Thessalonian faith. This was due to two causes: (1) to the practical and energetic character of their faith from the beginning (see note on “work of faith,” <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-3.htm" title="Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labor of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God and our Father;">1 Thessalonians 1:3</a>); and (2) to the persecution they had undergone. Great trials, if they do not destroy faith, strengthen it, as storms make the oak take deeper root.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“So fed by each strife won, each strenuous hour,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The strong soul grows, its patience ends in power.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>We are not surprised that the Apostle adds: <span class="bld">and the love of each one of you all toward one another aboundeth</span> (R. V.). This is at once a consequence and cause of growth in faith. Faith and Love are the chief, sister graces of St Paul’s theology; and Hope appears in the next verse, under the guise of “patience,” to complete the trio; comp. notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-3.htm" title="Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labor of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God and our Father;">1 Thessalonians 1:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-8.htm" title="But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation.">1 Thessalonians 5:8</a>; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-13.htm" title="And now stays faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity.">1 Corinthians 13:13</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/galatians/5-5.htm" title="For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith....">Galatians 5:5-6</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In this fundamental quality of Love the Thessalonian Church excelled; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_thessalonians/4-9.htm" title="But as touching brotherly love you need not that I write to you: for you yourselves are taught of God to love one another....">1 Thessalonians 4:9-10</a>,—where the Apostle, acknowledging their excellence, had exhorted them to “abound yet more <span class="ital">in love</span>.” This they are doing, and he is “bound to thank God” for it. He dwells on the universal prevalence of mutual love in this admirable Church—“the love of each one of you all!”<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_thessalonians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">We</span>.

The words are not to be considered as a parenthetic clause, far less as a tautological expression (Jowett); but they state that the reason of the apostle's thanksgiving arose from the spiritual condition of the Thessalonians; "with the acknowledgment of personal obligation, Paul joins a recognition of the circumstances of the case" (Hofinann). <span class="cmt_word">Because that your faith groweth exceedingly</span> - superabounds - <span class="cmt_word">and the charity of every one of you all.</span> The subject of the apostle's thanksgiving was the increase of the faith and love of the Thessalonians: faith here being faith in Christ, and love being love to man. Faith and love contain in themselves the whole of the Christian life; faith is its commencement, its source; love is not only its outcome, its spiritual action, but its completion; the climax of the Christian life is to be made perfect in love. Here, however, love is restricted by the context to love to believers, or brotherly love. <span class="cmt_word">Toward each other;</span> that is, toward your fellow Christians in Thessalonica.
