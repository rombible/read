It certainly does <span class= "ital">not</span> mean “taking vengeance” in the sense of “taking His revenge,” as though our Lord had conceived a personal grudge and were wreaking it. What it does mean would seem to be “assigning retribution:” appointing, that is, to each man what satisfaction of justice he must make. The very word for “vengeance” can only mean vengeance exacted on some one else’s behalf. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-6.htm" title="That no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter: because that the Lord is the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned you and testified.">1Thessalonians 4:6</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/79-10.htm" title="Why should the heathen say, Where is their God? let him be known among the heathen in our sight by the revenging of the blood of your servants which is shed.">Psalm 79:10</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">On them that know not God.</span>—According to the Greek, the word “them” should be repeated also in the next clause. The effect will then be to mark off the culprits into two classes: “them that know not,” and “them that obey not.” A comparison of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/4-17.htm" title="This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that you from now on walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind,">Ephesians 4:17-18</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-5.htm" title="Not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles which know not God:">1Thessalonians 4:5</a>, shows that by the first class are meant Gentiles; a comparison of <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-16.htm" title="But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Esaias said, Lord, who has believed our report?">Romans 10:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-21.htm" title="But to Israel he said, All day long I have stretched forth my hands to a disobedient and gainsaying people.">Romans 10:21</a> (and many other passages) will show disobedience to be the characteristic of the Jews. The Greek negative particle here is one which shows that the ignorance of the one set and the disobedience of the other were just the points for which they were to be punished: therefore, of course, only those Gentiles whose ignorance was voluntary, who chose (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-28.htm" title="And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;">Romans 1:28</a>) to be Gentiles when they might have been joined to the true God, are objects of wrath. Here, as the context shows, St. Paul is thinking chiefly of those Gentiles and Jews who actually persecuted the truth.<p><span class= "bld">Obey not the gospel.</span>—A noteworthy phrase; see the reference. The gospel, the “glad tidings,” contains not only a statement of facts, but also a call to obey a law which is the outcome of the facts. Even the acceptance of evangelical promises requires a submission. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-47.htm" title="And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.">Luke 24:47</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-18.htm" title="When they heard these things, they held their peace, and glorified God, saying, Then has God also to the Gentiles granted repentance to life.">Acts 11:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-3.htm" title="And there shall be no more curse: but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him:">Revelation 22:3</a>.) It is here called specially the gospel “of our Lord Jesus Christ,” because the sin of the Jews (who constitute this class of sinners) consisted precisely in the wilful rejection of Jesus as the Christ.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_thessalonians/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:5-10 Religion, if worth anything, is worth every thing; and those have no religion, or none worth having, or know not how to value it, cannot find their hearts to suffer for it. We cannot by all our sufferings, any more than by our services, merit heaven; but by our patience under sufferings, we are prepared for the promised joy. Nothing more strongly marks a man for eternal ruin, than a spirit of persecution and enmity to the name and people of God. God will trouble those that trouble his people. And there is a rest for the people of God; a rest from sin and sorrow. The certainty of future recompence is proved by the righteousness of God. The thoughts of this should be terrible to wicked men, and support the righteous. Faith, looking to the great day, is enabled partly to understand the book of providence, which appears confused to unbelievers. The Lord Jesus will in that day appear from heaven. He will come in the glory and power of the upper world. His light will be piercing, and his power consuming, to all who in that day shall be found as chaff. This appearance will be terrible to those that know not God, especially to those who rebel against revelation, and obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ. This is the great crime of multitudes, the gospel is revealed, and they will not believe it; or if they pretend to believe, they will not obey it. Believing the truths of the gospel, is in order to our obeying the precepts of the gospel. Though sinners may be long spared, they will be punished at last. They did sin's work, and must receive sin's wages. Here God punishes sinners by creatures as instruments; but then, it will be destruction from the Almighty; and who knows the power of his anger? It will be a joyful day to some, to the saints, to those who believe and obey the gospel. In that bright and blessed day, Christ Jesus will be glorified and admired by his saints. And Christ will be glorified and admired in them. His grace and power will be shown, when it shall appear what he has purchased for, and wrought in, and bestowed upon those who believe in him. Lord, if the glory put upon thy saints shall be thus admired, how much more shalt thou be admired, as the Bestower of that glory! The glory of thy justice in the damnation of the wicked will be admired, but not as the glory of thy mercy in the salvation of believers. How will this strike the adoring angels with holy admiration, and transport thy admiring saints with eternal rapture! The meanest believer shall enjoy more than the most enlarged heart can imagine while we are here; Christ will be admired in all those that believe, the meanest believer not excepted.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_thessalonians/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In flaming fire - This is a circumstance which is not noticed in the account of his appearing in the parallel place in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:16</a>.

Those that had not the gospel, yet had means to know God, by the light of nature, and the works of creation and providence, which if they did not improve, but remained ignorant of God, will fall under this vengeance. And by knowledge here is not meant so much a speculative as a practical knowledge of God; and so such as do not fear, love, and honour God, may be said not to know him. As the Gentiles, who are said to know God, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-21.htm" title="Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.">Romans 1:21</a></span>, but yet not glorifying him as God, and living in idolatry, are said not to know him, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-8.htm" title="However, then, when you knew not God, you did service to them which by nature are no gods.">Galatians 4:8</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-5.htm" title="Not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles which know not God:">1 Thessalonians 4:5</a></span>.

Some are ignorant and know not God, though they live under the gospel. Or, such as have knowledge, yet are not obedient. Knowledge and obedience ought to go together. And this obedience is called the obeying of the gospel. The gospel hath not only promises to be believed, but precepts to be obeyed. Yea, faith itself may fall under its precepts, and then those that believe not the gospel do not obey it: as the same word in the Greek signifies to believe and obey. And as the gospel hath some peculiar precepts and institutions, so all the commands of the moral law are comprehended in it; and the equitable part of the judicial law, yea, and the ceremonial law also, where that which is moral is figured by it; and so far as the gospel commands, men ought to obey; and disobedience appears to be a great evil, when it will expose men to this great vengeance.

Which may either refer to Christ, who will be revealed from heaven in such a manner; and whose coming will be as the lightning, not only sudden, but glorious, illustrious, and visible; he will be seen and easily discerned; there will be such a light and flaming fire about him, which, as it will serve to make him visible, will greatly add to the majesty of his appearance, and strike terror to his enemies, and burn them up round about; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-7.htm">Daniel 7:7</a> or else it may refer to the angels, who shall descend in fiery forms, which is agreeably to their nature, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-4.htm">Psalm 104:4</a> and so they appeared in the forms of horses of fire, and chariots of fire, when Elijah was carried up to heaven. And it is a tradition of the Jews (z), that the angel Gabriel descended , "in a flame of fire", to burn Moses, as he was in the inn, when upon his journey from Midian to Egypt: or this clause may be read in construction with the following, as it is in the Vulgate Latin and Syriac versions, "in flaming fire taking vengeance"; and so expresses the manner in which vengeance will be taken on the wicked by Christ, the Judge of all, to whom it belongs: and the punishment of ungodly men is often signified by fire, and flames of fire, by the fire of hell, and a lake which burns with fire and brimstone, by a furnace of fire, everlasting fire, and fire that cannot be quenched, to set forth the endless torture and inconceivable misery of the damned; and it may be, some regard is had to the general conflagration, which will be at the coming of Christ, when the heavens, being on fire, shall be dissolved, the elements shall melt with fervent heat, and the earth, and all that is in it, shall be burnt up, when the bodies of the wicked, then living, will be consumed in flames of fire, and their souls feel the wrath of the Almighty. The persons who will then be punished, and on whom vengeance will be taken, are described as follows, <p>on them that know not God; which is a periphrasis, or common character of the Gentiles, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-5.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:5</a> who know not the one, true, and living God; or know him not so as to glorify him as God, and be thankful to him for the mercies they receive from him, and still less know him in Christ Jesus; which ignorance of theirs is not without sin, nor will it excuse from punishment; for though vengeance will not be taken on them, because they have not a spiritual saving knowledge of God, in the Mediator Jesus Christ, who never was revealed to them; yet forasmuch as they had the light and law of nature, by which the being of God, and the invisible perfections of his nature might be seen and understood, and much of his will, with respect to moral good and evil, be known, against both which they have rebelled, and having sinned, will perish without law: though it may also include all such persons, who having been favoured with an external revelation, have professed to know God, and yet in works have denied him: <p>and that obey not the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ; of which Christ is the author, was the preacher, and is the sum and substance; which is good news and glad tidings of the grace of, God, of peace, pardon, righteousness, life, and salvation by Christ; which may be said to be obeyed, when it is received and embraced by faith, with and from the heart, and confession is made of it with the mouth, and the ordinances of it are submitted to; and which is called the obedience of faith, because faith without obedience is not right, and obedience without faith is of no avail: but all that hear the Gospel do not obey it; there are some that disbelieve and reject the doctrines and ordinances of it, and others that, do profess it, and do not yield a cordial and cheerful obedience to it; both may be reckoned among the disobeyers of it: and though the unbelieving Jews may be chiefly designed here, yet deists of every age and place, where the Gospel revelation has come, and carnal professors, and profane despisers everywhere, may be included; whose condemnation will be aggravated by the external light which has shone around them, and they have hated; the severest punishment will be inflicted on them; it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon, Sodom and Gomorrah, than for such persons; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-17.htm">1 Peter 4:17</a>. <p>(z) Zohar in Gen. fol. 63. 2.<a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_thessalonians/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">In flaming fire taking vengeance on them <span class="cverse3">{6}</span> that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ:</span><p>(6) There is no knowledge of God to salvation, without the Gospel of Christ.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/2_thessalonians/1.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/1-8.htm" title="In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ:">2 Thessalonians 1:8</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἐν φλογί πυρός</span>] is not, as Estius, Cornelius a Lapide, Seb.

The additional clause accordingly serves for a further exaltation of the <span class="ital">majesty</span> and <span class="ital">glory</span> in which Christ will return.

The formula <span class="greekheb">διδόναι ἐκδίκησίν τινι</span>, to impart vengeance, that is, punishment, to any one, is only found here in the N. T.

Paul does not mention only <span class="ital">one</span> class of persons who are to be punished (Calvin, Hemming, Turretin, Pelt, Schott, de Wette, Riggenbach), but <span class="ital">two</span> classes of persons.

The correctness of this interpretation is further evident from the fact that elsewhere <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΜῊ ΕἸΔΌΤΕς ΘΕΌΝ</span></span></span> is with Paul a characteristic designation of the Gentiles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-5.htm" title="Not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles which know not God:">1 Thessalonians 4:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-8.htm" title="However, then, when you knew not God, you did service to them which by nature are no gods.">Galatians 4:8</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-28.htm" title="And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;">Romans 1:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-12.htm" title="That at that time you were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world:">Ephesians 2:12</a>); whereas the characteristic of the <span class="ital">theocratic</span> nation of the Jews, as shown by experience, was <span class="ital">disobedience</span> to God and His plan of salvation; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-3.htm" title="For they being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves to the righteousness of God.">Romans 10:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-16.htm" title="But they have not all obeyed the gospel.

On the other hand, Harduin and Hofmann interpret the first clause of Gentiles, and the second of Jews and Gentiles; Schrader, the first of Gentiles, and the second of Christians; Aretius, the first of “manifesti Christi hostes, sive Judaei sint sive ethnici,” and the second of “pestes in sinu ecclesiae latitantes.” But with the first view the division, which the article repeated requires, becomes illusory; and the context decides against the last two views. For when, as here, Christians are comforted on account of the afflictions which they suffer from those who are not Christians by an intimation of a future retribution, the discourse cannot possibly have reference to a punishment which is impending on <span class="ital">Christians</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τοῦ κυρίου ἡμῶν Ἰησοῦ</span>] a repetition of the subject already contained in <span class="greekheb">διδόντος</span> in a fuller form, on account of the preceding <span class="greekheb">Θεόν</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[38] Thus also Theodoret must have united the words.

For Esaias said, Lord, who has believed our report?">Romans 10:16</a> f.), the description here applies principally to them.—<span class="greekheb">ἐν πυρὶ φλογός</span>, one of the most favourite realistic traits of the last judgment, in apocalyptic Judaism (<span class="ital">cf.</span> passages in Volz’s <span class="ital">Jüdische Eschatologie</span>, 285, 286); here it is simply a descriptive touch, which Paul does not pause to elaborate (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-13.htm" title="Every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is.">1 Corinthians 3:13</a>). The rather “broad and inflated” language (Weizsäcker) of the whole passage is probably due to the subject, more than to Paul’s employment of Silvanus, himself a prophet (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-32.htm" title="And Judas and Silas, being prophets also themselves, exhorted the brothers with many words, and confirmed them.">Acts 15:32</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_thessalonians/2-12.htm" title="That you would walk worthy of God, who has called you to his kingdom and glory....">1 Thessalonians 2:12-16</a>), as his amanuensis.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/2_thessalonians/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">8</span>. <span class="ital">in flaming fire</span>] Lit., <span class="bld">fire of flame</span>; or, in other copies, <span class="bld">flame of fire</span>. “Fire” is a symbol of Divine anger and majesty, in Scripture; and “flame” is fire in motion, leaping and blazing out. According to <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-7.htm" title="But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved to fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men.">2 Peter 3:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-10.htm" title="But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.">2 Peter 3:10</a>, fire will be the means of destruction for the visible world at the Day of the Lord; while in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-7.htm" title="And of the angels he said, Who makes his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire.">Hebrews 1:7</a>, quoted from Psalms 104, this element is represented as a form of angelic manifestation (see last note). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/3-13.htm" title="Every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is....">1 Corinthians 3:13-15</a> <span class="ital">fire</span> is itself made the means of judgement.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The comma parting this clause from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/1-7.htm" title="And to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels,">2 Thessalonians 1:7</a> in the A.V. must be struck out. The “flaming fire” is the element “in” which the Lord Jesus is “revealed” not the means by which He “takes vengeance” on the wicked. It is His awful robe of glory. The words which follow show why He must appear hi majesty so dreadful:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ</span>] Better, <span class="bld">rendering vengeance to them</span> (R. V.). We must dissociate from “vengeance” all notions of vindictiveness and passion; it is the inflicting of <span class="ital">full justice</span> on the criminal—nothing more, nothing less. In this sense it is written, “Vengeance belongeth unto Me; I will repay, saith the Lord” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-35.htm" title="To me belongs vengeance and recompense; their foot shall slide in due time: for the day of their calamity is at hand, and the things that shall come on them make haste.">Deuteronomy 32:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-19.htm" title="Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place to wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, said the Lord.">Romans 12:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-30.htm" title="For we know him that has said, Vengeance belongs to me, I will recompense, said the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge his people.">Hebrews 10:30</a>). The wronged are forbidden to avenge themselves, just because this is God’s prerogative. Now “the Father hath committed all judgement to the Son” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-22.htm" title="For the Father judges no man, but has committed all judgment to the Son:">John 5:22</a>)—this, therefore, with the rest.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The R. V. properly distinguishes the two classes here marked out for retribution. <span class="bld">Those who know not God</span> belong to the heathen; on this expression comp. note to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-5.htm" title="Not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles which know not God:">1 Thessalonians 4:5</a>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/1-18.htm" title="For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;...">Romans 1:18-25</a>, speaking of the heathenism of his own day and of the course and working of Gentile idolatry, the Apostle declares that this ignorance of God was wilful, that idolatry was the outcome of ungodliness, and that its wickedness was shown by the horrible depravity of morals it produced. It was therefore culpable in the highest degree and merited vengeance, being the ignorance of men who “did not think God worth having in their knowledge” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-28.htm" title="And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;">Romans 1:28</a>). Such is the sentence that St Paul pronounces on the Paganism of his time, in view of its general character and fruits. By no means does he suppose that this “vengeance” will fall on all idolaters at the Last Day, and for the mere fact of “not knowing God” as Christians do. He speaks otherwise in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-14.htm" title="For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law to themselves:">Romans 2:14</a>. Countless millions of heathen have had no such knowledge of God brought to them. Each will be judged according to his personal responsibility and share in the common offence. God “leaves Himself not without witness to any” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-17.htm" title="Nevertheless he left not himself without witness, in that he did good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness.">Acts 14:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-9.htm" title="That was the true Light, which lights every man that comes into the world.">John 1:9</a>); and by the measure of light and opportunity vouchsafed to him will the conduct of every man be weighed and estimated. The Apostle is thinking of the Gentile persecutors at Thessalonica (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/1-6.htm" title="Seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you;">2 Thessalonians 1:6</a>), who refused the knowledge of God and showed their hatred to Him by their hatred toward His children (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-24.htm" title="If I had not done among them the works which none other man did, they had not had sin: but now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father.">John 15:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-13.htm" title="Marvel not, my brothers, if the world hate you.">1 John 3:13</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Those who obey not the gospel</span> are all, whether Jews or Gentiles, to whose knowledge God’s good news of Christ is brought, and who reject the message. <span class="ital">Obedience</span> is practical faith, the submission of heart and life to the demands of Christ. This is what such men refuse; they will not say, “Jesus is Lord” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-3.htm" title="Why I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calls Jesus accursed: and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.">1 Corinthians 12:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-10.htm" title="That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth;">Php 2:10</a>). And the wilful rejecters of Christ became furious persecutors.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>St Paul’s warning echoes that of Christ concerning all who are brought face to face with His Gospel: “He that disbelieveth shall be condemned” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/16-16.htm" title="He that believes and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believes not shall be damned.">Mark 16:16</a>). This condemnation takes effect at once, and operates in the present life; it has the certainty of a moral law: “He that believeth not is condemned already. And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/3-18.htm" title="He that believes on him is not condemned: but he that believes not is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God....">John 3:18-19</a>). This sentence the Lord Jesus pronounces now on those who, with His light shining upon them, refuse Him the obedience of faith.

A distinction is asserted between &#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; as knowledge grounded in personal experience, apprehension of external impressions - and &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; purely mental perception in contrast with conjecture or knowledge derived from others. There are doubtless passages which bear out this distinction (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-24.htm">John 2:24</a>), but it is impossible to carry it rigidly through the N.T. In the two classes, - those who know not God and those who obey not the gospel, - it is not probable that Paul has in mind a distinction between Jews and Gentiles. The Jews were not ignorant of God, yet they are described by John as not knowing him. The Gentiles are described by Paul as knowing God, but as refusing to glorify him as God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-21.htm">Romans 1:21</a>). Paul rather describes here the subjects of God's judgment as one class, but under different aspects. </body></html>
