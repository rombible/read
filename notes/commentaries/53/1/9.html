But the word “destruction” does not stand absolutely and alone as a synonym for “annihilation.” This passage, in itself, gives us no reason to suppose that the lost will be “destroyed” in the ordinary sense of the word. They are to be <span class= "ital">“</span>destroyed <span class= "ital">from the presence</span> of the Lord, and from the glory of His power”—<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>cut off from it for ever. The “presence”—or, more literally here, ”<span class= "ital">the face</span>—of the Lord,” as well as “the glory of His power,” is a metaphor from the courts of Oriental kings, where only honoured courtiers are admitted to spend their time in the immediate and familiar presence of the sovereign. Familiar contact with Christ hereafter, which will be accorded to all the saved, was God’s ideal intention for the lost as well, therefore it is a positive “destruction” to be banished from it. But to the Jews, who looked for a Messiah who should keep regal state, the punishment was peculiarly appropriate. The word is used besides in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-5.htm" title="To deliver such an one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.">1Corinthians 5:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-3.htm" title="For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction comes on them, as travail on a woman with child; and they shall not escape.">1Thessalonians 5:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-9.htm" title="But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition.">1Timothy 6:9</a>. As for the word rendered “everlasting” (or <span class= "ital">eternal, </span>for it is the same which is used, <span class= "ital">e.g., </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-2.htm" title="Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.">Hebrews 6:2</a>), it would certainly convey to St. Paul’s readers the notion of <span class= "ital">incessant duration in time;</span> it is, of course, only an adaptation to human language to speak of time at all in such a case, as we cannot tell what may take the place of time in the next dispensation; however, so far as the actual words go, there is nothing in these passages (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-8.htm" title="Why if your hand or your foot offend you, cut them off, and cast them from you: it is better for you to enter into life halt or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire.">Matthew 18:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-41.htm" title="Then shall he say also to them on the left hand, Depart from me, you cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:">Matthew 25:41</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-46.htm" title="And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.">Matthew 25:46</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-29.htm" title="But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost has never forgiveness, but is in danger of eternal damnation.">Mark 3:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-2.htm" title="Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.">Hebrews 6:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-7.htm" title="Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.">Jude 1:7</a>) to suggest any future alteration in the state of the lost. In this, as in some other doctrines, there seem to be two distinct sets of passages, the logical reconciliation of which in our present state seems almost impossible.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/2_thessalonians/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_thessalonians/1-9.htm" title="Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power;...">2 Thessalonians 1:9-10</a></span>. <span class="ital">Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction </span>— Not the annihilation, but the perversion and utter ruin of all their powers of body and mind, so that those powers become instruments of torment and sources of misery to them in all possible ways. As there can be no end of their sins, (the same enmity against God continuing,) so neither of their punishment: sin and its punishment running parallel through eternity itself. They must of necessity therefore be cut off from all good, and all possibility of it. <span class="ital">From the presence of the Lord </span>— Wherein chiefly consists the salvation and felicity of the righteous.

But this phrase, <span class="ital">destruction from the presence, </span>or face, <span class="ital">of the Lord, </span>as Bishop Hopkins justly observes, expresses not only that they shall be expelled from that joy and glory which reigns in the presence of God and of Christ, but that his presence shall appear active in the infliction of their punishment, so that they shall find his wrath issuing forth like lightning to appal and torment their spirits, while his power glorifies itself in their ruin and misery. <span class="ital">When he shall come to be glorified in his saints </span>— For his wonderful glory shall shine forth in them, and he will manifest the greatness of his power in rendering them glorious; <span class="ital">and to be admired in all them that believe </span>— With respect to the efforts of his almighty power and love for their complete salvation.

We cannot by all our sufferings, any more than by our services, merit heaven; but by our patience under sufferings, we are prepared for the promised joy. Nothing more strongly marks a man for eternal ruin, than a spirit of persecution and enmity to the name and people of God. God will trouble those that trouble his people. And there is a rest for the people of God; a rest from sin and sorrow. The certainty of future recompence is proved by the righteousness of God. The thoughts of this should be terrible to wicked men, and support the righteous. Faith, looking to the great day, is enabled partly to understand the book of providence, which appears confused to unbelievers. The Lord Jesus will in that day appear from heaven. He will come in the glory and power of the upper world. His light will be piercing, and his power consuming, to all who in that day shall be found as chaff. This appearance will be terrible to those that know not God, especially to those who rebel against revelation, and obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ. This is the great crime of multitudes, the gospel is revealed, and they will not believe it; or if they pretend to believe, they will not obey it. Believing the truths of the gospel, is in order to our obeying the precepts of the gospel. Though sinners may be long spared, they will be punished at last. They did sin's work, and must receive sin's wages. Here God punishes sinners by creatures as instruments; but then, it will be destruction from the Almighty; and who knows the power of his anger? It will be a joyful day to some, to the saints, to those who believe and obey the gospel. In that bright and blessed day, Christ Jesus will be glorified and admired by his saints. And Christ will be glorified and admired in them. His grace and power will be shown, when it shall appear what he has purchased for, and wrought in, and bestowed upon those who believe in him. Lord, if the glory put upon thy saints shall be thus admired, how much more shalt thou be admired, as the Bestower of that glory! The glory of thy justice in the damnation of the wicked will be admired, but not as the glory of thy mercy in the salvation of believers. How will this strike the adoring angels with holy admiration, and transport thy admiring saints with eternal rapture! The meanest believer shall enjoy more than the most enlarged heart can imagine while we are here; Christ will be admired in all those that believe, the meanest believer not excepted.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_thessalonians/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction; - see the notes on <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/25-41.htm">Matthew 25:41</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-46.htm">Matthew 25:46</a>. The word which is here rendered "destruction" (&#x3bf;&#787;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;  olethron), is different from that which occurs in <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/25-46.htm">Matthew 25:46</a>, and which is there rendered "punishment" - &#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;  kolasis. The word &#x3bf;&#787;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; olethron - "olethron" - occurs only here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-5.htm">1 Corinthians 5:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-9.htm">1 Timothy 6:9</a>; in each of which places it is rendered destruction. It does not denote annihilation, but is used in the same sense in which we use the word when we say that a thing is destroyed. Thus, health is destroyed when it fails; property is destroyed when it is burned or sunk in the ocean; a limb is destroyed that is lost in battle; life is destroyed when one dies. In the case before us, the destruction, whatever it be, is:<p>(1) to be continued forever; and,<p>(2) is to be of the nature of punishment.<p>The meaning then must be, that the soul is destroyed as to the great purposes of its being - its enjoyment, dignity, honor, holiness, happiness. It will not be annihilated, but will live and linger on in destruction. It seems difficult to conceive how anyone can profess to hold that this passage is a part of the Word of God, and yet deny the doctrine of future eternal punishment. It would not be possible to state that doctrine in clearer language than this. It is never is in clearer language in any creed or confession of faith, and if it is not true that the wicked will be punished forever, then it must be admitted that it would not have been possible to reveal the doctrine in human language!<p>From the presence of the Lord - That is, a part of their punishment will consist in being banished from the immediate presence of the Lord. There is a sense in which God is everywhere present, and in that sense he will be in the world where the wicked will dwell, to punish them. But the phrase is also used to denote his more immediate presence; the place where are the symbols of his majesty and glory; the home of the holy and the blessed. It is in that sense that the word is used here, and the idea is, that it will be one of the circumstances contributing to the deeper woe of the place of punishment, that those who dwell there will be banished from that holy abode, and will never be permitted to enter there.<p>And from the glory of his power - The meaning seems to be, that they will not be able to endure the manifestation of his power and majesty when he shall appear, but will be driven away by it into outer darkness; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-8.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:8</a>. The Saviour, in describing his second coming, uses this language: "They shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven, with power and great glory;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-30.htm">Matthew 24:30</a>. There will be a great exhibition of both. The power will be seen in the convulsions of nature which will precede or attend him; in the resurrection of the dead; and in the bringing of all to judgment: and the glory will be seen in his own person; the dignity and number of his attendants; and the honor that shall then be conferred on him as the final Judge of all mankind. By the manifestation of that power and glory the wicked will be driven away into eternal ruin. They will not be able to stand before it, and though, in common with the righteous, they may see the majesty of the Redeemer in the last day, yet they will be driven away to witness it no more. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_thessalonians/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9.

The sentence emanating from Him in person, sitting as Judge [Bengel], and driving them far from Him (Mt 25:41; Re 6:16; 12:14; compare 1Pe 3:12; Isa 2:10, 19). "The presence of the Lord" is the source whence the sentence goes forth; "the glory of His power" is the instrument whereby the sentence is carried into execution [Edmunds]. But Alford better interprets the latter clause (see 2Th 1:10), driven "from the manifestation of His power in the glorification of His saints." Cast out from the presence of the Lord is the idea at the root of eternal death, the law of evil left to its unrestricted working, without one counteracting influence of the presence of God, who is the source of all light and holiness (Isa 66:24; Mr 9:44).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_thessalonians/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This is the vengeance before spoken of; it is here called <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">destruction, </span> not an annihilation, and cessation of being, but of all well-being: and elsewhere called <span class="ital">death, </span><span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-23.htm" title="For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.">Romans 6:23</a></span>, and <span class="ital">the second death, </span><span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-6.htm" title="Blessed and holy is he that has part in the first resurrection: on such the second death has no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.">Revelation 20:6</a></span>, which imports also not all ceasing of life, but all comfort of life.

They sinned in their eternity, and will be punished in God’s eternity. There was a remedy provided in the gospel for men, but rejecting the gospel, and not obeying it, there remains no hope; their destruction is everlasting. And this destruction is called punishment, dikhn tisousin <span class="ital">poenam luent; </span> not the chastisement of a Father, as the temporal affliction of God’s people.

With destruction both of soul and body, though not with the annihilation of either; their gnawing worm of conscience will never die, and the fire of divine wrath will never be quenched; the smoke of their torment will ascend for ever. Sin being committed against an infinite and eternal Being, will be infinite in its duration; nor will it cease to be in the persons punished, who will not be in the least reformed or purged from sin by punishment; which will make the continuance of it just and necessary. And these will be driven <p>from the presence of the Lord; as the former clause may express the punishment of sense the wicked will feel in their own breasts, this may intend the punishment of loss; or what they will be deprived of, the presence of the Lord, in which the happiness of angels, and of glorified saints lies; and may also signify how sudden and terrible their destruction will be. As soon as the Lord appears, they will perish at his presence like wax before the fire; and so awful will be his appearance, they will flee from it with the utmost terror, and call to the rocks and mountains to hide them from the face of the Lord, and to screen them from his wrath: <p>and from the glory of his power; or his glorious power, in which he shall come, and which will be exerted, and shown in raising the dead, and gathering all nations before him, in passing sentence on them, and in executing it. For he has power, as to save, so to destroy, as to glorify the bodies and souls of his saints, so to destroy the wicked, both body and soul, in hell; and the glory of his power will be seen in the one, as well as in the other.

Chrysostom, Oecumenius, Theophylact, Erasmus, Vatablus, Estius, Fromond., and others interpret <span class="greekheb">ἀπό</span> of <span class="ital">time</span>: immediately after the appearance of the <span class="greekheb">πρόσωπον τοῦ κυρίου</span> and of the <span class="greekheb">δόξα τῆς ἰσχύος αὐτοῦ</span>. The <span class="ital">swiftness</span> and <span class="ital">facility</span> of the punishment are thereby described, inasmuch as it required Christ merely to <span class="ital">become visible</span>. The artificialness of this interpretation is evident. For however often <span class="greekheb">ἀπό</span> denotes the point of commencement of a period, yet the bare <span class="greekheb">ἀπὸ προσώπου</span> cannot possibly be considered as parallel with such constructions as <span class="greekheb">ἀπὸ κτίσεως κόσμου</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-20.htm" title="For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:">Romans 1:20</a>; <span class="greekheb">ἀπὸ τῆς πρώτης ἡμέρας</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-5.htm" title="For your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now;">Php 1:5</a>, and the like. At least <span class="greekheb">ἀπʼ ἀποκαλύψεως τοῦ προσώπου</span> or something similar would require to have been written. Add to this that <span class="greekheb">ἀπὸ προσώπου κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., on account of its position at the <span class="ital">end</span> of the sentence, cannot have such an emphasis, that the idea of the <span class="ital">swiftness</span> and <span class="ital">facility</span> of the punishment can be derived from it. <span class="greekheb">ἀπό</span> is understood as a statement of the <span class="ital">operating cause</span> by Grotius, Harduin, Benson, Bengel, Moldenhauer, Flatt, Pelt, de Wette, Baumgarten-Crusius, Ewald, and Hofmann: “<span class="ital">from</span> the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of His power” (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-19.htm" title="Repent you therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord.">Acts 3:19</a>). Pelt (and so also Castalio, Koppe, Bolten, and others) arbitrarily considers <span class="greekheb">ἀπὸ προσώπου τοῦ κυρίου</span> as equivalent to the simple <span class="greekheb">ἀπὸ τοῦ κυρίου</span>; and equally arbitrarily Harduin, Benson, and Moldenhauer (comp. also Hofmann) understand <span class="greekheb">πρόσωπον</span> of a <span class="ital">wrathful</span> or <span class="ital">gloomy</span> countenance. But there is an essential inconvenience to this second mode of interpretation, inasmuch as by its assumption without the introduction of a <span class="ital">new</span> idea there is only a repetition in other words of what has already been said in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_thessalonians/1-7.htm" title="And to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels,...">2 Thessalonians 1:7-8</a> from <span class="greekheb">ἐν τῇ ἀποκαλύψει</span> to <span class="greekheb">διδόντος ἐκδίκησιν</span>; the whole of the 9th verse would only contain <span class="greekheb">αἰώνιον</span> as a new point. Accordingly the third mode of explanation, adopted by Piscator, Ernest Schmid, Beza, Calixt, Koppe, Krause, Schott, Bloomfield, Alford, Bisping, and Riggenbach, is decidedly to be preferred, according to which <span class="greekheb">ἀπό</span> expresses the idea of <span class="ital">separation</span>, of <span class="ital">severance from something</span>. Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-2.htm" title="That you be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of Christ is at hand.">2 Thessalonians 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-3.htm" title="For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my brothers, my kinsmen according to the flesh:">Romans 9:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-3.htm" title="But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtlety, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.">2 Corinthians 11:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-4.htm" title="Christ is become of no effect to you, whoever of you are justified by the law; you are fallen from grace.">Galatians 5:4</a>. According to Flatt and de Wette, the expression <span class="greekheb">ἰσχύος</span> is opposed to this explanation, which directly points to an operating cause. But <span class="greekheb">τῆς ἰσχύος</span> is to be rendered the genitive of origin, and the <span class="greekheb">δόξα</span> is to be understood, not of the glory of Christ, but of the glory which is to be imparted to <span class="ital">believers</span>. The meaning is: <span class="ital">apart</span> or <span class="ital">separated from the face of the Lord, and apart from the glory which is a creation of His power</span>.

In these awful words the Apostle describes the retribution designed for godless men and rejecters of the Gospel. His word for “penalty” (<span class="ital">diké</span>, the root of the words <span class="ital">righteous</span> and <span class="ital">righteousness</span> in Greek) brings to a climax the idea of <span class="ital">justice</span> developed in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_thessalonians/1-5.htm" title="Which is a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God, that you may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which you also suffer:...">2 Thessalonians 1:5-8</a></span>; see note on “vengeance.” But the clause while defining, qualifies the foregoing; for “who” is equal to <span class="ital">such as, who with all like them</span>. The threatening applies to the impious and malignant opposers who were seeking to crush the infant Church. Their sin corresponded to that which our Lord denounced as the sin against the Holy Spirit, the “eternal sin,” the “blasphemy against the Spirit which shall not be forgiven” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/12-31.htm" title="Why I say to you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven to men: but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven to men....">Matthew 12:31-32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/mark/3-28.htm" title="Truly I say to you, All sins shall be forgiven to the sons of men, and blasphemies with which soever they shall blaspheme:...">Mark 3:28-29</a>, R.

Nor can we limit the range of the word <span class="ital">eternal</span> in its relation to this fearful doom; it removes all limits of time, and is the express opposite of <span class="ital">temporary</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-18.htm" title="While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal.">2 Corinthians 4:18</a>). Seventy-two times the Greek original of the adjective is found in the N.T.: forty-four of these examples are repetitions of the phrase “eternal life;” it is arbitrary to suppose that in the opposite combination “eternal” bears a restricted sense.

The sight of their Judge and His Almightiness, robed in fire and attended by His host of angels, will drive these wretched men, terror-stricken, into ruin.

"Destruction" here denotes ruin, death; the word is only used in Paul's Epistles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-8.htm">1 Corinthians 5:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-9.htm">1 Timothy 6:9</a>). The Greek word translated "everlasting," from dogmatic reasons, has given rise to much controversy. Here it appears to denote eternal - eternity to come. The eternal punishment of the wicked seems here asserted; a terrible declaration, which the mind shudders to contemplate. The observation of Olshausen is worthy of attention: "This is the only passage in Paul's Epistles in which everlasting damnation is openly declared, whereas not a few occur in which a bringing back of all the lost ones is apparently assumed as possible;" but he adds, "For the supposition that Paul did indeed in the earliest of his Epistles still teach everlasting damnation, but gave it up in later times, there exists no sufficient foundation, because the bringing back again is nowhere freely and openly declared." <span class="cmt_word">From the presence</span> (or, <span class="accented">face</span>) <span class="cmt_word">of the Lord.</span> This clause has received a threefold interpretation. Some (De Wette, Hofmann) take the preposition "from" in a causal sense, denoting the efficient cause of the punishment of the wicked - that they will be as it were blasted by the face of the Lord. Others (Chrysostom, Theophylact) take it in a temporal sense, denoting the swiftness of the punishment of the wicked - that their punishment will rise directly on the appearance of Christ (Lunemann, Alford). And others take it in a local sense, denoting banishment or separation - that the wicked will be expelled from that joy and glory which reign in the presence of Christ; they shall be banished away from the presence of the Lord. This last interpretation seems to be the correct meaning; it gives to the proposition its full force. <span class="cmt_word">And from the glory of his power;</span> not a Hebraism for "his mighty glory" (Jowett), but from that glory which has its origin in his power - the wicked will be banished from the manifestation of his power in the glorification of his saints. The punishment of the wicked on its negative side is here stated. As the presence of the glorified Jesus will constitute the happiness of heaven, so banishment from his presence will constitute the misery of hell, because the soul is then cut off from the source of all good and of all holiness. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/2_thessalonians/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Shall be punished (&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;)<p>The verb (N.T.o.) means to pay or render.

Aristotle (&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;, i. 9, 15) says: "The period which includes the whole time of each one's life is called the eon of each one." Hence it often means the life of a man, as in Homer, where one's life (&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bd;) is said to leave him or to consume away (Il. v. 685; Od. v. 160). It is not, however, limited to human life; it signifies any period in the course of events, as the period or age before Christ; the period of the millennium; the mytho-logical period before the beginnings of history. The word has not "a stationary and mechanical value" (De Quincey). It does not mean a period of a fixed length for all cases. There are as many eons as entities, the respective durations of which are fixed by the normal conditions of the several entities. There is one eon of a human life, another of the life of a nation, another of a crow's life, another of an oak's life. The length of the eon depends on the subject to which it is attached.<p>It is sometimes translated world; world representing a period or a series of periods of time. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-32.htm">Matthew 12:32</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/13-40.htm">Matthew 13:40</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-49.htm">Matthew 13:49</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-70.htm">Luke 1:70</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-20.htm">1 Corinthians 1:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-6.htm">1 Corinthians 2:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-21.htm">Ephesians 1:21</a>.

It always means a period of time. Otherwise it would be impossible to account for the plural, or for such qualifying expressions as this age, or the age to come. It does not mean something endless or everlasting. To deduce that meaning from its relation to &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769; is absurd; for, apart from the fact that the meaning of a word is not definitely fixed by its derivation, &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769; does not signify endless duration. When the writer of the Pastoral Epistles quotes the saying that the Cretans are always (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;) liars (<a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-12.htm">Titus 1:12</a>), he surely does not mean that the Cretans will go on lying to all eternity.

In our colloquial dialect everlastingly is used in the same way. "The boy is everlastingly tormenting me to buy him a drum."<p>In the New Testament the history of the world is conceived as developed through a succession of eons. A series of such eons precedes the introduction of a new series inaugurated by the Christian dispensation, and the end of the world and the second coming of Christ are to mark the beginning of another series.

Neither the noun nor the adjective, in themselves, carry the sense of endless or everlasting. They may acquire that sense by their connotation, as, on the other hand, &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b9;&#836;&#768;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, which means everlasting, has its meaning limited to a given point of time in Jde 1:6. &#x391;&#788;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; means enduring through or pertaining to a period of time. Both the noun and the adjective are applied to limited periods. Thus the phrase &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;, habitually rendered forever, is often used of duration which is limited in the very nature of the case.

The same is true of &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;. Out of 150 instances in lxx, four-fifths imply limited duration.
