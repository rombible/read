Perhaps “we order” might convey the meaning still more sharply. But immediately, lest severity provoke rebellion, he adds, “and we beseech,” alleging also the grounds on which he rests his appeal: “<span class= "ital">in</span> our Lord”—<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>“on the strength of our union in the Body of Christ.” (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-1.htm" title="Furthermore then we beseech you, brothers, and exhort you by the Lord Jesus, that as you have received of us how you ought to walk and to please God, so you would abound more and more.">1Thessalonians 4:1</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">That with quietness they</span> <span class= "bld">work.</span>—The opposites of bustling, and of idleness.<p><span class= "bld">Eat their own bread.</span>—Not other people’s. This passage tempts us to take the marginal version in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-12.htm" title="That you may walk honestly toward them that are without, and that you may have lack of nothing.">1Thessalonians 4:12</a> : “have need of no man.” The phrase is not fatal to the idea of there being a communism established. The bread would still be “their own”—<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>they would have a right to it, supposing it had been earned for the community by hard work: otherwise, communism or no communism, the bread was stolen. The commentators aptly compare a rabbinical saying:” When a man eats his own bread he is composed and tranquil in mind; but if he be eating the bread of his parents or children, much more that of strangers, his mind is less tranquil.”<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_thessalonians/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:6-15 Those who have received the gospel, are to live according to the gospel. Such as could work, and would not, were not to be maintained in idleness. Christianity is not to countenance slothfulness, which would consume what is meant to encourage the industrious, and to support the sick and afflicted. Industry in our callings as men, is a duty required by our calling as Christians. But some expected to be maintained in idleness, and indulged a curious and conceited temper. They meddled with the concerns of others, and did much harm. It is a great error and abuse of religion, to make it a cloak for idleness or any other sin. The servant who waits for the coming of his Lord aright, must be working as his Lord has commanded. If we are idle, the devil and a corrupt heart will soon find us somewhat to do. The mind of man is a busy thing; if it is not employed in doing good, it will be doing evil. It is an excellent, but rare union, to be active in our own business, yet quiet as to other people's. If any refused to labour with quietness, they were to note him with censure, and to separate from his company, yet they were to seek his good by loving admonitions. The Lords is with you while you are with him. Hold on your way, and hold on to the end. We must never give over, or tire in our work. It will be time enough to rest when we come to heaven.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_thessalonians/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Now them that are such we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus ... - A more solemn command and appeal to do what he had before enjoined on all of them; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-11.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:11</a>; see the notes on that verse. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_thessalonians/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. by&#8212;The oldest manuscripts read, "IN the Lord Jesus."
