It does not give the reason why St. Paul and his companions worked: “because we strictly enjoined you to work, and therefore could not be idle ourselves.” Rather, it justifies the reiteration of the command: “We do not hesitate to command you now to repress this disorderly conduct, so contrary to the example set you; for, in fact, when we were with you we used to lay down this law.” So Theodoret takes it: “It is no new thing that we write to you.”<p><span class= "bld">We commanded.</span>—The tense in the original is that of constant re-assertion, which brings out once more the thorough grounding which the Apostles gave at once to their converts. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-6.htm" title="Now we command you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you withdraw yourselves from every brother that walks disorderly, and not after the tradition which he received of us.">2Thessalonians 3:6</a> : “the tradition;” also the Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-5.htm" title="Remember you not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you these things?">2Thessalonians 2:5</a>.) The same definite precept is referred to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-11.htm" title="And that you study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you;">1Thessalonians 4:11</a>.<p><span class= "bld">If any would not work.</span>—The word “would” stands for “is not willing,” “refuses.” To any weakness or incapacity for work, except in himself, St. Paul would be very tender; the vice consists in the defective <span class= "ital">will.</span> The canon (in the original) is laid down in the pointed form of some old Roman law like those of the Twelve Tables: “If any man choose not to work, neither let him eat.” It does not mean, “let him leave off eating,” putting it to the man’s own conscience to see the necessary connection between the two things (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-19.htm" title="In the sweat of your face shall you eat bread, till you return to the ground; for out of it were you taken: for dust you are, and to dust shall you return.">Genesis 3:19</a>); but, “let him not be fed.” The Thessalonians are not to be misled into a false charity: giving food in Christ’s name to persons who are capable of working and able to get work, and are too indolent to do so. The support which is here forbidden to be given to these disorderly persons might come either direct from the private liberality of individuals, or from some collected church fund administered by the deacons. It does not seem at all impossible that this Thessalonian Church, which St. Paul himself declares to have taken the churches of Judaea for a model (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-14.htm" title="For you, brothers, became followers of the churches of God which in Judaea are in Christ Jesus: for you also have suffered like things of your own countrymen, even as they have of the Jews:">1Thessalonians 2:14</a>), may have copied its model in adopting some form of communism, or, at any rate, some extensive use of the <span class= "ital">agapè</span> which we see to have been in use at Corinth, established by the Apostle at the very time of writing this Letter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-21.htm" title="For in eating every one takes before other his own supper: and one is hungry, and another is drunken.">1Corinthians 11:21</a>). Such a supposition would give much more point to St. Paul’s canon, as well as to other phrases in both these Epistles, and would enable us to understand better how this discipline could be actively enforced. That the ordinary <span class= "ital">agape</span> was a matter of considerable importance to the poorer classes is evident from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-22.htm" title="What? have you not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise you the church of God, and shame them that have not?

Such as could work, and would not, were not to be maintained in idleness. Christianity is not to countenance slothfulness, which would consume what is meant to encourage the industrious, and to support the sick and afflicted. Industry in our callings as men, is a duty required by our calling as Christians. But some expected to be maintained in idleness, and indulged a curious and conceited temper. They meddled with the concerns of others, and did much harm. It is a great error and abuse of religion, to make it a cloak for idleness or any other sin. The servant who waits for the coming of his Lord aright, must be working as his Lord has commanded. If we are idle, the devil and a corrupt heart will soon find us somewhat to do. The mind of man is a busy thing; if it is not employed in doing good, it will be doing evil. It is an excellent, but rare union, to be active in our own business, yet quiet as to other people's. If any refused to labour with quietness, they were to note him with censure, and to separate from his company, yet they were to seek his good by loving admonitions. The Lords is with you while you are with him. Hold on your way, and hold on to the end. We must never give over, or tire in our work. It will be time enough to rest when we come to heaven.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_thessalonians/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For even when we were with you, this we commanded you - It would seem from this that the evil of which the apostle here complains had begun to operate even when he was with them. There were those who were disposed to be idle, and who needed the solemn command of an apostle to induce them to labor.<p>That if any would not work, neither should he eat - That is, at the public expense. They should not be supported by the church. This was a maxim among the Jews (see Wetstein, in loc.), and the same sentiment may be found in Homer, Demosthenes, and Pythagoras; see Grotius, in loc. The maxim is founded in obvious justice, and is in accordance with the great law under which our Creator has placed us; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-19.htm">Genesis 3:19</a>. That law, in the circumstances, was benevolent, and it should be our aim to carry it out in reference to ourselves and to others. The law here laid down by the apostle extends to all who are able to work for a living, and who will not do it, and binds us not to contribute to their support if they will not labor for it. It should be regarded as extending:<p>(1) to the members of a church - who, though poor, should not be supported by their brethren, unless they are willing to work in any way they can for their own maintenance.<p>(2) to those who beg from door to door, who should never be assisted unless they are willing to do all they can do for their own support. No one can be justified in assisting a lazy man. In no possible circumstances are we to contribute to foster indolence. A man might as properly help to maintain open vice. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_thessalonians/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10.

We not only set you the example, but gave a positive "command."<p>commanded&#8212;Greek imperfect, "We were commanding"; we kept charge of you.<p>would not work&#8212;Greek, "is unwilling to work." Bengel makes this to be the argument: not that such a one is to have his food withdrawn from him by others; but he proves from the necessity of eating the necessity of working; using this pleasantry, Let him who will not work show himself an angel, that is, do without food as the angels do (but since he cannot do without food, then he ought to be not unwilling to work). It seems to me simpler to take it as a punishment of the idle. Paul often quotes good adages current among the people, stamping them with inspired approval. In the Hebrew, "Bereshith Rabba," the same saying is found; and in the book Zeror, "He who will not work before the sabbath, must not eat on the sabbath."<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_thessalonians/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The words contain a reason, as the illative <span class="ital">for</span> imports; but what it refers to is uncertain; most probably a further reason of the apostle’s working with his hands, because when with them he left this command, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">that if any would not work, neither should he eat; </span> he would therefore practise himself what he commanded them, and not be thought to be as the Pharisees, binding heavy burdens upon others, and he not touch them himself. And this is another of the commandments which the apostle gave them, which he declared his confidence that they would do, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-4.htm" title="And we have confidence in the Lord touching you, that you both do and will do the things which we command you.">2 Thessalonians 3:4</a></span>. And this command seems grounded upon the law given to Adam: <span class="ital">In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, </span><span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-19.htm" title="In the sweat of your face shall you eat bread, till you return to the ground; for out of it were you taken: for dust you are, and to dust shall you return.">Genesis 3:19</a></span>. For when he recommends a practice not directly grounded upon some word of God, or of Christ, or from infallible inspiration, he calls it a <span class="ital">permission, </span> as <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-6.htm" title="But I speak this by permission, and not of commandment.">1 Corinthians 7:6</a></span>; but when otherwise, he saith: <span class="ital">I command, yet not I, but the Lord, </span><span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-10.htm" title="And to the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife depart from her husband:">1 Corinthians 7:10</a></span>; and calls it <span class="ital">the commandment of the Lord, </span><span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-37.htm" title="If any man think himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things that I write to you are the commandments of the Lord.">1 Corinthians 14:37</a></span>. And this in the text is not his alone, but the Lord’s, and is elsewhere mentioned, as <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-28.htm" title="Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labor, working with his hands the thing which is good, that he may have to give to him that needs.">Ephesians 4:28</a></span>: <span class="ital">Let him that stole steal no more, but work with his hands, </span>& c.: see <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-20.htm" title="Let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called.">1 Corinthians 7:20</a></span>. God requires it of us as men, that we may be profitable in the commonwealth, supply our own wants and of those that depend upon us, and have wherewith also to supply the wants of the poor, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-28.htm" title="Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labor, working with his hands the thing which is good, that he may have to give to him that needs.">Ephesians 4:28</a></span>, to be kept from the temptations of idleness. Christianity doth not extinguish the profitable laws of nature or nations. Yet this general command admits limitations; if men have ability and opportunity to work, or if the ends of working are not otherwise supplied. For he that lives out of the reason of the law seems not bound by the law; or if the work be mental, and not manual, the law is fulfilled; and the equity of the law reacheth all men so far, as that none ought to be idle and useless in the world. And the apostle’s argument for it in the text is cogent from nature itself; agreeably to that of Solomon, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-26.htm" title="He that labors labors for himself; for his mouth craves it of him.">Proverbs 16:26</a></span>: <span class="ital">He that laboureth laboureth for himself, for his mouth craveth it of him.</span> Whereupon some judge these believing Thessalonians to be generally a people that lived by some handicraft trade, or some other manual labour. And the eating here intended is meant of relief from the stock and charge of the church: such should not be relieved who <span class="ital">would not work, </span> as it is in the text; who could, but would not, the fault being in the will. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_thessalonians/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For even when we were with you,....

There is here a reference to the sentence pronounced on man in Paradise in consequence of disobedience: "In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-19.htm">Genesis 3:19</a>). Labour, indeed, may in one point of view be considered as part of the curse, but it is also a blessing adapted to man's fallen nature.
