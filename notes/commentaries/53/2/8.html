The purpose with which St. Paul began this chapter was to show relatively the date of our Lord’s Advent; but he is now so engrossed in describing the events which must precede it, that when he does mention the Advent again he does so in a parenthetical relative clause.<p><span class= "bld">That Wicked.</span>—Or, <span class= "ital">the</span> <span class= "ital">Lawless One.</span> The English version has again obscured the passage by not keeping the same word as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-7.htm" title="For the mystery of iniquity does already work: only he who now lets will let, until he be taken out of the way.">2Thessalonians 2:7</a>. The general tendency to “lawlessness” or “rebellion” will be brought to a head in the person of “the Lawless One” or “the “Rebel,” just as the “obstruction” is impersonated in “the Obstructor.” The publication of the “secret of rebelliousness” will be effected by the manifesto of the Rebel-in-chief. Of course, this Rebel is the same person with the Man of Sin, the change of title being due to the particularising of his sin by the word “lawlessness” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-7.htm" title="For the mystery of iniquity does already work: only he who now lets will let, until he be taken out of the way.">2Thessalonians 2:7</a>; the specification of the <span class= "ital">time</span> is the only additional intelligence; all the emphasis of the sentence, therefore, rests on “And <span class= "ital">then.”</span><p><span class= "bld">The Lord.</span>—The best text adds the name Jesus, which serves more clearly to contrast Him with His rival.

Nothing can be more plain than that this <span class="ital">wicked </span>or <span class="ital">lawless one, </span>and <span class="ital">the man of sin, </span>must be one and the same person: <span class="ital">shall be revealed — </span>This revelation must mean that he would then no longer work secretly, but would openly show himself, possessing the character, and performing the actions ascribed to the man of sin. <span class="ital">Whom the Lord shall consume </span>— The apostle does not mean that he should be consumed immediately after he was revealed; but, to comfort the Thessalonians, he no sooner mentions his revelation, than he foretels also his destruction, even before he describes his other qualifications; which qualifications should have been described first in order of time, but the apostle hastens to what was first and warmest in his thoughts and wishes. The word <span class="greekheb">αναλωσει</span>, here rendered <span class="ital">to consume, </span>Chandler observes, is used to denote a lingering, gradual consumption; being applied to the waste of time, to the dissipation of an estate, and the slow death of being eaten up of worms. He supposes it has the same meaning here, importing that <span class="ital">the man of sin </span>is to be gradually destroyed by the <span class="ital">spirit </span>— Or <span class="ital">breath</span> rather, as it seems <span class="greekheb">πνευμα </span>should have been here translated; <span class="ital">of Christ’s mouth </span>— By which expression the preaching of true doctrine, and its efficacy in destroying the man of sin, are predicted. For the mouth being the instrument by which speech is formed of breath, or air from the lungs, the <span class="ital">breath of his mouth </span>is a proper figurative expression to denote the speaking or preaching of true doctrine. Accordingly, the preaching of the gospel is termed, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-15.htm" title="And out of his mouth goes a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treads the wine press of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God.">Revelation 19:15</a>,) <span class="ital">a sharp sword proceeding out of the mouth of Christ; </span>and (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/6-5.htm" title="Therefore have I hewed them by the prophets; I have slain them by the words of my mouth: and your judgments are as the light that goes forth.">Hosea 6:5</a>) God says, <span class="ital">I have hewed them by the prophets, I have slain them by the word of my mouth. </span>See also <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-4.htm" title="But with righteousness shall he judge the poor, and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth: and he shall smite the earth: with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked.">Isaiah 11:4</a>. Or, the expression may include both the preaching of the gospel and the power of the Spirit accompanying it; <span class="ital">and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming </span>— By clear, convincing reasons and arguments contained in the doctrine of those that shall speak or write by the Spirit of Christ, or by God’s manifest judgments against him in the pouring out of the several vials, Revelation 16. The original expression, <span class="greekheb">επιφανεια της παρουσιας αυτου</span>, is, literally, <span class="ital">the bright shining of his coming, </span>and means that, as darkness is dispelled by the rising of the sun, so the mystery of iniquity shall be destroyed by the lustre with which Christ will cause the true doctrine of the gospel to shine. “If,” says Dr. Benson, “St. John and St. Paul have prophesied of the same corruptions, it should seem that the head of the apostacy will be destroyed by some signal judgment, after its influence or dominion hath, in a gradual manner, been destroyed by the force of truth.” According to Daniel, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-27.htm" title="And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him.">Daniel 7:27</a>,) after the little horn is <span class="ital">consumed and destroyed, the kingdom, and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High; </span>a prediction which undoubtedly signifies the general conversion of both Gentiles and Jews to the Christian faith, and the universal reign of righteousness and peace through all the earth.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_thessalonians/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:5-12 Something hindered or withheld the man of sin. It is supposed to be the power of the Roman empire, which the apostle did not mention more plainly at that time. Corruption of doctrine and worship came in by degrees, and the usurping of power was gradual; thus the mystery of iniquity prevailed. Superstition and idolatry were advanced by pretended devotion, and bigotry and persecution were promoted by pretended zeal for God and his glory. This mystery of iniquity was even then begun; while the apostles were yet living, persons pretended zeal for Christ, but really opposed him. The fall or ruin of the antichristian state is declared. The pure word of God, with the Spirit of God, will discover this mystery of iniquity, and in due time it shall be destroyed by the brightness of Christ's coming. Signs and wonders, visions and miracles, are pretended; but they are false signs to support false doctrines; and lying wonders, or only pretended miracles, to cheat the people; and the diabolical deceits with which the antichristian state has been supported, are notorious. The persons are described, who are his willing subjects. Their sin is this; They did not love the truth, and therefore did not believe it; and they were pleased with false notions. God leaves them to themselves, then sin will follow of course, and spiritual judgments here, and eternal punishments hereafter. These prophecies have, in a great measure, come to pass, and confirm the truth of the Scriptures. This passage exactly agrees with the system of popery, as it prevails in the Romish church, and under the Romish popes. But though the son of perdition has been revealed, though he has opposed and exalted himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; and has spoken and acted as if he were a god upon earth, and has proclaimed his insolent pride, and supported his delusions, by lying miracles and all kinds of frauds; still the Lord has not yet fully destroyed him with the brightness of his coming; that and other prophecies remain to be fulfilled before the end shall come.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_thessalonians/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And then shall that Wicked be revealed - &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  ho anomos - "the wicked one," referring to the "man of sin," and called "the wicked one" because of the eminent depravity of the system of which he was to be the head; see the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-3.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:3</a>.<p>Whom the Lord shall consume - The Lord Jesus; see the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-24.htm">Acts 1:24</a>. The word "consume" here - &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;  analo&#772;sei - means "to destroy;" see <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-15.htm">Galatians 5:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-54.htm">Luke 9:54</a>. The word would be applicable to any kind of destruction. The methods by which this will be done are immediately specified - and it is of much importance to understand them, if this refers to the papacy. "With the spirit of his mouth." What goes out of his mouth, or what he speaks; that is, word, truth, command, or gospel - all of which he may be regarded as speaking. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-16.htm">Revelation 1:16</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/19-15.htm">Revelation 19:15</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/19-21.htm">Revelation 19:21</a>, it is said of the Redeemer that "a sharp two-edged sword goeth out of his mouth;" that is, his word, doctrine, or command - what he speaks - is like a sharp sword. It will cut deep; will lay open the heart; will destroy his enemies. Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-4.htm">Isaiah 11:4</a>, "With the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked." The reference in the passage before us is to one of the methods which would be employed to "destroy" the man of sin; and the sense is, that it would be by what is spoken by the Redeemer. This may refer either to what he will say at his coming, or to his truth - already spoken; to what has gone from his lips, by whomsoever uttered; and the meaning then is, that one of the grand agencies for destroying this anti-Christian power is the truth spoken or revealed by the Saviour - that is, his pure gospel.<p>If this latter is the true interpretation, it may mean that the process for his destruction may have commenced long anterior to the personal appearing of the Redeemer, but that the complete destruction of this power will be accomplished by the splendor of his second coming. It cannot be denied, however, that the most obvious interpretation is that which refers both clauses in the sentence to the same period - that of his second coming. Still, it is not improper to suppose that it may be implied that his power will be weakened and diminished by the influence of the gospel, though it may not be wholly destroyed until the second coming of the Saviour.<p>And shall destroy - &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;  katarge&#772;sei. Shall bring to nothing; cause to cease; put an end to. This is, in some respects, a stronger word than that which in the former part of the verse is rendered "consume." It denotes a more entire destruction than that, though it does not refer so much to any positive agency by which it will be done. In the former word, the attention is directed more to the agency by which the destruction will be effected - to the exertion of some kind of power to do it; in this word the attention is directed rather to the entireness or totality of the destruction. The anti-Christian domination will wholly cease, or be entirely destroyed. The words would naturally harmonize with the idea that there would be a somewhat gradual process under the operation of truth toward the destruction of the man of sin, but that the complete annihilation of his power would be by some more manifest exhibition of the personal glory of the Saviour.<p>With the brightness of his coming - This is evidently a Hebraism, meaning his splendid or glorious appearing. The Greek word, however, rendered "brightness" (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;  epiphaneia - epiphany) - means merely "an appearing," or "appearance." So it is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-4.htm">1 Timothy 6:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-10.htm">2 Timothy 1:10</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-1.htm">2 Timothy 4:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-8.htm">2 Timothy 4:8</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/titus/2-13.htm">Titus 2:13</a>, in all which places it is rendered appearing, and refers to the manifestation of the Saviour when he shall come to judge the world. It is used nowhere else in the New Testament. There is no necessary idea of splendor in the word, and the idea is not, as our translation would seem to convey, that there would be such a dazzling light, or such unsufferable brightness that all would be consumed before it, but that he would appear, and that this anti-Christian power would be destroyed by his appearing; that is, by himself when he would return. The agency in doing it would not be his brightness, but himself. It would seem to follow from this, that, however this enormous power of wickedness might be weakened by truth, the final triumph over it would be reserved for the Son of God himself on his second return to our world. Yet, if this be so, it need not lessen our zeal in endeavoring to diminish the power of these corruptions; to establish and spread the truth, or to convert the defenders of these errors to a better faith. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_thessalonians/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. Translate, "the lawless one"; the embodiment of all the godless "lawlessness" which has been working in "mystery" for ages (2Th 2:7): "the man of sin" (2Th 2:3).<p>whom the Lord&#8212;Some of the oldest manuscripts read, "the Lord Jesus." How awful that He whose very name means God-Saviour, should appear as the Destroyer; but the salvation of the Church requires the destruction of her foe. As the reign of Israel in Canaan was ushered in by judgments on the nations for apostasy (for the Canaanites were originally worshippers of the true God: thus Melchisedek, king of Salem, was the "priest of the most high God," Ge 14:18: Ammon and Moab came from righteous Lot), so the Son of David's reign in Zion and over the whole earth, is to be ushered in by judgments on the apostate Christian world.<p>consume &#8230; and &#8230; destroy&#8212;So Da 7:26, "consume and destroy"; Da 11:45. He shall "consume" him by His mere breath (Isa 11:4; 30:33): the sentence of judgment being the sharp sword that goeth out of His mouth (Re 19:15, 21). Antichrist's manifestation and destruction are declared in the same breath; at his greatest height he is nearest his fall, like Herod his type (Isa 1:24-27; Ac 12:20-23). As the advancing fire, while still at a distance consumes little insects [Chrysostom] by its mere heat, so Christ's mere approach is enough to consume Antichrist. The mere "appearance of the coming" of the Lord of glory is sufficient to show to Antichrist his perfect nothingness. He is seized and "cast alive into the take of fire" (Re 19:20). So the world kingdoms, and the kingdom of the beast, give place to that of the Son of man and His saints. The Greek for "destroy" means "abolish" (the same Greek is so translated, 2Ti 1:10); that is, cause every vestige of him to disappear. Compare as to Gog attacking Israel and destroyed by Jehovah (Eze 38:1-39:29), so as not to leave a vestige of him.<p>with the brightness of his coming&#8212;Greek, "the manifestation, (or appearance) of His presence": the first outburst of His advent&#8212;the first gleam of His presence&#8212;is enough to abolish utterly all traces of Antichrist, as darkness disappears before the dawning day. Next, his adherents are "slain with the sword out of His mouth" (Re 19:21). Bengel's distinction between "the appearance of His coming" and the "coming" itself is not justified by 1Ti 6:14; 2Ti 1:10; 4:1, 8; Tit 2:13, where the same Greek for "appearing" (English Version, here "the brightness") plainly refers to the coming itself. The expression, "manifestation (appearing) of His presence," is used in awful contrast to the revelation of the wicked one in the beginning of the verse.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_thessalonians/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">And then shall that Wicked be revealed:</span> this revealing I think differs from that mentioned before, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-3.htm" title="Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;">2 Thessalonians 2:3</a></span>; he is first revealed, as I said: <span class="ital">quoad existentiam, </span> when he comes forth into being, and then <span class="ital">quoad apparentiam, </span> when he comes to be discovered.

And without question his coming will destroy him, if not destroyed before, as well as the rest of the wicked, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/1-9.htm" title="Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power;">2 Thessalonians 1:9</a></span>; but whether judgment may not first proceed against the antichristian state, and those that have sinned under the gospel, is a question. It is sometimes mentioned particularly with respect to them: as in the parable of the tares and wheat, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/13-1.htm" title="The same day went Jesus out of the house, and sat by the sea side....">Matthew 13:1-30</a></span>, of the ten virgins, and the talents, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/25-1.htm" title="Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened to ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom....">Matthew 25:1-46</a></span>. And the beast and false prophet are cast into the lake of fire, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-20.htm" title="And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that worked miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone.">Revelation 19:20</a></span>, before the general judgment, mentioned <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-12.htm" title="And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.">Revelation 20:12</a></span>. So that at Christ’s personal coming his judgment will, as some conceive, begin here, and then proceed to the rest of the world; whereupon many assign some great length of time to Christ’s stay upon earth, and judging the world. Others take <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">the brightness of his coming</span> in a spiritual sense, for a clearer manifestation of Christ in the world. As the kingdom of antichrist, or of this man of sin, is founded in darkness, so the brightness of this coming will dispel and destroy it. With respect to his eternal generation, Christ is said to be <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">the brightness of his</span> Father’s <span class="bld">glory, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-2.htm" title="Has in these last days spoken to us by his Son, whom he has appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;">Hebrews 1:2</a></span>; but this is a brightness with respect to men. And though he hath come in his Spirit to enlighten his church from the beginning of the world, and more eminently after his ascension, yet this will exceed all the former, and is peculiarly styled <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">the brightness of his coming.</span> And so they expect this destruction of this man of sin before Christ’s coming to judgment; for if it be the same with the fall of Babylon, mentioned in the Revelation, many things are to be done here upon earth after that, before Christ’s last coming, and they mention the calling of the Jews, the destruction of those enemies called Gog and Magog, the coming down of the new Jerusalem from heaven, which is some glorious state of the ctmrch here upon earth. However, the apostle here mentions nothing of a destruction by the material sword; what princes may do of different religions upon a civil account, I do not know, but as this man of sin rose out of the apostacy of the church, so he will not be consumed and destroyed but by a return from it, which is done by the breath of Christ’s mouth, and the brightness of his coming. But yet, by some instruments or other, God will avenge the blood of his servants upon this man of sin in the time and way appointed of him. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_thessalonians/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And then shall that wicked be revealed,.... That lawless one, who sets himself above the laws of God and man, and dispenses with them at pleasure, who judges all men, but is judged by no man; as he was in his ecclesiastical power, when Phocas, who murdered the Emperor Mauritius, granted to Boniface III. to be called universal bishop; and in his civil power in succeeding popes, who took upon them the power over kings and emperors, to crown, depose, and excommunicate at pleasure: <p>whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth: that is, the "Lord Jesus", as the Alexandrian copy, and Vulgate Latin version read; and the Syriac version, "our Lord Jesus": who is Lord of lords, and God over all; and so able to do what he is here said he shall do: and which he will do <p>with the Spirit of his mouth; meaning either the Holy Spirit, the third person which proceeds from him, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/33-6.htm">Psalm 33:6</a>, and so the Ethiopic version, "whom the Spirit of our Lord Jesus shall cast out"; Christ will by his Spirit blow a blast upon antichrist and his kingdom, which he shall never recover again, but ever after consume and waste away: or else by his spirit is meant his Gospel; the Scriptures in general are the breath of God, being divinely inspired by him, and are the sword of the Spirit, the twoedged sword of law and Gospel, which proceeds out of Christ's mouth; the Gospel contains the words of Christ, which are spirit and life; these come out of his mouth, and are sharper than any twoedged sword; and as hereby sinners are cut to the heart, hewn and slain, convicted and converted, so by this likewise antichrist will be consumed, and is consuming; for this phrase denotes the beginning of his destruction, which took place at the time of the reformation by the preaching of the Gospel by Luther and others; by which this man of sin received his deadly wound, and has been in a consumption ever since, and is sensibly wasting in his power and glory every day, and will ere long come to utter destruction: <p>and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming; either in a spiritual way, when he shall come in his spiritual kingdom and glory, by the light of his Gospel and the illuminations of his Spirit; when at eventide it shall be light; when he the sun of righteousness shall arise; when latter day light and glory shall appear, and latter day darkness, the gross darkness of Popery, Paganism, and Judaism, which cover the people, shall, be removed, and antichrist in every form shall disappear: or in a personal manner, when he shall come to judge the quick and dead, which will be in flaming fire and great glory; and then will antichrist and his followers, the beast and those that have worshipped him, be cast with the devil and the false prophet into the lake which burns with fire and brimstone; and this will be the last and utter end of him. In this passage there is a manifest reference to <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-4.htm">Isaiah 11:4</a>, "with the breath of his mouth shall he slay the wicked": which the Targumist paraphrases, <p>"with the words of his lips he shall slay , "Armillus the wicked":'' <p>and which the Jews say will be done by the Messiah at his coming; <p>"for so (i) (say they) that phrase in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-8.htm">Deuteronomy 22:8</a> "if a man fall from thence", has respect to Armillus the wicked, who at the coming of our Messiah will be slain, as it is said in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-4.htm">Isaiah 11:4</a>' <p>This Armillus, the Jews say (k), is the head of all idolatry, the tenth king who shall reign at Rome, the city of Satan; that he shall rise up after Gog and Magog, and shall go up to Jerusalem, and slay Messiah ben Joseph, and shall himself be slain by Messiah the son of David; yea, they say expressly (l), it is the same whom the Gentiles call antichrist: it is the same with Romulus the first king of the Romans, and designs a Roman, the Roman antichrist; and it may be observed, that the Targumist interprets "the breath of his mouth", by his word; and so says another of their writers (m), <p>"the meaning is by the word of his lips, for the word goes out of the mouth with the vapour and breath:'' <p>such an expression as this is said (n) to be used by Moses, when he was bid by God to answer the angels who objected to his having the law given him; <p>"I am afraid (says he) they will slay (or burn me), , "with the breath of their mouth":'' <p>much more may this be feared from the breath of Christ's mouth. <p>(i) Tzeror Hammor, fol. 148. 2.((k) Apud Buxtorf.

The Lawless One, being the ultimate embodiment of the world’s wickedness and defiance of God, must suffer the conclusive fulfilment of the prophet’s words.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Just as <span class="ital">the sight</span> of the Lord Jesus will suffice to bring ruin on cruel persecutors (ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/1-9.htm" title="Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power;">2 Thessalonians 1:9</a>), so it will need but <span class="ital">the breath of His mouth</span> to lay low the haughty and Titanic Antichrist: “A word shall quickly slay him!”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming</span>] More exactly, <span class="bld">and shall bring to nought with the manifestation of his coming</span> (or <span class="ital">presence</span>: Greek <span class="ital">parousia</span>; see note on this word, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-19.htm" title="For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing?

Others refer the term to a cry or word, and think that the sentence of condemnation pronounced by the Lord Jesus on the wicked is intended. But the words are to be taken literally as a description of the power and  irresistible might of Christ at his coming - that the mere breath of his mouth is sufficient to consume the wicked (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-4.htm">Isaiah 11:4</a>, "He shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked"). <span class="cmt_word">And shall destroy</span> (or, <span class="accented">annihilate</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>with the brightness</span> (or, <span class="accented">appearance</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>of his coming.</span> The two words, <span class="accented">epiphany</span> and <span class="accented">parousia</span>, which are elsewhere used separately to denote the coming of Christ, are here employed. There is no ground for the assertion that the first is the subjective and the second the objective aspect of Christ's coming (Olshausen). The brightness of Christ's coming is not here expressed; but the meaning is that the mere appearance of Christ's presence will annihilate the wicked. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/2_thessalonians/2.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Consume (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;)<p>Better, slay, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/2-16.htm">Matthew 2:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-2.htm">Luke 22:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-33.htm">Acts 5:33</a>.<p>Spirit (&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;)<p>Better, breath. &#x3a0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;, almost always translated spirit, is from &#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd; to breathe or blow.
