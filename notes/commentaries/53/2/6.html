The word “now” is not used exactly in a temporal sense, but as introducing another item. “You remember about Antichrist and his characteristics: very good; and now, what keeps Antichrist back? You know that too.” Knowing not only that Antichrist’s apocalypse must precede Christ’s, but also that Antichrist could not reveal himself yet, because the way was blocked by something still (as they saw) unremoved, the Thessalonians were absurd in acting as if the day of the Lord was come.<p><span class= "bld">What withholdeth.</span>—Rather, <span class= "ital">that which withholdeth:</span> they did not merely know it as a dogma, but as a familiar object. “You are perfectly acquainted with the thing which acts as a check upon the Man of Sin.” Unlike the Man of Sin himself, who was a dim figure in the mysterious future, the Obstacle was present and tangible. They may have forgotten what the thing is, but St. Paul stirs their memory by telling them that they well know the thing itself. It must needs be a marked and mighty power which can prevent the development of the great Antichrist. At the same time, St. Paul’s doctrine is that this marked power is destined by-and-by to be removed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-7.htm" title="For the mystery of iniquity does already work: only he who now lets will let, until he be taken out of the way.">2Thessalonians 2:7</a>). Possibly, then, St. Paul may shrink from naming it in writing, not only because he wishes to exercise the Thessalonians’ memories, but also for fear the power should discover and disapprove of his prophecies. For the question what the withholding power is, see the <span class= "ital">Excursus on the Interpretation of the Prophecy.</span><p><span class= "bld">That he might . . . in his time.</span>—Or, <span class= "ital">with a view to his being revealed at his proper moment.</span> Not that the withholding power is conscious of such desire, but God’s design is to use that power for the purpose.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_thessalonians/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:5-12 Something hindered or withheld the man of sin. It is supposed to be the power of the Roman empire, which the apostle did not mention more plainly at that time. Corruption of doctrine and worship came in by degrees, and the usurping of power was gradual; thus the mystery of iniquity prevailed. Superstition and idolatry were advanced by pretended devotion, and bigotry and persecution were promoted by pretended zeal for God and his glory. This mystery of iniquity was even then begun; while the apostles were yet living, persons pretended zeal for Christ, but really opposed him. The fall or ruin of the antichristian state is declared. The pure word of God, with the Spirit of God, will discover this mystery of iniquity, and in due time it shall be destroyed by the brightness of Christ's coming. Signs and wonders, visions and miracles, are pretended; but they are false signs to support false doctrines; and lying wonders, or only pretended miracles, to cheat the people; and the diabolical deceits with which the antichristian state has been supported, are notorious. The persons are described, who are his willing subjects. Their sin is this; They did not love the truth, and therefore did not believe it; and they were pleased with false notions. God leaves them to themselves, then sin will follow of course, and spiritual judgments here, and eternal punishments hereafter. These prophecies have, in a great measure, come to pass, and confirm the truth of the Scriptures. This passage exactly agrees with the system of popery, as it prevails in the Romish church, and under the Romish popes. But though the son of perdition has been revealed, though he has opposed and exalted himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; and has spoken and acted as if he were a god upon earth, and has proclaimed his insolent pride, and supported his delusions, by lying miracles and all kinds of frauds; still the Lord has not yet fully destroyed him with the brightness of his coming; that and other prophecies remain to be fulfilled before the end shall come.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_thessalonians/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And now ye know what withholdeth - Margin, "holdeth." The reference is, to something that then operated to constrain or hold back the obvious tendency of things, so that the "man of sin" should not at once appear, or so that things should not soon so develop themselves as to give rise to this anti-Christian power. There were causes at work even then, which would ultimately lead to this; but there was also something which checked the tendency of things, so that the revelation or development of the "man of sin" was put off to a future period. The obvious meaning of this would be, that, when the apostle wrote, there was a tendency to what would occur under the great apostasy, and that this would soon develop itself if it were not restrained. If the reference is to the papacy, this would consist in corruptions already existing in the church, having a resemblance to those which afterward existed under that system, or which were the germ of that system.<p>If there was a tendency toward the concentration of all power in an individual in the church, - if there was an assumption of authority by one class of ministers above another, - if there was a denial of the "parity of the clergy," the tendency would have been to that ultimate assumption of authority which is found in the Romish hierarchy. But conjecture is useless as to what was the precise form in which this tendency then began to develop itself. That the corruptions early began in the church which terminated in the papacy, and which led on directly to it, we know; and that the apostle was able to foresee and predict such a final development, shows that he was under the influence of inspiration. It is not known precisely what is referred to by the phrase "what withholdeth," &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;  to katechon. The phrase means properly, something that "holds back," or "restrains."<p>The word here is in the neuter gender, "What withholdeth." In the following verse it is in the masculine gender, &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;  ho katecho&#772;n - "he that letteth," or withholdeth; and the reference would seem to be to some agency or state of things under the control of an individual, or of some civil power, that then operated as a restraint on the natural tendency of things. Of this, the apostle says, they had had full information; but we can only conjecture what it was. The restraining power of anything controlled by an individual, or of any government, or the restraining power of God, would meet all that the phrase implies. The most natural interpretation is that which refers it to civil power, meaning that there was something in the form of the existing administration which would prevent this development until that restraint should be removed. The supposition that there was even then a tendency to concentrate all ecclesiastical power at Rome, and that while the civil authority remained there it would not suffer ecclesiastical power to grow to the exorbitant height which it ultimately reached, will meet all that is implied in the language.<p>That he might be revealed in his time - The man of sin. The meaning is, that there was then a restraint operating which would prevent the development of this anti-Christian power until the proper time; that is, until the state of the world should be such that in the divine arrangements it would be proper to permit it. It was not to be permitted until the gospel should be extensively preached, and had had an opportunity of showing its fair effects on the nations; until it had become so planted and established that even the rise of this anti-Christian power could not effectually uproot it. If the "man of sin" had been permitted to rise at once, the consequence might have been that the new religion would have been crushed, so that it could never have revived again. There was then a providential arrangement by which this growth of wickedness should be checked and restrained, until the new religion should take deep root in the earth, and its perpetuity should be secured. Then the great trial was to be permitted under the "man of sin." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_thessalonians/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. now ye know&#8212;by my having told you. The power must have been one "known" to the Thessalonians.<p>what withholdeth&#8212;that which holds him back; "keeps him in check": the power that has restrained the man of sin from his full and final development, is the moral and conservative influence of political states [Olshausen]: the fabric of human polity as a coercive power; as "he who now letteth" refers to those who rule that polity by which the great upbursting of godlessness is kept down [Alford]. The "what withholdeth" refers to the general hindrance; "he who now letteth," to the person in whom that hindrance is summed up. Romanism, as a forerunner of Antichrist, was thus kept in check by the Romanemperor (the then representative of the coercive power) until Constantine, having removed the seat of empire to Constantinople, the Roman bishop by degrees first raised himself to precedency, then to primacy, and then to sole empire above the secular power. The historical fact from which Paul starts in his prediction was probably the emperor Claudius' expulsion of the Jews, the representative of the anti-Christian adversary in Paul's day, from Rome, thus "withholding" them in some degree in their attacks on Christianity; this suggested the principle holding good to the end of time, and about to find its final fulfilment in the removal of the withholding person or authority, whereupon Antichrist in his worst shape shall start up.<p>that he might be&#8212;Greek, "in order that": ye know that which keeps him back, in God's purposes, from being sooner manifested, "in order that he may be revealed in his own time" (that is, the time appointed by God to him as his proper time for being manifested), not sooner (compare Da 11:35). The removal of the withholding power will be when the civil polity, derived from the Roman empire, which is to be, in its last form, divided into ten kingdoms (Re 17:3, 11-13), shall, with its leading representative head for the time being ("he who now letteth," Greek, "withholdeth," as in 2Th 2:6), yield to the prevalent godless "lawlessness" with "the lawless one" as its embodiment. The elect Church and the Spirit cannot well be, as De Burgh suggests, the withholding power meant; for both shall never be wholly "taken out of the way" (Mt 28:20). However, the testimony of the elect Church, and the Spirit in her, are the great hindrance to the rise of the apostasy; and it is possible that, though the Lord shall have a faithful few even then, yet the full energy of the Spirit in the visible Church, counteracting the energy or "working" of "the mystery of lawlessness" by the testimony of the elect, shall have been so far "taken out of the way," or set aside, as to admit the manifestation of "the lawless one"; and so De Burgh's'S view may be right (Lu 18:8; Re 11:3-12). This was a power of which the Thessalonians might easily "know" through Paul's instruction.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_thessalonians/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">And now ye know what withholdeth:</span> the apostle it seems had told them, as of his coming, so of what at present withheld the revealing of him. And what this was is difficult to know now, though it seems these Thessalonians knew it: there are many conjectures about it. This I shall say in general: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. It was something that the apostle thought not safe openly to declare in writing; else he would not have written of it so obscurely. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. It was both a thing, and a person; a thing, to katecon, in this verse, <span class="ital">that which withholdeth; </span> and a person, as in the next verse, o katecwn, <span class="ital">he who letteth.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. It was also such a thing and such a person as were to be removed out of the way, not totally, but as they were hinderances of this revelation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Expositors, both popish and protestant, pitch upon the Roman emperor and empire as most probably meant here by the apostle; and therefore he wrote not plainly, lest by writing of the taking away that empire, which the Romans thought to be eternal, he might stir up their hatred against the Christians. Some understand it of the removing only the seat of the emperor from Rome to Constantinople, whereby the bishop of Rome had opportunity to grow up into greater power. The popish writers understand it of the total destruction of the empire, which because they see not yet done they conclude the man of sin is not yet revealed. Our protestant writers understand it only of such a weakening of the empire and imperial dominion, as gave the bishop and clergy of Rome advantage to rise up into power both spiritual and secular; as some learned writers have given an account thereof. When the empire was broken into ten kingdoms, the imperial power of the emperors was much weakened; and being afterwards united in the pope as an ecclesiastical monarch, he grew up, and the imperial power declined, the grandeur of them both could not stand together. And this is the beast with the ten horns, and ten crowns upon the horns, which is spoken of, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-1.htm" title="And I stood on the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and on his horns ten crowns, and on his heads the name of blasphemy.">Revelation 13:1</a></span>; whereupon this beast is worshipped, and the voice is: <span class="ital">Who is like unto the beast? who is able to make war with him?</span> <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-4.htm" title="Who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God sits in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God.">2 Thessalonians 2:4</a></span>. Some of the ancient fathers had this sense of the text: see Tertul. de Resurrect. 1. 4. c. 24. Chrysost. in locum. Aug. de Civ. Dei, 1. 19. c. 20. Jerome, when he heard of the taking of Rome by Alaricus, expected the coming of antichrist not far off. Whereupon the ancient church did pray that the Roman empire might continue long, that his coming might be delayed: <span class="ital">Tertul. Apol.</span> c. 32,39. But it is now evident how it is fallen from what once it was. The eastern part is under the dominion of the Turk; the western divided into ten distinct kingdoms under distinct governments; and in Germany, where it is most remaining, the empire is little more than titular; and Italy and Rome wholly in the pope’s possession: and hence this man of sin hath been long since revealed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">That he might be revealed in his time:</span> as God appoints seasons for all his works, so for the revealing of him, as also for his ruin. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_thessalonians/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And now ye know what withholdeth,.... Or hinders the revelation of the man of sin, or antichrist; by which is meant not the Apostle Paul, though he by his ministry was a very great hinderance of the growth of error, and the spread of evil practices in the churches, and so of the more open appearance of the man of sin in his forerunners; and after his departure from Ephesus, and imprisonment at Rome, and suffering death, there was a great falling off in the churches, and among professors of religion, which made way for the manifestation of antichrist in due time: nor the preaching of the Gospel, in its power and purity, in the several parts of the world; though so long as this obtained, got ground, and gained success, the man of sin could not show his head; and therefore it must, as it did, decline, and was gradually taken away that he might appear: nor the Spirit of God, as the spirit of truth and holiness, though as long as he continued in his gifts and operations of grace in the churches, they were preserved from antichristian doctrine and worship; but when he removed from them, this enemy and adversary of Christ and his Gospel came in like a flood: nor the general defection in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-3.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:3</a> though that was to be previous to the revelation of antichrist, and was to be what would usher him in; nor could he appear until the wickedness of men was come to a pitch, that they would be ready to receive him, and pay homage and worship to him: nor is the decree of God meant, though till the time came fixed by God for his appearance, the decree must be a bar in his way; since as there is a time for every purpose, nothing can come to pass till that time comes: but by that which withheld, let or hindered the open appearance of antichrist, were the Roman empire and emperors; these stood in his way, and while this empire lasted, and the emperors wore the imperial crown, and sat on the throne, and held the government in their hands, the popes could not come at the height of their ambition, dignity, and authority, nor shine in their glory; nor could the whore of Babylon take her seat, and sit upon the seven hills of Rome until the Roman emperor was taken out of the way: this therefore hindered, <p>that he might be revealed in his time. The Ethiopic version renders it, "until his time appointed came": wherefore till the time that God had fixed for the appearance of this monster of iniquity, this son of perdition, the Roman empire must continue, and Roman emperors must keep their place and dignity to prevent his appearance sooner: the reason why the apostle expresses this not in plain words, but in an obscure manner, and with so much caution, was, that he might not offend the Roman emperors, and provoke them to a severe persecution of them as seditious persons, that sought the destruction of the empire: the word here used, which is rendered "withholdeth", or "letteth", as in the next verse, signifies a ruler or governor, and answers to the Hebrew word  "to keep back, or restrain"; and which is used of kings, who by their laws and government restrain and withhold people from doing what they would; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-17.htm">1 Samuel 9:17</a> to which the apostle, who well understood the Hebrew language, doubtless had reference; so , is rendered, "a magistrate", in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-7.htm">Judges 18:7</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_thessalonians/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And now ye know <span class="cverse3">{g}</span> what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time.</span><p>(g) What hinders and stops.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/2_thessalonians/2.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-6.htm" title="And now you know what withholds that he might be revealed in his time.">2 Thessalonians 2:6</a>. <span class="greekheb">Τὸ κατέχον</span>] is <span class="ital">that which keeps back, that which hinders</span> (<span class="greekheb">τὸ κωλύον</span>, Chrysostom).

More difficult than these determinations is the solution of the question, In what connection this verse is conjoined to the preceding by means of <span class="greekheb">καὶ νῦν</span>. Storr, with whom Flatt agrees, finds in <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΝῦΝ</span></span></span> a contrast to <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἜΤΙ</span></span></span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-5.htm" title="Remember you not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you these things?">2 Thessalonians 2:5</a>. The thought would then be, that the <span class="ital">advent</span> cannot commence until Antichrist appears, <span class="ital">this</span> I have told you by word of mouth; <span class="ital">but now</span>, after my written declaration (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-3.htm" title="Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;">2 Thessalonians 2:3</a>), you know also why the appearance of <span class="ital">Antichrist</span> is still delayed, namely, by the circumstance that the <span class="greekheb">ἀποστασία</span> must precede his appearance. But if Paul had actually wished to have expressed this contrast, he would have been obliged to write in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-5.htm" title="Remember you not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you these things?">2 Thessalonians 2:5</a>, <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὍΤΙ ΤΑῦΤΑ ΜῈΝ ἜΤΙ ὪΝ ΠΡῸς ὙΜᾶς ἜΛΕΓΟΝ ὙΜῖΝ</span></span></span>, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-6.htm" title="And now you know what withholds that he might be revealed in his time.">2 Thessalonians 2:6</a>, <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΝῦΝ ΔῈ ΚΑῚ ΤῸ ΚΑΤΈΧΟΝ ΟἼΔΑΤΕ</span></span></span>. Related to Storr’s view is the interpretation of Kern, with whom Hilgenfeld (<span class="ital">l.c.</span> p. 247) agrees: “That the advent of Christ does not take place until the man of sin be revealed, is already known to you: and <span class="ital">now, in reference to what the present presents to you</span>, ye know also that which hinders.” The same objection is decisive against this view. Further, according to Hofmann, who considers <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_thessalonians/2-5.htm" title="Remember you not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you these things?...">2 Thessalonians 2:5-6</a> as “two halves of one question united with <span class="greekheb">καί</span>,” <span class="greekheb">νῦν</span> stands not, indeed, in opposition to <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἜΤΙ</span></span></span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-5.htm" title="Remember you not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you these things?">2 Thessalonians 2:5</a>, but must express “the present in reference to that future which was known to the readers,” that they know <span class="ital">that</span> in the present by which its commencement is still hindered. But the temporal <span class="greekheb">νῦν</span> can never form a contrast to <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΑῦΤΑ</span></span></span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-5.htm" title="Remember you not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you these things?">2 Thessalonians 2:5</a>; and to assume that the words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-6.htm" title="And now you know what withholds that he might be revealed in his time.">2 Thessalonians 2:6</a> are still contained in the question in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-5.htm" title="Remember you not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you these things?">2 Thessalonians 2:5</a> is entirely erroneous, because in this case <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑῚ ΝῦΝ Κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Λ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> could only be considered as dependent on <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὍΤΙ</span></span></span>,[47] but it is not necessary to recall to mind what is actually known in the present.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">νῦν</span> is also understood as a particle of <span class="ital">time</span>, by Whitby, Macknight, Heydenreich, Schrader, Olshausen, Baumgarten-Crusius, Wieseler, and Bisping, but they do not connect it with <span class="greekheb">οἴδατε</span>, but with <span class="greekheb">τὸ κατέχον</span>: “and ye know that which <span class="ital">at present</span> hinders.” But only a grammatical impropriety would be expressed thereby, as <span class="greekheb">καὶ τὸ νῦν κατέχον</span> would be required. For it is inconceivable that an adverb, whose proper place is <span class="ital">between the article and the participle</span>, should by a <span class="ital">hyperbaton</span> be placed first, because it <span class="ital">has</span> already in its <span class="ital">natural</span> position the same emphasis which it would <span class="ital">receive</span> by its being placed first. The passages appealed to, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-7.htm" title="For the mystery of iniquity does already work: only he who now lets will let, until he be taken out of the way.">2 Thessalonians 2:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-17.htm" title="But as God has distributed to every man, as the Lord has called every one, so let him walk.

For the emphasis lies not on <span class="greekheb">ἄρτι</span>, but on <span class="greekheb">κατέχων</span>, so that <span class="greekheb">ἄρτι</span> might be omitted without injury to the sense; and <span class="greekheb">ἤδη</span> is not put in exchange for <span class="greekheb">νῦν</span>, but for <span class="greekheb">ἐν τῷ ἑαυτοῦ καιρῷ</span>. Likewise <span class="greekheb">νῦν</span> is understood by Schott as a <span class="ital">temporal</span> and <span class="ital">consecutive</span> particle, but <span class="greekheb">καί</span> is then taken in the sense of <span class="ital">also</span>: “For ye know <span class="ital">also now</span> (not only have ye learned it <span class="ital">at that time</span> when I was with you), why the appearance of Antichrist is still delayed.” But (1) <span class="greekheb">τὸ οὖν κατέχον οἴδατε καὶ νῦν</span> would require to have been written; (2) <span class="greekheb">τὸ κατέχον</span> must refer to a point <span class="ital">formerly already explained</span>; but it is entirely a <span class="ital">new</span> point, as in what goes before what hindered the appearance of <span class="ital">Christ</span>, but not what hindered the appearance of <span class="ital">Antichrist</span>, was spoken of; (3) lastly, to what an idle, dragging, and trivial addition would <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-6.htm" title="And now you know what withholds that he might be revealed in his time.">2 Thessalonians 2:6</a> be degraded! The only correct view is to take <span class="greekheb">καὶ νῦν</span> in a <span class="ital">logical</span> sense, but not, with Koppe and Krause, as an inferential particle (“and accordingly”), but with de Wette, Alford, and Ewald, as <span class="ital">a particle of transition to a new communication: and now</span>, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-34.htm" title="I have seen, I have seen the affliction of my people which is in Egypt, and I have heard their groaning, and am come down to deliver them.

Accordingly, the emphasis does not lie on <span class="greekheb">νῦν</span>, but on <span class="greekheb">κατέχον</span>. The meaning is: <span class="ital">and now</span>—to pass on to a further point—<span class="ital">ye know what hindereth</span>, namely, wherein it consists, and why the appearance of Antichrist is still prevented, that it should be revealed in its <span class="ital">appointed</span> time, marked out by God.

Were <span class="greekheb">νῦν</span> temporal, it would mean (<span class="ital">a</span>) that during the interval between Paul’s teaching and the arrival of this letter fresh circumstances (so Zimmer) had arisen to throw light on the thwarting of the adversary. But of this there is no hint whatsoever in the context. Or (<span class="ital">b</span>), preferably, it would contrast with the following <span class="greekheb">ἐν τῷ αὐτοῦ καιρῷ</span>, as an equivalent for “already” (Hofmann, Wohl., Milligan, etc.).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/2_thessalonians/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">6</span>. <span class="ital">And now ye know</span>] After this allusion: “now that yon call to mind what I used to say about the final struggle with the powers of evil, that will precede Christ’s coming.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(ye know) <span class="ital">what withholdeth</span>] Better, <span class="bld">that which restraineth</span>—rendered “letteth” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-7.htm" title="For the mystery of iniquity does already work: only he who now lets will let, until he be taken out of the way.">2 Thessalonians 2:7</a>; only it is masculine there, denoting personal agency; here neuter, indicating a principle or power.

As Christ’s advent has its proper season reserved for it, so has that of Antichrist.

Some connect it with the restraining influence: "And ye know what now withholdeth;" but if so, there would have been a different arrangement of the words in the original Others consider it as a mere particle of transition: "Now, to pass over to another subject;" but there is no transition, the apostle continues his description of the man of sin.

The hindrance does not refer to the prevention of the apostle from speaking freely on this subject, lest he should involve himself in political difficulties; nor to any delay in the coming of Christ; but to a restraint upon the appearance of the man of sin: "Ye know what prevents his open manifestation." <span class="cmt_word">That he;</span> namely, the man of sin. <span class="cmt_word">Might be revealed in his time;</span> literally, <span class="accented">in his season</span>; in his proper time, the time appointed by God.

Just as there was a "fulness of time" when Christ should appear (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4</a>), so there was a "fulness of time" when the man of sin should be revealed; there was a series of events going on which would culminate in his revelation.
