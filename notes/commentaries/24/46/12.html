The prophecy begins with Egypt. Let them strengthen themselves with all the art and interest they have, yet it shall be all in vain. The wounds God inflicts on his enemies, cannot be healed by medicines. Power and prosperity soon pass from one to another in this changing world.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/46.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The land - The earth; the world rings with the cry of grief.<p>Against the mighty - Against the mighty man, i. e., one mighty man against another.

For the Egyptians should certainly be overthrown, either by the Chaldeans stumbling upon the Babylonians, or the Babylonians on them, or they (fleeing) for haste stumbling one upon another, so as both those that went before, and those who followed after, should both fall together. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/46.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>The nations have heard of thy shame,.... Their shameful defeat and overthrow by the Chaldean army; so, after the manner of prophecy, the thing is related as done; the battle fought, and the victory obtained; and the rumour and fame of it spread among the nations, to the great mortification of this proud people: <p>and thy cry hath filled the land; the shrieks of the wounded; the cry of the pursued and taken; the lamentation of friends and relations for their dead; with one thing or another of this kind the whole land of Egypt was filled; yea, all the countries round about them, in confederacy with them, were filled with distress for the loss of their own; the calamity was large and spreading, and the rumour of it: <p>for the mighty man hath stumbled against the mighty, and they are fallen both together; either the mighty Egyptians against the mighty Chaldeans; and though the latter were the conquerors, yet lost abundance of men; so that there were mighty ones fell on both sides: or rather, as Jarchi, Kimchi, and Abarbinel, the mighty Egyptians in their flight fell, and other mighty ones of them following, stumbled at them, and fell upon them, and so both became a prey to the pursuers; or in their flight the mighty Egyptians stumbled against their mighty auxiliaries before mentioned, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-9.htm">Jeremiah 46:9</a>; and so both came into the hands of their enemies.

The question, "Why (wherefore) do I see?" points to the unexpected and incomprehensible turn in the progress of events. &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; &#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; is not an accus. dependent on &#1512;&#1488;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497;, but an independent clause: "What do I see? They are terror-stricken" (&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, terrified, broken-spirited through terror). &#1497;&#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;, Hoph. from &#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1514;, to be broken, here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-20.htm">Job 4:20</a> applied to persons. &#1502;&#1504;&#1493;&#1505; is added to the verb instead of the inf. abs., to give emphasis to the idea contained in the word; cf. Ewald, 281, a. &#1502;&#1490;&#1493;&#1512; &#1502;&#1505;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1489; .a , "horror, terror around" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-25.htm">Jeremiah 6:25</a>), is taken by Ewald as the reply of Jahveh to the question, "Wherefore is this? On every side there is danger;" and this is appropriately followed by the imperatives in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-6.htm">Jeremiah 46:6</a>, "Let no one, then, attempt to flee; not one shall escape to Egypt, but they must fall at the Euphrates."

The second strophe commences at <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-7.htm">Jeremiah 46:7</a>. The description begins anew, and that with a question of astonishment at the mighty host advancing like the Nile when it bursts its banks and inundates the whole country. &#1497;&#1488;&#1512; is the name of the Nile, taken from the Egyptian into the Hebrew language; cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/41.htm">Genesis 41</a>ff., <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/1-22.htm">Exodus 1:22</a>, etc. &#1492;&#1514;&#1490;&#1468;&#1506;&#1513;&#1473;, dash about (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-22.htm">Jeremiah 5:22</a>), wave backwards and forwards: the Hithpa. is here interchanged with the Hithpo. without any difference of meaning. </body></html>
