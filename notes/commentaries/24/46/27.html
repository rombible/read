Why should they insist, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/43-7.htm" title="So they came into the land of Egypt: for they obeyed not the voice of the LORD: thus came they even to Tahpanhes.">Jeremiah 43:7</a>, on placing themselves in a position which would involve them in the destruction which the prophet thus foretells?

Such a consolation was, we may well believe, needed by the people when they saw the armies of Nebuchadnezzar laying waste the country in whose protection they had trusted, and where they had hoped to find a home. Better things, they are told, were in store for them, even a return to the land of their fathers.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/jeremiah/46.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/46-27.htm" title="But fear not you, O my servant Jacob, and be not dismayed, O Israel: for, behold, I will save you from afar off, and your seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and be in rest and at ease, and none shall make him afraid....">Jeremiah 46:27-28</a></span>. <span class="ital">But fear not thou, O my servant Jacob; for I will make a full end of all the nations whither, </span>&c. — See notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/30-10.htm" title="Therefore fear you not, O my servant Jacob, said the LORD; neither be dismayed, O Israel: for, see, I will save you from afar, and your seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and shall be in rest, and be quiet, and none shall make him afraid....">Jeremiah 30:10-11</a>, from whence these two verses are taken, containing a comfortable promise to the Jews, that God will not make an utter destruction of them as he hath done of several other nations, against which the prophets have denounced his judgments; but will still preserve a remnant of them, to whom he will perform the promises made to their fathers: see also note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/30-16.htm" title="Therefore all they that devour you shall be devoured; and all your adversaries, every one of them, shall go into captivity; and they that spoil you shall be a spoil, and all that prey on you will I give for a prey....">Jeremiah 30:16-17</a>. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/46.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>46:13-28 Those who encroached on others, shall now be themselves encroached on.

Egypt's fall and restoration have been foretold; but the prophet closes with a word of exhortation to the many erring Jews who dwelt there. Why should they flee from their country, and trust in a pagan power, instead of endeavoring to live in a manner worthy of the noble destiny which was their true glory and ground of confidence? <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/46.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>27, 28. Repeated from Jer 30:10, 11. When the Church (and literal Israel) might seem utterly consumed, there still remains hidden hope, because God, as it were, raises His people from the dead (Ro 11:15). Whereas the godless "nations" are consumed even though they survive, as are the Egyptians after their overthrow; because they are radically accursed and doomed [Calvin].   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/46.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/46.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But fear thou not, O my servant Jacob; and be not dismayed, O Israel,....

Jarchi supposes these to be the righteous in Egypt, who were carried thither by Johanan against their will; but though they may be included, even that small remnant that should escape, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-28.htm">Jeremiah 44:28</a>; yet the Jews in Babylon, and other provinces, are chiefly designed; and the words are intended to comfort them in their captivity, with a promise of their return, lest they should be discouraged, in hearing that the Egyptians should inhabit their own land again, and they not theirs: <p>and Jacob shall return, and be in rest, and at ease, and none shall make him afraid: this will have its full accomplishment hereafter in the latter day; when the Jews will be converted, and return to their own land, and never be disturbed more, as they have been, ever since their return from the Babylonish captivity.

The prophet is suddenly transported in imagination into the period of the Babylonian exile. Egypt and its fortunes are far away; the troubles of Israel entirely absorb his attention. After thinking sadly of the reverses of his people, he bursts out with an encouraging exhortation not to fear, though, humanly speaking, there was everything to fear. Did Jeremiah write these verses here? There is strong reason to doubt it; for they occur, with insignificant variations, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-10.htm">Jeremiah 30:10, 11</a>, where they cohere far better with the context than here. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/46.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The mercenaries, also, of the daughter of Egypt, well fed, like fatted calves, betake themselves to flight. &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; are "mercenaries," as distinguished from the allies mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-9.htm">Jeremiah 46:9</a>. It was Carians and Ionians through whom Psammetichus attained the supremacy over all Egypt: these had settled down in &#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3b1; of their own, between Bubastis and Pelusium, on both banks of the eastern arm of the Nile (Herodotus, ii. 152, 154), and were very well cared for, since the king relied on them (Herod. ii. 152, 163). Hence the comparison with fatted calves, which, moreover, are co-ordinated with the subject, as is shown by the resumption of the subject in &#1490;&#1468;&#1501; &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492;. &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; stands in the middle of the sentence, with an asseverative meaning: "Yea, these also turn their back, they flee together, do not stand; for the day of their destruction is come." "The day of their destruction" is used as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-17.htm">Jeremiah 18:17</a>. On "the time of their visitation" (which stands in apposition to the preceding expression (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-23.htm">Jeremiah 11:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-12.htm">Jeremiah 23:12</a> : it is not an accusative of time (Graf), for this always expresses the idea of continuance during a space of time.</body></html>
