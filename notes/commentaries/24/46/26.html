This we are told by civil historians fell out in the time of Amasis, a king of Egypt coevous with Cyrus, who was overcome by Cyrus’s son Cambyses, who brought Egypt to be a province belonging to the Medes and Persians; by the fulfilling of which prophecy the truth both of Jeremiah’s and Ezekiel’s prophecies are justified. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/46.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And I will deliver them into the hand of those that seek their lives,....

The <span class="ital">v</span>. may be well suspected as a gloss by a scribe who desired in the latter part of it to soften the dismal forecast for Egypt, especially as words of corresponding comfort follow for his own people.

"In the days of old," patriarchal and unmilitary, the fertile valley of the Nile offered a peaceful and a happy home to its teeming inhabitants; those times shall yet come again. To understand this, we must assume that during its period of depression Egypt has been but sparsely peopled, owing to the large numbers of its inhabitants carried away captive. Another explanation, "afterwards Egypt shall stay at home [i.e, 'be quiet']," though equally justifiable item the point of view of the lexicon (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-17.htm">Judges 5:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55-7.htm">Psalm 55:7</a>), seems less natural. Possibly <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/29-13.htm">Ezekiel 29:13-16</a> is a development of our passage; it contains a promise of future remission of punishment, though a promise qualified in such a way as to be akin to a threat. The words, "And it shall no more be the confidence of the house of Israel" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/29-16.htm">Ezekiel 29:16</a>), seem like a comment on Jeremiah's threat to "Pharaoh, and them that trust in him," in the preceding verse. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/46.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"Egypt is a very beautiful young heifer; a gadfly from the north comes - comes. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-21.htm">Jeremiah 46:21</a>.

Egypt is a very beautiful &#1506;&#1490;&#1500;&#1492;; this feminine is chosen with a regard to "the daughter of Egypt." &#1497;&#1508;&#1492;&#1470;&#1508;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; is an adjective formed from the Peal of &#1497;&#1508;&#1492;, "very beautiful," not "coquetting" (Hitzig, who follows the &#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7; of the lxx). A very beautiful heifer is the people when carefully and abundantly fed in their beautiful and fertile land (Hitzig). Upon this heifer there comes from the north &#1511;&#1512;&#1509;. This &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;. is variously rendered. &#1511;&#1512;&#1509; means, in the Hebrew, to pinch, nip (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-6.htm">Job 33:6</a>), to compress together, as in winking (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-19.htm">Psalm 35:19</a>), to bring the lips closely together (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-30.htm">Proverbs 16:30</a>), and to nip off; cf. Arab. qaras[a to pinch, nip, cut off. Hence A. Schultens (Orig. Heb. ii. 34ff.), after Cocceius, and with a reference to Virgil, Georg. iii. 147, has rendered &#1511;&#1512;&#1509; by morsus vellicans oestri. Hitzig (with whom Roediger, in his additions to Gesenius' Thesaurus, agrees) takes Arab. qa&#770;rs&#803;, insectum cimici simile as his warrant for rendering it by oestrus, "the gadfly," which gives a more suitable meaning. Ewald, on the contrary, compares &#1511;&#1512;&#1509; with Arab. qrs], and translates it "whale," a huge sea-monster; but this is quite arbitrary, for &#1511;&#1512;&#1509; does not correspond to the Arabic qrs], and the whale or shark does not afford any figure that would be suitable for the context: e.g., <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-21.htm">Jeremiah 46:21</a>, "her mercenaries also flee," shows that the subject treated of is not the devouring or destruction, but the expulsion of the Egyptians out of their land; this is put as an addition to what is said about exile in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-19.htm">Jeremiah 46:19</a>. Still less suitable is the general rendering excidium, destruction (Rabbins, Gesenius, Umbreit); and there is no lexical foundation for the Vulgate translation stimulator, nor for "taskmaster," the rendering of J. D. Michaelis and Rosenmller. The old translators have only made guesses from the context. The figure of the gadfly corresponds to the bee in the land of Assyria, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-18.htm">Isaiah 7:18</a>. The repetition of &#1489;&#1468;&#1488; gives emphasis, and points either to the certainty of the coming, or its continuance.</body></html>
