The former gives the rendering “Why did Apis flee from thee, and thy chosen calf abode not” as if referring to the bull Apis as the representative of Osiris, the chief deity of Egypt; and this version receives some support from the use of the Hebrew words for “oxen,” “bulls,” “beasts,” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-7.htm" title="And the unicorns shall come down with them, and the bullocks with the bulls; and their land shall be soaked with blood, and their dust made fat with fatness.">Isaiah 34:7</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-12.htm" title="Many bulls have compassed me: strong bulls of Bashan have beset me round.">Psalm 22:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-30.htm" title="Rebuke the company of spearmen, the multitude of the bulls, with the calves of the people, till every one submit himself with pieces of silver: scatter you the people that delight in war.">Psalm 68:30</a>, and from the fact that the same word is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-24.htm" title="Therefore said the LORD, the LORD of hosts, the mighty One of Israel, Ah, I will ease me of my adversaries, and avenge me of my enemies:">Isaiah 1:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-26.htm" title="And I will feed them that oppress you with their own flesh; and they shall be drunken with their own blood, as with sweet wine: and all flesh shall know that I the LORD am your Savior and your Redeemer, the mighty One of Jacob.">Isaiah 49:26</a> as a Divine name “the mighty one of Israel.” So understood, the prophet’s words contemplate the triumph of the God of Israel over the theriomorphic deity of Egypt. We may find a literal fulfilment of the words in the slaughter of the sacred bull by Cambyses (Herod. iii. 29).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/46.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>46:13-28 Those who encroached on others, shall now be themselves encroached on.

The contrast thus is between the palpable impotence of the idol and the might attributed to it by the worshippers. The Hebrew term, "strong," or "valiant," is applied to bulls (Ps 22:12). Cambyses in his invasion of Egypt destroyed the sacred bull.<p>drive them&#8212;(Compare Jer 46:5).

The Septuagint renders it, <p>"why does Apis flee from thee? thy choice ox does not continue.'' <p>Which was the god of the Egyptians, they worshipped in the form of an ox; this could not protect them, though thought by them to be very mighty and powerful; so Aelianus (i) says Apis with the Egyptians is believed to be a most powerful deity; yet could not save them; but the word signifies their nobles, their mighty men of war, their generals and officers, at least their valiant soldiers; who yet were not able to stand the tide of power that came against them. The reason was, <p>because the Lord did drive them; by means of the Chaldeans; he dispirited them; he put them into a panic, and they fled from their posts; there is no standing against the Lord. <p>(i) De Animal. l. 11. c. 10. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/46.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Why are thy valiant men swept away? they stood not, because the LORD did drive them.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/46.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">15</span>. <span class="ital">Why … swept away</span>?] The mg. is to be preferred. The adjective in the Hebrew is plural, while both the verb connected with it and the pronouns that follow are in the singular. Hence we conclude that the singular is right. But probably we should, with LXX, divide the Hebrew verb rendered “swept away” into two words, translating with them, “Why is Apis fled? Thy mighty one stood not, because, etc.” The sacred bull Apis worshipped at Memphis is called <span class="ital">the mighty one</span> (the word in MT. being often used of bulls), i.e. the deity of Egypt, ‘just as Jehovah is named the Mighty One of Jacob or of Israel in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-24.htm" title="But his bow stayed in strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob; (from there is the shepherd, the stone of Israel:)">Genesis 49:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-24.htm" title="Therefore said the LORD, the LORD of hosts, the mighty One of Israel, Ah, I will ease me of my adversaries, and avenge me of my enemies:">Isaiah 1:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-26.htm" title="And I will feed them that oppress you with their own flesh; and they shall be drunken with their own blood, as with sweet wine: and all flesh shall know that I the LORD am your Savior and your Redeemer, the mighty One of Jacob.">Isaiah 49:26</a>, etc. “The authority of the Egyptian-Jewish version in a prophecy relative to Egypt is not slight” (Cheyne, <span class="ital">ad loc</span>.). A failure to understand this application of the word may have early induced a Hebrew copyist to alter it to the plural (which was effected by the insertion of the smallest Hebrew letter). For the thought of the Egyptian gods as overthrown before the Eastern power cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-1.htm" title="The burden of Egypt. Behold, the LORD rides on a swift cloud, and shall come into Egypt: and the idols of Egypt shall be moved at his presence, and the heart of Egypt shall melt in the middle of it.">Isaiah 19:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/46-1.htm" title="Bel bows down, Nebo stoops, their idols were on the beasts, and on the cattle: your carriages were heavy laden; they are a burden to the weary beast.">Isaiah 46:1</a> f.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">drive them</span>] rather, as mg. <span class="ital">thrust them down</span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/46.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Why are thy valiant men,</span> etc.? The literal rendering of the received text is, <span class="accented">Why is thy strong ones</span> (plural) <span class="accented">swept sway</span> (or, <span class="accented">ca</span>s<span class="accented">t down</span>)<span class="accented">? He stood not, because Jehovah thrust him!</span> It is true that the first half of the verse might, consistently with grammar, be rendered, "Why are thy strong ones swept away?" But the following singulars prove that the subject of the verb in the first verse half must itself be a singular. We must, therefore, follow the reading of the Septuagint, Vulgate, Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion, and many of the extant Hebrew manuscripts, and change the plural "strong ones" into the singular  "strong one." The word so rendered is elsewhere in Jeremiah one used (in the plural) of strong horses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-16.htm">Jeremiah 8:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/47-3.htm">Jeremiah 47:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-11.htm">Jeremiah 1:11</a>); but there is no necessity to bind ourselves to this acceptation. Other possible meanings are <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> strong man, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-22.htm">Judges 5:22</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/1-15.htm">Lamentations 1:15</a>; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> steer, bull, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-13.htm">Psalm 22:13</a> and Psalm 50:13, and (metaphorically of princes) Psalm 68:31. It is a tenable view that "thy strong one" is to be understood distributively as equivalent to "every strong one of thine." But it is certainly more plausible to regard the phrase as a synonym for Apis, the sacred bull in which the supreme god Osiris was believed by the Egyptians to be incarnate. This was a superstition (strange, no doubt, but not so ignoble as some have thought) as deeply ingrained in the Egyptian mind as any in their complicated religion. "In fact, they believed that the supreme God was with them when they possessed a bull bearing certain hieratic marks, the signs of the incarnation of the divinity" (Pierrot). His death was the signal for a mourning as general as for a Pharaoh, and the funeral ceremonies (accounts of which are given in the inscriptions) were equally splendid. M. Mariette has discovered, in the neighbourhood of Memphis, a necropolis in which the Apis bulls were successively interred from the eighteenth dynasty to the close of the period of the Ptolemies. For the Apis to be "swept away" like ordinary plunder, or "cast down" in the slaughtering trough (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-7.htm">Isaiah 34:7</a>), was indeed a token that the glory of Egypt had departed. It is a singular coincidence that the very word here employed by Jeremiah for "bull" (abbir) was adopted (like many other words) into the Egyptian language - it received the slightly modified form <span class="accented">aber</span>. The Septuagint, it should be added, is in favour of the general view of the verse thus obtained, and the authority of the <span class="accented">Egyptian-Jewish</span> version in a prophecy relative to Egypt is not slight. Its rendering of the first half is, "Why hath Apis, thy chosen calf, fled?" But the probability is that it read the Hebrew differently, "Why hath Khaph (  =   Apis), thy chosen one, fled?" This merely involves grouping some letters otherwise, and reading one word a little differently. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/46.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>brings the answer to the question of astonishment: "Egypt approaches, its hosts cover the land like the waves of the Nile, to destroy cities and men."
