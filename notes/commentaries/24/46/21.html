The mercenaries of Egypt - Nubians, Moors, and Lydians <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-9.htm">Jeremiah 46:9</a> - were destroyed at the battle of Carchemish, and their place was taken by hirelings from Asia Minor, Carians, and Ionians, whom Hophra took into his pay to the number of 30,000 men. These he settled in the midst of Egypt, in the fertile lands above Bubastis, in the Delta, where, well paid and fed and with great privileges, they became as calves of the stall. Their mutiny cost Hophra his crown.<p>For they also are turned back ... - literally, "for they also have lurched the back, they flee together, they stand not: for the day of their destruction is come upon them, the time of their visitations." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/46.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21.

The same image, "heifer &#8230; bullocks" (Jer 46:20, 21), is applied to Egypt's foreign mercenaries, as to herself. Pampered with the luxuries of Egypt, they become as enervated for battle as the natives themselves.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/46.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Also her hired men are in the midst of her like fatted bullocks; </span> the mercenary soldiers also, which the Egyptians have hired from Cush and Phut, and other parts, are at present in a flourishing, prosperous state. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">For they also are turned back, and are fled away together; they did not stand:</span> we have translated yk here <span class="ital">ill</span>, it had been better translated <span class="ital">but</span>, for that is manifestly the sense.

The reference is to the Ionian and Carian soldiers, who (Herod. II. 163) numbered 30,000, and lived on the Pelusiac branch of the Nile in a fertile district. Hence they seem to have earned the description given of them here, and were useless in war (Herod. II. 152 ff.).

On the other hand, the description will exactly apply to the Caftans and Ionians in the service of Psammetichus and Apries (Herod., 2:152, 163), who were "for many years" settled "a little below the city of Bubastis, on the Pelusiac mouth of the Nile."

This is shown by the question of astonishment, &#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506; &#1504;&#1505;&#1495;&#1507; &#1488;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1498;, which has been variously rendered. &#1488;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; .deredner ylsuoirav neeb sa, "strong ones," is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-16.htm">Jeremiah 8:16</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/47-3.htm">Jeremiah 47:3</a>, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-11.htm">Jeremiah 50:11</a>, of stallions, but elsewhere as an epithet of bulls, especially the strong bulls of Bashan; see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-16.htm">Jeremiah 8:16</a>. In the present passage the reference may be to the mighty men of war, who do not maintain their position (Chald. and most of the old interpreters); the verb in the singular forms no sufficient objection to this view, the irregularity being due to the fact that the verb precedes its subject see Ewald, 316, t; Gesenius, 147]. It is more difficult to combine with this the singulars of the verbs &#1506;&#1502;&#1491; and &#1492;&#1491;&#1508;&#1493; which follow; these, and especially the suffix in the singular, appear to indicate that &#1488;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491;&#1497;&#1498; really refers to a noun in the singular. But the form of this noun seems against such a view; for the words adduced in support of the position that singular nouns sometimes assume plural suffixes, are insufficient for the purpose: thus, &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497;&#1498;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/9-15.htm">Psalm 9:15</a>, and &#1513;&#1474;&#1504;&#1488;&#1514;&#1497;&#1498;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-11.htm">Ezekiel 35:11</a>, are plainly nouns in the singular. And in support of the averment that, in pausal forms with Segol, the &#1497; is a mere mater lectionis, only &#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1498;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-1.htm">Proverbs 6:1</a>, can be adduced: the other instances brought forward by Hitzig fail to establish his position. For &#1488;&#1497;&#1489;&#1497;&#1498;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-48.htm">Deuteronomy 28:48</a>, may be plural; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/16-5.htm">Genesis 16:5</a>, is far from being a case in point, for the preposition often takes plural suffixes; and even in the case of &#1495;&#1505;&#1497;&#1491;&#1497;&#1498;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a>, the &#1497; is marked in the Qeri as superfluous; most codices, too, rather give the form &#1495;&#1505;&#1497;&#1491;&#1498;. But even in the verse now before us, many codices, according to Kennicott and de Rossi, read &#1488;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;&#1498;, so that the word should perhaps be taken as a singular. The singulars, however, which occur in the following clauses do not form conclusive proofs of this, since they may be taken in a distributive sense; and more generally the address often suddenly changes from the plural to the singular. In connection with the possibility of taking &#1488;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1498; as a singular, the paraphrase of the lxx deserves mention and consideration, &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;, to which a gloss adds &#x3bf;&#788; But we cannot agree with Kennicott, J. D. Michaelis, Ewald, Hitzig, Graf, and N&#x3b4;gelsbach, in holding this as certainly the correct rendering; nor can we give to &#1488;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512; the sense of "bull," for this meaning is not made out for the singular simply because the plural is used of strong bulls: this holds especially in Jeremiah, who constantly applies the plural to strong steeds. Still less ground is there for appealing to the fact that Jahveh is repeatedly called &#1488;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512; &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1488;&#1500; or &#1488;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512; &#1497;&#1506;&#1511;&#1493;&#1489;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/49-24.htm">Genesis 49:24</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-24.htm">Isaiah 1:24</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/39-1.htm">Isaiah 39:1-8</a> :26 etc.; for this epithet of Jahveh (who shows Himself in or towards Israel as the Mighty One) cannot be applied to the helpless images of Apis. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/68-31.htm">Psalm 68:31</a>, &#1488;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; means "strong ones" - bulls as emblems of kings. If the word be used here with such a reference, it may be singular or plural. In the former case it would mean the king; in the latter, the king with his princes and magnates. Against the application of the word to the images of Apis, there is the fact that Apis, a symbol of Osiris, was neither the only nor the chief god of Egypt, but was worshipped nowhere except in Memphis (Herodotus, ii. 153); hence it was not suited to be the representative of the gods or the power of Egypt, as the context of the present passage requires.</body></html>
