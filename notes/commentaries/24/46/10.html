In doing so he falls back upon the language of earlier prophets (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-8.htm" title="For it is the day of the LORD's vengeance, and the year of recompenses for the controversy of Zion.">Isaiah 34:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-7.htm" title="Hold your peace at the presence of the Lord GOD: for the day of the LORD is at hand: for the LORD has prepared a sacrifice, he has bid his guests.">Zephaniah 1:7</a>), in part also upon that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-42.htm" title="I will make my arrows drunk with blood, and my sword shall devour flesh; and that with the blood of the slain and of the captives, from the beginning of revenges on the enemy.">Deuteronomy 32:42</a>.

The prophecy begins with Egypt. Let them strengthen themselves with all the art and interest they have, yet it shall be all in vain. The wounds God inflicts on his enemies, cannot be healed by medicines.

Or, "but this is the day" (y), &amp;c. notwithstanding this great apparatus for war, and those many auxiliaries the Egyptians would have, yet it would not be their day, in which they should get the better of their enemies; but the Lord's day; the day he had appointed; who is the Lord God of all armies, above and below; and who would bring his own armies together when he pleased, and give them victory: <p>a day of vengeance, that he may avenge him of his enemies: the enemies of his people, as the Targum; the Egyptians, who had been of old the implacable enemies of his people Israel; though now, contrary to his will, they too much trusted to them, and relied on them; according to Kimchi, this vengeance was taken on them for killing Josiah: <p>and the sword shall devour, and it shall be satiate and made drunk with their blood; that is, the sword of the Chaldeans shall destroy the Egyptians in such vast numbers, that there shall be no more to be slain; or there shall be no desire in the enemy to slay any more; they shall be glutted with their blood. All the phrases are designed to show the carnage that should be made; the vast destruction of the people; the large numbers that should be slain: <p>for the Lord God of hosts hath a sacrifice in the north country by the river Euphrates; near Carchemish, situated by the river Euphrates, which lay north of Egypt; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-6.htm">Jeremiah 46:6</a>. Here is an allusion to the sacrifices of great persons, which are many; the Lord of hosts had a sacrifice, or a great slaughter of men, his enemies; inflicted punishment on them, wherein his power, justice, and holiness, were displayed; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-6.htm">Isaiah 34:6</a>. <p>(y)  "dies autem", V.

The expression of fierce vengeance, adduced by Schwally and others (see introd. notes) as an argument for rejecting the passage, is not unnatural, when we consider that the death of Josiah and captivity of Jehoahaz (cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-10.htm" title="Weep you not for the dead, neither bemoan him: but weep sore for him that goes away: for he shall return no more, nor see his native country.">Jeremiah 22:10</a>) were still fresh in memory.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/46.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The contrast.</span> <span class="accented">And yet that day is</span> (<span class="accented">the day</span>) <span class="accented">of the Lord, Jehovah Sabdoth</span> (the rendering of the Authorized Version, <span class="cmt_word">For this is the day,</span> etc., is clearly a mistake). The "day of Jehovah" is an expression so familiar to us that we are in danger of losing a part of its sublime meaning. It is, in brief, "that crisis in the history of the world when Jehovah will interpose to rectify the evils of the present, bringing joy and glory to the humble believer, and misery and shame to the proud and disobedient .... This great crisis is called a day, in antithesis to the ages of the Divine long suffering: it is <span class="accented">Jehovah's</span> day, because, without a special Divine interposition, there would be no issue out of the perplexities and miseries of human life." We may say, with equal truth, that there are many "days of the Lord," and that there is only one. Every great revolution is a fresh stage in the great judgment day; "<span class="accented">die Weltgesehichte ist das Weltgericht"</span> (Schiller). The <span class="accented">loci classici</span> for the expression in the prophets are <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-18.htm">Amos 5:18, 20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-7.htm">Zephaniah 1:7, 14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-1.htm">Joel 2:1, 11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-12.htm">Isaiah 2:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-6.htm">Isaiah 13:6, 9</a> (in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-12.htm">Isaiah 2:12</a>, the phraseology closely resembles that of our passage - "for there is a day unto Jehovah Sabaoth;" Jehovah, that is, hath it in readiness in the supersensible world, where there is no time, and where all God's purposes have an ideal, but no less real existence. We might, in fact, render our passage, "but that day (is the day that belongeth) unto the Lord," etc.). The Lord here, as generally elsewhere, is that expressive form which intimates the universal lordship of the God who has revealed himself to Israel. <span class="cmt_word">The sword.</span> A comparison with <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-6.htm">Isaiah 34:6</a> suggests that it is "the sword of the Lord" which is meant - a symbolic phrase for the Divine vengeance, which meets us again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-12.htm">Jeremiah 12:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/47-6.htm">Jeremiah 47:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-41.htm">Deuteronomy 32:41, 42</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/7-20.htm">Judges 7:20</a> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/5-13.htm">Joshua 5:13</a>); <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/27-1.htm">Isaiah 27:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/31-8.htm">Isaiah 31:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-5.htm">Isaiah 34:5, 6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-16.htm">Isaiah 66:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/13-7.htm">Zechariah 13:7</a>. If Jehovah can be spoken of as having an Arm, a Hand, and a Bow, why not also as having a sword? Both expressions represent the self-revealing side of the Divine nature, and are not merely poetical ornaments, but correspond to awful objective realities. Divine  vengeance exists, and must exercise itself on all who oppose the Divine will. <span class="cmt_word">Hath a sacrifice.</span> The same figurative expression occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-6.htm">Isaiah 34:6</a>, and, developed at considerable length, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/39-17.htm">Ezekiel 39:17-20</a>, where the slaughtered foes are described as fatted beasts, rams, lambs, he-goats, bullocks - animals employed in the Jewish sacrifices. This, then, is the purpose for which this immense host "rolls up from Africa" - it is that it may fall by the Euphrates, at once as a proof of God's justice, and as a warning to transgressors. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/46.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"Prepare shield and target, and advance to the battle. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-4.htm">Jeremiah 46:4</a>.

The nations have heard of thine ignominy, and thy cry hath filled the earth: for heroes stumble against heroes, both of them fall together."<p>This address falls into two strophes, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-3.htm">Jeremiah 46:3-6</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-7.htm">Jeremiah 46:7-12</a>. In both are depicted in a lively manner, first the advance of the Egyptian host to the battle, then their flight and destruction. The whole has been arranged so as to form a climax: in the first strophe, the admirable equipment of the armies, and their sudden flight and defeat, are set forth in brief sentences; in the second, there is fully described not merely the powerful advance of the host that covers the earth, but also the judgment of inevitable destruction passed on them by God: the reason for the whole is also assigned. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-3.htm">Jeremiah 46:3</a>. In order to represent the matter in a lively way, the description begins with the call addressed to the army, to make ready for the battle. "Make ready shield and target," the two main pieces of defensive armour. &#1502;&#1490;&#1503; was the small [round] shield; &#1510;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;, scutum, the large shield, covering the whole body. "Advance to the fight," i.e., go forward into the battle. Then the address turns to the several portions of the army: first to those who fight from chariots, who are to yoke the horses; then to the horsemen, to mount the steeds. &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; are not horsemen, but riding-horses, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-6.htm">1 Kings 5:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-26.htm">1 Kings 10:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-14.htm">Ezekiel 27:14</a>. &#1506;&#1500;&#1492; is construed with the accus., as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-4.htm">Genesis 49:4</a>. The rendering given by Dahler and Umbreit, "Mount, ye horsemen," and that of Hitzig, "Advance, ye horsemen," are against the parallelism; and the remark of the last-named writer, that "Mount the steeds" would be &#1512;&#1499;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;, does not accord with <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-17.htm">1 Samuel 30:17</a>. Next, the address is directed to the foot-soldiers, who formed the main portion of the army. These are to take up their position with helmets on, to polish the spears, i.e., to sharpen them, and to put on the pieces of armour, in order to be arrayed for battle. &#1502;&#1512;&#1511;, to rub, polish, remove rust from the spear, and thereby sharpen it. &#1505;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503;, here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-3.htm">Jeremiah 51:3</a> for &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503;, a coat of mail, pieces of armour. </body></html>
