He was the deity invisible and unfathomable, whose name signifies "the concealed." No-Amon, is the sacred city of Thebes, the capital of Upper Egypt. First then Yahweh's anger falls upon the representatives of the highest divine and human powers, Amon of No and Pharaoh. It next punishes Egypt generally, and her gods and her kings, for each city had its special divinity, and inferior rulers were placed in the several parts of the country. Finally, Pharaoh is again mentioned, with "all who trust in him," i. e., the Jews, who had made Egypt their confidence and not God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/46.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>25. multitude&#8212;Hebrew, "Amon" (Na 3:8, Margin, "No-Ammon"), the same as Thebes or Diospolis in Upper Egypt, where Jupiter Ammon had his famous temple. In English Version, "multitude" answers to "populous No" (Na 3:8; Eze 30:15). The reference to "their gods" which follows, makes the translation more likely, "Ammon of No," that is, No and her idol Ammon; so the Chaldee Version.

These titles are often given to the Lord, and set before prophecies that come from him; and, according to Kimchi, the reason why he is here spoken of as the God of Israel was, because the vengeance threatened to the Egyptians should come upon them, as a punishment for using Israel ill; as Shishak king of Egypt, and Pharaohnecho, who slew Josiah: <p>behold, I will punish the multitude of No; the inhabitants of it, which were many, called "populous No", <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/3-8.htm">Nahum 3:8</a>; a famous city in Egypt. Some take it to be Diospolis or Thebes; and others (p) the same that is now called Alexandria; and so the Targum renders it; and which is followed by the Vulgate Latin version: and Jarchi calls it the seignory or government of Alexandria; and takes Amon, the word for "multitude", to signify the prince of this place; and so Kimchi and Ben Melech interpret it, king of a city called No: rather Jupiter Ammon (q) is meant, an idol of the Egyptians, which had a temple in Thebes, and was worshipped in it; and who had his name from Ham, the son of Noah. Hillerus (r), by various arguments, endeavours to prove that No is the same city with Memphis, and that No Amon signifies "the habitation of the nourished"; that is, of Apis, which was nourished here. But be he who he will, or the place what it will, he or that would certainly be punished; <p>and Pharaoh, and Egypt, with their gods, and their kings; Pharaoh, the present king of Egypt, who was Pharaohhophra, and all the land of Egypt; and all their numerous idols, which were many indeed; and the several governors of the nomes or provinces into which the land was distributed; these should be punished, and suffer in the general calamity; <p>even Pharaoh, and all them that trust in him; the Jews that dwelt in Egypt, and who thought themselves safe under his protection; such who went along with Johanan thither, contrary to the will of God; these should not escape punishment, but be involved in the same destruction. <p>(p) R.

"There they cry, 'Pharaoh the king of Egypt is &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1493;&#1503;, desolation, destruction, ruin:' " for this meaning, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-31.htm">Jeremiah 25:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-3.htm">Psalm 40:3</a>; the signification "noise, bustle," is unsuitable here.<p>(Note: The word &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; has been read by the lxx and the Vulgate as if it had been &#1513;&#1473;&#1501;, &#x3bf;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;, nomen; accordingly the lxx render, &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3bf;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; &#x3a6;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c9;&#768; &#x39d;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c9;&#768; &#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2; &#x391;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3a3;&#x3b1;&#x3c9;&#768;&#x3bd;  &#787;&#x395;&#x3c3;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#768;  &#787;&#x395;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3b4; (or  &#787;&#x395;&#x3c3;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x39c;&#x3c9;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3b4;e'd); Vulgate, vocate nomen Pharaonis regis Aegypti: Tumultum adduxit tempus. This reading is preferred by J. D. Michaelis, Ewald, Hitzig, and Graf, with this difference, that Hitzig and Graf take only &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1493;&#1503; as a name. Hence Ewald translates, "They call Pharaoh's name 'Noise-which-a-wink-can-hush.' " This rendering is decidedly false, for &#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491; nowhere has the sense of "wink, nod," not even in <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/20-38.htm">Judges 20:38</a>, where it means an agreement made. For the reading &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; instead of &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; there are no sufficient grounds, although such passages as <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-3.htm">Jeremiah 20:3</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-7.htm">Isaiah 30:7</a> may be adduced in support of the idea obtained by such a change in the word. The translation of the lxx is merely a reproduction of the Hebrew words by Greek letters, and shows that the translator did not know how to interpret them. The Vulgate rendering, tumultum adduxit tempus, is also devoid of meaning. Moreover, these translators have read &#1511;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; as the imperative &#1511;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;; if we reject this reading, as all moderns do, then we may also lay no weight on &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; instead of &#1513;&#1473;&#1501;. Besides, the meaning is not materially affected by this reading, for the giving of a name to a person merely expresses what he is or will be.)<p>The meaning of &#1492;&#1506;&#1489;&#1497;&#1512; &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491; also is disputed; it is quite inadmissible, however, to join the words with &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1493;&#1503;, as Ewald does, for the purpose of making out a name. No suitable meaning can be extracted from them. Neither &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1493;&#1503; nor &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491; can be the subject of &#1492;&#1506;&#1489;&#1497;&#1512;; the translation given by Schnurrer, "devastation that goes beyond all bounds," is still more arbitrary than that of Ewald given in the note. Since the Hiphil &#1492;&#1506;&#1489;&#1497;&#1512; is never used except with a transitive meaning, the subject can be none else than Pharaoh; and the words &#1492;&#1506;&#1489;&#1497;&#1512; &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491; must be intended to give the reason for this becoming a desolation: they are thus to be rendered, "he has allowed &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491; to pass by," not "the precise place," as Rosenmller explains it ("he did not stop in his flight at the place where the army could be gathered again, on the return"), but "the precise time." The reference, however, is not to the suitable time for action, for self-defence and for driving off the enemy (Grotius, C. B. Michaelis, Maurer, Umbreit), because the word does not mean suitable, convenient time, but appointed time. As Hitzig rightly perceived, the time meant is that within which the desolation might still be averted, and after which the judgment of God fell on him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-25.htm">Isaiah 10:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-18.htm">Isaiah 30:18</a>), - the time of grace which God had vouchsafed to him, so that Nebuchadnezzar did not at once, after the victory at Carchemish, invade and conquer Egypt. Pharaoh let this time pass by; because, instead of seeing in that defeat a judgment from God, he provoked the anger of Nebuchadnezzar by his repeated attacks on the Chaldean power, and brought on the invasion of Egypt by the king of Babylon (see above, p. 354). - In <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-18.htm">Jeremiah 46:18</a>. there is laid down a more positive foundation for the threat uttered in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-17.htm">Jeremiah 46:17</a>. With an oath, the Lord announces the coming of the destroyer into Egypt. Like Tabor, which overtops all the mountains round about, and like Carmel, which looks out over the sea as if it were a watch-tower, so will he come, viz., he from whom proceeds the devastation of Egypt, the king of Babylon. the power of Nebuchadnezzar, in respect of its overshadowing all other kings, forms the point of comparison. Tabor has the form of a truncated cone. Its height is given at 1805 feet above the level of the sea, or 1350 from the surface of the plain below; it far surpasses in height all the hills in the vicinity, ad affords a wide prospect on every side; cf. Robinson's Phys. Geogr. of Palestine, p. 26f. Carmel stretches out in the form of a long ridge more than three miles wide, till it terminates on the shore of the Mediterranean Sea, as a bold, lofty promontory, which rises in an imposing manner at least 500 feet above the sea; cf. Robinson, p. 26f. Then the inhabitants of Egypt will be driven into exile. &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497; &#1490;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492; .e, "vessels of wandering;" outfit for an exile, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-3.htm">Ezekiel 12:3</a>. "Daughter of Egypt" is not a personification of the country, whose inhabitants are the people, but of the population, which is viewed as the daughter of the country; it stands in apposition to &#1497;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1514;, like &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514; &#1489;&#1468;&#1514; &#1502;&#1510;&#1512;&#1497;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-11.htm">Jeremiah 46:11</a>. For Noph, i.e., Memphis, the capital, is laid waste and burned, so as to lose its inhabitants. With <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-20.htm">Jeremiah 46:20</a> begins the second strophe, in which the fate impending on Egypt is still more plainly predicted.</body></html>
