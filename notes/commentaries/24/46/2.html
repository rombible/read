He was the sixth king of the twenty-sixth dynasty of Manetho, and succeeded his father Psammetichus in B.C. 610, and reigned for sixteen years. Herodotus (ii. 158, 159) relates as his chief achievements that he anticipated the Suez Canal by endeavouring to connect the Nile with the Red Sea, but was stopped by an oracle, and sent a fleet of Phœnician ships to circumnavigate Africa. One hundred and twenty thousand lives were said to have been sacrificed in the former enterprise. On desisting from it, he turned his attention to other plans of conquest, defeated the Syrians at Magdolus, near Pelusium, and took Cadytis, a great city of Syria, which Herodotus describes as not much less than Sardis. By some writers this has been identified with the capture of Jerusalem in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-3.htm" title="And the king of Egypt put him down at Jerusalem, and condemned the land in an hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.">2Chronicles 36:3</a>, the name Cadytis being looked on as equivalent to <span class= "ital">Kadusha </span>(=the holy city),and so anticipating the modern Arabic name of <span class= "ital">El-Khuds. </span>Herodotus, however (iii. 5), describes it as being near the coast, and this has led to its being identified with Gaza, or Kedesh-Naphtali, or a Hittite city—Ketesh—on the Orontes, near which the great commercial and. military road turned off for Damascus and the Euphrates. In any case, it was in the course of this invasion, directed against the Babylonian Empire, then ruled by Nabopolassar, the father of Nebuchadnezzar, that he defeated and slew Josiah at Megiddo (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_chronicles/35-20.htm" title="After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Necho king of Egypt came up to fight against Charchemish by Euphrates: and Josiah went out against him.">2Chronicles 35:20-24</a>), deposed Jehoahaz, and appointed Jehoiakim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-4.htm" title="And the king of Egypt made Eliakim his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem, and turned his name to Jehoiakim. And Necho took Jehoahaz his brother, and carried him to Egypt.">2Chronicles 36:4</a>). By some writers, accordingly (R. S. Poole, in Smith’s <span class= "ital">Dict. Bible, </span>Art. <span class= "ital">Pharaoh-necho</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>Megiddo is identified with the Magdolus of Herodotus. His army advanced, and took the city of Carchemish, by some (Hitzig) identified with Circesium, an island formed by the confluence of the Chaboras and the Euphrates; by others (Rawlinson) with a Hittite city, now <span class= "ital">Jerablus, </span>a corruption of the Greek Hierapolis, much higher up the Euphrates. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-9.htm" title="Is not Calno as Carchemish? is not Hamath as Arpad? is not Samaria as Damascus?">Isaiah 10:9</a>). After the capture Necho appears to have returned to Egypt. Three years later (B.C. 606) Carchemish was taken by Nebuchadnezzar with the almost total defeat of Necho’s army, he himself having returned to Egypt, and it is this defeat of which Jeremiah now proceeds to speak as in a song of anticipated triumph at the downfall of the Egyptian oppressor.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/jeremiah/46.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-2.htm" title="Against Egypt, against the army of Pharaohnecho king of Egypt, which was by the river Euphrates in Carchemish, which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon smote in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah.">Jeremiah 46:2</a></span>. <span class="ital">Against Egypt, against the army of Pharaoh-necho — Pharaoh- necho </span>was king of Egypt in Josiah’s time, and it was by his army that Josiah was killed at Megiddo, as is related <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-29.htm" title="In his days Pharaohnechoh king of Egypt went up against the king of Assyria to the river Euphrates: and king Josiah went against him; and he slew him at Megiddo, when he had seen him.">2 Kings 23:29</a>, where see the note. That army was then marching under the conduct of Necho against the Medes and Babylonians, who, having by the capture of Nineveh destroyed the Assyrian empire, had become formidable to the neighbouring states. Josiah opposed it in its march through the country, but was defeated, and received a wound in the battle which proved mortal. Necho continued his march after this victory, defeated the Babylonians, took Carchemish, and securing it with a strong garrison, returned into his own country. Nabopolassar, the king of Babylon, observing that all Syria and Palestine had revolted on account of the reduction of Carchemish by the Egyptians, sent his son Nebuchadnezzar with an army to retake that city, and recover the revolted provinces. Necho marched with a powerful army to oppose him; and it appears it was at the time when the Egyptian army lay along the banks of the Euphrates, waiting to oppose the entrance of Nebuchadnezzar into Syria, that this prophecy was delivered, namely, as is here said, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim. The two armies came to an engagement near the city of Carchemish, and the event of the battle proved very disastrous to the Egyptians, who were routed with prodigious slaughter, as is here foretold by the prophet in a very animated style, and with great poetic energy and liveliness of colouring.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/46.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>46:1-12 The whole word of God is against those who obey not the gospel of Christ; but it is for those, even of the Gentiles, who turn to Him.

The prediction would mitigate the Jews' grief for Josiah, and show his death was not to be unavenged (2Ki 24:7).

This is the title of the first prophecy against Egypt; which is the first mentioned, because first accomplished; and because the Jews placed great confidence in and much relied on the Egyptians for help: <p>against the army of Pharaohnecho king of Egypt; who is by Herodotus (q) called Necos; he was the son and successor of Psammitichus, and was succeeded by his son Psammis; and he by Apries, the same with Pharaohhophra, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-30.htm">Jeremiah 44:30</a>; the Targum calls this king Pharaoh the lame: <p>which was by the river Euphrates in Carchemish; of which place See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-9.htm">Isaiah 10:9</a>; this being in the land of the king of Assyria, as appears from the same place. Pharaohnecho, in Josiah's time, came up against him, in order to take it from him; but whether he did or no is not certain; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-29.htm">2 Kings 23:29</a>; however, he appeared at the same place a second time, against the king of Babylon, into whose hands it was now very probably fallen, with the whole Assyrian monarchy; and here, in this second battle, his army was routed, as follows: <p>which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon smote in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah; when he took away from the king of Egypt all that belonged to him between the Nile and Euphrates, so that he came no more out of his land, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-7.htm">2 Kings 24:7</a>. Kimchi and Abarbinel think there was but one expedition of Pharaohnecho; and that the siege of Carchemish continued to the fourth year of Jehoiakim; when he met with an entire overthrow from the king of Babylon, which God suffered as a judgment on him for killing Josiah. This, according to Bishop Usher, was in the year of the world 3397, and before Christ 607; and, according to the Universal History, in the year of the world 3396, and before Christ 608. <p>(q) L. 2. sive Euterpe, c. 158. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/46.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Against Egypt, against the army of <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> Pharaohnecho king of Egypt, who was by the river Euphrates in Carchemish, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon smote in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah.</span><p>(b) Read 2Ki 23:29,24:7, 2Ch 35:20.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/46.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">2</span>. <span class="ital">Pharaoh-neco</span>] This monarch (b.c. 610–594) had defeated and slain Josiah at Megiddo (b.c. 608).

(Psammetichus), who had for a time revived the declining power of Egypt. Herodotus (2:158) credits him with being the first to construct a canal to the Red Sea, which seems an exaggeration (see Sir Gardner Wilkinson's note <span class="accented">ap.</span> Rawlinson), also (4:42) with having caused the circumnavigation of Africa, after which the Phoenician seamen brought back the startling news that they had had the sun upon their right hand. This energetic monarch noticed the decline of Assyria, and, at the battle of Megiddo (Herodotus, 2:159, wrongly says Magdolus or Migdol), reattached Judah to the Egyptian empire. Four years later, at the battle of Carchemish, he himself sustained a crushing defeat at the hands of the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-20.htm">2 Chronicles 35:20</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Carehemish</span>. This was the great emporium of Mesopotamia, Syria, and Palestine. Its true site was discovered by Mr. George Smith, in his last fatal journey, to be at Jerabis or Jirbas, on the right bank of the Euphrates. It was anciently a city of the Kheta (equivalent to Khittim, "Hittites"), but passed to the Assyrians, under Sargon, under whom it attained the highest commercial prosperity, especially after the overthrow of Tyre by Sennacherib. The "mana," or <span class="accented">mina</span>, "of Gargamis" is constantly referred to as a standard weight in the commercial cuneiform inscriptions. <span class="cmt_word">In the fourth year,</span> etc. Marcus Niebuhr wishes to put a stop before these words, so as to make them a definition of the date of the prophecy. He thinks the date of the battle of Carchemish was the third and not the fourth year of Jehoiakim. This view, however, is very uncertain (see Keil), and it is exegetieally very unnatural to detach the closing words of ver. 2 from those which precede. The obvious inference, moreover, from the prophecy (vers. 2-12) is that it was written at or about the time of the battle; a special date for the prophecy did not require to be given. Should Niebuhr's chronological combinations, however, turn out to be correct, the mistake would probably not be that of Jeremiah, nor of his scribe, but of his editor, who may easily have fallen into error in the mere minutiae of chronology. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/45.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"The word which Jeremiah the prophet spake to Baruch the son of Neriah, when he wrote these words in a book at the mouth of Jeremiah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, saying, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/45-2.htm">Jeremiah 45:2</a>. Thus saith Jahveh, the God of Israel, to thee, O Baruch: V. 3. Thou saidst, Woe to me now! for Jahveh hath added sorrow to my pain: I am weary with sighing, and no rest do I find. V. 4. Thus shalt thou say unto him, Thus saith Jahveh: Behold, what I have built I will destroy, and what I have planted I will pluck up, and that is the whole earth. V. 5. And thou seekest great things for thyself: seek them not: for, behold, I will bring evil on all flesh, saith Jahveh; but I will give thy life unto thee for booty in all places whither thou shalt go."<p>From the superscription in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/45-1.htm">Jeremiah 45:1</a>, it appears that this word of God came to Baruch through Jeremiah the prophet, in the fourth year of the reign of Jehoiakim, when Baruch was writing out, or had written out, in a book-roll the prophecies that had been uttered by Jeremiah up till that time. It is not necessarily implied in the infin. &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1514;&#1489;&#1493; that the word of God came during the transcription, while he was still engaged in writing: it may also mean, "when he was ready with the writing," had got done with it; and Hitzig is wrong when he rejects as "misleading" the view which Movers takes - "when he had written." The writing down of the addresses of Jeremiah in the year mentioned is related in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/36.htm">Jeremiah 36</a>; thus the substance of this chapter and that of <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/36.htm">Jeremiah 36</a> agree. "These words" can only be the addresses (words) of Jeremiah which Baruch was then writing down. From this, Hitzig, Graf, Ngelsbach, and others, infer that this small piece was the last in the copy of Jeremiah's prophecies originally prepared under Jehoiakim, - if not of the first one which was intended to be read in the temple, at least of the second copy which was made after the former one had been destroyed; and that it was only after the collection had been enlarged to the extent of the collection handed down to us, that this portion was affixed as an appendix to the end of the prophecies of Jeremiah which relate to his own country. But this inference is not a valid one. "These words" are the addresses of the prophet in general, which Baruch wrote down; and that only those which were uttered up to the fourth year of Jehoiakim are intended, is implied, not in the demonstrative "these," but in the date given afterwards, by which "these" is further specified. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/45-1.htm">Jeremiah 45:1</a> it is merely stated that at that time the word of God, given below, came to Jeremiah, and through Him to Baruch, but not that Baruch wrote down this also on that occasion, and appended it to the roll of Jeremiah's prophecies which had been prepared at his dictation. It may have been written down much later, possibly not till the whole of Jeremiah's prophecies were collected and arranged in Egypt. Moreover, the position occupied by this chapter in the collection shows that this message of comfort to Baruch was added as an appendix to those predictions of Jeremiah which concern Judah and Israel.<p>The occasion for this message of comfort addressed to the prophet's attendant is pointed out in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/45-3.htm">Jeremiah 45:3</a>, in the words which Baruch had uttered: "Woe to me! for Jahveh adds sorrow to my pain." Baruch felt "pain," i.e., pain of soul, at the moral corruption of the people, their impenitence and obduracy in sin and vice, just like the prophet himself, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-18.htm">Jeremiah 15:18</a>. To this pain God adds sorrow, by threatening the judgment which shall fall on Judah for sin, and which was even then beginning to break over the land; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-18.htm">Jeremiah 8:18</a>. Baruch sighs over this till he is wearied, and finds no rest; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/5-5.htm">Lamentations 5:5</a>. "I am weary with my sighing," is a reminiscence from <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/6-7.htm">Psalm 6:7</a>. This sorrow in addition to his pain was not caused in him for the first time by writing down the discourses of the prophet, but was rather thus freshened and increased. The answer of the Lord to this sighing is of a stern character, yet soothing for Baruch. The sentence of destruction has been determined on. What the Lord has built He will now destroy: it is not said why, since the reason was sufficiently known from the prophet's utterances. As to the expression in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/45-4.htm">Jeremiah 45:4</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-10.htm">Jeremiah 1:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-28.htm">Jeremiah 31:28</a>. The destruction regards the whole earth, &#1492;&#1497;&#1488;  &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509;, lit., "and as regards the whole earth, it is it," namely that I destroy. On the employment of &#1488;&#1514; in introducing the subject, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-13.htm">Daniel 9:13</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/haggai/2-5.htm">Haggai 2:5</a>, and Ewald, 277 d. &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; does not mean "the whole land," but "the whole earth:" this is indubitably evident from the parallel "upon all flesh," <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/45-5.htm">Jeremiah 45:5</a>, i.e., the whole of humanity, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-31.htm">Jeremiah 25:31</a>. The sentence is passed on all the earth, in accordance with the announcement made in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-15.htm">Jeremiah 25:15</a>. </body></html>
