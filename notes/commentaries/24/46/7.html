The prophet goes back, as an English poet might have done after the destruction of the Spanish Armada, to the time when all the strength of Egypt had been poured forth in the exultation of anticipated victory, as the great river of Egypt poured its waters. The word for “rivers,” though more general, has a like allusive reference, being used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-19.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses, Say to Aaron, Take your rod, and stretch out your hand on the waters of Egypt, on their streams, on their rivers, and on their ponds, and on all their pools of water, that they may become blood; and that there may be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood, and in vessels of stone.">Exodus 7:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-5.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses, Say to Aaron, Stretch forth your hand with your rod over the streams, over the rivers, and over the ponds, and cause frogs to come up on the land of Egypt.">Exodus 8:5</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-2.htm" title="Son of man, take up a lamentation for Pharaoh king of Egypt, and say to him, You are like a young lion of the nations, and you are as a whale in the seas: and you came forth with your rivers, and troubled the waters with your feet, and fouled their rivers.">Ezekiel 32:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-14.htm" title="Then will I make their waters deep, and cause their rivers to run like oil, said the Lord GOD.">Ezekiel 32:14</a> for the arms or canals of the Nile.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/jeremiah/46.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/46-7.htm" title="Who is this that comes up as a flood, whose waters are moved as the rivers?...">Jeremiah 46:7-10</a></span>. <span class="ital">Who is this that cometh up as a flood </span>— Here the king of Egypt is compared to a mighty river, the Nile, or the Euphrates, when it swells above its banks, and threatens to overwhelm the country with ruin and desolation. <span class="ital">And he saith I will go up, and will cover the earth </span>— With my numerous armies; <span class="ital">I will destroy the city </span>— Carchemish or Babylon; <span class="ital">and the inhabitants thereof — </span>Who shall not be able to withstand the powerful force I bring against them.

This chapter contains two prophecies regarding Egypt, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-2.htm">Jeremiah 46:2-12</a>, and vv. 13-28. &#1500;&#1502;&#1510;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; refers to both. After this there follows an account of the occasion for the first of these two prophecies, in the words, "Concerning the army of Pharaoh-Necho, the king of Egypt, which was at the river Euphrates, near Carchemish, which Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon smote in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah." &#1504;&#1499;&#1493;, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-20.htm">2 Chronicles 35:20</a>, or &#1504;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492;, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-29.htm">2 Kings 23:29</a>, in lxx &#x39d;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c9;&#769;; Egyptian, according to Brugsch (Hist. d'Egypte, i. p. 252), Nekaaou; in Herodotus &#x39d;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c2;, - is said by Manetho to have been the sixth king of the twenty-sixth (Sate) dynasty, the second Pharaoh of this name, the son of Psammetichus I, and grandson of Necho I. Brugsch says he reigned from 611 to 595 b.c. See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/23-29.htm">2 Chronicles 23:29</a>. The two relative clauses are co-ordinate, i.e., &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; in each case depends on &#1495;&#1497;&#1500;. The first clause merely states where Pharaoh's army was, the second tells what befall it at the Euphrates. It is to this that the following prophecy refers. Pharaoh-Necho, soon after ascending the throne, in the last year of Josiah's reign (610 b.c.), had landed in Palestine, at the bay of Acre, with the view of subjugating Hither Asia as far as the Euphrates, and had defeated the slain King Josiah, who marched out against him. He next deposed Jehoahaz, whom the people had raised to the throne as Josiah's successor, and carried him to Egypt, after having substituted Eliakim, the elder brother of Jehoahaz, and made him his vassal-king, under the name of Jehoiakim. When he had thus laid Judah under tribute, he advanced farther into Syria, towards the Euphrates, and had reached Carchemish on that river, as is stated in this verse: there his army was defeated by Nebuchadnezzar, in the fourth year of the reign of Jehoiakim (606 b.c.); see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-29.htm">2 Kings 23:29</a>. Carchemish is &#x39a;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, Circesium, or Cercusium of the classical writers,<p>(Note: See the opinion of Rawlinson in Smith's Bible Dictionary, vol. i. p. 278. - Tr.)<p>Arabic karqi equals si equals yat, a fortified city at the junction of the Chebar with the Euphrates, built on the peninsula formed by the two rivers (Ammian. Marc. xxiii. 5, Procop. bell. Pers. ii. 5, and Maras. under Karkesija). All that now remains of it are ruins, called by the modern Arabs Abu Psera, and situated on the Mesopotamian side of the Euphrates, where that river is joined by the Chebar (Ausland, 1864, S. 1058). This fortress was either taken, or at least besieged, by Necho. The statement, "in the fourth year of Jehoiakim," can be referred exegetically only to the time of the defeat of the Egyptians at Carchemish, or the year of the battle, and is actually so understood by most interpreters. No one but Niebuhr (Gesch. Ass. u. Babl. S. 59, 86, 370ff.) alters the date of the battle, which he places in the third year of Jehoiakim, partly from consideration of <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/1-1.htm">Daniel 1:1</a>, partly from other chronological calculations; he would refer the date given in our verse to the time when the following song was composed or published. But <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/1-1.htm">Daniel 1:1</a> does not necessarily require us to make any such assumption (see on that passage), and the other chronological computations are quite uncertain. Exegetically, it is as impossible to insert a period after "which Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon smote" (Nieb. p. 86, note 3), as to connect the date "in the fourth year of Jehoiakim" with "which word came to Jeremiah" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-10.htm">Jeremiah 46:10</a>). The title in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-1.htm">Jeremiah 46:1</a> certainly does not refer specially to the prophecy about Egypt, but to &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501;. But if we wished to make the whole of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-2.htm">Jeremiah 46:2</a> dependent on '&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1492;&#1497;&#1492; &#1491;&#1489;&#1512; , which would, at all events, be a forced, unnatural construction, then, from the combination of the title in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-1.htm">Jeremiah 46:1</a> with the specification of time at the end of <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-2.htm">Jeremiah 46:2</a>, it would follow that all the prophecies regarding the nations had come to Jeremiah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim, - which would contradict what is said in the heading to the oracle against Elam (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-34.htm">Jeremiah 49:34</a>), not to mention the oracle against Babylon.<p>Moreover, there is nothing to prevent us from assuming that the first prophecy against Egypt was revealed to Jeremiah, and uttered by him, in the same fourth year of Jehoiakim in which Necho was defeated by Nebuchadnezzar. In this way, the argument brought forward by Niebuhr in support of his forced interpretation, viz., that all specifications of time in the addresses of Jeremiah refer to the period of composition, loses all its force. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/45-1.htm">Jeremiah 45:1</a> also, and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-9.htm">Jeremiah 51:9</a>, the time when the event occurred coincides with the time when the utterance regarding it was pronounced. Although we assume this to hold in the case before us, yet it by no means follows that what succeeds, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-3.htm">Jeremiah 46:3-12</a>, is not a prophecy, but a song or lyric celebrating so important a battle, "the picture of an event that had already occurred," as Niebuhr, Ewald, and Hitzig assume. This neither follows from the statement in the title, "which Nebuchadnezzar in the fourth year of Jehoiakim smote," nor from the contents of the succeeding address. The superscription does not naturally belong to what Jeremiah has said or uttered, but must have been prefixed, for the first time, only when the address was committed to writing and inserted in the collection, and this not till after the battle had been fought; but it is evident that the address is to be viewed as substantially a prophecy (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-6.htm">Jeremiah 46:6</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-10.htm">Jeremiah 46:10</a>), although Jeremiah depicts, in the most lively and dramatic way, not merely the preparation of the mighty host, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-3.htm">Jeremiah 46:3</a>, and its formidable advance, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-7.htm">Jeremiah 46:7-9</a>, but also its flight and annihilation, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-5.htm">Jeremiah 46:5</a> and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-10.htm">Jeremiah 46:10-12</a>. </body></html>
