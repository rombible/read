Is it their wisdom to submit to the heavy iron yoke of a cruel tyrant, that they may secure their lives; and is it not much more our wisdom to submit to the pleasant and easy yoke of our Lord and Master, Jesus Christ, that we may secure our souls? It were well if sinners would be afraid of the destruction threatened against all who will not have Christ to reign over them. Why should they die the second death, infinitely worse than that by sword and famine, when they may submit and live? And those who encourage sinners to go on in sinful ways, will perish with them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/27.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Zedekiah was restless under the Babylonian yoke, and the false prophets found only too ready a hearing from him. He is addressed in the plural because his feelings were fully shared by the mass of the officers of state and by the people. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/27.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15. in my name&#8212;The devil often makes God's name the plea for lies (Mt 4:6; 7:22, 23; Jer 27:15-20, the test whereby to know false prophets).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/27.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> They make use of my name, and pretend to say what they say by commission from me, saith the Lord; but there is no such thing, I never gave them authority to speak any such things. And though possibly they do not design your ruin by these practices, for none can be thought to design their own ruin, yet that will be the end of it; for by this means your hearts are hardened against the revelations of my will, by which I shall be provoked to give you up to ruin; nor shall they escape, for they shall be ruined with you. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/27.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For I have not sent them, saith the Lord,....

The mention of dreams between the prophets and soothsayers on the one hand, and the enchanters and sorcerers on the other, strikes us as singular. It is, however, to be explained from the fact, that prophets and soothsayers often feigned dreams and dream-revelations (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-25.htm">Jeremiah 23:25</a>); and other persons, too, might have dreams, and could give them out as significant. Cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-8.htm">Jeremiah 29:8</a>, where dreams are expressly distinguished from the discourse of the prophets and soothsayers. Whether the reckoning of five kinds of heathen prophecy has anything to do with the naming of five kings (Hitz.), appears to us to be questionable; but it is certain that Jeremiah does not design to specify five different, i.e., distinct and separate, kinds of heathen divination. For there was in reality no such distinction. Heathen prophecy was closely allied with sorcery ad soothsaying; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-9.htm">Deuteronomy 18:9</a>., and Oehler on the Relation of Old Testament Prophecy to Heathen Divination (Tb. 1861). The enumeration of the multifarious means and methods for forecasting the future is designed to show the multitude of delusive schemes for supplying the lack of true and real divine inspiration. &#1499;&#1468;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1508;&#1497;&#1501;, equivalent to &#1502;&#1499;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1508;&#1497;&#1501; , the same which in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-10.htm">Deuteronomy 18:10</a> is used along with &#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1504;&#1503;. The explanation of the last-mentioned word is disputed. Some take it from &#1506;&#1504;&#1503;, cloud  equals  cloud-maker or storm-raiser; others from &#1506;&#1497;&#1503;, eye  equals  fascinator, the idea being that of bewitching with the evil eye; see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-26.htm">Leviticus 19:26</a>. The use of the word along with &#1502;&#1504;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473; &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1499;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1507;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-10.htm">Deuteronomy 18:10</a>, favours the latter rendering, whereas no passage in which the word is used in the Old Testament supports the sig. storm-raiser. "That I should remove you," as is shown by the continuation of the infinitive by &#1493;&#1492;&#1491;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;. The false prophets delude the people, inducing them to rise in rebellion against Nebuchadnezzar, contrary to God's will, and thus simply bringing about their expulsion from their land, i.e., removal into banishment. &#1500;&#1502;&#1506;&#1503; shows, as frequently, that the inevitable consequence of these persons' proceedings is designed by them. </body></html>
