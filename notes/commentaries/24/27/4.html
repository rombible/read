They, with their hosts of earth, were setting themselves against the Lord of the hosts alike of heaven and of earth.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/27.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>27:1-11 Jeremiah is to prepare a sign that all the neighbouring countries would be made subject to the king of Babylon. God asserts his right to dispose of kingdoms as he pleases. Whatever any have of the good things of this world, it is what God sees fit to give; we should therefore be content. The things of this world are not the best things, for the Lord often gives the largest share to bad men. Dominion is not founded in grace. Those who will not serve the God who made them, shall justly be made to serve their enemies that seek to ruin them. Jeremiah urges them to prevent their destruction, by submission. A meek spirit, by quiet submission to the hardest turns of providence, makes the best of what is bad. Many persons may escape destroying providences, by submitting to humbling providences. It is better to take up a light cross in our way, than to pull a heavier on our own heads. The poor in spirit, the meek and humble, enjoy comfort, and avoid many miseries to which the high-spirited are exposed. It must, in all cases, be our interest to obey God's will.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/27.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Come - Or, are come.

According to Pherecydes in Clement of Alexandria [Miscellanies, 567], Idanthura, king of the Scythians, intimated to Darius, who had crossed the Danube, that he would lead an army against him, by sending him, instead of a letter, a mouse, a frog, a bird, an arrow, and a plough. The task assigned to Jeremiah required great faith, as it was sure to provoke alike his own countrymen and the foreign ambassadors and their kings, by a seeming insult, at the very time that all were full of confident hopes grounded on the confederacy.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/27.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The Lord of hosts, </span> who hath therefore a power over all the creatures; who though he be in a special sense <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">the God of Israel, </span> yet his dominion is extended to your masters’ countries, as well as unto Israel. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/27.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And command them to say unto their masters,....

For this purpose, and not merely to show in how great peril Jeremiah then stood (Gr., N&#1492;g.), this history is introduced into our book. It is not stated that the occurrence took place at the beginning of Jehoiakim's reign, nor can we infer so much from its being placed directly after the events of that time. The time is not specified, because it was irrelevant for the case in hand. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-20.htm">Jeremiah 26:20</a>. A man, Urijah the son of Shemaiah - both unknown - from Kirjath-Jearim, now called Kuriyet el 'Enab, about three hours to the north-west of Jerusalem, on the frontiers of the tribe of Benjamin (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/9-17.htm">Joshua 9:17</a>), prophesied in the name of Jahveh against Jerusalem and Judah very much in the same terms as Jeremiah had done. When King Jehoiakim and his great men heard this, discourse, he sought after the prophet to kill him. Urijah, when he heard of it, fled to Egypt; but the king sent men after him, Elnathan the son of Achbor with some followers, and had him brought back thence, caused him to be put to death, and his body to be thrown into the graves of the common people. Hitz. takes objection to "all his mighty men," <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-21.htm">Jeremiah 26:21</a>, because it is not found in the lxx, and is nowhere else used by Jeremiah. But these facts do not prove that the words are not genuine; the latter of the two, indeed, tells rather in favour of their genuineness, since a glossator would not readily have interpolated an expression foreign to the rest of the book. The "mighty men" are the distinguished soldiers who were about the king, the military commanders, as the "princes" are the supreme civil authorities. Elnathan the son of Achbor, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-12.htm">Jeremiah 36:12</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-25.htm">Jeremiah 36:25</a>, one of Jehoiakim's princes, was a son of Achbor who is mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-12.htm">2 Kings 22:12-14</a> as amongst the princes of Josiah. Whether this Elnathan was the same as the Elnathan whose daughter Nehushta was Jehoiachin's mother (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-8.htm">2 Kings 24:8</a>), and who was therefore the king's father-in-law, must remain an undecided point, since the name Elnathan is of not unfrequent occurrence; of Levites, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/8-16.htm">Ezra 8:16</a>. &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1492;&#1506;&#1501; (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-19.htm">Jeremiah 17:19</a>) means the common people here, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-6.htm">2 Kings 22:6</a>. The place of burial for the common people was in the valley of the Kidron; see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-6.htm">2 Kings 22:6</a>. </body></html>
