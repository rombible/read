All shall be carried to Babylon. But he concludes with a gracious promise, that the time would come when they should be brought back. Though the return of the prosperity of the church does not come in our time, we must not despair, for it will come in God's time.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/27.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Zedekiah was restless under the Babylonian yoke, and the false prophets found only too ready a hearing from him.

Why will ye die, thou and thy people, by sword, famine, and pestilence, as Jahveh hath spoken concerning the people that will not serve the king of Babylon? <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-14.htm">Jeremiah 27:14</a>.

For I have not sent them, saith Jahveh, and they prophesy in my name falsely, that I might drive you out and ye might perish, ye and the prophets that prophesy unto you." - The discourse addressed to the king in the plural, "bring your necks," etc., is explained by the fact that, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-13.htm">Jeremiah 27:13</a> shows, in and along with the king of his people are addressed.
