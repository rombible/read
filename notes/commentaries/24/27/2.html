And he did so, walking naked and barefoot.">Isaiah 20:2</a>). We have to realise the infinitely more vivid impression which the appearance of the prophet in this strange guise, as though he were at once a captive slave and a beast of burden, would make on the minds of men, as compared with simply warning them of a coming subjugation. The principle on which the prophet acted was that of Horace (<span class= "ital">Ep. ad Pis. </span>180):—<p>“<span class= "ital">Segnius irritant animos demissa per aures,<p>Quam quæ sunt oculis subjecta fidelibus, et quæ<p>Ipse sibi tradit spectator.”</span><p>“Things that we hear less stir the inmost soul,<p>Than what the eye sees dramatised in act.”<p>So Agabus bound himself with Paul’s girdle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-11.htm" title="And when he was come to us, he took Paul's girdle, and bound his own hands and feet, and said, Thus said the Holy Ghost, So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man that ownes this girdle, and shall deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.">Acts 21:11</a>). So Ezekiel dug through the wall of his house and carried out his stuff (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/12-5.htm" title="Dig you through the wall in their sight, and carry out thereby.">Ezekiel 12:5-7</a>). We find from <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/28-10.htm" title="Then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke from off the prophet Jeremiah's neck, and broke it.">Jeremiah 28:10</a> that the prophet obeyed the command quite literally.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/jeremiah/27.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/27-2.htm" title="Thus said the LORD to me; Make you bonds and yokes, and put them on your neck,...">Jeremiah 27:2-3</a></span>. <span class="ital">Make thee bonds and yokes, </span>&c. — The prophets were frequently ordered to foreshow future events by actions as well as by words.

Ezekiel, in like manner, was ordered to prophesy by signs, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-1.htm" title="You also, son of man, take you a tile, and lay it before you, and portray on it the city, even Jerusalem:">Ezekiel 4:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-3.htm" title="Therefore, you son of man, prepare you stuff for removing, and remove by day in their sight; and you shall remove from your place to another place in their sight: it may be they will consider, though they be a rebellious house.">Ezekiel 12:3</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/24-17.htm" title="Forbear to cry, make no mourning for the dead, bind the tire of your head on you, and put on your shoes on your feet, and cover not your lips, and eat not the bread of men....">Ezekiel 24:17-19</a>. In making these yokes, putting them upon his neck, and fastening them on with bands, Jeremiah was intended to be a type both to his own people, and also to the people afterward mentioned, that they should be brought under subjection to the king of Babylon. <span class="ital">And send them to the king of Edom, </span>&c. — These nations were near to the Jews, and their princes had their ambassadors resident at Jerusalem.

God asserts his right to dispose of kingdoms as he pleases. Whatever any have of the good things of this world, it is what God sees fit to give; we should therefore be content. The things of this world are not the best things, for the Lord often gives the largest share to bad men. Dominion is not founded in grace. Those who will not serve the God who made them, shall justly be made to serve their enemies that seek to ruin them. Jeremiah urges them to prevent their destruction, by submission. A meek spirit, by quiet submission to the hardest turns of providence, makes the best of what is bad. Many persons may escape destroying providences, by submitting to humbling providences. It is better to take up a light cross in our way, than to pull a heavier on our own heads. The poor in spirit, the meek and humble, enjoy comfort, and avoid many miseries to which the high-spirited are exposed. It must, in all cases, be our interest to obey God's will.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/27.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Yokes - Two curved pieces of wood, the one put over the neck of the ox, the other under, and then fastened together by bonds or cords (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-3.htm">Psalm 2:3</a>).

For this purpose, and not merely to show in how great peril Jeremiah then stood (Gr., N&#1492;g.), this history is introduced into our book. It is not stated that the occurrence took place at the beginning of Jehoiakim's reign, nor can we infer so much from its being placed directly after the events of that time. The time is not specified, because it was irrelevant for the case in hand. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-20.htm">Jeremiah 26:20</a>. A man, Urijah the son of Shemaiah - both unknown - from Kirjath-Jearim, now called Kuriyet el 'Enab, about three hours to the north-west of Jerusalem, on the frontiers of the tribe of Benjamin (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/9-17.htm">Joshua 9:17</a>), prophesied in the name of Jahveh against Jerusalem and Judah very much in the same terms as Jeremiah had done. When King Jehoiakim and his great men heard this, discourse, he sought after the prophet to kill him. Urijah, when he heard of it, fled to Egypt; but the king sent men after him, Elnathan the son of Achbor with some followers, and had him brought back thence, caused him to be put to death, and his body to be thrown into the graves of the common people. Hitz. takes objection to "all his mighty men," <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-21.htm">Jeremiah 26:21</a>, because it is not found in the lxx, and is nowhere else used by Jeremiah. But these facts do not prove that the words are not genuine; the latter of the two, indeed, tells rather in favour of their genuineness, since a glossator would not readily have interpolated an expression foreign to the rest of the book. The "mighty men" are the distinguished soldiers who were about the king, the military commanders, as the "princes" are the supreme civil authorities. Elnathan the son of Achbor, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-12.htm">Jeremiah 36:12</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-25.htm">Jeremiah 36:25</a>, one of Jehoiakim's princes, was a son of Achbor who is mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-12.htm">2 Kings 22:12-14</a> as amongst the princes of Josiah. Whether this Elnathan was the same as the Elnathan whose daughter Nehushta was Jehoiachin's mother (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-8.htm">2 Kings 24:8</a>), and who was therefore the king's father-in-law, must remain an undecided point, since the name Elnathan is of not unfrequent occurrence; of Levites, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/8-16.htm">Ezra 8:16</a>. &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1492;&#1506;&#1501; (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-19.htm">Jeremiah 17:19</a>) means the common people here, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-6.htm">2 Kings 22:6</a>. The place of burial for the common people was in the valley of the Kidron; see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-6.htm">2 Kings 22:6</a>. </body></html>
