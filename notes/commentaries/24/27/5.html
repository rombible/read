The whole preface, which rises to a height of rhythmic loftiness not common in Jeremiah’s writings, asserts the truth that the Creator of the material world is also the ruler over the kingdoms of the earth. For a like utterance of the same thought, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/4-13.htm" title="For, see, he that forms the mountains, and creates the wind, and declares to man what is his thought, that makes the morning darkness, and treads on the high places of the earth, The LORD, The God of hosts, is his name.">Amos 4:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/9-6.htm" title="It is he that builds his stories in the heaven, and has founded his troop in the earth; he that calls for the waters of the sea, and pours them out on the face of the earth: The LORD is his name.">Amos 9:6</a>.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/27.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>27:1-11 Jeremiah is to prepare a sign that all the neighbouring countries would be made subject to the king of Babylon. God asserts his right to dispose of kingdoms as he pleases. Whatever any have of the good things of this world, it is what God sees fit to give; we should therefore be content. The things of this world are not the best things, for the Lord often gives the largest share to bad men. Dominion is not founded in grace. Those who will not serve the God who made them, shall justly be made to serve their enemies that seek to ruin them. Jeremiah urges them to prevent their destruction, by submission. A meek spirit, by quiet submission to the hardest turns of providence, makes the best of what is bad. Many persons may escape destroying providences, by submitting to humbling providences. It is better to take up a light cross in our way, than to pull a heavier on our own heads. The poor in spirit, the meek and humble, enjoy comfort, and avoid many miseries to which the high-spirited are exposed. It must, in all cases, be our interest to obey God's will.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/27.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Come - Or, are come.

God here, as elsewhere, connects with the symbol doctrine, which is as it were its soul, without which it would be not only cold and frivolous, but even dead [Calvin].

Therefore he can give any part of it to whomsoever he will. Therefore, Jeremiah being his trustworthy prophet, the kings are called upon to take notice that Jehovah has transferred their kingdoms to Nebuchadnezzar. Observe, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27.htm">Jeremiah 27-29</a>. the form employed is not "Nebuchadnezzar," but "Nebuchadnezzar" (so also <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-1.htm">Jeremiah 34:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-5.htm">Jeremiah 39:5</a>). (See on Jeremiah 21:7.) <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/26.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The prophet Urijah put to death. - While the history we have just been considering gives testimony to the hostility of the priests and false prophets towards the true prophets of the Lord, the story of the prophet Urijah shows the hostility of King Jehoiakim against the proclaimers of divine truth. For this purpose, and not merely to show in how great peril Jeremiah then stood (Gr., N&#1492;g.), this history is introduced into our book. It is not stated that the occurrence took place at the beginning of Jehoiakim's reign, nor can we infer so much from its being placed directly after the events of that time. The time is not specified, because it was irrelevant for the case in hand. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-20.htm">Jeremiah 26:20</a>. A man, Urijah the son of Shemaiah - both unknown - from Kirjath-Jearim, now called Kuriyet el 'Enab, about three hours to the north-west of Jerusalem, on the frontiers of the tribe of Benjamin (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/9-17.htm">Joshua 9:17</a>), prophesied in the name of Jahveh against Jerusalem and Judah very much in the same terms as Jeremiah had done. When King Jehoiakim and his great men heard this, discourse, he sought after the prophet to kill him. Urijah, when he heard of it, fled to Egypt; but the king sent men after him, Elnathan the son of Achbor with some followers, and had him brought back thence, caused him to be put to death, and his body to be thrown into the graves of the common people. Hitz. takes objection to "all his mighty men," <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-21.htm">Jeremiah 26:21</a>, because it is not found in the lxx, and is nowhere else used by Jeremiah. But these facts do not prove that the words are not genuine; the latter of the two, indeed, tells rather in favour of their genuineness, since a glossator would not readily have interpolated an expression foreign to the rest of the book. The "mighty men" are the distinguished soldiers who were about the king, the military commanders, as the "princes" are the supreme civil authorities. Elnathan the son of Achbor, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-12.htm">Jeremiah 36:12</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-25.htm">Jeremiah 36:25</a>, one of Jehoiakim's princes, was a son of Achbor who is mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-12.htm">2 Kings 22:12-14</a> as amongst the princes of Josiah. Whether this Elnathan was the same as the Elnathan whose daughter Nehushta was Jehoiachin's mother (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-8.htm">2 Kings 24:8</a>), and who was therefore the king's father-in-law, must remain an undecided point, since the name Elnathan is of not unfrequent occurrence; of Levites, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/8-16.htm">Ezra 8:16</a>. &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1492;&#1506;&#1501; (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-19.htm">Jeremiah 17:19</a>) means the common people here, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-6.htm">2 Kings 22:6</a>. The place of burial for the common people was in the valley of the Kidron; see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-6.htm">2 Kings 22:6</a>. </body></html>
