The vessels referred to are those which had been carried off by Nebuchadnezzar in his first invasion, and before the accession of Zedekiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-13.htm" title="And he carried out there all the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house, and cut in pieces all the vessels of gold which Solomon king of Israel had made in the temple of the LORD, as the LORD had said.">2Kings 24:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-7.htm" title="Nebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of the house of the LORD to Babylon, and put them in his temple at Babylon.">2Chronicles 36:7</a>). The people mourned over the absence of what they had so prized among the treasures of the Temple, and the prophets accordingly soothed them with predictions that they would before long be brought back. In marked contrast to these prophecies of their restoration “shortly,” we find them brought out for use at Belshazzar’s feast, towards the close of the Babylonian exile (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/1-2.htm" title="And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God: which he carried into the land of Shinar to the house of his god; and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god.">Daniel 1:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/5-2.htm" title="Belshazzar, whiles he tasted the wine, commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels which his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the temple which was in Jerusalem; that the king, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, might drink therein.">Daniel 5:2</a>), and restored to the Jews by Cyrus, after the capture of Babylon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/1-7.htm" title="Also Cyrus the king brought forth the vessels of the house of the LORD, which Nebuchadnezzar had brought forth out of Jerusalem, and had put them in the house of his gods;">Ezra 1:7</a>). In the apocryphal book of Baruch (1:8) we find a tradition that some of them (silver, not gold) were restored in the reign of Zedekiah, but this can hardly be regarded as historical. It is noticeable that the restoration is connected, in that narrative, with the agency of Baruch himself, and it is scarcely probable that he would have brought about a fulfilment of the prediction of the false prophets, who were his Master’s enemies.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/jeremiah/27.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/27-16.htm" title="Also I spoke to the priests and to all this people, saying, Thus said the LORD; Listen not to the words of your prophets that prophesy to you, saying, Behold, the vessels of the LORD's house shall now shortly be brought again from Babylon: for they prophesy a lie to you....">Jeremiah 27:16-18</a></span>. <span class="ital">Also I spake to the priests and to all this people </span>— The prophet, being God’s true servant, spared none, but gave faithful warning to all sorts of persons, to take heed of being deceived by the false prophets, who undertook to foretel that the vessels of the temple, carried away in the time of Jehoiakim and his son Jeconiah, (of which we read <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-7.htm" title="Nebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of the house of the LORD to Babylon, and put them in his temple at Babylon.">2 Chronicles 36:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-10.htm" title="And when the year was expired, king Nebuchadnezzar sent, and brought him to Babylon, with the goodly vessels of the house of the LORD, and made Zedekiah his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem.">2 Chronicles 36:10</a>,) should be brought back again to Jerusalem in a short time: see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/28-3.htm" title="Within two full years will I bring again into this place all the vessels of the LORD's house, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this place, and carried them to Babylon:">Jeremiah 28:3</a>. <span class="ital">Hearken not unto them </span>— Believe them not, but acquiesce in God’s providence with respect to you, and be content to be subject to the king of Babylon, that so your lives may be given you for a prey. <span class="ital">Wherefore should this city be laid waste? </span>— If you do not comply with God’s will in this instance, your city will certainly be destroyed, and why should you pull down such a judgment upon your own heads? <span class="ital">But if they be prophets, </span>&c. — If they be true prophets, and have any power with God, instead of foretelling the bringing back of the vessels carried away, let them apply to him in prayer to prevent the carrying away of the vessels that yet remain, whether in the house of the Lord, or in the king’s house, or in Jerusalem, which can be done no other way than by pleading with God to turn away his wrath, and not proceed in inflicting those sore judgments which he is most certainly bringing upon you.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/27.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>27:12-18 Jeremiah persuades the king of Judah to surrender to the king of Babylon. Is it their wisdom to submit to the heavy iron yoke of a cruel tyrant, that they may secure their lives; and is it not much more our wisdom to submit to the pleasant and easy yoke of our Lord and Master, Jesus Christ, that we may secure our souls? It were well if sinners would be afraid of the destruction threatened against all who will not have Christ to reign over them. Why should they die the second death, infinitely worse than that by sword and famine, when they may submit and live?

The same message is addressed to the priests and the people concerning the false prophets. More than half the contents of this part of the ch. are lacking in LXX, the main difference between them and MT. being that the latter includes the promise of the restoration of the sacred vessels to Jerusalem. Co. grants the LXX a <span class="ital">relative</span> originality, considering that the process of amplification is shewn in their Version in an earlier stage than that which is presented by the Hebrew.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 16-22.</span> - The warning to the priests and to the rest of the people. The last four verses of this section appear in a much shortened form in the Septuagint, and it must be admitted that the description is singularly lengthy. It is, therefore, quite conceivable that this is one of the cases in which the Hebrew text has been disfigured by willful interpolation. On the other hand, it is also possible that the description was filled out by an editor, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, by Baruch, conscientiously for the benefit of later readers. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The vessels of the Lord's house</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the golden vessels which Solomon had made, and which Nebuchadnezzar had taken away (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-48.htm">1 Kings 7:48-50</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-13.htm">2 Kings 24:13</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Now shortly</span>. These words are wanting in the Septuagint, and, considering that the Greek is also without the prediction in ver. 22, that the vessels of the temple and of the palace should be brought back in the day of visitation (which seems inconsistent with <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-17.htm">Jeremiah 52:17</a>), the question arises whether the words "now shortly" here are not due to a hasty copyist. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/27.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Therefore they must not hearken to their prophets, soothsayers, and sorcerers, that prophesy the contrary. The mention of dreams between the prophets and soothsayers on the one hand, and the enchanters and sorcerers on the other, strikes us as singular. It is, however, to be explained from the fact, that prophets and soothsayers often feigned dreams and dream-revelations (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-25.htm">Jeremiah 23:25</a>); and other persons, too, might have dreams, and could give them out as significant. Cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-8.htm">Jeremiah 29:8</a>, where dreams are expressly distinguished from the discourse of the prophets and soothsayers. Whether the reckoning of five kinds of heathen prophecy has anything to do with the naming of five kings (Hitz.), appears to us to be questionable; but it is certain that Jeremiah does not design to specify five different, i.e., distinct and separate, kinds of heathen divination. For there was in reality no such distinction. Heathen prophecy was closely allied with sorcery ad soothsaying; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-9.htm">Deuteronomy 18:9</a>., and Oehler on the Relation of Old Testament Prophecy to Heathen Divination (Tb. 1861). The enumeration of the multifarious means and methods for forecasting the future is designed to show the multitude of delusive schemes for supplying the lack of true and real divine inspiration. &#1499;&#1468;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1508;&#1497;&#1501;, equivalent to &#1502;&#1499;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1508;&#1497;&#1501; , the same which in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-10.htm">Deuteronomy 18:10</a> is used along with &#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1504;&#1503;. The explanation of the last-mentioned word is disputed. Some take it from &#1506;&#1504;&#1503;, cloud  equals  cloud-maker or storm-raiser; others from &#1506;&#1497;&#1503;, eye  equals  fascinator, the idea being that of bewitching with the evil eye; see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-26.htm">Leviticus 19:26</a>. The use of the word along with &#1502;&#1504;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473; &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1499;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1507;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-10.htm">Deuteronomy 18:10</a>, favours the latter rendering, whereas no passage in which the word is used in the Old Testament supports the sig. storm-raiser. "That I should remove you," as is shown by the continuation of the infinitive by &#1493;&#1492;&#1491;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;. The false prophets delude the people, inducing them to rise in rebellion against Nebuchadnezzar, contrary to God's will, and thus simply bringing about their expulsion from their land, i.e., removal into banishment. &#1500;&#1502;&#1506;&#1503; shows, as frequently, that the inevitable consequence of these persons' proceedings is designed by them. </body></html>
