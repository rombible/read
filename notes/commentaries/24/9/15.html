The word rendered <span class="ital">wormwood </span>here, it seems, had better be rendered <span class="ital">wolfsbane, </span>as signifying an herb which is not only bitter and nauseous, but also noxious. <span class="ital">And give them water of gall to drink </span>— Or <span class="ital">juice of hemlock, </span>as some read it; some other herb that is poisonous as well as distasteful. By these expressions is signified not only a scarcity of meat and drink, but the most grievous calamities. <span class="ital">I will scatter them also among the heathen </span>— They have been corrupted by their intimacy with heathen idolaters, with whom they mingled themselves, and whose works they learned, and now they shall lose themselves among those through whom they lost their virtue. <span class="ital">Whom neither they nor their fathers have known </span>— They set up gods to worship, which <span class="ital">they had not known, </span>strange gods, new gods, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-17.htm" title="They sacrificed to devils, not to God; to gods whom they knew not, to new gods that came newly up, whom your fathers feared not.">Deuteronomy 32:17</a>; and now God will scatter them among those people whom <span class="ital">they had not known, </span>those with whom they can claim no acquaintance, and from whom therefore they can expect no favour. The nations to the east, beyond the Euphrates and Tigris, seem to be chiefly meant here, whom the Jews knew little or nothing of before they were carried into captivity among them. And from that time to this the Jews have been scattered among those people. They are now also scattered through almost all the nations of the earth; so that this prophecy has received its full accomplishment in the most literal sense; for they have indeed been scattered among those whom neither they nor their fathers <span class="ital">had known. </span>And what deserves highly to be remarked is, that among none of these nations have they attained to any share of supreme power, but have always lived among them upon courtesy or sufferance. <span class="ital">And I will send a sword after them, </span>&c. — A judgment threatened by Moses in case of their disobedience, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-23.htm" title="And if you will not be reformed by me by these things, but will walk contrary to me;">Leviticus 26:23</a>, and fulfilled upon several of the Jewish captives in Egypt and elsewhere.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:12-22 In Zion the voice of joy and praise used to be heard, while the people kept close to God; but sin has altered the sound, it is now the voice of lamentation. Unhumbled hearts lament their calamity, but not their sin, which is the cause of it. Let the doors be shut ever so fast, death steals upon us. It enters the palaces of princes and great men, though stately, strongly built, and guarded. Nor are those more safe that are abroad; death cuts off even the children from without, and the young men from the streets. Hearken to the word of the Lord, and mourn with godly sorrow. This alone can bring true comfort; and it can turn the heaviest afflictions into precious mercies.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I will feed them ... - Rather, I am feeding them.

He calls himself "the Lord God of hosts", of armies above and below, in heaven and in earth, in opposition to Baalim, the idols of the Gentiles; which word signifies "lords"; which, though there be many who are called so, there is but one God, and one Lord, who is God over all, and "the God of Israel"; who had chosen them, and distinguished them by the blessings of his goodness; and yet they had forsaken him, and followed after other gods; by which the eyes of his glory were provoked, and he was determined to chastise them for it: <p>behold, I will feed them, even this people, with wormwood; that is, with straits or difficulties, as the Septuagint version; with bitter afflictions; such are not joyous, but grievous; which are irksome and disagreeable, as bitter things, and particularly wormwood, are to the taste. The Targum is, <p>"I will bring tribulation upon them, bitter as wormwood:'' <p>and give them water of gall to drink; meaning either of the entrails of a beast so called, or of the juice of the herb hemlock, as the word is rendered in <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/10-4.htm">Hosea 10:4</a>, as Kimchi; or of the poison of a serpent, as Jarchi; and so the Targum, <p>"and I will give them the cup of cursing to drink as the heads of serpents:'' <p>signifying that their punishment would be very severe, though just. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will feed them, <i>even</i> this people, with wormwood, and give them water of gall <span class="cverse3">{m}</span> to drink.</span><p>(m) Read Jer 8:14.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/9.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">15</span>.

The mountains and meadows of the steppes or prairies are made so desolate, that neither men nor beasts are to be found there. Mountains and meadows or pastures of the steppes, as contrasted with the cities (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-10.htm">Jeremiah 9:10</a>), represent the remoter parts of the country. &#1506;&#1500; is here not local: upon, but causal, concerning  equals  because of, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-24.htm">Jeremiah 4:24</a>., as is usual with (&#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488; &#1504;&#1492;&#1497; )&#1511;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492;; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-17.htm">2 Samuel 1:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-1.htm">Amos 5:1</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/26-17.htm">Ezekiel 26:17</a>, etc. &#1504;&#1510;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493;&#1468;, kindled, burnt up, usually of cities (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-15.htm">Jeremiah 2:15</a>), here of a tract of country with the sig. be parched by the glowing heat of the sun, as a result of the interruption of agriculture. &#1502;&#1491;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; is steppe, prairie, not suitable for tillage, but well fitted for pasturing cattle, as e.g., the wilderness of Judah; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-28.htm">1 Samuel 17:28</a>.

To "are fled," which is used most properly of birds, is added: are gone away, departed, in reference to the cattle.</body></html>
