But even the desert, without communion with God, through Christ Jesus, and the influences of the Holy Spirit, must be a place for temptation and evil; while, with these blessings, we may live in holiness in crowded cities. The people accustomed their tongues to lies. So false were they, that a brother could not be trusted. In trading and bargaining they said any thing for their own advantage, though they knew it to be false. But God marked their sin. Where no knowledge of God is, what good can be expected?

Because of the desolation of them; because no pasture upon them, nor flocks feeding there; or "concerning" them, as the Arabic version; or "upon" them (y), in order to cause the lamentation to be heard the further; but the former sense seems best, as appears by what follows. The Septuagint, Syriac, and Arabic versions, read it as an exhortation to others, "take up a weeping": but they are the words of the prophet, declaring what he would do. <p>And for the habitations of the wilderness a lamentation; for the cottages of the shepherds, erected for their convenience, to look after their flocks, feeding on the mountains, and in the valleys; for the wilderness does not denote barren places, but pastures: <p>because they are burnt up; by the fire of the Chaldeans, who burnt the cottages, and drove off the cattle: <p>so that none can pass through them; or there is none that passes through; as no inhabitant there, so no passenger that way; which shows how very desolate these places were: <p>neither can men hear the voice of the cattle; the lowing of the oxen, or the bleating of the sheep, there being none to be heard, being all carried off; and indeed no men to hear them, had there been any: <p>both the fowl of the heavens and the beasts are fled, they are gone; or, "from the fowl of the heavens to the beasts", &amp;c. (z), the places lying waste and uncultivated; there were no seed for the fowls to pick up, which generally frequent places where there is sowing, and where fruit is brought to perfection; and no pasture for the beasts to feed upon. Kimchi says these words are an hyperbole. The word  "beast", being by geometry, or numerically, fifty two, the Jews (a) gather from hence, that for the space of fifty two years no man passed through the land of Judah; which they reckon from the time that Zedekiah was carried captive, to the commandment of Cyrus. <p>(y)  "super montibus", Cocceius; "super montes", V.

Ew. has adopted this construction, and so translates: "have accustomed their tongue to speak lies, to do perversity, are weary of turning again; wrong upon wrong, deceit upon deceit, they are not willing to know me." But this text is not better, but worse, than the Masoretic: for, 1st, the perverse dealing or action is attributed to the tongue; 2nd, the thought, they are weary of turning again, does not suit the context, since the persons described here have never sought to return or repent, and so cannot have become weary of it. For these reasons, neither Hitz. nor Graf has given countenance to the lxx text.)<p>By reason of this depravity, the Lord must purge His people by sore judgments. He will melt it in the fire of affliction (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-10.htm">Isaiah 48:10</a>), to separate the wicked: cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-25.htm">Isaiah 1:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/13-9.htm">Zechariah 13:9</a>; and on &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1503;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-27.htm">Jeremiah 6:27</a>. For how should I do, deal? Not: what dreadful judgments shall I inflict (Hitz., Gr.), in which case the grounding &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; would not have its proper force; but: I can do none otherwise than purge. Before the face of, i.e., by reason of, the daughter, because the daughter of my people behaves herself as has been described in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-2.htm">Jeremiah 9:2-4</a>, and as is yet to be briefly repeated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-7.htm">Jeremiah 9:7</a>.

This is true to the sense, but it is unfair to argue from it, as Ew., Hitz., Gr. do, that &#1512;&#1506;&#1514; has been dropped out of the Hebrew text and should be restored. - In <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-7.htm">Jeremiah 9:7</a> what has been said is recapitulated shortly, and then in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-8.htm">Jeremiah 9:8</a> the necessity of the judgment is shown. &#1495;&#1509; &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1495;&#1496;, a slaying, slaughtering, i.e., murderous arrow. Instead of this Chet., which gives a good sense, the Keri gives &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1496;, which, judging from the Chald. translation, is probably to be translated sharpened. But there is no evidence for this sig., since &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1496; occurs only in connection with &#1494;&#1492;&#1489;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-16.htm">1 Kings 10:16</a>, and means beaten, lit., spread gold.
