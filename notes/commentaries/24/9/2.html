In some such shelter, far from the cities of Judah, the prophet, with a feeling like that of the Psalmist (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/55-6.htm" title="And I said, Oh that I had wings like a dove! for then would I fly away, and be at rest.">Psalm 55:6-8</a>) would fain find refuge from his treacherous enemies—“adulterers,” alike spiritually and literally (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-8.htm" title="They were as fed horses in the morning: every one neighed after his neighbor's wife.">Jeremiah 5:8</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/jeremiah/9.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-2.htm" title="Oh that I had in the wilderness a lodging place of wayfaring men; that I might leave my people, and go from them! for they be all adulterers, an assembly of treacherous men.">Jeremiah 9:2</a></span>. <span class="ital">O that I had in the wilderness, </span>&c. — The prophet here wishes that he had a lodging-place, or tent, such as travellers in this country were wont to lodge in when they travelled over the deserts, professing that he would rather pass his days in such a habitation in some desert place, than at Jerusalem, which was filled with wicked men. <span class="ital">That I may leave my people and go from them </span>— Not chiefly because of the ill usage he met with among them, but rather because <span class="ital">his righteous soul was vexed from day to day, </span>as Lot’s was in Sodom, with <span class="ital">the wickedness of their conversation, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_peter/3-7.htm" title="But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved to fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men....">2 Peter 3:7-8</a>. It made him even weary of his life to see them dishonouring God and destroying themselves. Time was when the place where God had chosen to put his name, there were the desire and delight of good men. David, in the wilderness, longed to be again in the courts of God’s house; but now Jeremiah, in the courts of God’s house, (for there he was when he said this,) wishes himself in a wilderness! Those have made themselves very vile and very miserable, that have made God’s people and ministers weary of them, and desirous to get from among them. It may not be improper to observe here, that “travellers in the East are not, nor ever were, accommodated at inns on the road, after the manner of the European nations. In some places indeed there are large public buildings provided for their reception, which they call <span class="ital">caravansaries; </span>but these afford merely a covering, being absolutely without furniture; and the traveller must carry his own provisions and necessaries along with him, or he will not find any. Nor are even these empty mansions always to be met with; so that if the weary traveller at night comes into a town where there is no <span class="ital">caravansary, </span>or <span class="greekheb">πανδοχειον</span>, as it is called <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-34.htm" title="And went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.">Luke 10:34</a>, he must take up his lodging in the street, unless some charitable inhabitant will be pleased to receive him into his house, as we find <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/19-15.htm" title="And they turned aside thither, to go in and to lodge in Gibeah: and when he went in, he sat him down in a street of the city: for there was no man that took them into his house to lodging.">Jdg 19:15</a>. And if he passes through the desert, it is well for him if he can light upon a cave, or a hut, which some one before him may have erected for a temporary shelter. And this last is what I conceive to be here meant by <span class="greekheb">מלון ארחים</span>, a solitary and not very comfortable situation, but yet preferable to the chagrin of living continually in the society of men of profligate manners.” — Blaney. <span class="ital">For they be all adulterers </span>— The expression seems here to be metaphorical, implying that they were apostates from God, to whose service they were engaged by the most solemn covenant, like that which obliges a wife to be faithful to her husband. See note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-2.htm" title="Go and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, Thus said the LORD; I remember you, the kindness of your youth, the love of your espousals, when you went after me in the wilderness, in a land that was not sown.">Jeremiah 2:2</a>; and compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-4.htm" title="A wicked and adulterous generation seeks after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas.

But even the desert, without communion with God, through Christ Jesus, and the influences of the Holy Spirit, must be a place for temptation and evil; while, with these blessings, we may live in holiness in crowded cities. The people accustomed their tongues to lies. So false were they, that a brother could not be trusted. In trading and bargaining they said any thing for their own advantage, though they knew it to be false. But God marked their sin. Where no knowledge of God is, what good can be expected?

Such as travellers take up with in a desert, when they are benighted, and cannot reach a town or village. This the prophet chose, partly that he might have an opportunity to give vent to his grief, being alone; for which reason he did not desire to be in cities and populous places, where he might be amused and diverted while his people were in distress: and partly to show his sympathy, not being able to bear the sight of their misery; and also some degree of indignation at their impieties, which had brought ruin upon them; on account of which it was more eligible to dwell with the wild beasts of the desert than with them in his native country: wherefore it follows, <p>that I might leave my people, and go from them; which of itself was not desirable; no man chooses to leave his country, his own people, and his father's house, and go into distant lands and strange countries; and especially into a wilderness, where there is neither suitable food nor agreeable company: wherefore this shows, that there must be something very bad, and very provoking, to lead him to take such a step as this: the reason follows, <p>for they be all adulterers; either in a literal or figurative sense; the latter seems rather intended; for though corporeal fornication and adultery might greatly prevail among them, yet not to such a height as that "all" of them were guilty; whereas idolatry did generally obtain among them: an assembly of treacherous men; not a few only, but in general they were apostates from God and from true religion, and treacherous to one another. The Septuagint calls them "a synod"; and Joseph Kimchi interprets it "a kingdom"; deriving the word from  as it signifies to have rule and dominion; denoting, that the kingdom in general was false and perfidious. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">O that I had in the wilderness a <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> lodging place of wayfaring men; that I might leave my people, and go from them! for they <i>are</i> all <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> adulterers, an assembly of treacherous men.</span><p>(b) He shows that there was more peace and greater safety for him to dwell among the wild beasts than among this wicked people except that God has given him this charge.<p>(c) Utterly turned from God.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/9.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">2</span>. <span class="ital">a lodging place</span>] a caravanserai, hospice (khan).

This may be seen from the second half of the verse, the sense of which is clear: sick (faint) is my heart upon me. &#1506;&#1500;&#1497; shows that the sickness of heart is a sore burden on him, crushes him down; cf. Ew. 217, i. "My comfort" is accordingly vocative: Oh my comfort concerning the sorrow! Usually &#1502;&#1497; &#1497;&#1514;&#1468;&#1503; is supplied: Oh that I had, that there were for me comfort! The sense suits, but the ellipse is without parallel. It is simpler to take the words as an exclamation: the special force of it, that he knows not when to seek comfort, may be gathered from the context. For other far-fetched explanations, see in Ros. ad h. l. The grief which cuts so deeply into his heart that he sighs for relief, is caused by his already hearing in spirit the mourning cry of his people as they go away into captivity.</body></html>
