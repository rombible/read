He had learnt from it to estimate the wisdom and the greatness on which the Corinthians prided themselves at their true value. We may find a parallel even in the higher words which teach us that “eternal life is to know God” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-3.htm" title="And this is life eternal, that they might know you the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.">John 17:3</a>), to understand those attributes, love, judgment, righteousness, which we associate with our thoughts of Him, as indeed they are in their infinite perfection, and which when we know them as we ought to know, we must needs strive to reproduce.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:23-26 In this world of sin and sorrow, ending soon in death and judgement, how foolish for men to glory in their knowledge, health, strength, riches, or in any thing which leaves them under the dominion of sin and the wrath of God! and of which an account must hereafter be rendered; it will but increase their misery. Those are the true Israel who worship God in the Spirit, rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh. Let us prize the distinction which comes from God, and will last for ever.

God shows loving-kindness to those with whom he is in covenant; hence the combination "loving-kindness and faithfulness" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/85-10.htm">Psalm 85:10</a>, corrected version), and as here (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/5-7.htm">Psalm 5:7, 8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/36-5.htm">Psalm 36:5, 6</a>), "mercy and righteousness." Israel is weak and erring, and needs mercies of all sorts, which Jehovah, in his "loving-kindness," vouchsafes. <span class="cmt_word">Next, judgment, or justice.</span> Jehovah is a King, helps the poor and weak to their right, and punishes the wrong-doer (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-12.htm">Jeremiah 21:12</a>). Then, <span class="cmt_word">righteousness</span> - a similar but wider term. This is the quality which leads its subject to adhere to a fixed rule of conduct. God's rule is his covenant; hence "righteousness" shows itself in all such acts as tend to the full realizing of the covenant with Israel, including the "plan of salvation." It is by no means to be confined to exacting penalties and conferring rewards. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-18.htm">Jeremiah 9:18</a> gives the reason why the mourning women are to be called: Loud lamentation is heard out of Zion. Ew. takes "out of Zion" of the Israelites carried away from their country - a view arbitrary in itself, and incompatible with <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-20.htm">Jeremiah 9:20</a>. "How are we spoiled!" cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-13.htm">Jeremiah 4:13</a>; brought utterly to shame, because we have left the land, i.e., have been forced to leave it, and because they (the enemies) have thrown down our dwellings! &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1497;&#1498;, cast down, overthrow, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/18-7.htm">Job 18:7</a>, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/19-12.htm">Ezekiel 19:12</a>, and of buildings, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-11.htm">Daniel 8:11</a>. Kimchi and Hitz., again, take "our dwellings" as subject: our dwellings have cast us out, and appeal to <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-25.htm">Leviticus 18:25</a> : The land vomited out its inhabitants. But the figurative style in this passage does not justify us in adopting so unnatural a figure as this, that the dwellings cast out their occupants. Nor could the object be omitted in such a case. The passages, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-9.htm">Isaiah 33:9</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/2-4.htm">Micah 2:4</a>, to which Hitz. appeals, are not analogous to the present one. The subject, not expressed, acc. to our view of the passage, is readily suggested by the context and the nature of the case. The "for" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-19.htm">Jeremiah 9:19</a> gives a second reason for calling the mourning women together. They are to come not only to chant laments for the spoiling of Zion, but that they may train their daughters and other women in the art of dirge-singing, because the number of deaths will be so great that the existing number of mourning women will not be sufficient for the task about to fall on them. This thought is introduced by a command of God, in order to certify that this great harvest of death will without fail be gathered. &#1488;&#1494;&#1504;&#1499;&#1501; and &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1514;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501; have masc. suffixes instead of feminine, the masc. being often thus used as the more general form; cf. Ew. 184, c. In the last clause the verb "teach" is to be supplied from the preceding context.</body></html>
