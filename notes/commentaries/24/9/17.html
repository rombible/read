Wailing was reduced to an art, and they who practised it were cunning. There are the “mourners” that “go about the streets” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-5.htm" title="Also when they shall be afraid of that which is high, and fears shall be in the way, and the almond tree shall flourish, and the grasshopper shall be a burden, and desire shall fail: because man goes to his long home, and the mourners go about the streets:">Ecclesiastes 12:5</a>), those that “are skilful of lamentation” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-16.htm" title="Therefore the LORD, the God of hosts, the LORD, said thus; Wailing shall be in all streets; and they shall say in all the highways, Alas! alas! and they shall call the farmer to mourning, and such as are skillful of lamentation to wailing.">Amos 5:16</a>), those that mourned for Jehoiakim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-18.htm" title="Therefore thus said the LORD concerning Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah; They shall not lament for him, saying, Ah my brother! or, Ah sister! they shall not lament for him, saying, Ah lord! or, Ah his glory!">Jeremiah 22:18</a>), those that “wept and wailed greatly” in the house of Jairus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/5-38.htm" title="And he comes to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and sees the tumult, and them that wept and wailed greatly.">Mark 5:38</a>). They are summoned as to the funeral, not of a friend or neighbour, but of the nation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/jeremiah/9.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-17.htm" title="Thus said the LORD of hosts, Consider you, and call for the mourning women, that they may come; and send for cunning women, that they may come:">Jeremiah 9:17</a></span>. <span class="ital">Consider ye, and call for the mourning women </span>— Consider the evil circumstances you are in, which call for mourning and lamentation: and since you yourselves are not sufficiently affected with the dangers that threaten you, send for those women whose profession it is to mourn at funerals, and upon other sorrowful occasions, and let their lamentations excite true sorrow in you. The prophet seems here to compare the Jewish state to a person dead, and going to be buried, and therefore calls upon the people to send for those who used to be hired to make lamentations and wailings at funerals. The reader will observe, “it was an ancient custom of the Hebrews, at funerals, and on other like occasions, to make use of hired mourners, whose profession it was to exhibit in public all the signs and gestures of immoderate and frantic grief, and by their loud outcries and doleful songs to excite a real passion of sorrow in others. Women were generally employed in this office, either because it was an office more suitable to the softness of a female mind, or because the more tender passions being predominant in that sex, they succeeded better in their parts; nor were there ever wanting those artists well instructed in the discipline of mourning, and ready to hire out their lamentations and tears on any emergency. It was the chief excellence of other arts to imitate nature; it was likewise esteemed so in this; their funeral dirges, therefore, were composed in imitation of those which had been poured forth by genuine and sincere grief. Their sentences were short, querulous, pathetic, simple, and unadorned; somewhat laboured indeed, because they were composed in metre, and to be sung to the pipe, as we learn from <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-23.htm" title="And when Jesus came into the ruler's house, and saw the minstrels and the people making a noise,">Matthew 9:23</a>; and from Homer,” where, speaking of Hector’s funeral, he says, — — <span class="greekheb">Παρα δ</span>’ <span class="greekheb">εισαν αοιδους</span>,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">Θρηνων εξαρχους</span>, <span class="greekheb">οιτε σονοεσσαν αοιδην</span>,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">Οι μεν αρ</span>’ <span class="greekheb">εθρηνεον</span>, <span class="greekheb">επι δε σεναχοντο γυναικες</span>.

See POPE’S IL., book 24. ver. 900.</span></span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Jerome tells us, in his comment on this verse, that the practice was continued in Judea down to his days; “That women, at funerals, with dishevelled hair, and naked breasts, endeavoured, in a modulated voice, to unite others in lamentation with them.” Frequent allusions to this custom are to be met with in Scripture, particularly <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-25.htm" title="And Jeremiah lamented for Josiah: and all the singing men and the singing women spoke of Josiah in their lamentations to this day, and made them an ordinance in Israel: and, behold, they are written in the lamentations.">2 Chronicles 35:25</a>, where the <span class="ital">singing men and singing women </span>are said to have made it a constant rule, after King Josiah’s death, to commemorate that excellent prince in all their future dirges or lamentations, as one in whom the public in general had sustained an irreparable loss. Such were the <span class="ital">mourners, </span>mentioned <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-5.htm" title="Also when they shall be afraid of that which is high, and fears shall be in the way, and the almond tree shall flourish, and the grasshopper shall be a burden, and desire shall fail: because man goes to his long home, and the mourners go about the streets:">Ecclesiastes 12:5</a>, and said to <span class="ital">go about the streets; </span>and those whom Amos calls, <span class="greekheb">יודעי נהי</span>, <span class="ital">skilful of lamentation; </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-16.htm" title="Therefore the LORD, the God of hosts, the LORD, said thus; Wailing shall be in all streets; and they shall say in all the highways, Alas! alas! and they shall call the farmer to mourning, and such as are skillful of lamentation to wailing.">Amos 5:16</a>. And such no doubt were <span class="ital">the minstrels and the people making a noise; </span><span class="greekheb">οχλον θορυβουμενον</span>, whom our Saviour found in the house of the ruler of the synagogue, whose daughter was just dead; who, St. Mark says, <span class="ital">wept and wailed greatly, </span><span class="greekheb">κλαιοντας και αλαλαζοντας πολλα</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/5-38.htm" title="And he comes to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and sees the tumult, and them that wept and wailed greatly.">Mark 5:38</a>. There are especially several traces of this custom to be met with in the prophets, who frequently delivered their predictions of approaching calamities in the form of funeral dirges. The poem before us, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/9-19.htm" title="For a voice of wailing is heard out of Zion, How are we spoiled! we are greatly confounded, because we have forsaken the land, because our dwellings have cast us out....">Jeremiah 9:19-22</a>, is both an illustration and confirmation of this, and worthy of the reader’s frequent perusal, on account of its affecting pathos, moral sentiments, and fine images; particularly in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-21.htm" title="For death is come up into our windows, and is entered into our palaces, to cut off the children from without, and the young men from the streets.">Jeremiah 9:21</a>, where <span class="ital">death </span>is described in as animated a prosopopœia as can be conceived. See Lowth’s <span class="ital">Prelec., </span>Calmet, and Blaney. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:12-22 In Zion the voice of joy and praise used to be heard, while the people kept close to God; but sin has altered the sound, it is now the voice of lamentation. Unhumbled hearts lament their calamity, but not their sin, which is the cause of it. Let the doors be shut ever so fast, death steals upon us. It enters the palaces of princes and great men, though stately, strongly built, and guarded. Nor are those more safe that are abroad; death cuts off even the children from without, and the young men from the streets. Hearken to the word of the Lord, and mourn with godly sorrow. This alone can bring true comfort; and it can turn the heaviest afflictions into precious mercies.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The mourning women - Hired to attend at funerals, and by their skilled wailings aid the real mourners in giving vent to their grief.

This was a custom that early prevailed among the Jews, and long continued with them; and was so common, that, according to the Misnic doctors (c), the poorest man in Israel, when his wife died, never had less than two pipes, and one mourning woman; See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-23.htm">Matthew 9:23</a>. Now, in order to show what a calamity was coming on them, and what mourning there would be, and what occasion for it; the Lord by the prophet, not as approving, but deriding the practice, bids them call for the mourning women to assist them in their lamentations: <p>and send for cunning women, that they may come; such as were expert in this business, and could mimic mourning well, and had the art of moving the affections with their voice and gestures. <p>(c) Miss.

To give an idea of the greatness of the impending blow, all the skilled mourners are sent for to raise the cry of lamentation. But no, this is not enough. So large will be the number of the dead that all the women must take their part in the doleful office. The description of the mourning women is as true to modern as to ancient life in the East. "And, indeed," says Dr. Shaw, a thoughtful traveler and an ornament of Oxford in the dark eighteenth century, "they perform their parts with such proper sounds, gestures, and commotions, that they rarely fail to work up the assembly into some extraordinary pitch of thoughtfulness and sorrow" ('Travels in Barbary and the Levant,' 2nd edit., p. 242; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-16.htm">Amos 5:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:5</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Jerusalem is to become stone-heaps, where only jackals dwell. &#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; is jackals (canis aureus), in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-22.htm">Isaiah 13:22</a> called &#1488;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; from their cry; see on Isa. l.c., and Gesen. thes. s. v. &#1502;&#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497; &#1497;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-15.htm">Jeremiah 2:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-7.htm">Jeremiah 4:7</a>. - That such a judgment will pass over Judah every wise man must see well, and every one enlightened by God is to declare it; for universal apostasy from God and His law cannot but bring down punishment. But such wisdom and such spiritual enlightenment is not found in the infatuated people. This is the idea of <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-11.htm">Jeremiah 9:11-13</a>. The question: Who is the wise man? etc., reminds us of <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/14-9.htm">Hosea 14:9</a>, and is used with a negative force: unhappily there is none so wise as to see this. "This" is explained by the clause, Wherefore doth the land, etc.: this, i.e., the reason why the land is going to destruction. The second clause, "and to whom," etc., is dependent on the &#1502;&#1497;, which is to be repeated in thought: and who is he that, etc. Jeremiah has the false prophets here in view, who, if they were really illumined by God, if they had the word of God, could not but declare to the people their corruptness, and the consequences which must flow from it. But since none is so wise...Jeremiah proposes to them the question in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-11.htm">Jeremiah 9:11</a>, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-12.htm">Jeremiah 9:12</a> tells the answer as given by God Himself.

"Walketh therein" refers to the law. The stubbornness of their heart, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-17.htm">Jeremiah 3:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-24.htm">Jeremiah 7:24</a>.
