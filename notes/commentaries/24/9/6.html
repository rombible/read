It is, however, better to take them as spoken by Jehovah to the prophet individually. The LXX., following a different reading and punctuation, translates “usury upon usury, deceit upon deceit; they refuse to know Me, saith the Lord.” And this has been adopted by Ewald, among recent commentators.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:1-11 Jeremiah wept much, yet wished he could weep more, that he might rouse the people to a due sense of the hand of God. But even the desert, without communion with God, through Christ Jesus, and the influences of the Holy Spirit, must be a place for temptation and evil; while, with these blessings, we may live in holiness in crowded cities. The people accustomed their tongues to lies. So false were they, that a brother could not be trusted. In trading and bargaining they said any thing for their own advantage, though they knew it to be false. But God marked their sin. Where no knowledge of God is, what good can be expected? He has many ways of turning a fruitful land into barrenness for the wickedness of those that dwell therein.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A continuation of the warning given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-4.htm">Jeremiah 9:4</a>.

In the midst of a people of deceit, as Kimchi and Ben Molech. These are the words of the Lord to the prophet, showing what a people he dwelt among, and had to do with; how cautiously and prudently he should act; how little they were to be trusted to and depended upon; and what little hope there was of bringing them to true repentance, since there was so much deceit and hypocrisy among them. The Targum interprets the words not of the habitation of the prophet, but of the people, thus, <p>"they sit in the house of their own congregation, and talk of their iniquities deceitfully;'' <p>and so Jarchi, <p>"while they are sitting they devise deceitful devices.'' <p>Through deceit they refuse to know me, saith the Lord: or, "because of deceit" (t); hypocrisy being a reigning and governing sin in them; they liked not the true knowledge of God, and refused to worship him according to the revelation of his will. <p>(t) "ob dolum", Schmidt. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Thy habitation <i>is</i> in the midst of deceit; <span class="cverse3">{g}</span> through deceit they refuse to know me, saith the LORD.</span><p>(g) They would rather have forsaken God than left their wicked trade.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thine habitation</span>, etc. According to St. Jerome, this is addressed to the prophet; but it is better to follow the Targum, which makes the clause refer to the Jewish people. The connection is (as Dr. Payne Smith points out)," Trust no one; for thou dwellest surrounded by deceit on every side." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The hopeless case of the people and kingdom moves the seer so deeply, that he bursts forth with the cry: For the breaking of my people I am broken (the Hoph. &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;, of the breaking of the heart, only here; in this sig. usu. the Niph., e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-7.htm">Jeremiah 38:7</a>. Horror hath taken hold on me, is stronger than: Anguish hath taken hold on me, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-24.htm">Jeremiah 6:24</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-9.htm">Micah 4:9</a>. Help is nowhere to be found. This thought is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-22.htm">Jeremiah 8:22</a> clothed in the question: Is there no balm in Gilead, or no physician there? "There" points back to Gilead. Graf's remark, that "it is not known that the physicians were got from that quarter," shows nothing more than that its author has mistaken the figurative force of the words. &#1510;&#1512;&#1497;, balsam, is mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/37-25.htm">Genesis 37:25</a> as an article of commerce carried by Midianite merchants to Egypt (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-17.htm">Ezekiel 27:17</a>), but is hardly the real balsam from Mecca (amyris opobalsamum), which during the Roman sovereignty was grown under culture in the gardens of Jericho, and which only succeeds in a climate little short of tropical. It was more likely the resina of the ancients, a gum procured from the terebinth or mastic tree (lentiscus, &#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;), which, acc. to Plin. h. nat. xxiv. 22, was held in esteem as a medicament for wounds (resolvitur resina ad vulnerum usus et malagmata oleo). Acc. to our passage and <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-11.htm">Jeremiah 46:11</a>, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-25.htm">Genesis 37:25</a>, it was procured chiefly from Gilead; cf. Movers, Phniz. ii. 3, S. 220ff., and the remarks on <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/37-25.htm">Genesis 37:25</a>. To these questions a negative answer is given. From this we explain the introduction of a further question with &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;: if there were balm in Gilead, and a physician there, then a plaister would have been laid on the daughter of my people, which is not the case. As to &#1506;&#1500;&#1514;&#1492; , lit., a plaister comes upon, see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-17.htm">Jeremiah 30:17</a>. </body></html>
