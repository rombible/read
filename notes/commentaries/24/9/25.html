Better, <span class= "ital">I will punish all those that are circumcised in uncircumcision—</span>all, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>who have the outward sign, but not the inward purity of which it was the symbol. In the day of God’s judgments (this being the connecting link with the preceding verse) there would be no difference between the Jew and other races who like him practised circumcision on the one hand, and the outlying heathen world on the other. Here, again, Jeremiah anticipated St. Paul, “To the Jew first, and also to the Gentile; for there is no respect of persons with God” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-9.htm" title="Tribulation and anguish, on every soul of man that does evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile;">Romans 2:9</a>). The true circumcision is that which is “in the spirit, not in the letter” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-29.htm" title="But he is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God.">Romans 2:29</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/jeremiah/9.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/9-25.htm" title="Behold, the days come, said the LORD, that I will punish all them which are circumcised with the uncircumcised;...">Jeremiah 9:25-26</a></span>. <span class="ital">Behold the days come, </span>&c. — Blaney translates these two verses, “Behold, the days are coming, saith Jehovah, that I will punish all the circumcision with the uncircumcision; Egypt, &c., and all those that have their coast insulated, those that dwell in the wilderness: for all the nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel is uncircumcised in heart.” The Greek word <span class="greekheb">ακροβυσια</span>, which properly means <span class="ital">uncircumcision, </span>is several times used by St. Paul for the <span class="ital">persons who are uncircumcised, </span>as <span class="greekheb">περιτομη</span>, <span class="ital">circumcision, </span>is put for <span class="ital">persons circumcised. </span>See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/2-26.htm" title="Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?...">Romans 2:26-27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-30.htm" title="Seeing it is one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith.">Romans 3:30</a>. Because the Jews valued themselves so much upon their circumcision, God here tells them that, when he should send his judgments abroad into the world, they should find no more favour than those that were not circumcised; and, accordingly, in mentioning the heathen nations whom he would punish, he places Judah among them, because they were, in effect, uncircumcised as well as the heathen, contenting themselves with the outward sign of circumcision in the flesh, without seeking that internal circumcision, which is of <span class="ital">the heart and spirit, </span>and the purification and holiness signified thereby. By <span class="ital">those that have their coast insulated, </span>as Blaney renders one of the clauses of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-26.htm" title="Egypt, and Judah, and Edom, and the children of Ammon, and Moab, and all that are in the utmost corners, that dwell in the wilderness: for all these nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in the heart.">Jeremiah 9:26</a>, he supposes the Arabians are designed, which he thinks may be fairly concluded from the connection in which the same words. <span class="greekheb">קצוצי פאה</span>, stand with the context, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-32.htm" title="And their camels shall be a booty, and the multitude of their cattle a spoil: and I will scatter into all winds them that are in the utmost corners; and I will bring their calamity from all sides thereof, said the LORD.">Jeremiah 49:32</a>. Concerning the precise meaning, however, of these words, he justly observes, “interpreters differ very greatly. Some represent them as signifying persons cut off from other people, by being thrust into a remote corner; in which light the translators of our Bible appear to have considered them, when they rendered them in the text, <span class="ital">All that are in the utmost corners, </span>and in the margin, <span class="ital">cut off into corners. </span>But all the ancient versions understand them as expressing the peculiar manner in which the Arabians cut the hair of their heads or beards,” expressed also in our marginal reading; which reading, Dr. Durel says, ought doubtless to be received into the text; the Arabs, who are meant, he thinks, by this periphrasis, being accustomed to cut their hair short, particularly about the crown of the head; and in respect to their beards, leaving only a tuft of hair growing about their chins; a practice which was forbidden to the Jews, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-27.htm" title="You shall not round the corners of your heads, neither shall you mar the corners of your beard.">Leviticus 19:27</a>. But it seems much more probable that the words have a respect to the peninsular form of the country, surrounded on all sides by the sea, excepting only the isthmus to the north; and thus almost <span class="ital">insulated, </span>or <span class="ital">cut off, </span>from any other land. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:23-26 In this world of sin and sorrow, ending soon in death and judgement, how foolish for men to glory in their knowledge, health, strength, riches, or in any thing which leaves them under the dominion of sin and the wrath of God! and of which an account must hereafter be rendered; it will but increase their misery.

The Hebrew is an abstract term, not a concrete, as English Version translates, and as the pious "circumcised" is. The nations specified, Egypt, Judah, &c., were outwardly "circumcised," but in heart were "uncircumcised." The heathen nations were defiled, in spite of their literal circumcision, by idolatry. The Jews, with all their glorying in their spiritual privileges, were no better (Jer 4:4; De 10:16; 30:6; Ro 2:28, 29; Col 2:11). However, Eze 31:18; 32:19, may imply that the Egyptians were uncircumcised; and it is uncertain as to the other nations specified whether they were at that early time circumcised. Herodotus says the Egyptians were so; but others think this applies only to the priests and others having a sacred character, not to the mass of the nation; so English Version may be right (Ro 2:28, 29).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">I will punish, </span> viz. by the Babylonians, all them which are circumcised: q.d.

II. 104. The other nations, as tracing their descent from Abraham, would naturally observe the rite; so too the Arabians, as claiming Ishmael (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-23.htm" title="And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham's house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said to him.">Genesis 17:23</a> ff.) for ancestor. Josephus (<span class="ital">Ant</span>. I. xii. 2) also testifies as to these last. The Philistines, on the other hand, are frequently designated contemptuously as uncircumcised (e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-6.htm" title="And Jonathan said to the young man that bore his armor, Come, and let us go over to the garrison of these uncircumcised: it may be that the LORD will work for us: for there is no restraint to the LORD to save by many or by few.">1 Samuel 14:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-26.htm" title="And David spoke to the men that stood by him, saying, What shall be done to the man that kills this Philistine, and takes away the reproach from Israel? for who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?">1 Samuel 17:26</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">that have the corners</span> of their hair <span class="ital">polled</span>] i.e. cut off from the temples.

But what does this enigmatical expression signify? Hitzig, Graf, and apparently Dr. Payne Smith, think that it has a twofold meaning: that, as applied to the Jews, it means circumcised in the flesh, but not in heart, and, as applied to the heathen, simply uncircumcised (the one-half of the phrase neutralizing the other, like "a knife without the blade," "angels with horns and hoofs," etc.). The latter meaning, however, is surely very improbable, and it would only become necessary if it were proved that circumcision was practiced by none of the nations mentioned but the Jews. This is not the case. There is no doubt that the Egyptians were circumcised in very early times (see the drawing of a bas-relief in the Temple of Chunsu at Karnak, given by Dr. Ebers in his 'Egypten und die Bucher Meets'). The assertion that only the priests underwent the operation has no older evidence than that of Origen (edit. Lommatzsch, 4:138), "in whose time it is quite possible that the Egyptians, like the later Jews, sought to evade a peculiarity which exposed them to ridicule and contempt." As to the Ammonites and Moabites, we have, unfortunately, no information. With regard to the Edomites, it is true that, according to Josephus ('Antiq.,' 13:9, 1), they were compelled to accept circumcision by John Hyrcanus. But it is still quite possible that, at an earlier period, the rite was practiced, just as it was among the ancient Arabs, the evidence for which is beyond question (see the writer's article, "Circumcision," in Encyclopaedia Britannica, 9th edit.). (On the statement that "all these [the] nations are uncircumcised," see below.) <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-18.htm">Jeremiah 9:18</a> gives the reason why the mourning women are to be called: Loud lamentation is heard out of Zion. Ew. takes "out of Zion" of the Israelites carried away from their country - a view arbitrary in itself, and incompatible with <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-20.htm">Jeremiah 9:20</a>. "How are we spoiled!" cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-13.htm">Jeremiah 4:13</a>; brought utterly to shame, because we have left the land, i.e., have been forced to leave it, and because they (the enemies) have thrown down our dwellings! &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1497;&#1498;, cast down, overthrow, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/18-7.htm">Job 18:7</a>, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/19-12.htm">Ezekiel 19:12</a>, and of buildings, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-11.htm">Daniel 8:11</a>. Kimchi and Hitz., again, take "our dwellings" as subject: our dwellings have cast us out, and appeal to <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-25.htm">Leviticus 18:25</a> : The land vomited out its inhabitants. But the figurative style in this passage does not justify us in adopting so unnatural a figure as this, that the dwellings cast out their occupants. Nor could the object be omitted in such a case. The passages, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-9.htm">Isaiah 33:9</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/2-4.htm">Micah 2:4</a>, to which Hitz. appeals, are not analogous to the present one. The subject, not expressed, acc. to our view of the passage, is readily suggested by the context and the nature of the case. The "for" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-19.htm">Jeremiah 9:19</a> gives a second reason for calling the mourning women together. They are to come not only to chant laments for the spoiling of Zion, but that they may train their daughters and other women in the art of dirge-singing, because the number of deaths will be so great that the existing number of mourning women will not be sufficient for the task about to fall on them. This thought is introduced by a command of God, in order to certify that this great harvest of death will without fail be gathered. &#1488;&#1494;&#1504;&#1499;&#1501; and &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1514;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501; have masc. suffixes instead of feminine, the masc. being often thus used as the more general form; cf. Ew. 184, c. In the last clause the verb "teach" is to be supplied from the preceding context.</body></html>
