These he threw down as they became too big to hold, and they were left strewn on the field till he returned to gather them up into larger sheaves. So should the bodies of the dead be strewn, the prophet says, on the open field, but there should be none to take them up and bury them.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:12-22 In Zion the voice of joy and praise used to be heard, while the people kept close to God; but sin has altered the sound, it is now the voice of lamentation. Unhumbled hearts lament their calamity, but not their sin, which is the cause of it. Let the doors be shut ever so fast, death steals upon us. It enters the palaces of princes and great men, though stately, strongly built, and guarded. Nor are those more safe that are abroad; death cuts off even the children from without, and the young men from the streets. Hearken to the word of the Lord, and mourn with godly sorrow. This alone can bring true comfort; and it can turn the heaviest afflictions into precious mercies.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The "handful" means the little bundle of grain which the reaper gathers on his arm with three or four strokes of his sickle, and then lays down. Behind the reaper came one whose business it was to gather several of these bundles, and bind them into a sheaf. Thus, death strews the ground with corpses as thickly as these handfuls lie upon the reaped land, but the corpses lie there unheeded. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22. saith the Lord&#8212;continuing the thread of discourse from Jer 9:20.<p>dung&#8212;(Jer 8:2).<p>handful &#8230; none &#8230; gather them&#8212;implying that the handful has been so trodden as to be not worth even the poor gleaner's effort to gather it.

The Targum is, <p>"as dung spread upon the face of the field;'' <p>which denotes the great number that should fall, which would cover the face of the field; the condition they should be in; and the contempt and neglect they should be had in: <p>and as the handful after the harvestman, and none shall gather them; as a handful of corn that is forgot, and left by the harvestman; or as ears of corn which are dropped by the reaper, or binder, and are usually gleaned or gathered up by the poor that follow; but in the case referred to, or supposed, are not gathered; so it would be with these people; they should be left upon the ground, like a handful forgot, or like ears of corn dropped, and not gathered up, and there they should lie, and none should bury them. <p>(f)   "super faciebus agri", Montanus, Schmidt; "in facie agri", Cocceius; "in superficie agri", Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Speak, Thus saith the LORD, Even the carcases of men shall fall as dung upon the open field, and as the handful after the harvestman, and none shall gather them.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/9.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">22</span>. <span class="ital">Speak, Thus saith the Lord</span>] The words are not found in LXX and they break the connexion.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Speak, Thus saith the Lord</span>.

With other points, the word rendered "speak" would mean "pestilence." Possibly the word fell out of Ver. 21, where it would find an excellent place in the second clause (as an explanatory parallel to "death," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-50.htm">Psalm 78:50</a>), which would thus obtain greater roundness and symmetry. <span class="cmt_word">As the handful</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. as thickly as one heap of corn succeeds another under the deft hand of the leaper. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Zion laid waste. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-16.htm">Jeremiah 9:16</a>.

Speak: Thus runs the saying of Jahve: And the carcases of men shall fall as dung upon the field, and as a sheaf behind the shearer, which none gathereth."<p>In this strophe we have a further account of the execution of the judgment, and a poetical description of the vast harvest death is to have in Zion. The citizens of Zion are called upon to give heed to the state of affairs now in prospect, i.e., the judgment preparing, and are to assemble mourning women that they may strike up a dirge for the dead. &#1492;&#1514;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1504;&#1503;, to be attentive, give heed to a thing; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-10.htm">Jeremiah 2:10</a>. Women cunning in song are to come with speed (&#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492;&#1512;&#1504;&#1492; takes the place of an adverb). The form &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-16.htm">Psalm 45:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-7.htm">1 Samuel 10:7</a>) alternates with &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488;&#1504;&#1492;&#1468;, the usual form in this verb, e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/30-38.htm">Genesis 30:38</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-16.htm">1 Kings 3:16</a>, etc., in order to produce an alternating form of expression . "For us" Ng. understands of those who call the mourning women, and in it he finds "something unusual," because ordinarily mourners are summoned to lament for those already dead, i.e., others than those who summon them. "But here they are to raise their laments for the very persons who summon them, and for the death of these same, which has yet to happen." There is a misunderstanding at the bottom of this remark. The "for us" is not said of the callers; for these are addressed in the second person. If Ng.'s view were right, it must be "for you," not "for us." True, the lxx has &#x3b5;&#x3c6; &#787; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c2;; but Hitz. has rejected this reading as a simplification and weakening expression, and as disturbing the plan. "For us" is used by the people taken collectively, the nation as such, which is to be so sorely afflicted and chastised by death that it is time for the mourning women to raise their dirge, that so the nation may give vent to its grief in tears. We must also take into account, that even although the lamentations were for the dead, they yet chiefly concerned the living, who had been deeply afflicted by the loss of beloved relations; it would not be the dead merely that were mourned for, but the living too, because of their loss. It is this reference that stands here in the foreground, since the purpose of the chanting of dirges is that our eyes may flow with tears, etc. Zion will lament the slain of her people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-22.htm">Jeremiah 8:22</a>), and so the mourning women are to strike up dirges. &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1504;&#1492; for &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1488;&#1504;&#1492;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/1-14.htm">Ruth 1:14</a>; cf. Ew. 198, b. On the use of &#1497;&#1512;&#1491; and &#1504;&#1494;&#1500; with the accus.: flow down in tears, cf. Gesen. 138, 1, Rem. 2, Ew. 281, b.</body></html>
