Unhumbled hearts lament their calamity, but not their sin, which is the cause of it. Let the doors be shut ever so fast, death steals upon us. It enters the palaces of princes and great men, though stately, strongly built, and guarded. Nor are those more safe that are abroad; death cuts off even the children from without, and the young men from the streets. Hearken to the word of the Lord, and mourn with godly sorrow.

Their doors being shut, bolted, and barred, they thought themselves safe, but were not; the Chaldeans scaled their walls, broke in at the tops of their houses, or at their windows, and destroyed them: for the invasion of the enemy, and the manner of their entrance into them, seem to be described. Death is here represented as a person, as it sometimes is in Scripture; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-8.htm">Revelation 6:8</a> and as coming suddenly and unawares upon men, and from whom there is no escape, or any way and method of keeping him out; bolts and bars will not do; he can climb up, and go in at the window: <p>and is entered into our palaces; the houses of their principal men, which were well built, and most strongly fortified, these could not keep out the enemy: and death spares none, high nor low, rich nor poor; it enters the palaces of great men, as well as the cottages of the poor. The Septuagint version is, "it is entered into our land"; and so the Arabic version; only it places the phrase, "into our land", in the preceding clause; and that of "into", or "through our windows", in this: <p>to cut off the children from without, and the young men from the streets; these words are not strictly to be connected with the preceding, as though they pressed the end of death, ascending up to the windows, and entering palaces, to cut off such as were in the streets; but the words are a proposition of themselves, as the distinctive accent "athnach" shows; and must be supplied after this manner, and passing through them it goes on, "to cut off", &amp;c. and so aptly describes the invading enemy climbing the walls of the city, entering at windows, or tops of houses, upon or near the walls; and, having destroyed all within, goes forth into the streets, where children were at play, and slays them and into courts or markets, where young men were employed in business, and destroys them. The Jews (e) interpret it of famine. <p>(e) T. Bab.

The ideal of Zechariah is that "the streets of the city should be full of boys and girls playing in the streets thereof" (Jeremiah 8:5). But the pitiless reaper, Death, shall cut off even "the playful child from the street" (so we might render more literally). Streets, in the parallel clause, means the "broad places" where men congregate to toll the news. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The description of the offence is again followed by the threatening of judgment. To feed with wormwood and give gall to drink is a figure for sore and bitter suffering at the overthrow of the kingdom and in exile. The meaning of the suffix in &#1502;&#1488;&#1499;&#1497;&#1500;&#1501; is shown by the apposition: this people. On water of gall see <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-14.htm">Jeremiah 8:14</a>, and for the use of &#1500;&#1506;&#1504;&#1492; and &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; together see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-17.htm">Deuteronomy 29:17</a>. - '&#1492;&#1508;&#1497;&#1510;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; implies a verbal allusion to the words of <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-64.htm">Deuteronomy 28:64</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-36.htm">Deuteronomy 28:36</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-33.htm">Leviticus 26:33</a>. With this latter passage the second clause: I send the sword after them, has a close affinity. The purport of it is: I send the sword after the fugitives, to pursue them into foreign lands and slay them; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/42-16.htm">Jeremiah 42:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-27.htm">Jeremiah 44:27</a>. Thus it is indicated that those who fled into Egypt would be reached by the sword there and slain. This does not stand in contradiction to what is said in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-27.htm">Jeremiah 4:27</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-18.htm">Jeremiah 5:18</a>, etc., to the effect that God will not make an utter end of them (Graf's opinion). This appears from <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-27.htm">Jeremiah 44:27</a>, where those that flee to Egypt are threatened with destruction by famine and sword &#1506;&#1491; &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497; &#1488;&#1493;, while <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-28.htm">Jeremiah 44:28</a> continues: but they that have escaped the sword shall return. Hence we see that the terms of the threatening do not imply the extirpation of the people to the last man, but only the extirpation of all the godless, of this wicked people.</body></html>
