Unhumbled hearts lament their calamity, but not their sin, which is the cause of it. Let the doors be shut ever so fast, death steals upon us. It enters the palaces of princes and great men, though stately, strongly built, and guarded. Nor are those more safe that are abroad; death cuts off even the children from without, and the young men from the streets. Hearken to the word of the Lord, and mourn with godly sorrow. This alone can bring true comfort; and it can turn the heaviest afflictions into precious mercies.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Forsaken - Or, left: forced to abandon the land.<p>Because our dwellings ... - Rather, "because they have east down our dwellings."

Out of the fortress of Zion, out of the city of Jerusalem, which was thought to be inexpugnable, and could never be taken; but now a voice is heard out of that, deploring the desolation of it: <p>how are we spoiled? our houses destroyed, and we plundered of our substance: <p>we are greatly confounded: filled with shame, on account of their vain confidence; thinking their city would never be taken, and they were safe in it: <p>because we have forsaken the land; the land of Judea, being obliged to it, the enemy carrying them captive into other countries: <p>because our dwellings have cast us out; not suffering us to continue there any longer, as being unworthy of them; or enemies have cast down our habitations to the earth, as Jarchi; and so the Targum, "for our palaces are desolate"; the principal buildings in Jerusalem, as well as the houses of the common people, were thrown down to the ground, or burnt with fire, and particularly the temple; so that the whole was in a most ruinous condition, and a fit subject of a mournful song. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For a voice of wailing is heard out of Zion, How are we laid waste! we are greatly confounded, because we have forsaken the land, because our dwellings <span class="cverse3">{o}</span> have cast <i>us</i> out.</span><p>(o) As though they were weary of us, because of our iniquities, Le 18:28,20:22.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/9.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">19</span>.

But such wisdom and such spiritual enlightenment is not found in the infatuated people. This is the idea of <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-11.htm">Jeremiah 9:11-13</a>. The question: Who is the wise man? etc., reminds us of <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/14-9.htm">Hosea 14:9</a>, and is used with a negative force: unhappily there is none so wise as to see this. "This" is explained by the clause, Wherefore doth the land, etc.: this, i.e., the reason why the land is going to destruction. The second clause, "and to whom," etc., is dependent on the &#1502;&#1497;, which is to be repeated in thought: and who is he that, etc. Jeremiah has the false prophets here in view, who, if they were really illumined by God, if they had the word of God, could not but declare to the people their corruptness, and the consequences which must flow from it. But since none is so wise...Jeremiah proposes to them the question in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-11.htm">Jeremiah 9:11</a>, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-12.htm">Jeremiah 9:12</a> tells the answer as given by God Himself. Because they have forsaken my law, etc. &#1504;&#1514;&#1503; &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;, to set before; as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-8.htm">Deuteronomy 4:8</a>, so here, of the oral inculcation of the law by the prophets. "Walketh therein" refers to the law. The stubbornness of their heart, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-17.htm">Jeremiah 3:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-24.htm">Jeremiah 7:24</a>. After the Baals, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-23.htm">Jeremiah 2:23</a>. The relative clause, "which their fathers," etc., refers to both clauses of the verse; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; with a neuter sense: which their fathers have taught them.</body></html>
