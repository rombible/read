It thus became a parable of the covetous man, whose avarice leads him to pile up riches which are not rightly his, and which after a while “make to themselves wings” and are seen no more. Modern naturalists have not observed this habit, but it is probable that the belief originated in the practice of the cuckoo laying its eggs in the nest of the partridge, as in that of other birds. The cuckoo (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-16.htm" title="And the owl, and the night hawk, and the cuckow, and the hawk after his kind,">Leviticus 11:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-15.htm" title="And the owl, and the night hawk, and the cuckow, and the hawk after his kind,">Deuteronomy 14:15</a>) was and is a common bird in Palestine (<span class= "ital">Bibl.

Many commentators, however, adopt the rendering, <span class= "ital">they </span>(the riches) <span class= "ital">shall leave him. </span>As covetousness was the besetting sin of Jehoiakim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-17.htm" title="But your eyes and your heart are not but for your covetousness, and for to shed innocent blood, and for oppression, and for violence, to do it.">Jeremiah 22:17</a>), the prediction may have pointed specially to him.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/jeremiah/17.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-11.htm" title="As the partridge sits on eggs, and hatches them not; so he that gets riches, and not by right, shall leave them in the middle of his days, and at his end shall be a fool.">Jeremiah 17:11</a></span>. <span class="ital">As the partridge sitteth on eggs, and hatcheth them not </span>— Or rather, as the words <span class="greekheb">דגר לא ילד</span>may be more literally rendered, <span class="ital">hatcheth eggs which she did not lay; so he that getteth riches, and not by right </span>— That is, not in a due, regular manner, by the blessing of God upon honest endeavours, but by arts of knavery and injustice; <span class="ital">shall leave them in the midst of his days </span>— Though he may make them his hope, he shall not have joy in them, nor the true and lasting possession of them; but they shall be soon taken from him, or he from them. <span class="ital">And at his end shall be a fool </span>— That is, he shall evidently appear such. He was indeed a fool all along, and doubtless his conscience often told him so; but at his end his folly will be manifest to all men.

Blaney gives it the Hebrew name <span class="ital">kore, </span>observing, “that it is a bird which frequents the mountains, and is of no great value, as may be learned from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/26-20.htm" title="Now therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth before the face of the LORD: for the king of Israel is come out to seek a flea, as when one does hunt a partridge in the mountains.">1 Samuel 26:20</a>. Here it is said to sit upon and hatch the eggs of birds of another species. This want of distinction is common to many sorts of birds; and the partridge is no way remarkable for it. But where it is so done, the young ones, when fledged, are sure to forsake their supposititious dam, and to join with those of their own feather; in which circumstance the point of comparison seems to lie.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/17.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>17:5-11 He who puts confidence in man, shall be like the heath in a desert, a naked tree, a sorry shrub, the product of barren ground, useless and worthless. Those who trust to their own righteousness and strength, and think they can do without Christ, make flesh their arm, and their souls cannot prosper in graces or comforts. Those who make God their Hope, shall flourish like a tree always green, whose leaf does not wither. They shall be fixed in peace and satisfaction of mind; they shall not be anxious in a year of drought. Those who make God their Hope, have enough in him to make up the want of all creature-comforts. They shall not cease from yielding fruit in holiness and good works. The heart, the conscience of man, in his corrupt and fallen state, is deceitful above all things. It calls evil good, and good evil; and cries peace to those to whom it does not belong. Herein the heart is desperately wicked; it is deadly, it is desperate. The case is bad indeed, if the conscience, which should set right the errors of other faculties, is a leader in the delusion. We cannot know our own hearts, nor what they will do in an hour of temptation. Who can understand his errors? Much less can we know the hearts of others, or depend upon them. He that believes God's testimony in this matter, and learns to watch his own heart, will find this is a correct, though a sad picture, and learns many lessons to direct his conduct. But much in our own hearts and in the hearts of others, will remain unknown. Yet whatever wickedness there is in the heart, God sees it. Men may be imposed upon, but God cannot be deceived. He that gets riches, and not by right, though he may make them his hope, never shall have joy of them. This shows what vexation it is to a worldly man at death, that he must leave his riches behind; but though the wealth will not follow to another world, guilt will, and everlasting torment. The rich man takes pains to get an estate, and sits brooding upon it, but never has any satisfaction in it; by sinful courses it comes to nothing. Let us be wise in time; what we get, let us get it honestly; and what we have, use it charitably, that we may be wise for eternity.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Rather, "As the partridge hath gathered eggs which it laid not, so ..."

Hebrew, korea, from a root, "to call," alluding to its cry; a name still applied to a bustard by the Arabs. Its nest is liable, being on the ground, to be trodden under foot, or robbed by carnivorous animals, notwithstanding all the beautiful manoeuvres of the parent birds to save the brood. The translation, "sitteth on eggs which it has not laid," alludes to the ancient notion that she stole the eggs of other birds and hatched them as her own; and that the young birds when grown left her for the true mother. It is not needful to make Scripture allude to an exploded notion, as if it were true. Maurer thinks the reference is to Jehoiakim's grasping cupidity (Jer 22:13-17). Probably the sense is more general; as previously He condemned trust in man (Jer 17:5), He now condemns another object of the deceitful hearts' trust, unjustly gotten riches (Ps 39:6; 49:16, 17; 55:23).<p>fool&#8212;(Pr 23:5; Lu 12:20); "their folly" (Ps 49:13).

How the partridge is said to <span class="ital">sit on eggs, and hatch them not</span>, is yet a greater question. It may be occasioned so many ways, viz. either sitting upon <span class="ital">windeggs</span>, or <span class="ital">being killed</span> before the eggs are hatched, or <span class="ital">having its eggs destroyed</span> by the male partridge, or by some dog or other vermin, or its nest being found having her eggs taken from her, that it is hard to determine which the prophet means. Of all other I least approve of that which Jerome makes the sense, though the thing be true, (if we may believe Cassiodorus, and several natural historians, Aldrovandus, &c.,) that partridges have such a love and desire to hatch young ones, that having lost their own eggs, they will steal the eggs of other partridges and hatch them, which birds being hatched, the young ones, knowing the cry of their proper dams, hearing them call, leave the partridge that hatched them (which is one thing quoted by Aldrovandus to show the sagacity of that bird): but if this were the sense, the words would be, <span class="ital">As the partridge sitteth on eggs and hatcheth them, but enjoyeth them not</span>, whereas they are <span class="ital">hatcheth them not</span>; that is, having lost them, either by some man that hath taken them from her, or by some vermin or wild beast. <span class="ital">So he that getteth riches, and not by right, shall leave them in the midst of his days, and at his end shall be a fool</span>; so he that getteth an estate by oppression, or any cozenage, or unrighteous actions, shall lose it again before he cometh to die; and when he comes to die, shall understand what a fool he was to take so much pains to no more purpose. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/17.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>As the partridge sitteth on eggs, and hatcheth them not,.... Here seems to be another sin pointed at, as the cause of the ruin of the Jews; as idolatry and trust in the creature before mentioned; so riches unjustly got, and these boasted of and trusted in; the folly of which is illustrated by the simile of a bird sitting on eggs, and not hatching them; being either addled, or broke by the male through lust, or by the foot of man or beast, being laid on the ground; Or by a bird which "gathers" (s), as some; or "hatches", as others, eggs it has not laid; which being hatched, run away from it, and so not enjoyed by it. The Targum is, <p>"as the partridge, or "koraah", which gathers eggs that are not its own, and nourishes young ones which will not follow it, so, &amp;c.'' <p>whether the partridge is meant by "kore", the word here used, is uncertain. Bochart (t) thinks the "woodcock", or "snite" or "snipe", is intended. Jarchi interprets it, by the "cuckoo", which is not likely; since that does not take away another's eggs, and sit on them; but lays its own eggs in another's nest, and leaves them to be hatched by it; but it must be understood rather of such an one that gets the eggs of another, and hatches them, but cannot keep the young when hatched; and this is said of the partridge, that when its own eggs are broke, it will get others, and sit upon them, and hatch them; but being hatched, knowing her not to be their dam, and hearing the voice of that which is, run from her to it (u): <p>so he that getteth riches, and not by right; but by fraud, rapine, and oppression; such are they that will be rich, that are resolved upon it at any rate, right or wrong; and such persons may succeed, and become rich by illicit methods; but then, as such riches may be truly called "mammon of unrighteousness"; so they will not profit in a time to come, in a day of wrath; neither are they of long continuance now: for such a man <p>shall leave them in the midst of his days; which, according to the common term of life, and course of nature, he might hope to arrive to; he shall die, and not enjoy what he has got together; while he is promising himself much and long happiness, his soul is required of him; and whose his substance shall be, he knows not; the riches he has heaped up together, he knows not who shall gather; nor to whom he leaves them, whether a wise man or a fool: however, this is certain as to himself, <p>and at his end shall be a fool; he shall appear to be one for getting riches in an unlawful way; for trusting in uncertain riches; for promising himself a great deal of pleasure and felicity in them for a long time, which he could not secure; and for neglecting the true riches of grace and glory; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-19.htm">Luke 12:19</a>. The Targum is, <p>"at his end he is called a wicked man;'' <p>because of the unjust manner in which he has got his riches, and which appears by his end; every wicked man is a fool.

The prophet assumes the truth of a popular belief respecting the partridge (still a common bird in Judaea), that it brooded upon eggs which it had not laid. As the young birds soon leave the false mother, so unjustly acquired riches soon forsake their possessors. [Canon Tristram rejects this explanation, on the ground that the statement is not true to natural history; the partridge neither steals the broods of others nor needs to do so, as it lays a very large number of eggs. But grammar requires us to translate as suggested above, and consequently excludes any other explanation-May not the unusually large number of the eggs laid by the partridge have led to the fancy that they could not be all its own?] <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/17.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div> Further Confirmation of this Announcement in General Reflections concerning the Sources of Ruin and of well-being. - This portion falls into two halves: a.

These truths are substantiated in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-9.htm">Jeremiah 17:9-13</a>, and elucidated by illustrations.<p>Trust in man is described according to the nature of it in the second clause: he that maketh flesh his arm, i.e., has strength. Flesh, the antithesis to spirit (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/31-3.htm">Isaiah 31:3</a>), sets forth the vanity and perishableness of man and of all other earthly beings; cf. besides <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/31-3.htm">Isaiah 31:3</a>, also <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-4.htm">Job 10:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/56-5.htm">Psalm 56:5</a>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-6.htm">Jeremiah 17:6</a> we are shown the curse of this trusting in man. One who so does is as &#1506;&#1512;&#1506;&#1512; in the steppe. This word, which is found beside only in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/102-18.htm">Psalm 102:18</a>, and in the form &#1506;&#1512;&#1493;&#1506;&#1512; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-6.htm">Jeremiah 48:6</a>, is rendered by the old translators by means of words which mean desert plants or thorny growths (lxx &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;; Jerome, myrice; similarly in Chald. and Syr.); so Ew., arid shrub; Umbr., a bare tree. All these renderings are merely guesses from the context; and the latter, indeed, tells rather against than for a bush or tree, since the following clause, "he shall not see," can be said only of a man. So in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/102-18.htm">Psalm 102:18</a>, where we hear of the prayer of the &#1506;&#1512;&#1506;&#1512;. The word is from &#1506;&#1512;&#1512;, to be naked, made bare, and denotes the destitute man, who lacks all the means of subsistence. It is not the homeless or outcast (Graf, Hitz.). He shall not see, i.e., experience that good comes, i.e., he shall have no prosperity, but shall inhabit "burnt places," tracts in the desert parched by the sun's heat. Salt-land, i.e., quite unfruitful land; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-22.htm">Deuteronomy 29:22</a>. &#1500;&#1488; &#1514;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489; is a relative clause: and which is not inhabited  equals  uninhabitable. Dwelling in parched tracts and salt regions is a figure for the total want of the means of life (equivalent to the German: auf keinen grnen Zweig kommen).</body></html>
