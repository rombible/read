Presumably, therefore, the words were written before the death of Jehoiakim and the capture of Jerusalem.<p><span class= "bld">Let it come now.</span>—The last word is the usual formula of request, and implies a mocking tone in the speakers: “Let it come, <span class= "ital">if you please.</span>”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/jeremiah/17.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/17-15.htm" title="Behold, they say to me, Where is the word of the LORD? let it come now....">Jeremiah 17:15-18</a></span>. <span class="ital">Behold, they say unto me </span>— Scoffing at me, as if I had denounced threatenings in thy name, without any order or direction from thee: <span class="ital">Where is the word of the Lord? </span>— Like the scoffers, mentioned by St. Peter, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-4.htm" title="And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.">2 Peter 3:4</a>, saying, <span class="ital">Where is the promise of his coming? </span>This has been the practice of all wicked men, hardened in their sinful courses, and resolved to go on in them: they put the evil day far from them, and scoff at all denunciations of divine wrath. <span class="ital">Let it come now </span>— So said these scoffers, daring the vengeance of God, and challenging him to execute the judgments he had threatened. <span class="ital">As for me, I have not hastened,</span> &c. — Dr. Waterland translates this clause, “But as for me, I have not forced or intruded myself upon thee for a pastor.” To the same sense the Geneva translation interprets the words. According to which reading the prophet solemnly appeals to God that he had not intruded himself into the office of a prophet, nor had been desirous of an employment that foreboded so much evil to others, and brought a great deal of trouble upon himself. The words in the Hebrew, however, are literally as our translation expresses them, and may be paraphrased thus, “As I did not seek the office of a prophet, so when thou wast pleased to call me to it I did not decline it.” The LXX, render it, <span class="greekheb">εγω δε ουκ εκοπιασα κατακολουθων οπισω σου</span>, <span class="ital">I have not been weary of following thee. Neither have I desired the woful day </span>— Namely, the day of the accomplishment of his prophecies. Though, when it came, it would prove him to have been a true prophet, which they had questioned, and would be the avenging of him upon his persecutors, and therefore, on those accounts, he might have been tempted to desire it; yet, as it would be a <span class="ital">woful day </span>to Jerusalem, he deprecated it, and could appeal to God that he wished it might never come. <span class="ital">That which came out of my lips was right before thee </span>— That is, it exactly agreed with what I had received from thee. <span class="ital">Be not a terror unto me </span>— Amidst all the terrors, with which mine adversaries threaten me, let me still find comfort in thee; and let not any apprehension of being forsaken by thee be added to my other fears. <span class="ital">Let them be confounded, </span>&c. — See notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-20.htm" title="But, O LORD of hosts, that judge righteously, that try the reins and the heart, let me see your vengeance on them: for to you have I revealed my cause.">Jeremiah 11:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-18.htm" title="And first I will recompense their iniquity and their sin double; because they have defiled my land, they have filled my inheritance with the carcasses of their detestable and abominable things.">Jeremiah 16:18</a>.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/17.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>17:12-18 The prophet acknowledges the favour of God in setting up religion. There is fulness of comfort in God, overflowing, ever-flowing fulness, like a fountain. It is always fresh and clear, like spring-water, while the pleasures of sin are puddle-waters. He prays to God for healing, saving mercy. He appeals to God concerning his faithful discharge of the office to which he was called. He humbly begs that God would own and protect him in the work to which he had plainly called him. Whatever wounds or diseases we find to be in our hearts and consciences, let us apply to the Lord to heal us, to save us, that our souls may praise his name. His hands can bind up the troubled conscience, and heal the broken heart; he can cure the worst diseases of our nature.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This taunt shows that this prophecy was written before any very signal fulfillment of Jeremiah's words had taken place, and prior therefore to the capture of Jerusalem at the close of Jehoiakim's life.

Or, "they are saying unto me" (y), continually; these were their daily flouts and jeers: <p>Where is the word of the Lord? that thou hast so often talked of? thou hast for a long time threatened us with a siege, and famine, pestilence, and the sword, and captivity, but none of these come to pass; where is the accomplishment of them? thou hast pretended to have the word of the Lord for all this; but where is it, or the fulfilment of it? so the Targum, <p>"where is that which thou hast prophesied in the name of the Lord?'' <p>the judgments, as punishments for sin, he prophesied of. This has been always usual in all ages, that when God's judgments threatened have not been immediately executed, scoffers and mockers have rose up, suggesting they would never come; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/2-17.htm">Malachi 2:17</a>; <p>let it come now; immediately, or we shall not believe it ever will; a very impudent, daring, and wicked expression: this is like that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-19.htm">Isaiah 5:19</a>.
