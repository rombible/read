"Field" may, however, mean all Judea; it and "My mountain" will thus express the country and its capital.

The rendering in the text makes the “mountain” to apply to Jerusalem.

The question is whether "my mountain in the field" is a vocative or an accusative dependent on "I will give." If the former, then the phrase will mean Jerusalem (comp. "rock of the plain," <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-13.htm">Jeremiah 21:13</a>). This, however, does not suit with the second half of the verse ("thy high places," etch), and still less with ver. 4, which evidently refers to the people of Judah. Added to this, if Jerusalem were here addressed we should certainly expect feminine suffixes. It remains to take "my mountain," etc., as an accusative. It describes, not Jerusalem, but Mount Zion as the site of the temple, the mountain of the house of Jehovah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-3.htm">Isaiah 2:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/8-3.htm">Zechariah 8:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/24-3.htm">Psalm 24:3</a>). Render, therefore, my <span class="accented">mountain in the field will I give</span>. The prophet magnifies Zion into a mountain with a widely extended prospect (comp. ver. 12 and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-13.htm">Jeremiah 21:13</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Thy substance and all thy treasures</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> these of the people. The part of the verse which begins here is almost the same as <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-13.htm">Jeremiah 15:13</a> (see note). <span class="cmt_word">And thy high places for sin</span>. Keil explains, Jehovah declares that he will, on account of the sinful practices upon them, deliver up the high places throughout the land. Gesenius, "He will deliver up the high places <span class="accented">with</span> the sin attaching to them;" Hitzig, "as a sin offering." There is a question, however, whether there is not a corruption in the text, and whether we should not read, with Ewald, "without price for thy sins" (as in the parallel passage, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-13.htm">Jeremiah 15:13</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/16.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div> The punishment foretold is but retribution for their sins. Because they have defiled the land by idolatry, they shall be driven out of it. &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1504;&#1492;, first, is by Jerome, Hitz., Ew., Umbr. made to refer to the salvation promised in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-15.htm">Jeremiah 16:15</a> : first, i.e., before the restoration of my favour spoken of in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-15.htm">Jeremiah 16:15</a>, I requite double. Against this Graf has objected, that on this view "first" would appear somewhat superfluous; and Ng., that the manifestly intended antithesis to &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1492; is left out of account. There is little force in either objection. Even Ng.'s paraphrase does not do full justice to the presumed antithesis; for if we render: "For the first time the double shall be requited, in the event of repetition a severer standard shall be used," then the antithesis to "first" would not be "double," but the supplied repetition of the offence. There is not the slightest hint in the context to lead us to supply this idea; nor is there any antithesis between "first" and "double." It is a mere assumption of the comm., which Rashi, Kimchi, Ros., Maur., etc., have brought into the text by the interpolation of a &#1493; cop. before &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1492;: I requite the first of their transgressions and the repetition of them, i.e., their earlier and their repeated sins, or the sins committed by their fathers and by themselves, on a greater scale. We therefore hold the reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-15.htm">Jeremiah 16:15</a> to be the only true one, and regard it as corresponding both to the words before us and the context. "The double of their iniquity," i.e., ample measure for their sins (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-2.htm">Isaiah 40:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/11-6.htm">Job 11:6</a>) by way of the horrors of war and the sufferings of the exile. The sins are more exactly defined by: because they defiled my land by the carcases of their detestables, i.e., their dead detestable idols. &#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1510;&#1497;&#1501;  &#1504;&#1489;&#1500;&#1514; is formed according to &#1508;&#1468;&#1490;&#1512;&#1497; , <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-30.htm">Leviticus 26:30</a>, and it belongs to "they defiled," not to "they filled," as the Masoretic accentuation puts it; for &#1502;&#1500;&#1488; is construed, not with &#1489;&#1468; of the thing, but with double accus.; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-17.htm">Ezekiel 8:17</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-11.htm">Ezekiel 30:11</a>, etc. So it is construed in the last clause: With their abominations they have filled the inheritance of Jahveh, i.e., the land of the Lord (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-7.htm">Jeremiah 2:7</a>). The infin. &#1495;&#1500;&#1468;&#1500;&#1501; is continued by &#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; in verbo fin., as usual.<p>In <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-19.htm">Jeremiah 16:19-21</a> we have more as to the necessity of the threatened punishment. The prophet turns to the Lord as his defence and fortress in time of need, and utters the hope that even the heathen may some time turn to the Lord and confess the vanity of idolatry, since the gods which men make are no gods. To this the Lord answers in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-21.htm">Jeremiah 16:21</a>, that just therefore He must punish His idolatrous people, so that they shall feel His power and learn to know His name.</body></html>
