The Sabbath was observed after a fashion, but, as Sunday has been for many centuries and in many parts of Christendom, it was turned into a market-day, and so, though men abstained probably from manual labour, the quiet sanctity which of right belonged to it was lost. Passages like <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/56-2.htm" title="Blessed is the man that does this, and the son of man that lays hold on it; that keeps the sabbath from polluting it, and keeps his hand from doing any evil.">Isaiah 56:2-6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-13.htm" title="If you turn away your foot from the sabbath, from doing your pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, the holy of the LORD, honorable; and shall honor him, not doing your own ways, nor finding your own pleasure, nor speaking your own words:">Isaiah 58:13</a> show that the evil was one of some standing, and the practice of the time of Jehoiakim was not likely to be more rigorous than it had been in the time of Isaiah, or was, at a later period, after the return from the Captivity.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/17.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>17:19-27 The prophet was to lay before the rulers and the people of Judah, the command to keep holy the sabbath day. Let them strictly observe the fourth command. If they obeyed this word, their prosperity should be restored. It is a day of rest, and must not be made a day of labour, unless in cases of necessity. Take heed, watch against the profanation of the sabbath. Let not the soul be burdened with the cares of this world on sabbath days. The streams of religion run deep or shallow, according as the banks of the sabbath are kept up or neglected. The degree of strictness with which this ordinance is observed, or the neglect shown towards it, is a good test to find the state of spiritual religion in any land. Let all; by their own example, by attention to their families, strive to check this evil, that national prosperity may be preserved, and, above all, that souls may be saved.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>To yourselves - literally, "in your souls, i. e., in yourselves."

The country people were in the habit of coming to Jerusalem on the Sabbath to attend the temple service, but mingled traffic with their devotions, bringing the produce of their fields and gardens with them for disposal. The people of Jerusalem for their part took <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-22.htm">Jeremiah 17:22</a> their wares to the gates, and carried on a brisk traffic there with the villagers. Both parties seem to have abstained from manual labor, but did not consider that buying and selling were prohibited by the fourth commandment.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/17.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21. Take heed to yourselves&#8212;literally, "to your souls." Maurer explains, "as ye love your lives"; a phrase used here to give the greater weight to the command.<p>sabbath&#8212;The non-observance of it was a chief cause of the captivity, the number of years of the latter, seventy, being exactly made to agree with the number of Sabbaths which elapsed during the four hundred ninety years of their possession of Canaan from Saul to their removal (Le 26:34, 35; 2Ch 36:21). On the restoration, therefore, stress was especially laid on Sabbath observance (Ne 13:19).<p>Jerusalem&#8212;It would have been scandalous anywhere; but in the capital, Jerusalem, it was an open insult to God. Sabbath-hallowing is intended as a symbol of holiness in general (Eze 20:12); therefore much stress is laid on it; the Jews' gross impiety is manifested in their setting God's will at naught, in the case of such an easy and positive command.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/17.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This command for the sanctification of the sabbath was given <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-8.htm" title="Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.">Exodus 20:8</a></span>, repeated <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-12.htm" title="Six days you shall do your work, and on the seventh day you shall rest: that your ox and your ass may rest, and the son of your handmaid, and the stranger, may be refreshed.">Exodus 23:12</a> 31:14,15 Le 19:3 23:3 <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-12.htm" title="Keep the sabbath day to sanctify it, as the LORD your God has commanded you.">Deu 5:12</a>,15 Eze 20:12</span>: the bearing of burdens forbidden was such as was for profit; for in some cases it was lawful to carry burdens for the saving the lives of men or beasts, and some learned men justify the poor sick man carrying his bed when he was cured, not only from the command of Christ alone, who could authorize him to it though against the rule of the law, but because he had no further occasion himself to be there, and was not obliged by the law of the sabbath to leave his bed behind him, himself going away; but no unnecessary burdens, no trading burdens, might on the sabbath day be either carried out of the gates of the city, or out of the gates of any of their private houses. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/17.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Neither carry forth a burden out of your houses on the sabbath day,....

"Heal me, Jahveh, that I may be healed; help me, that I may be holpen, for Thou art my praise. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-15.htm">Jeremiah 17:15</a>. Behold, they say to me, Where is the word of Jahveh? let it come, now. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-16.htm">Jeremiah 17:16</a>.

Be not to me a confusion, my refuge art Thou in the day of evil. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-18.htm">Jeremiah 17:18</a>. Let my persecutors be put to shame, but let not me be put to shame; let them be confounded, but let not me be confounded; bring upon them the day of evil, and break them with a double breach."<p>The experience Jeremiah had had in his calling seemed to contradict the truth, that trust in the Lord brings blessing (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-7.htm">Jeremiah 17:7</a>.); for his preaching of God's word had brought him nothing but persecution and suffering. Therefore he prays the Lord to remove this contradiction and to verify that truth in his case also. The prayer of <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-14.htm">Jeremiah 17:14</a>, "heal me," reminds one of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/6-3.htm">Psalm 6:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/30-3.htm">Psalm 30:3</a>. Thou art &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497;, the object of my praises; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/71-6.htm">Psalm 71:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-21.htm">Deuteronomy 10:21</a>. - The occasion for this prayer is furnished by the attacks of his enemies, who ask in scorn what then has become of that which he proclaims as the word of the Lord, why it does not come to pass. Hence we see that the discourse, of which this complaint is the conclusion, was delivered before the first invasion of Judah by the Chaldeans. So long as his announcements were not fulfilled, the unbelieving were free to persecute him as a false prophet (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-22.htm">Deuteronomy 18:22</a>), and to give out that his prophecies were inspired by his own spite against his people. He explains, on the contrary, that in his calling he has neither acted of his own accord, nor wished for misfortune to the people, but that he has spoken by the inspiration of God alone. '&#1500;&#1488; &#1488;&#1510;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;  cannot mean: I have not pressed myself forward to follow Thee as shepherd, i.e., pressed myself forward into Thy service in vain and overweening self-conceit (Umbr.). For although this sense would fall very well in with the train of thought, yet it cannot be grammatically justified. &#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509;, press, press oneself on to anything, is construed with &#1500;, cf.Josh. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-13.htm">Jeremiah 10:13</a>; with &#1502;&#1503; it can only mean: press oneself away from a thing. &#1502;&#1512;&#1506;&#1492; may stand for &#1502;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1514; , cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-2.htm">Jeremiah 48:2</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-23.htm">1 Samuel 15:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-13.htm">1 Kings 15:13</a> : from being a shepherd after Thee, i.e., I have not withdrawn myself from following after Thee as a shepherd. Against this rendering the fact seems to weigh, that usually it is not the prophets, but only the kings and princes, that are entitled the shepherds of the people; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-1.htm">Jeremiah 23:1</a>. For this reason, it would appear, Hitz. and Graf have taken &#1512;&#1506;&#1492; in the sig. to seek after a person or thing, and have translated: I have not pressed myself away from keeping after Thee, or from being one that followed Thee faithfully. For this appeal is made to places like <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-20.htm">Proverbs 13:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-7.htm">Proverbs 28:7</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/37-3.htm">Psalm 37:3</a>, where &#1512;&#1506;&#1492; does mean to seek after a thing, to take pleasure in it. But in this sig. &#1512;&#1506;&#1492; is always construed with the accus. of the thing or person, not with &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;, as here. Nor does it by any means follow, from the fact of shepherds meaning usually kings or rulers, that the idea of "shepherd" is exhausted in ruling and governing people. According to <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/23-1.htm">Psalm 23:1</a>, Jahveh is the shepherd of the godly, who feeds them in green pastures and leads them to the refreshing water, who revives their soul, etc. In this sense prophets, too, feed the people, if they, following the Lord as chief shepherd, declare God's word to the people. We cannot in any case abide by Ng.'s rendering, who, taking &#1512;&#1506;&#1492; in its literal sense, puts the meaning thus: I have not pressed myself away from being a shepherd, in order to go after Thee. For the assumption that Jeremiah had, before his call, been, like Amos, a herd of cattle, contradicts <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-1.htm">Jeremiah 1:1</a>; nor from the fact, that the cities of the priests and of the Levites were provided with grazing fields (&#1502;&#1490;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501;), does it at all follow that the priests themselves tended their flocks. "The day of trouble," the ill, disastrous day, is made out by Ng. to be the day of his entering upon the office of prophet - a view that needs no refutation. It is the day of destruction for Jerusalem and Judah, which Jeremiah had foretold. When Ng. says: "He need not have gone out of his way to affirm that he did not desire the day of disaster for the whole people," he has neglected to notice that Jeremiah is here defending himself against the charges of his enemies, who inferred from his prophecies of evil that he found a pleasure in his people's calamity, and wished for it to come. For the truth of his defence, Jeremiah appeals to the omniscience of God: "Thou knowest it." That which goes from my lips, i.e., the word that came from my lips, was &#1504;&#1498; &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1498;, before or over against thy face, i.e., manifest to Thee.</body></html>
