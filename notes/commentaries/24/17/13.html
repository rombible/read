The Eastern habit of writing on the ground (of which <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-6.htm" title="This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground, as though he heard them not.">John 8:6</a> supplies one memorable instance, and which was the common practice in Jewish schools) gave a vividness to the similitude which we have almost lost.

Contrariwise, a name written in heaven implies that its bearer belongs to heaven, and that the inscription will abide.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> We find running throughout Scripture the metaphor of books in which men’s names are written. Moses thought of a book which God has written, and in which his name was enrolled. A psalmist speaks of the ‘book of the living,’ and Isaiah of those who are ‘written among the living in Jerusalem.’ Ezekiel threatens the prophets who speak lies in Jehovah’s name that they ‘shall not be written in the writing of the house of Israel.’ The Apocalypse has many references to the book which is designated as ‘the Lamb’s book of life,’ and which is opened at the final judgment along with the books in which each man’s life-history is written, and only ‘they who are written in the Lamb’s book of life’ enter into the city that comes down out of heaven.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. The principle on which the two lists are made up.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>It is commonly supposed that the idea of unconditional predestination is implied in the writing of the names in the book of life. There is nothing in the figure itself to lead to that, and the text from Jeremiah suggests, on the contrary, that the voluntary attitude of men to God determines their being or not being inscribed in the book of heaven, since it is ‘they who depart from God’ whose ‘names are written on earth.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Then, since in the New Testament the book of life is called ‘the Lamb’s,’ we are led to think of Christ as writing in it, and hence of our faith in Him as being the condition of enrolling our names.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. The significance of the lists.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>They are lists of the living and of the dead.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> True life is in fellowship with God. The other is the register of the burials in a graveyard.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> They are lists of the citizens of two cities.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The idea is that the one class have relations and affinities with the celestial, are ‘fellow-citizens with the saints,’ and have heaven as their metropolis, their mother city. Therefore they are but as aliens here, and should not wish to be naturalised. The other class are citizens of the earthly, belonging to the present, with all their thoughts and desires bounded by this visible diurnal sphere.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> They are lists of those who shall be forgotten, and their works annihilated, and of those who shall be remembered and their work crowned.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The names written on earth are swiftly obliterated, like a child’s scrawl on the sand which is washed away by the next tide, or covered up by the next storm that blows about the sand-hills. What a contrast is that of the names written on the heavens, high up above all earthly mutations!<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> In one sense oblivion soon seizes on us all. In another none of us is ever forgotten by God, but good and bad alike live in His thought. Still this idea of a special remembrance has place, as suggesting that, however unnoticed or forgotten on earth, God’s children live in the true ‘Golden Book.’ Their names are in the book of life. ‘Of so much fame, in heaven expect the meed.’ Ay, and as, too, suggesting how brief after all is the honour that comes from men.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Also, there will be annihilation or perpetuation of their life’s work. Nothing lasts but the will of God. Men who live godless lives are engaged in true Sisyphean labour. They are running counter to the whole stream of things, and what can be left at the end but frustrated endeavours covered with a gloomy pall?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Is your life to be wasted?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> They are lists of those who are accepted in judgment, and of those who are not.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-12.htm" title="And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.">Revelation 20:12</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-15.htm" title="And whoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.">Revelation 20:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-27.htm" title="And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defiles, neither whatever works abomination, or makes a lie: but they which are written in the Lamb's book of life.">Revelation 21:27</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The books of men’s lives are to be opened, and also the book of life. What is written in the former can only bring condemnation. If our names are written in the latter, then He will ‘confess our names before His Father and the holy angels.’ And He will joyfully inscribe them there if we say to Him, like the man in <span class="ital">Pilgrim’s Progress</span>, ‘Set down my name.’ He will write them not only there, but on the palms of His hands and the tablets of His heart.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/jeremiah/17.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-13.htm" title="O LORD, the hope of Israel, all that forsake you shall be ashamed, and they that depart from me shall be written in the earth, because they have forsaken the LORD, the fountain of living waters.">Jeremiah 17:13</a></span>. <span class="ital">O Lord, the hope of Israel </span>— That is, He in whom alone thy true Israel can hope; <span class="ital">all they that forsake thee shall be ashamed </span>— Those who forsake thy law and that rule which thou hast given them, whereby to direct their conversation, will sooner or later be ashamed of such their disobedience.

There is fulness of comfort in God, overflowing, ever-flowing fulness, like a fountain. It is always fresh and clear, like spring-water, while the pleasures of sin are puddle-waters. He prays to God for healing, saving mercy. He appeals to God concerning his faithful discharge of the office to which he was called. He humbly begs that God would own and protect him in the work to which he had plainly called him. Whatever wounds or diseases we find to be in our hearts and consciences, let us apply to the Lord to heal us, to save us, that our souls may praise his name.

Their hopes and celebrity are wholly in the earth, not in the heavenly book of life (Re 13:8; 20:12, 15). The Jews, though boasting that they were the people of God, had no portion in heaven, no status before God and His angels.

Of all true Israelites; such as are regenerate persons, and true believers in him; Christ is the author and giver of that hope that is in them; the door of it unto them; the object on which it is exercised; the ground and foundation of it, or what gives encouragement to it; and the person they are hoping for; Old Testament saints hoped, waited for, and expected his first coming; and New Testament saints are hoping for his second coming, and to be for ever with him (w): <p>all that forsake thee shall be ashamed; who forsake him as the Hope of Israel, and place their hope elsewhere; in the creature, in themselves, in their riches, in their righteousness, and profession of religion; such shall be ashamed of their vain hope; whereas a true hope, a hope upon the right object, on Christ the Hope of Israel, makes not ashamed; nor shall the man that has it be ashamed of that. The Targum paraphrases it, <p>"all who forsake thy worship shall be ashamed;'' <p>for they forsake their own mercies, who forsake the house and ordinances of God, and the assembling of themselves together: <p>and they that depart from me; the prophet; refusing to hear the word of the Lord by him, which was all one as departing from the Lord. Some render it, "from thee", as the Vulgate Latin and Arabic versions; and so the Targum, <p>"and the ungodly that transgress thy word;'' <p>whose heart departed from the Lord, as in  <p><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-1.htm">Jeremiah 17:1</a> notwithstanding their show of devotion and religion. Some render the words, "that are chastised by me"; but repent not, and are not reformed thereby; reading not  as the Masorites direct, and we, and many others, follow; but according to the letters, and retaining them, (x): <p>shall be written in the earth; have a name among earthly and carnal men, and be called so, being sensual and carnal, and minding nothing but earth and earthly things; and shall not be written among the living in Jerusalem, or have a name and a place among spiritual men: or they shall be of a short continuance; their memory shall rot; their names be put out for ever; and their memorial perish with them; for things written in the dust do not continue, but are presently destroyed by a puff of wind, or by the treading of the foot upon them; or they shall die, and return to the earth, and be laid in the grave, as Jarchi and Kimchi interpret it; or shall perish eternally, die the second death, being not written in the Lamb's book of life.
