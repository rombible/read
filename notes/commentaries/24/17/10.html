Jehovah, who “searches the heart,” answers the question “who can know it?” He does know, and will, in the end, judge with a perfectly righteous judgment. Men should live as in the presence of One to whom all hearts are open.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/17.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>17:5-11 He who puts confidence in man, shall be like the heath in a desert, a naked tree, a sorry shrub, the product of barren ground, useless and worthless. Those who trust to their own righteousness and strength, and think they can do without Christ, make flesh their arm, and their souls cannot prosper in graces or comforts. Those who make God their Hope, shall flourish like a tree always green, whose leaf does not wither. They shall be fixed in peace and satisfaction of mind; they shall not be anxious in a year of drought. Those who make God their Hope, have enough in him to make up the want of all creature-comforts. They shall not cease from yielding fruit in holiness and good works. The heart, the conscience of man, in his corrupt and fallen state, is deceitful above all things. It calls evil good, and good evil; and cries peace to those to whom it does not belong. Herein the heart is desperately wicked; it is deadly, it is desperate. The case is bad indeed, if the conscience, which should set right the errors of other faculties, is a leader in the delusion. We cannot know our own hearts, nor what they will do in an hour of temptation. Who can understand his errors? Much less can we know the hearts of others, or depend upon them. He that believes God's testimony in this matter, and learns to watch his own heart, will find this is a correct, though a sad picture, and learns many lessons to direct his conduct. But much in our own hearts and in the hearts of others, will remain unknown. Yet whatever wickedness there is in the heart, God sees it. Men may be imposed upon, but God cannot be deceived. He that gets riches, and not by right, though he may make them his hope, never shall have joy of them. This shows what vexation it is to a worldly man at death, that he must leave his riches behind; but though the wealth will not follow to another world, guilt will, and everlasting torment. The rich man takes pains to get an estate, and sits brooding upon it, but never has any satisfaction in it; by sinful courses it comes to nothing. Let us be wise in time; what we get, let us get it honestly; and what we have, use it charitably, that we may be wise for eternity.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The answer to the question, "who can know it?" To himself a man's heart is an inscrutable mystery: God alone can fathom it.<p>Ways - Rather, way, his course of life. The "and" must be omitted, for the last clause explains what is meant "by man's way," when he comes before God for judgment.

Lest any should infer from Jer 17:9, "who can know it?" that even the Lord does not know, and therefore cannot punish, the hidden treachery of the heart, He says, "I the Lord search the heart," &c.

The inward parts of it, every room and corner in it; and know the thoughts of it; all its intents, purposes, designs, contrivances, and imaginations; all the secret motions of it, and the wickedness that is in it; so that this is an answer to the question in the preceding verse; and therefore, though the heart is deceitful, it cannot deceive him, because he judges not according to outward appearance; he sees and knows the heart; and none but the Lord, or he who is Jehovah, can so search the heart as thus to know it; wherefore, since Christ is said to search the reins and the heart, and to know the thoughts of men, and to be a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart, he must be Jehovah, and the true God, <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/2-23.htm">Revelation 2:23</a>, <p>I try the reins; the most inward and remote parts, covered with fat, and out of sight: these are the seat of the affections; and the Lord tries these, whether they are towards him or not; and whether sincere or hypocritical; Christ the omniscient God knew Peter's love to him, and the sincerity of it; for which he appeals to him as such, <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/21-17.htm">John 21:17</a>, <p>even to give every man accordions to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings; to do which it is necessary to search the heart, and try the reins, the fountain of all actions; and in which the principles of them are, and according to which they are denominated and judged of: in the future judgment every secret thing will be brought into account; the counsels of the heart will be made manifest; the book of conscience will be opened; and out of it, as well as other books, men will be judged according to their ways and works; and therefore it is requisite that the Judge should be the Lord God omniscient, the searcher and trier of the hearts and reins, as Christ is. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/17.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">I the LORD search the heart, I try the reins, even to give every man according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/17.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">10</span>. <span class="ital">search … reins</span>] See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-20.htm" title="But, O LORD of hosts, that judge righteously, that try the reins and the heart, let me see your vengeance on them: for to you have I revealed my cause.">Jeremiah 11:20</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">even to give, etc</span>.] found also <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-19.htm" title="Great in counsel, and mighty in work: for your eyes are open on all the ways of the sons of men: to give every one according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings:">Jeremiah 32:19</a>.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/17.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div> And thou shalt discontinue from thine inheritance. There is in &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1496;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; an allusion to the law in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/23-11.htm">Exodus 23:11</a>, to let the ground lie untilled in the seventh year, and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-2.htm">Deuteronomy 15:2</a>, to let loans go, not to exact from one's neighbour what has been lent to him. Because Judah has transgressed this law, the Lord will compel the people to let go their hold of their inheritance, i.e., He will cast them out of it. &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1498; seems strange, interposed between the verb and the "from thine inheritance" dependent on it. The later Greek translators (for the entire passage <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-1.htm">Jeremiah 17:1-4</a> is wanting in the lxx) render it &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;, and Jerome sola.

Mich., Gr., and Ng. propose to read &#1497;&#1491;&#1498;, on the ground of the connection wrongly made between &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1496; and &#1497;&#1491;&#1493;, to let go his hand, <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-2.htm">Deuteronomy 15:2</a>, given in Ges.

On the last clause, "for a fire," etc., cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-14.htm">Jeremiah 15:14</a>, where is also discussed the relation of the present <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-3.htm">Jeremiah 17:3</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-4.htm">Jeremiah 17:4</a> to <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-13.htm">Jeremiah 15:13-14</a>.
