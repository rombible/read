Beyond this, the fate of the last king of Judah is buried in darkness. His brother Jehoiachin was already a prisoner in Babylon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-15.htm" title="And he carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon, and the king's mother, and the king's wives, and his officers, and the mighty of the land, those carried he into captivity from Jerusalem to Babylon.">2Kings 24:15</a>), but we do not know whether the two were allowed to meet. Twenty-six years later Jehoiachin was released by Evil-merodach (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-27.htm" title="And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, that Evilmerodach king of Babylon in the year that he began to reign did lift up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah out of prison;">2Kings 25:27</a>); but there is no mention of Zedekiah, and it is a natural inference that his sufferings had ended previously.<p><span class= "bld">Bound him with chains.</span>—Literally, as in the margin, with two brazen chains.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/39.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>39:1-10 Jerusalem was so strong, that the inhabitants believed the enemy could never enter it. But sin provoked God to withdraw his protection, and then it was as weak as other cities. Zedekiah had his eyes put out; so he was condemned to darkness who had shut his eyes against the clear light of God's word. Those who will not believe God's words, will be convinced by the event. Observe the wonderful changes of Providence, how uncertain are earthly possessions; and see the just dealings of Providence: but whether the Lord makes men poor or rich, nothing will profit them while they cleave to their sins.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/39.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Compare the marginal reference.

Riblah was at a great distance from Babylon, where the king was at this time, probably to be nearer his army while the siege lasted at Jerusalem, and to give orders about it, and to divert himself, the place being a pleasant place, and the king not willing to trouble himself about the siege to go thither in person; but the siege being over, he now removeth to Babylon, and carrieth Zedekiah and the rest of the prisoners along with him. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/39.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Moreover he put out Zedekiah's eyes,....

These three verses, to which the last clause of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-28.htm">Jeremiah 38:28</a> belongs, form one period, broken up by a pretty long piece inserted in it, on the beginning and duration of the siege of Jerusalem; so that, after the introductory clause &#1493;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492; &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;(  equals  &#1493;&#1497;&#1492;&#1497; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-11.htm">Jeremiah 37:11</a>), <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-28.htm">Jeremiah 38:28</a>, the conclusion does not come till the word &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1489;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-3.htm">Jeremiah 39:3</a>. In the parenthesis, the length of the siege, as stated, substantially agrees with <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-4.htm">Jeremiah 52:4-7</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-1.htm">2 Kings 25:1-4</a>, only that in these passages the time when the siege began is further determined by the mention of the day of the month, &#1500;&#1495;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473; be &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1512;, which words are omitted here. The siege, then, lasted eighteen months, all but one day. After the besiegers had penetrated into the city through the breaches made in the wall, the princes, i.e., the chief generals, took up their position at "the gate of the midst." &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;, "they sat down," i.e., took up a position, fixed their quarters. "The gate of the midst," which is mentioned only in this passage, is supposed, and perhaps rightly, to have been a gate in the wall which divided the city of Zion from the lower city; from this point, the two portions of the city, the upper and the lower city, could most easily be commanded.<p>With regard to the names of the Babylonian princes, it is remarkable (1) that the name Nergal-sharezer occurs twice, the first time without any designation, the second time with the official title of chief magician; (2) that the name Samgar-nebo has the name of God (Nebo or Nebu) in the second half, whereas in all other compounds of this kind that are known to us, Nebu forms the first portion of the name, as in Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuzaradan, Nebushasban (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-13.htm">Jeremiah 39:13</a>), Naboned, Nabonassar, Nabopolassar, etc.; (3) from this name, too, is omitted the title of office, while we find one with the following name. Moreover (4) in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-13.htm">Jeremiah 39:13</a>, where the Babylonian grandees are again spoken of, instead of the four names, only three are given, but every one of them with a title of office; and only the third of these, Nergal-sharezer, the chief magician, is identical with the one who is named last in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-3.htm">Jeremiah 39:3</a>; while Nebushasban is mentioned instead of the Sarsechim of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-3.htm">Jeremiah 39:3</a> as &#1512;&#1489;&#1470;&#1505;&#1512;&#1497;&#1505;, chief of the eunuchs (high chamberlain); and in place of Nergal-sharezer, Samgar-nebo, we find Nebuzaradan as the commander of the body-guards (&#1512;&#1489; &#1496;&#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1497;&#1501;). On these four grounds, Hitzig infers that <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-3.htm">Jeremiah 39:3</a>, in the passage before us, has been corrupted, and that it contained originally only the names of three persons, with their official titles. Moreover, he supposes that &#1505;&#1502;&#1490;&#1468;&#1512; is formed from the Persian ja&#770;m and the derivation-syllable kr, Pers. war, and means "he who has or holds the cup," the cup-bearer; thus corresponding to &#1512;&#1489; &#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1492; ot gnidnop, Rab-shakeh, "chief cup-bearer," <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-17.htm">2 Kings 18:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-2.htm">Isaiah 36:2</a>. He also considers &#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1505;&#1499;&#1497;&#1501; a Hebraizing form of &#1512;&#1489; &#1505;&#1512;&#1497;&#1505;; &#1505;&#1499;&#1492; or &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1492;, "to cut," by transposition from &#1495;&#1510;&#1492;, Arab. chts&#803;y, from which comes chats&#803;iyun, "a eunuch,"  equals  &#1505;&#1499;&#1497;, plur. &#1505;&#1499;&#1497;&#1501;; hence &#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1505;&#1499;&#1497;&#1501;  equals  &#1512;&#1489; &#1505;&#1512;&#1497;&#1505;, of which the former has been a marginal gloss, afterwards received into the text. This complicated combination, however, by which Hitzig certainly makes out two official titles, though he retains no more than the divine name Nebu as that of Rabsaris, is founded upon two very hazardous conjectures. Nor do these conjectures gain much support from the renewal of the attempt, made about fifty years since by the late P. von Bohlen, to explain from the Neo-Persian the names of persons and titles occurring in the Assyrian and Old-Babylonian languages, an attempt which has long since been looked upon as scientifically unwarranted. Strange as it may seem that the two persons first named are not further specified by the addition of an official title, yet the supposition that the persons named in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-3.htm">Isaiah 36:3</a> are identical with those mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-13.htm">Isaiah 36:13</a> is erroneous, since it stands in contradiction with <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-12.htm">Jeremiah 52:12</a>, which even Hitzig recognises as historically reliable. According to <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-12.htm">Jeremiah 52:12</a>, Nebuzaradan, who is the first mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-13.htm">Jeremiah 39:13</a>, was not present at the taking of Jerusalem, and did not reach the city till four weeks afterwards; he was ordered by Nebuchadnezzar to superintend arrangements for the destruction of Jerusalem, and also to make arrangements for the transportation of the captives to Babylon, and for the administration of the country now being laid waste. But in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-3.htm">Jeremiah 39:3</a> are named the generals who, when the city had bee taken by storm, took up their position within it. - Nor do the other difficulties, mentioned above, compel us to make such harsh conjectures. If Nergal-sharezer be the name of a person, compounded of two words, the divine name, Nergal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-30.htm">2 Kings 17:30</a>), and Sharezer, probably dominator tuebitur (see Delitzsch on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-38.htm">Isaiah 37:38</a>), then Samgar-Nebu-Sarsechim may possibly be a proper name compounded of three words. So long as we are unable with certainty to explain the words &#1505;&#1502;&#1490;&#1468;&#1512; and &#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1505;&#1499;&#1497;&#1501; out of the Assyrian, we can form no decisive judgment regarding them. But not even does the hypothesis of Hitzig account for the occurrence twice over of the name Nergal-sharezer. The Nergal-sharezer mentioned in the first passage was, no doubt, the commander-in-chief of the besieging army; but it could hardly be maintained, with anything like convincing power, that this officer could not bear the same name as that of the chief magician. And if it be conceded that there are really errors in the strange words &#1505;&#1502;&#1490;&#1468;&#1512;&#1470;&#1504;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468; and &#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1505;&#1499;&#1497;&#1501;, we are as yet without the necessary means of correcting them, and obtaining the proper text.</body></html>
