The intention of the king was apparently to make his way to the ford near Jericho, cross the river, and escape to the open country of Gilead.<p><span class= "bld">Riblah in the land of Hamath.</span>—The city of Hamath stood on the Orontes, about half-way from its source, near <span class= "ital">Baalbek, </span>to the bend which it makes at <span class= "ital">Jisr-hadid, </span>and commanded the whole valley of the river to the defile of Daphne, below Antioch. It was a well-known city at the time of the Exodus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-21.htm" title="So they went up, and searched the land from the wilderness of Zin to Rehob, as men come to Hamath.">Numbers 13:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/34-8.htm" title="From mount Hor you shall point out your border to the entrance of Hamath; and the goings forth of the border shall be to Zedad:">Numbers 34:8</a>), and in that of David was the capital of a kingdom, which became tributary to him and Solomon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-10.htm" title="Then Toi sent Joram his son to king David, to salute him, and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer, and smitten him: for Hadadezer had wars with Toi.

Riblah (still retaining its name, <span class= "ital">Ribleh</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>also on the Orontes, and near its source, was a centre from which the great lines of traffic led by the Euphrates to Nineveh, by Palmyra <span class= "ital">to </span>Babylon, by Lebanon and the coast to Palestine and Egypt, and through the Jordan valley to the Holy Land. It was, therefore, a natural post of observation for the Chaldæan king while his generals were carrying on the sieges of Tyre and Jerusalem. So when Pharaoh-necho was for a time, before the battle of Carchemish, master of the Assyrian territory, it was to Riblah that he summoned Jehoahaz, and there imprisoned him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-33.htm" title="And Pharaohnechoh put him in bands at Riblah in the land of Hamath, that he might not reign in Jerusalem; and put the land to a tribute of an hundred talents of silver, and a talent of gold.">2Kings 23:33</a>). In this instance Zedekiah was brought before Nebuchadnezzar as a vassal prince who, having received his authority from the Chaldæan king (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-17.htm" title="And the king of Babylon made Mattaniah his father's brother king in his stead, and changed his name to Zedekiah.">2Kings 24:17</a>), had rebelled, and met with scant mercy.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/39.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>39:1-10 Jerusalem was so strong, that the inhabitants believed the enemy could never enter it. But sin provoked God to withdraw his protection, and then it was as weak as other cities. Zedekiah had his eyes put out; so he was condemned to darkness who had shut his eyes against the clear light of God's word. Those who will not believe God's words, will be convinced by the event. Observe the wonderful changes of Providence, how uncertain are earthly possessions; and see the just dealings of Providence: but whether the Lord makes men poor or rich, nothing will profit them while they cleave to their sins.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/39.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Compare the marginal reference.

It is not usual for princes upon conquests to sit in judgment upon princes conquered, but the reason of it in this case was because Zedekiah was a tributary to the king of Babylon, and so subject to his power, having made a covenant with him, and secured his allegiance by his oath to him, and then rebelled against him, as we read, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/17-13.htm" title="And has taken of the king's seed, and made a covenant with him, and has taken an oath of him: he has also taken the mighty of the land:...">Ezekiel 17:13-18</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/39.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But the Chaldean army pursued after them,.... Being informed of the flight of them, by those who surrendered to them, as Josephus says; or not finding the king, his family, nobles, and guards, at the palace, where they expected them; and, knowing which way they must take, pursued after them; not the whole army, only a part of it; for some must remain at Jerusalem to demolish the city, and take the spoil of it: <p>and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; not far from it, as Josephus says; and who also observes, that when his friends and generals saw the enemy near, they left him, and shifted for themselves, and only a few were with him when overtook: <p>and when they had taken him they brought him to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath: which is generally thought to be Antioch in Syria; whither he had retired from the siege of Jerusalem, having left it to his generals to refresh himself in this pleasant place, as it seems it was; or that he might be nearer his own kingdom, if any troubles should arise in it during his absence; however, here he was, and here the army brought Zedekiah to him, and those they took with him; which must be very agreeable to the king of Babylon to have this perfidious and ungrateful prince in his power: <p>where he gave judgment upon him: or passed sentence on him, which was to have his eyes put out: or, "spake judgments with him" (i); he severely chide him, and upbraided him for the injury he had done him; the perfidy he had been guilty of in breaking his oath and covenant. So Josephus says, <p>"after he came to him, Nebuchadnezzar began to call him a wicked man and a covenant breaker, unmindful of promises he had made to preserve the country for him; he reproached him with ingratitude, in receiving the kingdom from him he had taken from Jehoiakim, and given to him, who had used his power against the giver; but, says he, the great God that hates thy manners has put thee into our hands.'' <p>(i)   "et locutus est cum eo, vel ipso judicia", Pagninus, Montanus, Cocceius, Schmidt. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/39.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But the Chaldeans' army pursued them, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho: and when they had taken him, they brought him to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> Riblah in the land of Hamath, where he gave judgment upon him.</span><p>(c) Which is called Antioch in Syria.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/39.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">5</span>. <span class="ital">the plains of Jericho</span>] the W. side of the Arabah.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Riblah</span>] (<span class="ital">Ribleh</span>) between the mountain ranges of Lebanon and Hermon.
