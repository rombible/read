The question whether it is such a continuation has been variously answered by different commentators. On the one hand, the conditional threatenings are said to imply an earlier stage of Jeremiah’s work than the doom, absolute and unconditional, pronounced in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/21-1.htm" title="The word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD, when king Zedekiah sent to him Pashur the son of Melchiah, and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, saying,">Jeremiah 21:1-10</a>, and so have led men to refer the message to the earlier years of Jehoiakim. On the other, it is urged that the words may have the character of a last promise, and therefore a last warning.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/jeremiah/21.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/21-11.htm" title="And touching the house of the king of Judah, say, Hear you the word of the LORD;...">Jeremiah 21:11-12</a></span>. <span class="ital">And touching the house of the king of Judah, </span>&c. — The house of Zedekiah, the court, or those who were magistrates. <span class="ital">Hear ye the word of the Lord </span>— These, how great soever, are not excused from the common obligations which lie upon all to listen to and obey the revelations of the divine will. <span class="ital">Execute judgment in the morning </span>— Do it diligently, do it quickly, and do not delay to do justice upon appeals made to you, and tire out your poor petitioners as you have done. Those magistrates that would fill their places well, and do their duty, must rise early. This is so expressed because it was usual for kings and judges to sit for the administration of justice in a morning. <span class="ital">Lest my fury go out like fire </span>— Many commentators have been of opinion that this prophecy, from the 11th verse, belongs to the same subject with chapter 22., and relates to the time of Jehoiakim. And from these words, <span class="ital">lest my fury, </span>&c., they infer, that it was antecedent to the prophecy at the beginning of the chapter, and to that peremptory decree published against the king’s house, mentioned <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-7.htm" title="And afterward, said the LORD, I will deliver Zedekiah king of Judah, and his servants, and the people, and such as are left in this city from the pestilence, from the sword, and from the famine, into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of those that seek their life: and he shall smite them with the edge of the sword; he shall not spare them, neither have pity, nor have mercy.">Jeremiah 21:7</a> of this chapter, “But I cannot help thinking,” says Blaney, “that this latter part is but a continuation of the same prophecy with which the chapter begins; for the house of David was still to be visited with more calamities than those which had befallen it in the days of Jehoiakim. And how peremptory soever the decree may sound, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-7.htm" title="And afterward, said the LORD, I will deliver Zedekiah king of Judah, and his servants, and the people, and such as are left in this city from the pestilence, from the sword, and from the famine, into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of those that seek their life: and he shall smite them with the edge of the sword; he shall not spare them, neither have pity, nor have mercy.">Jeremiah 21:7</a>,) we must remember the rule laid down concerning such decrees, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/18-7.htm" title="At what instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to pluck up, and to pull down, and to destroy it;...">Jeremiah 18:7-8</a>,) none of which, it seems, are irreversible on the condition of a change of conduct. And, though God may well be supposed to know when no such ground of reversal will take place, yet it is agreeable to the justice of his providence repeatedly to admonish sinners of the means by which his judgments may be avoided, that they may have none to blame but themselves when the threatened vengeance overtakes them.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/21.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>21:11-14 The wickedness of the king and his family was the worse because of their relation to David.

The answer to the king's hope that the Lord will save Jerusalem from the Chaldeans (<a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-4.htm">Jeremiah 21:4-7</a>); b. The counsel given to the people and the royal family as to how they may avert ruin (<a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-8.htm">Jeremiah 21:8-12</a>); c. The prediction that Jerusalem will be punished for her sins (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-13.htm">Jeremiah 21:13</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-14.htm">Jeremiah 21:14</a>).<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-3.htm">Jeremiah 21:3-6</a><p>The answer. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-3.htm">Jeremiah 21:3</a>. "And Jeremiah said to them: Thus shall ye say to Zedekiah: <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-4.htm">Jeremiah 21:4</a>. Thus hath Jahveh the God of Israel said: Behold, I turn back the weapons of war that are in your hands, wherewith ye fight against the king of Babylon and the Chaldeans, which besiege you without the walls, and gather them together into the midst of this city. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-5.htm">Jeremiah 21:5</a>. And I fight against you with outstretched hand and strong arm, and with anger and fury and great wrath, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-6.htm">Jeremiah 21:6</a>. And smite the inhabitants of this city, both man and beast; of a great plague they shall die. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-7.htm">Jeremiah 21:7</a>. And afterward, saith Jahveh, I will give Zedekiah the king of Judah, and his servants, and the people - namely, such as in this city are left of the plague, of the sword, and of the famine - into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of those that seek after their life, that he may smite them according to the sharpness of the sword, not spare them, neither have pity nor mercy." This answer is intended to disabuse the king and his servants of all hope of help from God. So far from saving them from the Chaldeans, God will fight against them, will drive back into the city its defenders that are still holding out without the walls against the enemy; consume the inhabitants by sword, pestilence, famine; deliver the king, with his servants and all that survive inside the lines of the besiegers, into the hand of the latter, and unsparingly cause them to be put to death. "I make the weapons of war turn back" is carried on and explained by "I gather them into the city." The sense is: I will bring it about that ye, who still fight without the walls against the beleaguerers, must turn back with your weapons and retreat into the city. "Without the walls" is not to be joined to &#1502;&#1505;&#1489;, because this is too remote, and &#1502;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509; is by usage locative, not ablative. It should go with "wherewith ye fight," etc.: wherewith ye fight without the walls against the beleaguering enemies. The siege had but just begun, so that the Jews were still trying to hinder the enemy from taking possession of stronger positions and from a closer blockade of the city. In this they will not succeed, but their weapons will be thrust back into the city.</body></html>
