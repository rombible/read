The desolation wrought by an invading army such as that of Nebuchadnezzar, cutting down the “choice fir-trees of Lebanon and the forest of Carmel” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-23.htm" title="By your messengers you have reproached the LORD, and have said, With the multitude of my chariots I am come up to the height of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon, and will cut down the tall cedar trees thereof, and the choice fir trees thereof: and I will enter into the lodgings of his borders, and into the forest of his Carmel.">2Kings 19:23</a>), showed itself in this destruction of forests in its most conspicuous form, and explains the comparative scarcity of trees in modern Palestine.

"And unto the people thou shalt say: Thus hath Jahveh said: Behold, I set before you the way of life and the way of death. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-9.htm">Jeremiah 21:9</a>. He that abideth in this city shall die by sword, by famine, and by pestilence; but he that goeth out and falleth to the Chaldeans that besiege you, he shall live, and have his soul for a prey. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-10.htm">Jeremiah 21:10</a>. For I have set my face on this city for evil and not for good, saith Jahveh; into the hand of the king of Babylon shall it be given, who shall burn it with fire. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-11.htm">Jeremiah 21:11</a>. And to the house of the king of Judah: Hear the word of Jahveh: <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-12.htm">Jeremiah 21:12</a>. House of David! thus hath Jahveh said: Hold judgment every morning, and save the despoiled out of the hand of the oppressor, lest my fury break forth as fire, and burn unquenchably, because of the evil of your doings." What the prophet is here to say to the people and the royal house is not directly addressed to the king's envoy, but is closely connected with the answer he was to give to the latter, and serves to strengthen the same. We need not be hampered by the assumption that Jeremiah, immediately after that answer, communicated this advice, so that it might be made known to the people and to the royal house. The counsel given in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-8.htm">Jeremiah 21:8-12</a> to the people was during the siege repeatedly given by Jeremiah both to the king and to the people, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-1.htm">Jeremiah 38:1</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-17.htm">Jeremiah 38:17</a>., and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-11.htm">Jeremiah 27:11</a>., and many of the people acted by his advice, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-19.htm">Jeremiah 38:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-9.htm">Jeremiah 39:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-15.htm">Jeremiah 52:15</a>. But the defenders of the city, the authorities, saw therein treason, or at least a highly dangerous discouragement to those who were fighting, and accused the prophet as a traitor, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-4.htm">Jeremiah 38:4</a>., cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-13.htm">Jeremiah 37:13</a>. Still Jeremiah, holding his duty higher than his life, remained in the city, and gave as his opinion, under conviction attained to only by divine revelation, that all resistance is useless, since God has irrevocably decreed the destruction of Jerusalem as a punishment for their sins. The idea of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-7.htm">Jeremiah 21:7</a> is clothed in words taken from <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/30-15.htm">Deuteronomy 30:15</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-26.htm">Deuteronomy 11:26</a>. &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489; , <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-9.htm">Jeremiah 21:9</a>, as opposed to &#1497;&#1510;&#1488;, does not mean: to dwell, but: to sit still, abide. To fall to the Chaldeans, i.e., to go over to them, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-14.htm">Jeremiah 37:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-9.htm">Jeremiah 39:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-11.htm">2 Kings 25:11</a>; &#1506;&#1500; is interchanged with &#1488;&#1500;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-13.htm">Jeremiah 37:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-19.htm">Jeremiah 38:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-15.htm">Jeremiah 52:15</a>. The Chet. &#1497;&#1495;&#1497;&#1492; is right, corresponding to &#1497;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;; the Keri &#1493;&#1495;&#1497;&#1492; is wrong. His life shall be to him for a prey, i.e., he shall carry it thence as a prey, i.e., preserve it. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-10.htm">Jeremiah 21:10</a> gives the reason for the advice given. For I have set my face, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-11.htm">Jeremiah 44:11</a>, recalls <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/9-4.htm">Amos 9:4</a>, only there we have &#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497; for &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-6.htm">Jeremiah 24:6</a>. To set the face or eye on one means: to pay special heed to him, in good (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-12.htm">Jeremiah 39:12</a>) or in evil sense; hence the addition, "for evil," etc.</body></html>
