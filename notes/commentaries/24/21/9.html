They were, however, acted on by not a few (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-9.htm" title="Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive into Babylon the remnant of the people that remained in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to him, with the rest of the people that remained.">Jeremiah 39:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-15.htm" title="Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive certain of the poor of the people, and the residue of the people that remained in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the multitude.">Jeremiah 52:15</a>).<p><span class= "bld">His life shall be unto him for a prey.</span>—The phrase is characteristic of Jeremiah, and forcibly illustrates the misery of the time. Life itself was not a secure possession, but as the spoil which a man seizes on the field of battle, and with which he hastens away, lest another should deprive him of it. It occurs again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-18.htm" title="For I will surely deliver you, and you shall not fall by the sword, but your life shall be for a prey to you: because you have put your trust in me, said the LORD.">Jeremiah 39:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/45-5.htm" title="And seek you great things for yourself? seek them not: for, behold, I will bring evil on all flesh, said the LORD: but your life will I give to you for a prey in all places where you go.">Jeremiah 45:5</a>.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/21.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>21:1-10 When the siege had begun, Zedekiah sent to ask of Jeremiah respecting the event. In times of distress and danger, men often seek those to counsel and pray for them, whom, at other times, they despise and oppose; but they only seek deliverance from punishment. When professors continue in disobedience, presuming upon outward privileges, let them be told that the Lord will prosper his open enemies against them. As the king and his princes would not surrender, the people are exhorted to do so. No sinner on earth is left without a Refuge, who really desires one; but the way of life is humbling, it requires self-denial, and exposes to difficulties.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He that ... falleth to the Chaldeans - This was to counsel desertion, and would have been treason in an ordinary man: but the prophets Spoke with an authority above that even of the king, and constantly interfered in political matters with summary decisiveness.

The counsel given to the people and the royal family as to how they may avert ruin (<a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-8.htm">Jeremiah 21:8-12</a>); c. The prediction that Jerusalem will be punished for her sins (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-13.htm">Jeremiah 21:13</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-14.htm">Jeremiah 21:14</a>).<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-3.htm">Jeremiah 21:3-6</a><p>The answer. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-3.htm">Jeremiah 21:3</a>. "And Jeremiah said to them: Thus shall ye say to Zedekiah: <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-4.htm">Jeremiah 21:4</a>. Thus hath Jahveh the God of Israel said: Behold, I turn back the weapons of war that are in your hands, wherewith ye fight against the king of Babylon and the Chaldeans, which besiege you without the walls, and gather them together into the midst of this city. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-5.htm">Jeremiah 21:5</a>. And I fight against you with outstretched hand and strong arm, and with anger and fury and great wrath, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-6.htm">Jeremiah 21:6</a>. And smite the inhabitants of this city, both man and beast; of a great plague they shall die. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-7.htm">Jeremiah 21:7</a>. And afterward, saith Jahveh, I will give Zedekiah the king of Judah, and his servants, and the people - namely, such as in this city are left of the plague, of the sword, and of the famine - into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of those that seek after their life, that he may smite them according to the sharpness of the sword, not spare them, neither have pity nor mercy." This answer is intended to disabuse the king and his servants of all hope of help from God. So far from saving them from the Chaldeans, God will fight against them, will drive back into the city its defenders that are still holding out without the walls against the enemy; consume the inhabitants by sword, pestilence, famine; deliver the king, with his servants and all that survive inside the lines of the besiegers, into the hand of the latter, and unsparingly cause them to be put to death. "I make the weapons of war turn back" is carried on and explained by "I gather them into the city." The sense is: I will bring it about that ye, who still fight without the walls against the beleaguerers, must turn back with your weapons and retreat into the city. "Without the walls" is not to be joined to &#1502;&#1505;&#1489;, because this is too remote, and &#1502;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509; is by usage locative, not ablative. It should go with "wherewith ye fight," etc.: wherewith ye fight without the walls against the beleaguering enemies. The siege had but just begun, so that the Jews were still trying to hinder the enemy from taking possession of stronger positions and from a closer blockade of the city. In this they will not succeed, but their weapons will be thrust back into the city.</body></html>
