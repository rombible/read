If they had attended to the predictions of the prophets they would not have made this inquiry of Jeremiah; for all the things which had happened to them already, had been predicted by the prophets. But perhaps they flattered themselves that all God’s threatenings would not be executed; or that they had been executed already, in great numbers of them being carried into captivity, first in the reign of Jehoiakim, and afterward in that of Jehoiachin.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/21.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>21:1-10 When the siege had begun, Zedekiah sent to ask of Jeremiah respecting the event. In times of distress and danger, men often seek those to counsel and pray for them, whom, at other times, they despise and oppose; but they only seek deliverance from punishment. When professors continue in disobedience, presuming upon outward privileges, let them be told that the Lord will prosper his open enemies against them. As the king and his princes would not surrender, the people are exhorted to do so. No sinner on earth is left without a Refuge, who really desires one; but the way of life is humbling, it requires self-denial, and exposes to difficulties.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Nebuchadrezzar - A more correct way of spelling the name than Nebuchadnezzar.<p>According to all his wondrous works - The king and his envoys expected some such answer as Isaiah had given on a former occasion <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-6.htm">Isaiah 37:6</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2.

It is true, the greatest contemners of God and his faithful ministers will sometimes, in great straits, choose to send for them rather than those who in their prosperity pleased them. Hence we read of Saul, when he went to the witch at Endor, desiring that Samuel might be raised up. But in Zedekiah’s whole story we read no such eminent contempt of God, but a disobedience to the commands of God, proceeding rather from his easiness to be ruled by his corrupt court, than from a stubbornness in himself. By mentioning God’s former <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">wondrous works, </span> possibly he may have a respect to God’s raising Sennacherib’s siege in the time of his grandfather Hezekiah. The remembering of God’s former wondrous works is of use to raise in us a hope and confidence in God for further deliverances, supposing ourselves under the same circumstances of obedience to God’s will; otherwise not, as we shall see in the case of Judah and its king at this time; therefore Zedekiah saith, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">if so be.</span> Guilt of sin hinders confidence and holy boldness in the best: but as the guilt is greater, so the hope or confidence of any is justly less. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/21.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Inquire, I pray thee, of the Lord for us,....

"Cursed be the day wherein I was born! The day my mother bare me, let it not be blessed! <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-15.htm">Jeremiah 20:15</a>. Cursed be the man that brought the good tidings to my father, saying: A man-child is born to thee, who made him very glad. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-16.htm">Jeremiah 20:16</a>. Let that man be as the cities which Jahveh overthrew without repenting; let him hear crying in the morning and a war-cry at noon-tide, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-17.htm">Jeremiah 20:17</a>. Because he slew me not from the womb, and so my mother should have been my grave, and her womb should have been always great. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-18.htm">Jeremiah 20:18</a>. Wherefore am I come forth out of the womb to see hardship and sorrow, and that my days should wear away in shame?"<p>Inasmuch as the foregoing lamentation had ended in assured hope of deliverance, and in the praise rendered to God therefor, it seems surprising that now there should follow curses on the day of his birth, without any hint to show that at the end this temptation, too, had been overcome. For this reason Ew. wishes to rearrange the two parts of the complaint, setting <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-14.htm">Jeremiah 20:14-18</a> before <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-7.htm">Jeremiah 20:7-12</a>. This transposition he holds to be so unquestionably certain, that he speaks of the order ad numbering of the verses in the text as an example, clear as it is remarkable, of displacement. But against this hypothesis we have to consider the improbability that, if individual copyists had omitted the second portion (<a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-14.htm">Jeremiah 20:14-18</a>) or written it on the margin, others should have introduced it into an unsuitable place. Copyists did not go to work with the biblical text in such an arbitrary and clumsy fashion. Nor is the position occupied by the piece in question so incomprehensible as Ew. imagines. The cursing of the day of his birth, or of his life, after the preceding exaltation to hopeful assurance is not psychologically inconceivable. It may well be understood, if we but think of the two parts of the lamentation as not following one another in the prophet's soul in such immediate succession as they do in the text; if we regard them as spiritual struggles, separated by an interval of time, through which the prophet must successively pass. In vanquishing the temptation that arose from the plots of his enemies against his life, Jeremiah had a strong support in the promise which the Lord gave him at his call, that those who strove against him should not prevail against him; and the deliverance out of the hand of Pashur which he had just experience, must have given him an actual proof that the Lord was fulfilling His promise. The feeling of this might fill the trembling heart with strength to conquer his temptation, and to elevate himself again, in the joyful confidence of faith, to the praising of the Lord, who delivers the soul of the poor from the hand of the ungodly. But the power of the temptation was not finally vanquished by the renewal of his confidence that the Lord will defend him against all his foes. The unsuccess of his mission might stir up sore struggles in his soul, and not only rob him of all heart to continue his labours, but excite bitter discontent with a life full or hardship and sorrow - a discontent which found vent in his cursing the day of his birth.<p>The curse uttered in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-14.htm">Jeremiah 20:14-18</a> against the day of his birth, while it reminds us of the verses, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-3.htm">Jeremiah 3:3</a>., in which Job curses the day of his conception and of his birth, is markedly distinguished in form and substance from that dreadful utterance of Job's. Job's words are much more violent and passionate, and are turned directly against God, who has given life to him, to a man whose way is hid, whom God hath hedged round. Jeremiah, on the other hand, curses first the day of his birth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-14.htm">Jeremiah 20:14</a>), then the man that brought his father the joyful news of the birth of a son (<a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-15.htm">Jeremiah 20:15-17</a>), because his life is passing away in hardship, trials, sorrow, and shame, without expressly blaming God as the author of that life.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-14.htm">Jeremiah 20:14</a><p>The day on which I was born, let it be cursed and not blessed, sc. because life has never been a blessing to me. Job wishes that the day of his birth and the night of his conception may perish, be annihilated.</body></html>
