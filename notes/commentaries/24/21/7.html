In times of distress and danger, men often seek those to counsel and pray for them, whom, at other times, they despise and oppose; but they only seek deliverance from punishment. When professors continue in disobedience, presuming upon outward privileges, let them be told that the Lord will prosper his open enemies against them. As the king and his princes would not surrender, the people are exhorted to do so. No sinner on earth is left without a Refuge, who really desires one; but the way of life is humbling, it requires self-denial, and exposes to difficulties.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A great pestilence - As the result of the excessive crowding of men and animals in a confined space with all sanitary regulations utterly neglected. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. the people, and such&#8212;rather, explanatory, "the people," namely, "such as are left."<p>seek their life&#8212;content with nothing short of their death; not content with plundering and enslaving them.<p>smite with &#8230; sword&#8212;This was the fate of Zedekiah's sons and many of the Jewish nobles.

The heading specifying the occasion for the following prediction. "The word of the Lord came to Jeremiah when King Zedekiah sent unto him Pashur the son of Malchiah, and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, saying: Inquire now of Jahveh for us, for Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon maketh war against us; if so be that the Lord will deal with us according to all His wondrous works, that he may go up from us." The fighting of Nebuchadrezzar is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-4.htm">Jeremiah 21:4</a> stated to be the besieging of the city. From this it appears that the siege had begun ere the king sent the two men to the prophet. Pashur the son of Malchiah is held by Hitz., Graf, Ng., etc., to be a distinguished priest of the class of Malchiah. But this is without sufficient reason; for he is not called a priest, as is the case with Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah, and with Pashur the son of Immer (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-1.htm">Jeremiah 21:1</a>). Nor is anything proved by the circumstance that Pashur and Malchiah occur in several places as the names of priests, e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-12.htm">1 Chronicles 9:12</a>; for both names are also used of persons not priests, e.g., Malchiah, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/10-25.htm">Ezra 10:25</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/10-31.htm">Ezra 10:31</a>, and Pashur, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-1.htm">Jeremiah 38:1</a>, where this son of Gedaliah is certainly a laic. From this passage, where Pashur ben Malchiah appears again, it is clear that the four men there named, who accused Jeremiah for his speech, were government authorities or court officials, since in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-4.htm">Jeremiah 38:4</a> they are called &#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;. Ros. is therefore right in saying of the Pashur under consideration: videtur unus ex principibus sive aulicis fuisse, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-4.htm">Jeremiah 38:4</a>. Only Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah is called priest; and he, acc. to <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-25.htm">Jeremiah 29:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-3.htm">Jeremiah 37:3</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-24.htm">Jeremiah 52:24</a>, held a high position in the priesthood. Inquire for us of Jahveh, i.e., ask for a revelation for us, as <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-13.htm">2 Kings 22:13</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-22.htm">Genesis 25:22</a>. It is not: pray for His help on our behalf, which is expressed by &#1492;&#1514;&#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1500; &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1491;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-3.htm">Jeremiah 37:3</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-2.htm">Jeremiah 52:2</a>. In the request for a revelation the element of intercession is certainly not excluded, but it is not directly expressed. But it is on this that the king founds his hope: Peradventure Jahveh will do with us (&#1488;&#1493;&#1514;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; for &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;) according to all His wondrous works, i.e., in the miraculous manner in which He has so often saved us, e.g., under Hezekiah, and also, during the blockade of the city by Sennacherib, had recourse to the prophet Isaiah and besought his intercession with the Lord, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-2.htm">2 Kings 19:2</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-2.htm">Isaiah 37:2</a>. That he (Nebuch.) may go up from us. &#1506;&#1500;&#1492;, to march against a city in order to besiege it or take it, but with &#1502;&#1506;&#1500;, to withdraw from it, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-5.htm">Jeremiah 37:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-19.htm">1 Kings 15:19</a>. As to the name Nebuchadrezzar, which corresponds more exactly than the Aramaic-Jewish Nebuchadnezzar with the Nebucadurriusur of the inscriptions (&#1504;&#1489;&#1493; &#1499;&#1491;&#1512; &#1488;&#1510;&#1512;, i.e., Nebo coronam servat), see Comm. on Daniel at <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/1-1.htm">Daniel 1:1</a>. </body></html>
