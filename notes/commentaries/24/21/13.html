There seems no adequate reason for taking the words as symbolising the kingly house of Judah, but it is probable enough that local associations, palaces on the hill or in the valley, may have given the words a specially pointed application.<span class= "bld"><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/jeremiah/21.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/21-13.htm" title="Behold, I am against you, O inhabitant of the valley, and rock of the plain, said the LORD; which say, Who shall come down against us? or who shall enter into our habitations?...">Jeremiah 21:13-14</a></span>. <span class="ital">Behold, I am against thee, O inhabitant of the valley, and rock of the plain </span>— A description of Jerusalem, which was built in part upon the rocky mountain of Zion, but a great part of it was in the valley; and the higher mountains about mount Zion made that mountain itself, in comparison with them, to appear as a valley. <span class="ital">Which say, Who shall come down against us? </span>— They confided in the strength of their situation, as the Jebusites, the ancient inhabitants of the place, had formerly done. “Yet how many times,” says Bishop Newton, “was Jerusalem taken, though it was a very strong place and wonderfully fortified, both by nature and art!

The "valley" between Mount Zion and Moriah is called Tyropœon. Robinson takes, "rock of the plain" as Mount Zion, on which is a level tract of some extent.

It was evidently held by the compiler who placed it here to refer to Jerusalem. But that city is not in a “valley”, nor is it upon a “rock” rising out of a tableland “plain.” Neither can a foe be said to “come down” upon it. Dr. suggests that, as the word rendered “plain” is commonly used of the tableland upon which the principal cities of Moab lay (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-8.htm" title="And the spoiler shall come on every city, and no city shall escape: the valley also shall perish, and the plain shall be destroyed, as the LORD has spoken.">Jeremiah 48:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-21.htm" title="And judgment is come on the plain country; on Holon, and on Jahazah, and on Mephaath,">Jeremiah 48:21</a>), it is possible that the <span class="ital">v</span>. was originally written with reference to some other city.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - Jehovah, standing, as it were, on the Mount of Olives, addresses the proud city beneath him. <span class="cmt_word">O inhabitant of the valley, and rock of the plain</span>; rather, <span class="accented">O inhabitress</span>; Jerusalem is personified as a virgin. The poetical description of the capital as a "valley" (the word, however, signifies a valley as wide as a plain) reminds us of "the valley [or rather, 'ravine'] of vision" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-1.htm">Isaiah 22:1, 5</a>); While "the rock of the plain" recalls "my mountain in the field" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-3.htm">Jeremiah 17:3</a>). So, as Graf points out, Babylon is called "a mountain" in metaphorical language (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-25.htm">Jeremiah 51:25</a>). It is, however, singular that the prophet should call Jerusalem a "valley" and a "rock" in the same passage. In the former, perhaps, Jeremiah is thinking specially of the lower city, and in the latter of Mount Zion. <span class="cmt_word">Who shall come down against us</span>? viz. from the "hills round about Jerusalem." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/21.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Lord will make known His almighty power not for the rescue but for the chastisement of Judah.

The inhabitants of Jerusalem are to perish during the siege by pestilence and disease, and the remainder, including the king and his servants, to be mercilessly massacred.
