To rise at dawn of day, to sit in the gate and listen to the complaints of those who had been wronged, was the surest way to gain the affection of his people. It was David’s neglect of this that gave an opening for the rebellion of Absalom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-2.htm" title="And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate: and it was so, that when any man that had a controversy came to the king for judgment, then Absalom called to him, and said, Of what city are you? And he said, Your servant is of one of the tribes of Israel.">2Samuel 15:2</a>). Solomon’s early fame for wisdom rested on his discharge of this duty (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-28.htm" title="And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged; and they feared the king: for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him, to do judgment.">1Kings 3:28</a>). If the king remained slothfully in his palace in those golden hours of morning, the noon-tide heat made it impossible for him to retrieve the lost opportunity. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/4-5.htm" title="And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went, and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ishbosheth, who lay on a bed at noon.">2Samuel 4:5</a>.) Still worse was it when, as with luxurious and sensual kings, the morning hours were given to revelry and feasting (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ecclesiastes/10-16.htm" title="Woe to you, O land, when your king is a child, and your princes eat in the morning!">Ecclesiastes 10:16-17</a>).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/21.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>21:11-14 The wickedness of the king and his family was the worse because of their relation to David.

And as "the oppressor" was generally some powerful noble, it was especially the king's duty to see that the weaker members of the community were not wronged. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. house of David&#8212;the royal family and all in office about the king.

God urges to righteousness, not as if they can thereby escape punishment wholly, but as the condition of a mitigation of it.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/21.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> He calls these the <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">house of David, </span> either checking them, who were indeed so in a lineal descent, or minding them what they ought to be in imitation of their father, David. The only way they had to keep off those Divine judgments which now hanged over their heads was to <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">execute judgment, </span> that is, <span class="ital">justice</span>, without partiality; the prophet’s advice to them <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">to execute judgment in the morning</span> either lets them know they must do it quickly, or else it hath respect to the time when the courts of justice sat. One species of justice was the deliverance of the oppressed from the hands, that is, from the power and malice, of the oppressors; which if it were not done, God threateneth certain ruin and destruction to them, which none should be able to hinder or avoid. The cause of which was, their wicked doings; for that God who doth people good, and showeth them favour, not for their sake, but for his own name’s sake, yet never punisheth them but for a cause found in them. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/21.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>O house of David, thus saith the Lord,.... This appellation is made use of to put them in mind of their descent, and to observe to them how much it became them to follow the example of so illustrious an ancestor, from whom they had the honour to descend; by doing judgment and justice as he did, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-15.htm">2 Samuel 8:15</a>; or, otherwise, their being his seed would not secure them from ruin and destruction: <p>execute judgment in the morning; be at it early, and dispatch it speedily; show a hearty regard for it; prefer it to eating and drinking; and do not delay it to the prejudice of persons concerned. The power of judgment with the Jews belonged to the king; he was supreme judge in their courts; they judged, and were judged, the Jews say (q); by whom judgment was executed in a morning, and not in any other part of the day; and the case judged ought, as they say, to be as clear as the morning (r): <p>and deliver him that is spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor; that had anything taken from him by force or fraud; that was either robbed or cheated of his substance; or was refused what he had lent to or entrusted another with; or was by any ways and means wronged and injured by another in his person or property. This suggests that things of this kind were not done, and were the reason why the Lord would deliver them up into the hands of their enemies, or cause his judgments to fall upon them: <p>lest my fury go out like fire, and burn that none can quench it; or put a stop to it, by all their prayers and entreaties, or by all that they can say or do: <p>because of the evil of your doings; it is a sad thing when princes set bad examples; it is highly provoking to God, whose deputies they are; and it becomes them to begin a reformation, and lead it on, or they cannot expect safety for themselves and their people. <p>(q) T.

The answer to the king's hope that the Lord will save Jerusalem from the Chaldeans (<a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-4.htm">Jeremiah 21:4-7</a>); b. The counsel given to the people and the royal family as to how they may avert ruin (<a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-8.htm">Jeremiah 21:8-12</a>); c. The prediction that Jerusalem will be punished for her sins (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-13.htm">Jeremiah 21:13</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-14.htm">Jeremiah 21:14</a>).<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-3.htm">Jeremiah 21:3-6</a><p>The answer. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-3.htm">Jeremiah 21:3</a>. "And Jeremiah said to them: Thus shall ye say to Zedekiah: <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-4.htm">Jeremiah 21:4</a>. Thus hath Jahveh the God of Israel said: Behold, I turn back the weapons of war that are in your hands, wherewith ye fight against the king of Babylon and the Chaldeans, which besiege you without the walls, and gather them together into the midst of this city. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-5.htm">Jeremiah 21:5</a>. And I fight against you with outstretched hand and strong arm, and with anger and fury and great wrath, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-6.htm">Jeremiah 21:6</a>. And smite the inhabitants of this city, both man and beast; of a great plague they shall die. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-7.htm">Jeremiah 21:7</a>. And afterward, saith Jahveh, I will give Zedekiah the king of Judah, and his servants, and the people - namely, such as in this city are left of the plague, of the sword, and of the famine - into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of those that seek after their life, that he may smite them according to the sharpness of the sword, not spare them, neither have pity nor mercy." This answer is intended to disabuse the king and his servants of all hope of help from God. So far from saving them from the Chaldeans, God will fight against them, will drive back into the city its defenders that are still holding out without the walls against the enemy; consume the inhabitants by sword, pestilence, famine; deliver the king, with his servants and all that survive inside the lines of the besiegers, into the hand of the latter, and unsparingly cause them to be put to death. "I make the weapons of war turn back" is carried on and explained by "I gather them into the city." The sense is: I will bring it about that ye, who still fight without the walls against the beleaguerers, must turn back with your weapons and retreat into the city. "Without the walls" is not to be joined to &#1502;&#1505;&#1489;, because this is too remote, and &#1502;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509; is by usage locative, not ablative. It should go with "wherewith ye fight," etc.: wherewith ye fight without the walls against the beleaguering enemies. The siege had but just begun, so that the Jews were still trying to hinder the enemy from taking possession of stronger positions and from a closer blockade of the city. In this they will not succeed, but their weapons will be thrust back into the city.</body></html>
