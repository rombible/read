The verses that follow are so closely parallel to <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-7.htm" title="So the carpenter encouraged the goldsmith, and he that smoothes with the hammer him that smote the anvil, saying, It is ready for the soldering: and he fastened it with nails, that it should not be moved.">Isaiah 41:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/44-9.htm" title="They that make a graven image are all of them vanity; and their delectable things shall not profit; and they are their own witnesses; they see not, nor know; that they may be ashamed.">Isaiah 44:9-17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/46-5.htm" title="To whom will you liken me, and make me equal, and compare me, that we may be like?">Isaiah 46:5-7</a> (where see Notes), that the natural conclusion is that one writer had seen the work of the other. The grandeur and fulness of Isaiah’s language, and the unlikeness of what we find here to Jeremiah’s usual style, makes it more probable that he was the copyist, and so far adds to the argument for the authorship of the chapter ascribed to Isaiah. It is, however, possible, as some critics have thought, that these verses are an interpolation, and in that case they supply no evidence either way. The fact that they are found in the LXX. as well as in the Hebrew is, however, in favour of their genuineness. It may be noted that the substance of what follows has a parallel in the Epistle ascribed to Jeremiah in the apocryphal book of Baruch.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/jeremiah/10.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/10-3.htm" title="For the customs of the people are vain: for one cuts a tree out of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman, with the ax....">Jeremiah 10:3-5</a></span>. <span class="ital">One cutteth </span>down <span class="ital">a tree, </span>&c. — The prophet here exposes the folly of men’s worshipping the work of their own hands, by arguments similar to those which are used by <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/44-10.htm" title="Who has formed a god, or molten a graven image that is profitable for nothing?...">Isaiah 44:10-20</a>; where see the notes. <span class="ital">They are upright,</span>&c. <span class="ital">— They are like the trunk of the palm-tree </span>— Houb. “They are inflexible, immoveable, fixed, without action or motion, like the trunk of a tree: a comparison which admirably suits the ancient statues seen in Egypt and elsewhere, before the art of sculpture attained the perfection which it afterward did in Greece.” — Calmet.

Be not afraid of them</span> — They can do you no more harm than the signs of heaven could do. The heathen worshipped some idols in order that they might do them good, and others, that they might do them no harm: but God tells them here, that as <span class="ital">they cannot do evil, </span>so <span class="ital">neither is it in them to do good. </span>See note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-23.htm" title="Show the things that are to come hereafter, that we may know that you are gods: yes, do good, or do evil, that we may be dismayed, and behold it together.">Isaiah 41:23</a>. They can neither punish nor reward; they can neither hurt their enemies nor help their friends.

Charms and other attempts to obtain supernatural help, or to pry into futurity, are copied from the wicked customs of the heathen. Let us stand in awe, and not dare provoke God, by giving that glory to another which is due to him alone. He is ready to forgive, and save all who repent and believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ. Faith learns these blessed truths from the word of God; but all knowledge not from that source, leads to doctrines of vanity.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The customs - Better, as the marg, "the ordinances," established institutions, "of the peoples, i. e." pagan nations. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2.
