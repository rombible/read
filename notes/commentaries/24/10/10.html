In opposition to all nominal and fictitious deities, which are not by nature God, only by name, and in the foolish imagination of the people: or, "the Lord God is truth" (t); that cannot lie, is true to his covenant and promises, and will never deceive those that worship and serve him, and rely upon him: <p>he is the living God; that has life in himself, and is the author and giver of life to others; to all men natural life, to some men spiritual and eternal life; whereas the gods of the Gentiles have no life in themselves; are either dead men, or lifeless and inanimate things, stocks and stones, and can give no life to others. The words are in the plural number, "he is the living Gods"; not for the sake of honour and glory, as Kimchi observes; but as denoting a trinity of Persons in the unity of the divine essence: for though the words , "living Gods", that is, living divine Ones, or Persons, are in the plural number, yet  "he", is in the singular; which is worthy of observation. The Syriac version renders it, "the God of the living"; and so an Oxford Arabic MS, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-32.htm">Matthew 22:32</a>. <p>And an everlasting King; from everlasting to everlasting; he is King of old, even from eternity, and will ever be so; his kingdom is an everlasting one, and his throne for ever and ever, and he will always have subjects to reign over; nor will he have any successor, as mortal kings have, even such who have been deified by their idolatrous subjects. <p>At his wrath the earth shall tremble; that is, the inhabitants of it, when it is poured forth in judgments in the present life, and in the everlasting destruction of soul and body hereafter; and then shall they fear him, though now they do not. <p>And the nations shall not be able to abide his indignation; especially at the day of judgment; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-16.htm">Revelation 6:16</a>. <p>(t)  "Deus veritas", Pagninus, Montanus, Coceeius. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/10.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But the LORD is the true God, he is the living God, and an everlasting king: at his wrath the earth shall tremble, and the nations shall not be able to abide his indignation.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/10.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">10</span>.

The predicate is omitted, and must be supplied from &#1492;&#1489;&#1500;, a word which is in the plural used directly for the false gods; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-19.htm">Jeremiah 8:19</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-21.htm">Deuteronomy 32:21</a>, etc. With the axe, sc. wrought. &#1502;&#1506;&#1510;&#1491; Rashi explains as axe, and suitably; for here it means in any case a carpenter's tool, whereas this is doubtful in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-12.htm">Isaiah 44:12</a>. The images were made of wood, which was covered with silver plating and gold; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-22.htm">Isaiah 30:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-19.htm">Isaiah 40:19</a>. This Jeremiah calls adorning them, making them fair with silver and gold. When the images were finished, they were fastened in their places with hammer and nails, that they might not tumble over; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-7.htm">Isaiah 41:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-20.htm">Isaiah 40:20</a>.

But even if we admit that there is an allusion to the verse before us in the mockery of the gods in the passage of Epist.

And besides it has yet to be proved that the Israelites were in the habit of setting up images of Priapus as scare-crows.)<p>Not to be able to speak is to be without life; not to walk, to take not a single step, i.e., to be without all power of motion; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/46-7.htm">Isaiah 46:7</a>. The Chald. paraphrases correctly: quia non est in iis spiritus vitalis ad ambulandum. The incorrect form  &#1497;&#1504;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; for &#1497;&#1504;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; is doubtless only a copyist's error, induced by the preceding &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1488;. They can do neither good nor evil, neither hurt nor help; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-23.htm">Isaiah 41:23</a>. &#1488;&#1493;&#1514;&#1501; for &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501;, as frequently; see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-16.htm">Jeremiah 1:16</a>.</body></html>
