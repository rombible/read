The lack of righteousness is indicated by the idea &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500; &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512;&#1500;&#1492;: circumcised with foreskin, i.e., not, circumcised in the foreskin (lxx, Vulg.), but circumcised and yet possessed of the foreskin. It is incorrect to translate: circumcised together with the uncircumcised (Kimchi, de W.). This is not only contrary to the usage of the language, but inconsistent with the context, since in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-25.htm">Jeremiah 9:25</a> uncircumcisedness is predicated of the heathen and of Judah. The expression is an oxymoron, thus: uncircumcised-circumcised (Ew.), intended to gather Jews and heathen into one category. This is shown by the order of the enumeration in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-24.htm">Jeremiah 9:24</a> : Egypt, Judah, Edom, etc.; whence we may see that in this reference the prophet puts Judah on the same footing with the heathen, with the Egyptians, Edomites, etc., and so mentions Judah between Egypt and Edom. From the enumeration Ew. and Ng., following the example of Jerome, <p>(Note: Jerome writes: multarum ex quadam parte gentium, et maxime quae Judaeae Palaestinaeque confines sunt, usque hodie populi circumciduntur, et praecipue Aegyptii et Idumaei, Ammonitae et Moabitae et omnis regio Saracenorum, quae habitat in solitudine.)<p>conclude that all the peoples named along with Judah practised circumcision. But neither on exegetical nor on historical grounds can this be confidently asserted. Considered from the exegetical point of view, it is contradictory of the direct statement in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-25.htm">Jeremiah 9:25</a>, that all the nations are uncircumcised. We must certainly not take the words &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501; as: all these peoples, giving the article then the force of a retrospective demonstrative; still less can they mean "all the other nations" besides those named. "All the nations" are all nations besides Israel. When these are called "uncircumcised," and Israel "uncircumcised in heart," it is as clear as can be that all nations, and so Egyptians, Edomites, etc., are called uncircumcised, i.e., in the flesh; while Israel - the whole house of Israel, i.e., Judah and the other tribes - are set over against the nations in contrast to them as being uncircumcised in heart, i.e., spiritually. From the historical view-point, too, it is impossible to prove that circumcision was in use amongst all the nations mentioned along with Judah. Only of the Egyptians does Herod. ii. 36f., 104, record that they practised circumcision; and if we accept the testimony of all other ancient authors, Herod.'s statement concerns only the priests and those initiated into the mysteries of Egypt, not the Egyptian people as a whole; cf. my Bibl. Archol. i. S. 307f. The only ground for attributing the custom of circumcision to the Moabites and Arabs, is the fact that Esau and Ishmael, the ancestors of these peoples, were circumcised. But the inference drawn therefrom is not supported by historical testimony. Indeed, so far as the Edomites are concerned, Josephus testifies directly the contrary, since in Antt. xiii. 9. 1, he tells us that when John Hyrcanus had conquered this people, he offered them the choice of forsaking their country or adopting circumcision, and that they chose the latter alternative. As to the ancient Arabs, we find in the Ztschr. fr die Kunde des Morgl. iii. S. 230, a notice of the tribe 'Adva&#770;n, where we are told that the warriors of this tribe consist of uncircumcised young men along with those already circumcised. But this gives us no certain testimony to the universal prevalence of circumcision; for the notice comes from a work in which pre-and post-Mohammedan traditions are confounded. Finally, there is no historical trace of the custom of circumcision amongst the Ammonites and Moabites. &#1511;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1510;&#1497; &#1508;&#1488;&#1492; here, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-23.htm">Jeremiah 25:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-32.htm">Jeremiah 49:32</a> : those polled, cropped at the edges of the beard and sides of the head, are such as have the hair cut from off the temples and the forehead, observing a custom which, according to Herod. iii.8,<p>(Note: &#x3a4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769; &#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;, &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x394;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, &#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1; &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3be;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;.)<p>was usual amongst some of the tribes of the Arabian Desert. The imitation of this practice was forbidden to the Israelites by the law, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-27.htm">Leviticus 19:27</a>; from which passage we may see that &#1508;&#1488;&#1492; refers to the head and the beard. Acc. to <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-32.htm">Jeremiah 49:32</a>, cf. with v. 28, the tribes meant belonged to the Kedarenes, descended according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-13.htm">Genesis 25:13</a> from Ishmael. In the wilderness, i.e., the Arabian Desert to the east of Palestine. By means of the predicate "uncircumcised in heart," the whole house of Israel, i.e., the whole covenant people, is put in contrast with the heathen. Circumcision involved the obligation to walk blameless before God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-1.htm">Genesis 17:1</a>), and, as sign of the covenant, to keep God's commandments. If this condition was not fulfilled, if the heart remained uncircumcised, Israel lost all pre-eminence over the heathen, and was devoid of all room for glorying in the sight of God, just as the heathen were, who know not God the Lord, who have turned the truth of God into unrighteousness, and in their unrighteousness have become liable to the judgment of God. </body></html>
