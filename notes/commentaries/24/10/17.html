Now the prophet returns to his main theme, the devastation of the land of Israel as the penalty of that sin. He begins with a vivid touch in the picture of utter misery. The daughter of Israel (the word “inhabitant” is feminine), sitting as in a besieged fortress, is to gather up her goods and chattels into one small <span class= "ital">bundle </span>(the English “wares” suggests the idea of trade, which is foreign to the context), and with that as the sole remnant of her possessions, to go forth into exile. Probably, indeed, the word may mean simply the <span class= "ital">travelling carpet </span>or mantle which the exile was to take with him. The whole phrase has something of a proverbial type, like our “bag and baggage” or the <span class= "ital">collige sarcinulas et exi </span>(“take up your packages and begone”) of Juven. <span class= "ital">Sat. vi.</span> 146.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/jeremiah/10.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/10-17.htm" title="Gather up your wares out of the land, O inhabitant of the fortress....">Jeremiah 10:17-18</a></span>. <span class="ital">Gather up thy wares, </span>&c. — That is, as some explain it, “Collect to Jerusalem all that you have valuable in the country; flee thither for refuge with your best effects; for the enemy will soon extend himself over all your land, and render it desolate.” Or, rather, the prophet, returning to his former denunciations against Jerusalem, warns her to move her effects, and prepare for going into captivity; for, though she thought herself secure, as dwelling in a place of great strength and well fortified, yet her enemies should prevail and take it: compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-3.htm" title="Therefore, you son of man, prepare you stuff for removing, and remove by day in their sight; and you shall remove from your place to another place in their sight: it may be they will consider, though they be a rebellious house.">Ezekiel 12:3</a>. <span class="ital">Behold, I will sling out the inhabitants at this once </span>— I will, at one stroke, remove the whole body of this people out of their native country: see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-29.htm" title="Yet a man is risen to pursue you, and to seek your soul: but the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the LORD your God; and the souls of your enemies, them shall he sling out, as out of the middle of a sling.">1 Samuel 25:29</a>. <span class="ital">And I will distress them that they may find it so </span>— Or, that they may find my threatenings to be true. This implies, that though they had been often saved by God’s providence from hostile attacks, they would, however, on this occasion, find it otherwise.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/10.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>10:17-25 The Jews who continued in their own land, felt secure. But, sooner or later, sinners will find all things as the word of God has declared, and that its threatenings are not empty terrors. Submission will support the believer under every grief allotted to him; but what can render the load of Divine vengeance easy to be borne by those who fall under it in sullen despair? Those cannot expect to prosper, who do not, by faith and prayer, take God with them in all their ways. The report of the enemy's approach was very dreadful. Yet the designs which men lay deep, and think well formed, are dashed to pieces in a moment. Events are often overruled, so as to be quite contrary to what we intended and expected. If the Lord has directed our steps into the ways of peace and righteousness, let us entreat him to enable us to walk therein. Say not, Lord, do not correct me; but, Lord, do not correct me in anger. We may bear the smart of God's rod, but we cannot bear the weight of his wrath. Those who restrain prayer, prove that they know not God; for those who know him will seek him, and seek his favour. If even severe corrections lead sinners to be convinced of wholesome truths, they will have abundant cause for gratitude. And they will then humble themselves before the Lord.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The prophet now returns to the main subject of his sermon, the conquest of Judaea.<p>Thy wares - Rather, thy bundle, which could contain a few articles for necessary use, and be carried in the hand.

Though thou now seemest to inhabit an impregnable fortress, thou shalt have to remove. "The land" is the champaign region opposed to the "fortified" cities. The "fortress" being taken, the whole "land" will share the disaster. Henderson translates, "Gather up thy packages from the ground." Rosenmuller, for "fortress," translates, "siege," that is, the besieged city. The various articles, in this view, are supposed to be lying about in confusion on the ground during the siege.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The prophet now enters upon another subject, and probably begins another sermon. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Gather up thy wares, </span> i.e. every thing thou hast any advantage by, not only thy domestic concerns, but all thy traffic and merchandise, wherever thou hast any concerns in the land, as men use to do in case of invasion by an enemy, to secure them. It seems to be a sarcasm, or kind of military derision. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">O inhabitant of the fortress:</span> this is understood by some as spoken to the Babylonians, that they should make provision for their escape, their idols being not able to save them; but this seems to be remote from the prophet’s meaning. It is rather therefore directed to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, that being the chief place of security in Judea, and by a synecdoche to all other places that they promised themselves security in; the approaching destruction being to pass through the whole country. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/10.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Gather up thy wares out of the land,.... Or thy merchandise, as the Targum; or thy substance, as the Septuagint; all valuable effects and goods that are movable, which might be carried from place to place. The meaning is, that the Jews would gather up their riches from the several parts of the land of Judea, and bring them to Jerusalem, a fortified place; or they would be in danger of falling into the hands of the enemy. Kimchi interprets the words as if spoken of Babylon, and directed to the Chaldeans, not to be elated with the captivity of Israel; and because the word signifies "to humble and subdue" he takes the sense to be, <p>"gather in or contract thine humiliation or subjection;'' <p>that is, of other nations; refrain thyself, or cease from subduing kingdoms; that is now at an end, it shall be no more so; but the words manifestly respect the people of the Jews, as is clear from the next verse. <p>O inhabitant of the fortress; of the fortress of Zion, or the fortified city, Jerusalem.

Here, after describing dramatically the departure of the latter into exile, the prophet reports a distinct revelation of the same fact, so that this can no longer be assumed to be mere imaginative rhetoric. The Jewish people is then introduced, lamenting her sad fate, but expressing resignation. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Gather up thy wares</span>.

But it must not be regarded as a gloss that has found its way into the text, on the grounds on which Houb., Ven., Ros., Ew., Hitz., Gr., etc., so regard it, namely, because it is Chaldee, and because there is an immediate connection between <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-10.htm">Jeremiah 10:10</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-12.htm">Jeremiah 10:12</a>. Both the language in which the verse is written, and the subject-matter of it, are unfavourable to this view. The latter does not bear the character of a gloss; and no copyist would have interpolated a Chaldee verse into the Hebrew text. Besides, the verse is found in the Alexandrian version; and in point of sense it connects very suitably with <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-10.htm">Jeremiah 10:10</a> : Jahveh is everlasting King, whereas the gods which have not made heaven and earth shall perish from the earth and from under the heavens. This the Israelites are to say to the idolaters. &#1488;&#1512;&#1511;&#1488; is the harder form for &#1488;&#1512;&#1506;&#1488;. The last word, &#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;, is Hebrew; it does not belong to &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;, but serves to emphasize the subject: the gods - these shall perish. Jeremiah wrote the verse in Chaldee, ut Judaeis suggerat, quomodo Chaldaeis (ad quos non nisi Chaldaice loqui poterant) paucis verbis respondendum sit, as Seb. Schm has remarked. The thought of this verse is a fitting conclusion to the exhortation not to fear the gods of the heathen; it corresponds to the 5th verse, with which the first strophe concludes the warning against idolatry The Israelites are not only not to fear the null and void gods of the heathen, but they are to tell the heathen that their gods will perish from the earth and from under the heavens.</body></html>
