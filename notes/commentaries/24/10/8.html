The servants of the former, when they approached him in their devotions, could not but be impressed with a reverential awe of a being so transcendently glorious.

There are, therefore, an energy and pointedness in this short sentence, at least equal to whatever has been said on the same subject by the most spirited writer, whether sacred or profane.

The signs of heaven are unwonted phenomena in the heavens, eclipses of the sun and moon, comets, and unusual conjunctions of the stars, which were regarded as the precursors of extraordinary and disastrous events.

For the signs that marked the dawning of the day of the Lord are not merely such things as eclipses of sun and moon, and the like. There is still less ground for Ng.'s idea, that the signs of heaven are such as, being permanently there, call forth religious adoration from year to year, the primitive constellations (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-9.htm">Job 9:9</a>), the twelve signs of the zodiac; for &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;( &#1504;&#1495;&#1514;), to be in fear, consternari, never means, even in <a href="http://biblehub.com/malachi/2-5.htm">Malachi 2:5</a>, regular or permanent adoration.
