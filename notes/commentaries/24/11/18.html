Unless this is altogether a distinct fragment, connected, possibly, with <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-8.htm" title="Their tongue is as an arrow shot out; it speaks deceit: one speaks peaceably to his neighbor with his mouth, but in heart he lays his wait.">Jeremiah 9:8</a>, the abruptness suggests the inference that the plots of the men of Anathoth against him had suddenly been brought under his notice.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/jeremiah/11.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/11-18.htm" title="And the LORD has given me knowledge of it, and I know it: then you showed me their doings....">Jeremiah 11:18-19</a></span>. <span class="ital">And the Lord hath given me knowledge of it, </span>&c. — This relates to the ill designs which the men of Anathoth had contrived against the prophet, which he here saith God had revealed to him. See the following verses. <span class="ital">But I was like a lamb or an ox, &c. </span>— A proverbial speech, expressing a false security, or insensibility of danger. Dr. Waterland, in agreement with the Vulgate, Bochart, and Houbigant, reads this clause, <span class="ital">But I was like a gentle lamb; </span>and Blaney, <span class="ital">For I was like a tame lamb that is led to the slaughter. </span>But Lowth justly observes, we may very well admit of the common translation. For the word <span class="greekheb">יאלו</span>Šhere used, certainly frequently signifies <span class="ital">an ox, </span>and the disjunctive particle, supplied by <span class="ital">or, </span>is elsewhere often understood, though not expressed. The meaning here is, that the prophet would have met with a fate similar to that of a slaughtered lamb or ox, if God had not revealed to him the designs of his enemies. Many commentators suppose that Jeremiah here speaks of his own sufferings as figurative of those of the Messiah. “All the churches agree,” says St. Jerome, “that these and the following words respect Jesus Christ and his passion. It was against <span class="ital">his </span>life that they formed their designs: <span class="ital">he </span>was the true lamb, meek and innocent. Jeremiah is here a figure of the divine Saviour; he here suffers from his brethren, and represents, in his person, him who was a man of grief, and tried by all sorts of afflictions.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Let us destroy the tree with the fruit thereof </span>— Let us not only put an end to his prophesying, but to his life. The Hebrew is literally, <span class="ital">Let us destroy the tree </span>(or <span class="ital">the stock</span>) <span class="ital">with the bread thereof; </span>and <span class="ital">bread, </span>it must be observed, is sometimes used for the corn of which bread is made, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-17.htm" title="And they shall eat up your harvest, and your bread, which your sons and your daughters should eat: they shall eat up your flocks and your herds: they shall eat up your vines and your fig trees: they shall impoverish your fenced cities, wherein you trusted, with the sword.">Jeremiah 5:17</a>. The meaning then is, <span class="ital">Let us destroy the prophet and his doctrine. </span>We have no other mention of this conspiracy but this here. It is, however, very plain, both from this verse and what follows, that the men of Anathoth (which was Jeremiah’s own town) were offended at his prophesying, and had conspired to kill him. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/11.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>11:18-23 The prophet Jeremiah tells much concerning himself, the times he lived in being very troublesome. Those of his own city plotted how they might cause his death. They thought to end his days, but he outlived most of his enemies; they thought to blast his memory, but it lives to this day, and will be blessed while time lasts. God knows all the secret designs of his and his people's enemies, and can, when he pleases, make them known. God's justice is a terror to the wicked, but a comfort to the godly. When we are wronged, we have a God to commit our cause to, and it is our duty to commit it to him. We should also look well to our own spirits, that we are not overcome with evil, but that by patient continuance in praying for our enemies, and in kindness to them, we may overcome evil with good.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Rather, "gave me knowledge of it, and I knew it."

Either of what he had been declaring as the sins of these people; and of what he had been prophesying concerning punishment for their sins; what he had said was not of himself, did not arise from any pique or resentment in him against them; but it was of God, that knows all things, and had made known these things to him; and he had only faithfully related them as he had received them; or else of the malicious designs of the men of Anathoth to take away his life, after mentioned: <p>and I know it; and am sure of it; having it by divine revelation, and from that God that cannot lie, and will not deceive: <p>then thou shewedst me their doings. Some versions, as the Septuagint, Syriac; and Arabic, take the former words to be a prayer of the prophet's, "O Lord, make me know, or show me, or teach me, that I may know"; and these signify that his prayer was answered. The Lord showed him the sins of these people, and what punishments they deserved, and would be inflicted on them; or rather what they were doing in the dark, and what schemes they were contriving and attempting to put in execution against his life; but God was careful of it, and would not suffer them to do him any harm; and therefore made all known unto him; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-15.htm">Psalm 105:15</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/11.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And the LORD hath given me knowledge <i>of it</i>, and I know <i>it</i>: then thou didst show me <span class="cverse3">{n}</span> their doings.</span><p>(n) Who went about secretly to conspire my death.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/11.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">18–23</span>.
