It rapidly became proverbial, and is prominent in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-3.htm" title="Hear therefore, O Israel, and observe to do it; that it may be well with you, and that you may increase mightily, as the LORD God of your fathers has promised you, in the land that flows with milk and honey.">Deuteronomy 6:3</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/5-6.htm" title="For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness, till all the people that were men of war, which came out of Egypt, were consumed, because they obeyed not the voice of the LORD: to whom the LORD swore that he would not show them the land, which the LORD swore to their fathers that he would give us, a land that flows with milk and honey.">Joshua 5:6</a>. It points primarily, it may be noticed, to the plenty of a pastoral rather than an agricultural people (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-22.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, for the abundance of milk that they shall give he shall eat butter: for butter and honey shall every one eat that is left in the land.">Isaiah 7:22</a>), and so far to the earlier rather than the later stages of the life of Israel.<p><span class= "bld">So be it, O Lord.</span>—The <span class= "ital">Amen </span>of the liturgies and litanies of Israel, brought probably into fresh prominence by <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/27-15.htm" title="Cursed be the man that makes any graven or molten image, an abomination to the LORD, the work of the hands of the craftsman, and puts it in a secret place. And all the people shall answer and say, Amen.">Deuteronomy 27:15-26</a>, and uttered by princes and people in the solemn ceremonial of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-3.htm" title="And the king stood by a pillar, and made a covenant before the LORD, to walk after the LORD, and to keep his commandments and his testimonies and his statutes with all their heart and all their soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book.

Pardon and acceptance are promised freely to all believers; but no man can be saved who does not obey the command of God to repent, to believe in Christ, to separate from sin and the world, to choose self-denial and newness of life.

English Version makes the words apply to Jeremiah's time, "As ye know at this time, that God's promise has been fulfilled," namely, in Israel's acquisition of Canaan.<p>So be it&#8212;Hebrew, Amen.

And so they could not deal wisely, i.e., rule the people with wisdom. &#1492;&#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500; is here not merely: have prosperity, but: show wisdom, deal wisely, securing thus the blessed results of wisdom. This is shown both by the contrasted "become brutish" and by the parallel passage, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-15.htm">Jeremiah 3:15</a>. &#1502;&#1512;&#1506;&#1497;&#1514;&#1501;, their pasturing, equivalent to "flock of their pasturing," their flock, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-1.htm">Jeremiah 23:1</a>.<p>The calamity over which the people mourns is drawing near, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-22.htm">Jeremiah 10:22</a>. Already is heard the tremendous din of a mighty host which approaches from the north to make the cities of Judah a wilderness. &#1511;&#1493;&#1500; &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1492; is an exclamation: listen to the rumour, it is coming near. From a grammatical point of view the subject to "comes" is "rumour," but in point of sense it is that of which the rumour gives notice. Graf weakens the sense by gathering the words into one assertory clause: "They hear a rumour come." The "great commotion" is that of an army on the march, the clattering of the weapons, the stamping and neighing of the war-horses; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-23.htm">Jeremiah 6:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-16.htm">Jeremiah 8:16</a>. From the land of midnight, the north, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-14.htm">Jeremiah 1:14</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-6.htm">Jeremiah 4:6</a>, etc. "To make the cities," etc., cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-7.htm">Jeremiah 4:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-10.htm">Jeremiah 9:10</a>. - The rumour of the enemy's approach drives the people to prayer, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-23.htm">Jeremiah 10:23-25</a>. The prayer of these verses is uttered in the name of the congregation. It begins with the confession: Not with man is his way, i.e., it is not within man's power to arrange the course of his life, nor in the power of the man who walks to fix his step (&#1493;before &#1492;&#1499;&#1497;&#1503; merely marking the connection of the thought: cf. Ew. 348, a). The antithesis to &#1500;&#1488;&#1491;&#1501; and &#1500;&#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; is &#1500;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;, with God; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-23.htm">Psalm 37:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-9.htm">Proverbs 16:9</a> : Man's heart deviseth his way, but Jahveh establisheth the steps. The thought is not: it is not in man's option to walk in straight or crooked, good or evil ways, but: the directing of man, the way by which he must go, lies not in his own but in God's power. Hitz. justly finds here the wisdom that admits: "Mit unserer Macht ist nichts getan," - man's destiny is ordained not by himself, but by God. Upon this acquiescence in God's dispensation of events follows the petition: Chasten me, for I have deserved punishment, but chasten &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;, acc. to right, not in Thine anger; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/6-2.htm">Psalm 6:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-2.htm">Psalm 38:2</a>. A chastening in anger is the judgment of wrath that shall fall on obstinate sinners and destroy them. A chastening acc. to right is one such as is demanded by right (judgment), as the issue of God's justice, in order to the reclamation and conversion of the repentant sinner. "Lest Thou make me little," insignificant, puny; not merely, diminish me, make me smaller than I now am. For such a decrease of the people would result even from a gentle chastisement. There is no comparative force in the words. To make small, in other words, reduce to a small, insignificant people. This would be at variance with "right," with God's ordained plan in regard to His people. The expression is not equivalent to: not to make an utter end, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-11.htm">Jeremiah 30:11</a>, etc. The people had no call to pray that they might escape being made an utter end of; thus much had been promised by God, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-27.htm">Jeremiah 4:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-10.htm">Jeremiah 5:10</a>. - God is asked to pour forth His fury upon the heathen who know not the Lord nor call upon His name, because they seek to extirpate Jacob (the people of Israel) as the people of God, at this time found in Judah alone. The several words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-25.htm">Jeremiah 10:25</a> suggest the fury with which the heathen proceed to the destruction of Israel. The present verse is reproduced in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/79-6.htm">Psalm 79:6-7</a>, a psalm written during the exile, or at least after the destruction of Jerusalem by the Chaldeans; but in the reproduction the energetic expansion of the "devoured" is omitted. </body></html>
