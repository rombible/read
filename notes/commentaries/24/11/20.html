As such it is not to be imitated by Christians, but neither is it to be hastily condemned. The appeal to a higher judge, the desire to leave vengeance in His hands, is in itself a victory over the impulse to take vengeance into our own hands. Through it, in most cases, the sufferer from wrong must pass before he can attain to the higher and more Christ-like temper which utters itself in the prayer, “Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-34.htm" title="Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And they parted his raiment, and cast lots.">Luke 23:34</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Unto thee have I revealed my cause.</span>—i.e., laid it bare before thee. The thought and the phrase were characteristic of Jeremiah, and meet us again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-12.htm" title="But, O LORD of hosts, that try the righteous, and see the reins and the heart, let me see your vengeance on them: for to you have I opened my cause.">Jeremiah 20:12</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/jeremiah/11.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-20.htm" title="But, O LORD of hosts, that judge righteously, that try the reins and the heart, let me see your vengeance on them: for to you have I revealed my cause.">Jeremiah 11:20</a>. </span><span class="ital">But, O Lord, thou judgest righteously </span>— It is matter of comfort to us, when men deal unjustly with us, that we have a God to go to, who doth and will plead the cause of injured innocence, and appear against the injurious. God’s justice, which is a terror to the wicked, is a comfort to the godly. <span class="ital">That triest the reins and the heart </span>— That perfectly knowest what is in man, that discernest his most secret thoughts, desires, and designs. <span class="ital">Let me see thy vengeance on them </span>— That is, do justice between me and them in such a way as thou pleasest. “When men continue implacable in their malice,” says Lowth, “we may lawfully expect and desire that God will plead our cause, and judge us according to our righteousness. For the bringing wicked men to condign punishment tends both to the manifestation of God’s glory and the good government of the world. And to pray against our enemies in this sense, namely, not for the satisfying our private resentments, but the setting forth of God’s justice, is not contrary to the spirit of Christianity. So St. Paul prayed against Alexander the copper-smith, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-14.htm" title="Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord reward him according to his works:">2 Timothy 4:14</a>.” It must be observed, however, that, according to the Hebrew text here, the words are merely a prediction; <span class="greekheb">מהם אראה נקמתן</span>, being literally, <span class="ital">I shall see thy vengeance on them; </span>that is, I foresee it, and predict it, though I lament they should have given occasion for it.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/11.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>11:18-23 The prophet Jeremiah tells much concerning himself, the times he lived in being very troublesome. Those of his own city plotted how they might cause his death. They thought to end his days, but he outlived most of his enemies; they thought to blast his memory, but it lives to this day, and will be blessed while time lasts. God knows all the secret designs of his and his people's enemies, and can, when he pleases, make them known. God's justice is a terror to the wicked, but a comfort to the godly. When we are wronged, we have a God to commit our cause to, and it is our duty to commit it to him. We should also look well to our own spirits, that we are not overcome with evil, but that by patient continuance in praying for our enemies, and in kindness to them, we may overcome evil with good.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Like a lamb or an ox - Rather, "like a tame lamb."

This is the prophet's appeal to God, as the Judge of the whole earth, who will do right; he found there was no justice to be done him among men; he therefore has recourse to a righteous God, who he knew judged righteous judgment: <p>that triest the reins and the heart; of all men; as of his own, so of his enemies; and which he mentions, not so much on his own account as theirs: <p>let me see thy vengeance on them; which imprecation arose from a pure zeal for God, for his glory, and the honour of his justice; and not from private revenge; and so no ways inconsistent with the character of a good man; though some consider the words as a prediction of what would befall them, and he should live to see accomplished; and render them, "I shall see &amp;c."

This expression is certainly not only more forcible, but more appropriate than the other. Jeremiah's cause was not a secret which needed to be "revealed" <span class="accented">to</span> Jehovah, but a burden too heavy for so finely strung a nature to bear alone. Grammatically, the preferred meaning is quite justifiable, though less obvious, as there are other instances of an interchange of meanings between two classes of verbs (see on Jeremiah 33:6). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/11.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Neither entreaty on their behalf nor their hypocritical worship will avert judgment. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-14.htm">Jeremiah 11:14</a>. "But thou, pray not for this people, neither lift up for them cry or prayer; for I hear them not in the time that they cry unto me for their trouble. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-15.htm">Jeremiah 11:15</a>.

A green olive, fair for its goodly fruit, Jahveh called thy name; with the noise of great tumult He set fire to it, and its branches brake. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-17.htm">Jeremiah 11:17</a>. And Jahveh of hosts, that planted thee, hath decreed evil against thee, for the evil of the house of Israel and of the house of Judah which they themselves have done, to provoke me, in that they have offered odours to Baal."<p>We have already, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-16.htm">Jeremiah 7:16</a>, met with the declaration that the Lord will not accept any intercession for the covenant-breaking people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-14.htm">Jeremiah 11:14</a>); the termination of this verse differs slightly in the turn to takes. -  &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1491; &#1512;&#1506;&#1514;&#1501; the ancient commentators have almost unanimously rendered: tempore mali eorum, as if they had read &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1514; (this is, in fact, the reading of some codd.); but hardly on sufficient grounds. &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1491; gives a suitable sense, with the force of the Greek &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#769;, which, like the German um, passes into the sense of wegen, as the English about passes into that of concerning. - In <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-15.htm">Jeremiah 11:15-17</a> we have the reason why the Lord will hear neither the prophet's supplication nor the people's cry in their time of need. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-15.htm">Jeremiah 11:15</a> is very obscure; and from the Masoretic text it is hardly possible to obtain a suitable sense. "The beloved" of Jahveh is Judah, the covenant people; cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-12.htm">Deuteronomy 33:12</a>, where Benjamin is so called, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-7.htm">Jeremiah 12:7</a>, where the Lord calls His people &#1497;&#1491;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;. "What is to my beloved in my house?" i.e., what has my people to do in my house - what does it want there? "My house" is the temple of the Lord in Jerusalem, as appears from the mention of holy flesh in the second clause. The main difficulty lies in the words &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1514;&#1492;&#1468; &#1492;&#1502;&#1494;&#1502;&#1468;&#1514;&#1492; &#1492;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;. Hitz. takes &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1514;&#1492;&#1468; to be the subject of the clause, and makes the suffix point back to &#1497;&#1491;&#1497;&#1491;&#1497;, which, as collective, is to be construed generis faem.: what should the accomplishment of his plans be to my beloved in my house? But as adverse to this we must note, a. the improbability of &#1497;&#1491;&#1497;&#1491; as used of the people being feminine; b. the fact that even if we adopt Hitz.'s change of &#1492;&#1502;&#1494;&#1502;&#1468;&#1514;&#1492; into &#1492;&#1502;&#1494;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;, yet the latter word does not mean plans or designs to bring offerings. The phrase is clearly to be taken by itself as a continuation of the question; and the suffix to be regarded, with Ew., Umbr., etc., as pointing, in the Aramaic fashion, to the object following: they who practise guile. &#1502;&#1494;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492;, a thinking out, devising, usually of hurtful schemes, here guile, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-20.htm">Psalm 139:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-27.htm">Job 21:27</a>. What is meant is the hypocrisy of cloaking their apostasy from God by offering sacrifices in the temple, of concealing their idolatry and passing themselves off as worshippers of Jahve. On the form &#1502;&#1494;&#1502;&#1468;&#1514;&#1492;, see Ew. 173, g, Gesen. 80, Rem. 2,f. &#1492;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; makes no sense. It belongs manifestly to the words which follow; for it can neither be subject to &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1514;&#1492;&#1468;, nor can it be joined to &#1492;&#1502;&#1494;&#1502;&#1468;&#1514;&#1492; as its genitive. The lxx render: &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b1; &#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;; and following this, Dathe, Dahl., Ew., Hitz. hold &#1492;&#1504;&#1491;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; to be the original reading. On the other hand, Maur., Graf, and Ng. think we should read &#1492;&#1512;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; (after <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/32-7.htm">Psalm 32:7</a>) or &#1492;&#1512;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; myinirah, crying, loud supplication; on the ground of Buxtorf's hint, Anticrit. p. 661, that probably the Alexandrians had &#1492;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; in their text, but, changing the &#1489; for &#1504;, read &#1492;&#1512;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;. We must make our choice between these two conjectures; for even if &#1492;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; did not stand in the codex used by the Alexandrians, it cannot have been the original word. The form &#1512;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; is, indeed, sufficiently attested by &#1512;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497; &#1508;&#1500;&#1496;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/32-7.htm">Psalm 32:7</a>; but the meaning of exultation which it has there is here wholly out of place. And we find no case of a plural to &#1512;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;, which means both exultation and piteous, beseeching cry (e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-16.htm">Jeremiah 7:16</a>). So that, although &#1512;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; is in the lxx occasionally rendered by &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-14.htm">Jeremiah 11:14</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-12.htm">Jeremiah 14:12</a>, etc.) or &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#769; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-28.htm">1 Kings 8:28</a>), we prefer the conjecture &#1492;&#1504;&#1491;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;; for "vow" is in better keeping with "holy flesh," i.e., flesh of sacrifice, <a href="http://biblehub.com/haggai/2-12.htm">Haggai 2:12</a>, since the vow was generally carried out by offering sacrifice. - Nor do the following words, '&#1497;&#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; &#1502;&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1498; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;, convey any meaning, without some alteration. As quoted above, they may be translated: shall pass away from thee. But this can mean neither: they shall be torn from thee, nor: they shall disappoint thee. And even if this force did lie in the words, no statement can begin with the following &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1512;&#1506;&#1514;&#1499;&#1497; gniwollo. If this be a protasis, the verb is wanting. We shall have to change it, after the manner of the lxx, to &#1497;&#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; &#1502;&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1499;&#1497; &#1512;&#1506;&#1514;&#1499;&#1497;: shall vows and holy flesh (sacrifice) avert thine evil from thee? For the form &#1497;&#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; as Hiph. cf. &#1497;&#1491;&#1512;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-2.htm">Jeremiah 9:2</a>. "Thine evil" with the double force: thy sin and shame, and the disaster impending, i.e., sin and (judicial) suffering. There is no occasion for any further changes. &#1488;&#1494;, rendered &#x3b7;&#787;&#769; by the lxx, and so read &#1488;&#1493; by them, may be completely vindicated: then, i.e., if this were the case, if thou couldst avert calamity by sacrifice, then mightest thou exult. Thus we obtain the following as the sense of the whole verse: What mean my people in my temple with their hypocritical sacrifices? Can vows and offerings, presented by you there, avert calamity from you? If it could be so, well might you shout for joy.</body></html>
