There is no “or” in the Hebrew, and the translators seem to have mistaken the adjective (tame) for a noun. The LXX., Vulg., and Luther agree in the rendering now given.

The phrase would seem to be proverbial for total destruction, not of the man only, but of his work. While the prophet’s life had been innocent and unsuspecting, his own townsmen were conspiring to crush him, and bury his name and work in oblivion. The sufferings of the prophet present, in this matter, a parallel to those of the Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-29.htm" title="And rose up, and thrust him out of the city, and led him to the brow of the hill where on their city was built, that they might cast him down headlong.">Luke 4:29</a>).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/11.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>11:18-23 The prophet Jeremiah tells much concerning himself, the times he lived in being very troublesome. Those of his own city plotted how they might cause his death. They thought to end his days, but he outlived most of his enemies; they thought to blast his memory, but it lives to this day, and will be blessed while time lasts. God knows all the secret designs of his and his people's enemies, and can, when he pleases, make them known. God's justice is a terror to the wicked, but a comfort to the godly. When we are wronged, we have a God to commit our cause to, and it is our duty to commit it to him. We should also look well to our own spirits, that we are not overcome with evil, but that by patient continuance in praying for our enemies, and in kindness to them, we may overcome evil with good.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Like a lamb or an ox - Rather, "like a tame lamb."

His own familiar friends had plotted against the prophet. The language is exactly the same as that applied to Messiah (Isa 53:7). Each prophet and patriarch exemplified in his own person some one feature or more in the manifold attributes and sufferings of the Messiah to come; just as the saints have done since His coming (Ga 2:20; Php 3:10; Col 1:24).

The word "alluph", rendered an ox, is by many considered as an adjective to the word lamb (n); since the disjunctive particle or is not in the next; and is differently translated; by the Vulgate Latin version, "as a meek or tame lamb"; by the Septuagint and Arabic versions, "as an harmless lamb": and by the Syriac version, "as a pure" or "clean lamb"; and by the Targum, <p>"as a choice lamb;'' <p>and so R. Menachem in Jarchi, a large or principal one; but the words respect not the excellency, the meekness, patience, innocence, and harmlessness of the prophet; but his security and insensibility of danger, like one or both of these creatures: <p>that is brought to the slaughter; to be sacrificed by the priest, or killed by the butcher; not knowing but it is going to the pasture to feed in, or to the fold or stall to lie down in; so ignorant was the prophet of the designs of his townsmen against him, and not at all jealous that they wished him ill; since he meant none to them, but sought their good: <p>and I knew not that they had devised devices against me; that they had met and consulted together, and devised mischief against him: <p>saying, let us destroy the tree with the fruit thereof; meaning either the prophet and his family, root and branch; or him and his prophecies; for taking away his life would put an end to his prophesying. Some think this respects the manner in which they proposed to take away his life, as by poison; so the Targum, <p>"let us cast (put) poison (or the savour of death) into his food;'' <p>for the word rendered fruit signifies bread; and so the Septuagint, Arabic, and Vulgate Latin versions render it, "let us cast, or put wood into his bread" (o); either some poisonous plant or tree, or rotten wood; or give him wood instead of bread, and so starve him. De Dieu observes, that  translated "fruit", signifies, both in the Hebrew and Arabic languages, "flesh"; and renders it, "let us break wood upon his flesh", (p) or body; that is, beat him with staves till they are broken upon him, and so kill him. The ancient fathers understand this of Christ, who is the bread of life, and of his crucifixion upon the wood of the cross. Jerom says it is the consent of all the churches that these things are said of Christ in the person of Jeremiah, even in this and the preceding verse, and the following one: <p>let us cut him off from the land of the living. The Targum explains it of the land of Israel; but it designs the world in general, and the taking away of his life out of it, and from among men: <p>that his name may be remembered no more; that he and his prophecies may be buried in everlasting oblivion; he no more spoken of, and his predictions no more regarded: but, as they failed in the former in taking away his life, he outliving many of them, so in the latter; for as what he foretold exactly came to pass, his name and his prophesying are in remembrance to this day; and, as the wise man says, "the memory of the just is blessed", <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-7.htm">Proverbs 10:7</a>. <p>(n)  "quasi agnus mansuetus", V.

The prophet no more expected harm from his kindred than does the pet lamb from the family with which it lives (cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-3.htm" title="But the poor man had nothing, save one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and nourished up: and it grew up together with him, and with his children; it did eat of his own meat, and drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was to him as a daughter.">2 Samuel 12:3</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">gentle</span>] A.V. “an ox” represents the Hebrew word identical in form indeed with one so rendered in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/144-14.htm" title="That our oxen may be strong to labor; that there be no breaking in, nor going out; that there be no complaining in our streets.">Psalm 144:14</a> (where, however, the sense is dubious), but here the meaning is <span class="ital">familiar</span>, domesticated (cp. the rendering “companion” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55-13.htm" title="But it was you, a man my equal, my guide, and my acquaintance.">Psalm 55:13</a>). It is rendered “friends” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-21.htm" title="What will you say when he shall punish you? for you have taught them to be captains, and as chief over you: shall not sorrows take you, as a woman in travail?">Jeremiah 13:21</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">fruit</span>] mg.

Jeremiah says that he was as unsuspicious as a tame lamb which has grown up with its master's family (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-3.htm">2 Samuel 12:3</a>). The Arabs use the very same adjective in a slightly different form as an epithet of such tame lambs (Bochart, 'Hierozoicon,' 1:520-522, edit. 1663). It is impossible to help thinking of that "Servant of Jehovah," of whom Jeremiah was a type, who is said, in prophetic vision, to have been "brought as a lamb to the slaughter," and "not to have opened his mouth "(<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-7.htm">Isaiah 53:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The tree with the fruit thereof</span>; apparently a proverbial expression. Giving the words their ordinary meaning, the rendering would <span class="accented">be</span>, <span class="accented">the tree with its bread</span> (<span class="accented">b'lakhmo</span>). Our translators appear to have thought that the transition from "bread" to "fruit" was as justifiable in Hebrew as it is in Arabic (in which '<span class="accented">uklu</span> means properly "food" in general, but also "date fruit"). Fruit, however, was not such an important article of food with the Israelites as with the Arabs; and we must either, with Hitzig, suppose a letter to have intruded into the text, and render (from a corrected reading <span class="accented">b'lekho</span>), <span class="accented">with its sap</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/34-7.htm">Deuteronomy 34:7</a>, Hebrew), or else appeal to the etymology of <span class="accented">lekhem</span> (commonly "bread"), which is "firm, consistent," and render, the <span class="accented">tree with its pith</span> (Hence <span class="accented">lahmu</span> in Arabic means "flesh," and <span class="accented">luhmatu</span>, "a woof").
