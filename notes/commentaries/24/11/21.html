Failing in this, after the manner of the men of Nazareth in their attack on the Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/4-28.htm" title="And all they in the synagogue, when they heard these things, were filled with wrath,">Luke 4:28-29</a>), and of the later Jews in their dealings with St. Paul, they conspired against his life (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-23.htm" title="And after that many days were fulfilled, the Jews took counsel to kill him:">Acts 9:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-29.htm" title="And he spoke boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus, and disputed against the Grecians: but they went about to slay him.">Acts 9:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-19.htm" title="And there came thither certain Jews from Antioch and Iconium, who persuaded the people, and having stoned Paul, drew him out of the city, supposing he had been dead.">Acts 14:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-12.htm" title="And when it was day, certain of the Jews banded together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul.">Acts 23:12</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/jeremiah/11.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-21.htm" title="Therefore thus said the LORD of the men of Anathoth, that seek your life, saying, Prophesy not in the name of the LORD, that you die not by our hand:">Jeremiah 11:21</a></span>. <span class="ital">Thus saith the Lord of the men that seek thy life </span>— That are combined to kill thee; <span class="ital">saying, Prophesy not in the name of the Lord </span>—<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The meaning is, that those men of Anathoth threatened that they would kill him if he did not cease to prophesy such things as he did in the name of the Lord, namely, concerning the destruction of Jerusalem, the desolation of Judea, and the carrying away of the people into captivity. For if he had spoken falsely in the name of the Lord, and promised them peace and prosperity, they would have heard him prophesy gladly: they were thus exasperated at him, and opposed his prophesying, because he told them those truths which they had no mind to hear. This passage sufficiently shows that Jeremiah is to be understood in the literal sense here, which, however, does not by any means forbid our considering him in this instance as a type of Christ, and prefiguring, by his sufferings, those of the Redeemer of mankind. It manifests also the usage which the prophets generally met with from their own countrymen, who became their enemies because they told them the truth. The people of their own towns, even their friends and relations, could not bear to hear the solemn warnings which they gave them, and the prediction of those judgments which were coming upon them for their sins.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/11.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>11:18-23 The prophet Jeremiah tells much concerning himself, the times he lived in being very troublesome. Those of his own city plotted how they might cause his death. They thought to end his days, but he outlived most of his enemies; they thought to blast his memory, but it lives to this day, and will be blessed while time lasts. God knows all the secret designs of his and his people's enemies, and can, when he pleases, make them known. God's justice is a terror to the wicked, but a comfort to the godly. When we are wronged, we have a God to commit our cause to, and it is our duty to commit it to him. We should also look well to our own spirits, that we are not overcome with evil, but that by patient continuance in praying for our enemies, and in kindness to them, we may overcome evil with good.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Like a lamb or an ox - Rather, "like a tame lamb."

"But thou, pray not for this people, neither lift up for them cry or prayer; for I hear them not in the time that they cry unto me for their trouble. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-15.htm">Jeremiah 11:15</a>.

And Jahveh of hosts, that planted thee, hath decreed evil against thee, for the evil of the house of Israel and of the house of Judah which they themselves have done, to provoke me, in that they have offered odours to Baal."<p>We have already, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-16.htm">Jeremiah 7:16</a>, met with the declaration that the Lord will not accept any intercession for the covenant-breaking people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-14.htm">Jeremiah 11:14</a>); the termination of this verse differs slightly in the turn to takes. -  &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1491; &#1512;&#1506;&#1514;&#1501; the ancient commentators have almost unanimously rendered: tempore mali eorum, as if they had read &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1514; (this is, in fact, the reading of some codd.); but hardly on sufficient grounds. &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1491; gives a suitable sense, with the force of the Greek &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#769;, which, like the German um, passes into the sense of wegen, as the English about passes into that of concerning. - In <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-15.htm">Jeremiah 11:15-17</a> we have the reason why the Lord will hear neither the prophet's supplication nor the people's cry in their time of need. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-15.htm">Jeremiah 11:15</a> is very obscure; and from the Masoretic text it is hardly possible to obtain a suitable sense. "The beloved" of Jahveh is Judah, the covenant people; cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-12.htm">Deuteronomy 33:12</a>, where Benjamin is so called, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-7.htm">Jeremiah 12:7</a>, where the Lord calls His people &#1497;&#1491;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;. "What is to my beloved in my house?" i.e., what has my people to do in my house - what does it want there? "My house" is the temple of the Lord in Jerusalem, as appears from the mention of holy flesh in the second clause. The main difficulty lies in the words &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1514;&#1492;&#1468; &#1492;&#1502;&#1494;&#1502;&#1468;&#1514;&#1492; &#1492;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;. Hitz. takes &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1514;&#1492;&#1468; to be the subject of the clause, and makes the suffix point back to &#1497;&#1491;&#1497;&#1491;&#1497;, which, as collective, is to be construed generis faem.: what should the accomplishment of his plans be to my beloved in my house? But as adverse to this we must note, a. the improbability of &#1497;&#1491;&#1497;&#1491; as used of the people being feminine; b. the fact that even if we adopt Hitz.'s change of &#1492;&#1502;&#1494;&#1502;&#1468;&#1514;&#1492; into &#1492;&#1502;&#1494;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;, yet the latter word does not mean plans or designs to bring offerings. The phrase is clearly to be taken by itself as a continuation of the question; and the suffix to be regarded, with Ew., Umbr., etc., as pointing, in the Aramaic fashion, to the object following: they who practise guile. &#1502;&#1494;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492;, a thinking out, devising, usually of hurtful schemes, here guile, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-20.htm">Psalm 139:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-27.htm">Job 21:27</a>. What is meant is the hypocrisy of cloaking their apostasy from God by offering sacrifices in the temple, of concealing their idolatry and passing themselves off as worshippers of Jahve. On the form &#1502;&#1494;&#1502;&#1468;&#1514;&#1492;, see Ew. 173, g, Gesen. 80, Rem. 2,f. &#1492;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; makes no sense. It belongs manifestly to the words which follow; for it can neither be subject to &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1514;&#1492;&#1468;, nor can it be joined to &#1492;&#1502;&#1494;&#1502;&#1468;&#1514;&#1492; as its genitive. The lxx render: &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b1; &#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;; and following this, Dathe, Dahl., Ew., Hitz. hold &#1492;&#1504;&#1491;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; to be the original reading. On the other hand, Maur., Graf, and Ng. think we should read &#1492;&#1512;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; (after <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/32-7.htm">Psalm 32:7</a>) or &#1492;&#1512;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; myinirah, crying, loud supplication; on the ground of Buxtorf's hint, Anticrit. p. 661, that probably the Alexandrians had &#1492;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; in their text, but, changing the &#1489; for &#1504;, read &#1492;&#1512;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;. We must make our choice between these two conjectures; for even if &#1492;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; did not stand in the codex used by the Alexandrians, it cannot have been the original word. The form &#1512;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; is, indeed, sufficiently attested by &#1512;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497; &#1508;&#1500;&#1496;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/32-7.htm">Psalm 32:7</a>; but the meaning of exultation which it has there is here wholly out of place. And we find no case of a plural to &#1512;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;, which means both exultation and piteous, beseeching cry (e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-16.htm">Jeremiah 7:16</a>). So that, although &#1512;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; is in the lxx occasionally rendered by &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-14.htm">Jeremiah 11:14</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-12.htm">Jeremiah 14:12</a>, etc.) or &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#769; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-28.htm">1 Kings 8:28</a>), we prefer the conjecture &#1492;&#1504;&#1491;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;; for "vow" is in better keeping with "holy flesh," i.e., flesh of sacrifice, <a href="http://biblehub.com/haggai/2-12.htm">Haggai 2:12</a>, since the vow was generally carried out by offering sacrifice. - Nor do the following words, '&#1497;&#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; &#1502;&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1498; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;, convey any meaning, without some alteration. As quoted above, they may be translated: shall pass away from thee. But this can mean neither: they shall be torn from thee, nor: they shall disappoint thee. And even if this force did lie in the words, no statement can begin with the following &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1512;&#1506;&#1514;&#1499;&#1497; gniwollo. If this be a protasis, the verb is wanting. We shall have to change it, after the manner of the lxx, to &#1497;&#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; &#1502;&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1499;&#1497; &#1512;&#1506;&#1514;&#1499;&#1497;: shall vows and holy flesh (sacrifice) avert thine evil from thee? For the form &#1497;&#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; as Hiph. cf. &#1497;&#1491;&#1512;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-2.htm">Jeremiah 9:2</a>. "Thine evil" with the double force: thy sin and shame, and the disaster impending, i.e., sin and (judicial) suffering. There is no occasion for any further changes. &#1488;&#1494;, rendered &#x3b7;&#787;&#769; by the lxx, and so read &#1488;&#1493; by them, may be completely vindicated: then, i.e., if this were the case, if thou couldst avert calamity by sacrifice, then mightest thou exult. Thus we obtain the following as the sense of the whole verse: What mean my people in my temple with their hypocritical sacrifices? Can vows and offerings, presented by you there, avert calamity from you? If it could be so, well might you shout for joy.</body></html>
