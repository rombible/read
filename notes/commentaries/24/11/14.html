He is told that it is at once too early and too late for that prayer. The people have not yet been moved to repentance, and their cry is simply the wail of suffering. The discipline must do its work, and the judgment they have brought down on themselves can be stayed no longer.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/11.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>11:11-17 Evil pursues sinners, and entangles them in snares, out of which they cannot free themselves. Now, in their distress, their many gods and many altars stand them in no stead. And those whose own prayers will not be heard, cannot expect benefit from the prayers of others. Their profession of religion shall prove of no use. When trouble came upon them, they made this their confidence, but God has rejected it. His altar shall yield them no satisfaction. The remembrance of God's former favours to them shall be no comfort under troubles; and his remembrance of them shall be no argument for their relief. Every sin against the Lord is a sin against ourselves, and so it will be found sooner or later.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A parenthesis. As in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-16.htm">Jeremiah 7:16</a>, all intercession is forbidden, and for this reason. Prayer for others for the forgiveness of their sins avails only when they also pray. The cry of the people now was that of the guilty smarting under punishment, not of the penitent mourning over sin.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14. There is a climax of guilt which admits of no further intercessory prayer (Ex 32:10, in the Chaldee version, "leave off praying"; Jer 7:16; 1Sa 16:1; 15:35; 1Jo 5:16).

If for a remnant among them, yet not for the body of the people; and if for their spiritual and eternal good, yet not for their temporal salvation; their temporal ruin was certain; the decree was gone forth, and there was no revoking it; and this is said, not so much by way of prohibition of the prophet, as by way of threatening to the people, to show that as their own prayers should not profit them, so they should not have the benefit of the prayers of good men, their sin was a sin unto death, at least temporal death, and must not be prayed for, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/5-16.htm">1 John 5:16</a>, <p>neither lift up a cry or prayer for them; more words are used, to show the divine resolution, how inexorable he was, and how desperate was their condition, and their ruin sure; these words are repeated from <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-16.htm">Jeremiah 7:16</a>, <p>for I will not hear them in the time that they cry unto me for their trouble; for, as he would not hear their prayers when they should cry to him to be delivered from their trouble, it cannot be thought that he should hear the prayers of others for them, The Targum understands this of the prayers of the prophet for them, paraphrasing the words thus, <p>"for there is no acceptance before me (or it is not pleasing to me) when thou shall pray for them before me, in the time of their evil;'' <p>neither their prayers, nor the prophet's for them, would be acceptable to God, or of any avail, he being determined to bring evil upon them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/11.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Therefore <span class="cverse3">{i}</span> pray not thou for this people, neither lift up a cry or prayer for them: for I will not hear <i>them</i> in the time when they cry to me for their trouble.</span><p>(i) Read Jer 7:16,14:11.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/11.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">14</span>. <span class="ital">Therefore pray not thou</span>] Cp. ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-16.htm" title="Therefore pray not you for this people, neither lift up cry nor prayer for them, neither make intercession to me: for I will not hear you.">Jeremiah 7:16</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore pray not thou</span>, etc. First Jehovah declares that even the intercession of the prophet will be of no avail (see on Jeremiah 7:16), and then that the belated supplications of the people themselves will be ineffectual to avert the calamity. <span class="cmt_word">For their trouble</span>.

"All these words" are those subsequently specified, i.e., the commandments of the law (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-2.htm">Jeremiah 11:2</a>).
