Now, in their distress, their many gods and many altars stand them in no stead. And those whose own prayers will not be heard, cannot expect benefit from the prayers of others. Their profession of religion shall prove of no use. When trouble came upon them, they made this their confidence, but God has rejected it. His altar shall yield them no satisfaction. The remembrance of God's former favours to them shall be no comfort under troubles; and his remembrance of them shall be no argument for their relief. Every sin against the Lord is a sin against ourselves, and so it will be found sooner or later.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I will bring - Or, am bringing. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11. cry unto me&#8212;contrasted with "cry unto the gods," (Jer 11:12).<p>not hearken&#8212;(Ps 18:41; Pr 1:28; Isa 1:15; Mic 3:4).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Evil upon them which they shall not be able to escape; </span> a judgment from which they shall by no means be delivered, by any counsels of their own, or assistance of their friends and allies. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And though they shall cry unto me, I will not hearken unto them; </span> and though prayer to me hath been their usual course in such cases, and I have delivered them, yet I will no more hear them, though they cry unto me, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-28.htm" title="Then shall they call on me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me:">Proverbs 1:28</a>,29 Zec 7:11,13</span>.

That I may perform the oath which I have sworn unto your fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as it is this day. And I answered and said: So be it, Jahveh. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-6.htm">Jeremiah 11:6</a>. Then said Jahveh to me: Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying: Hear ye the words of this covenant and do them. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-7.htm">Jeremiah 11:7</a>. For I have testified to your fathers in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt unto this day, testifying from early morning on: Hearken to my voice! <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-8.htm">Jeremiah 11:8</a>. But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear, but walked each in the stubbornness of their evil heart; and so I brought on them all the words of this covenant which I have commanded them to do, and they have not done them."<p>The form of address, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-2.htm">Jeremiah 11:2</a> : hear ye (&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;), and speak ye (&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501;), is noteworthy since we are not told who are to hear and speak; while at <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-3.htm">Jeremiah 11:3</a>, in &#1493;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468; Jeremiah receives the commission to declare the words of the covenant to the people, and to make known in the cities of Judah, etc. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-6.htm">Jeremiah 11:6</a>). The difficulty is not removed by the plan adopted by Hitz. and Graf from the lxx, of changing &#1493;&#1491;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501; into &#1493;&#1491;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501;, "and speak them;" for the &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468; remains to be dealt with. To whom then, is it addressed? Schleussner proposed to change it into &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;&#1492; - a purely arbitrary change. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-4.htm">Jeremiah 11:4</a> "hearing" is used in the sense of giving ear to, obeying. And in no other sense can it be taken in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-1.htm">Jeremiah 11:1</a>. "The words of this covenant" are, as is clear from the succeeding context, the words of the covenant recorded in the Pentateuch, known from the reading of the Torah. The call to hear the words thereof can only have the meaning of: to give ear to them, take them to heart. Hence Chr. B. Mich. and Schnur. have referred the words to the Jews: Listen, ye Jews and ye citizens of Jerusalem, to the words of the covenant, and make them know to one another, and exhort one another to observe them. But this paraphrase is hardly consistent with the wording of the verse. Others fancied that the priests and elders were addressed; but if so, these must necessarily have been named. Clearly it is to the prophets in general that the words are spoken, as Kimchi observed; and we must not take "hear ye" as if the covenant was unknown to the prophets, but as intended to remind the prophets of them, that they might enforce them upon the people. Taken thus, this introductory verse serves to exalt the importance of the truths mentioned, to mark them out as truths which God had commanded all the prophets to proclaim. If it be the prophets in general who are addressed in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-2.htm">Jeremiah 11:2</a>, the transition to "and say thou" is easily explained. Jeremiah, too, must himself do that which was the bounden duty of all the prophets, must make the men of Judah and Jerusalem call to mind the curse overhanging transgressors of the covenant. The words: Cursed is the man, etc., are taken from <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-26.htm">Deuteronomy 27:26</a>, from the directions for the engagement to keep the covenant, which the people were to solemnise upon their entry into Canaan, and which, acc. to <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/8-30.htm">Joshua 8:30</a>., they did solemnise. The quotation is made freely from memory. Instead of "that heareth not the words of this covenant," we find in Deut. l.c.: "the confirmeth not (&#1497;&#1511;&#1497;&#1501;) the words of this law to do them." The choice there of the word &#1497;&#1511;&#1497;&#1501; is suggested by its connection with the act of solemnisation enjoined. The recitation and promulgation of the law upon Mount Gerizim and Ebal (<a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27.htm">Deuteronomy 27</a>) had no other aim than that of solemnly binding the people to keep or follow the law; and this is what Jeremiah means by "hearing." The law to be established is the law of the covenant, i.e., the covenant made by Jahveh with Israel, and spoken of in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-68.htm">Deuteronomy 28:68</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-8.htm">Deuteronomy 29:8</a> as the "words of this covenant." This covenant, which Moses had made with the sons of Israel in the land of Moab (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-68.htm">Deuteronomy 28:68</a>), was but a renewal of that solemnly concluded at Sinai (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/24.htm">Exodus 24</a>). And so Jeremiah speaks of this covenant as the one which Jahveh commanded the fathers in the day, i.e., at the time, of their leaving Egypt. "In the day that," etc., as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-22.htm">Jeremiah 7:22</a>. "Out of the iron furnace:" this metaphor for the affliction endured by Israel in Egypt is taken from <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-20.htm">Deuteronomy 4:20</a>. The words: hearken unto my voice and do them (the words of the covenant), suggest <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-1.htm">Deuteronomy 27:1-2</a>; and the words: so shall ye be my people, suggest <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-12.htm">Deuteronomy 29:12</a>, a passage which itself points back to ex. Jer 6:7 (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-5.htm">Jeremiah 19:5</a>.), <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/27-12.htm">Leviticus 27:12</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6</a>, etc. That I may establish, i.e., perform, the oath which I have sworn unto your fathers, i.e., the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (<a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-8.htm">Deuteronomy 7:8</a>, etc.), promising to give them a land flowing, etc. The frequently repeated description of the promised land; cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-17.htm">Exodus 3:17</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-3.htm">Deuteronomy 6:3</a>, etc. &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1501; , as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-30.htm">Deuteronomy 2:30</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-20.htm">Deuteronomy 4:20</a>, etc., is not: at this time, now (Graf), but: as this day, meaning: as is even now the case, sc. that ye still possess this precious land. The assenting reply of the prophet: &#1488;&#1502;&#1503; &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;, yea, or so be it (&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;, lxx), Lord, corresponds to the &#1488;&#1502;&#1503; with which the people, acc. to <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-15.htm">Deuteronomy 27:15</a>., were to take on themselves the curses attached to the breaking of the law, curses which they did take on themselves when the law was promulgated in Canaan. As the whole congregation did on that occasion, so here the prophet, by his "yea," expresses his adherence to the covenant, and admits that the engagement is yet in full force for the congregation of God; and at the same time indicates that he, on his part, is ready to labour for the fulfilment of the covenant, so that the people may not become liable to the curse of the law.</body></html>
