The elders speaking in the time of Jehoiakim (cir. B.C. 608) remembered the tradition of what had passed, a century or so before, in the reign of Hezekiah (B.C. 726-698), and could appeal to it as a precedent in favour of the prophet. The word for “assembly” (elsewhere rendered “congregation”) corresponds to the <span class= "ital">Ecclesia </span>of a Greek city.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/jeremiah/26.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/26-17.htm" title="Then rose up certain of the elders of the land, and spoke to all the assembly of the people, saying,...">Jeremiah 26:17-19</a></span>. <span class="ital">Then rose up certain of the elders </span>— Either the princes before mentioned, or the more intelligent men of the people, stood up, and put the assembly in mind of a former case, as is usual with us in giving judgment, the wisdom of our predecessors being a direction to us. The case referred to is that of Micah, the book of whose prophecies we have among those of the minor prophets. Was it thought strange that Jeremiah prophesied against this city and the temple? Micah did so before him, even in the reign of Hezekiah, that reign of reformation, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-18.htm" title="Micah the Morasthite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and spoke to all the people of Judah, saying, Thus said the LORD of hosts; Zion shall be plowed like a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of a forest.">Jeremiah 26:18</a>. Micah said as publicly, as Jeremiah had now spoken to the same purpose, <span class="ital">Zion shall be ploughed like a field </span>— The buildings shall be all destroyed, so that nothing shall hinder but it may be ploughed; <span class="ital">Jerusalem shall become heaps</span> — Of ruins; <span class="ital">and the mountain of the house </span>— On which the temple is built; <span class="ital">shall be as the high places of the forest </span>— Overrun with briers and thorns. This Micah not only spoke, but wrote, and left it upon record, <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/3-12.htm" title="Therefore shall Zion for your sake be plowed as a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of the forest.">Micah 3:12</a>. Now <span class="ital">did Hezekiah and all Judah put him to death? </span>— Did the people come together in a body to accuse Micah, and demand sentence against him, as they had now done in the case of Jeremiah? Did they and their king make an act to silence him, or take away his life? No: on the contrary, they took the warning he gave them. Hezekiah, that renowned prince, set a good example before his successors; for <span class="ital">he feared the Lord, </span>as Noah, who, being <span class="ital">warned of God of things not seen as yet, was moved with fear. </span>He <span class="ital">besought the Lord </span>— To turn away the judgment threatened, and to be reconciled to them; and he found it was not in vain to do so; <span class="ital">for the Lord repented him of the evil </span>— Returned in mercy to them, and even sent an angel, who routed the army of the Assyrians that then threatened to destroy Jerusalem. These elders conclude, that it would be of dangerous consequence to the state if they should gratify the importunity of the priests and prophets in putting Jeremiah to death; saying, <span class="ital">Thus we might procure great evil against our souls </span>— Observe, reader, it is well to deter ourselves from sin, with the consideration of the mischief we should certainly do to ourselves by it, and the irreparable damage we should thereby bring upon our own souls.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/26.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>26:16-24 When secure sinners are threatened with taking away the Spirit of God, and the kingdom of God, it is what is warranted from the word of God. Hezekiah who protected Micah, prospered. Did Jehoiakim, who slew Urijah, prosper? The examples of bad men, and the bad consequences of their sins, should deter from what is evil. Urijah was faithful in delivering his message, but faulty in leaving his work. And the Lord was pleased to permit him to lose his life, while Jeremiah was protected in danger. Those are safest who most simply trust in the Lord, whatever their outward circumstances may be; and that He has all men's hearts in his hands, encourages us to trust him in the way of duty. He will honour and recompense those who show kindness to such as are persecuted for his sake.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The elders of the land - The heads and spokesmen of the congregation, who added their approval after the princes who represented the king had given their decision. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/26.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17.

The whole verse is thoroughly technical in its phraseology. The word (<span class="accented">qahal</span>) rendered "assembly" is the traditional legal term for the "congregation of Israel" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-30.htm">Deuteronomy 31:30</a>); comp. ver. 9, where the verb is the corresponding one to <span class="accented">qahal</span>. Thus, with all the faults of the government of Judah, which Jeremiah himself reveals to us, it was very far removed from the Oriental despotisms of our day. The "elders" are still an important element in the social system, and form a link with that earlier period in which the family was the leading power in the social organization. Originally the term denoted, strictly and in the full sense, heads of families; they have their  analogue in the councils of the Aryan village communities. "References to their parliamentary status (if the phrase may be used) occur in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-16.htm">Exodus 3:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-11.htm">2 Samuel 19:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-1.htm">1 Kings 8:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-7.htm">1 Kings 20:7</a>.

We find another reference to their quasi-judicial authority in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-2.htm">Deuteronomy 21:2</a>. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/26.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Before these princes, about whom all the people gathered, Jeremiah is accused by the priests and prophets: "This man is worthy of death;" literally: a sentence of death (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-6.htm">Deuteronomy 19:6</a>), condemnation to death, is due to this man; "for he hath prophesied against this city, as ye have heard with your ears." With these last words they appeal to the people standing round who had heard the prophecy, for the princes had not reached the temple till after Jeremiah had been apprehended. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-12.htm">Jeremiah 26:12</a>. To this Jeremiah answered in his own defence before the princes and all the people: "Jahveh hath sent me to prophesy against (&#1488;&#1500; for &#1506;&#1500;) this house and against this city all the words which ye have heard. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-13.htm">Jeremiah 26:13</a>.

But I, behold, I am in your hand; do with me as seemeth to you good and right. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-15.htm">Jeremiah 26:15</a>. Only ye must know, that if ye put me to death, ye bring innocent blood upon you, and upon this city, and upon her inhabitants; for of a truth Jahveh hath sent me to you to speak in your ears all these words." - As to "make your ways good," cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-3.htm">Jeremiah 7:3</a>. This defence made an impression on the princes and on all the people. From the intimation that by reform it was possible to avert the threatened calamity, and from the appeal to the fact that in truth Jahveh had sent him and commanded him so to speak, they see that he is a true prophet, whose violent death would bring blood-guiltiness upon the city and its inhabitants. They therefore declare to the accusers, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-16.htm">Jeremiah 26:16</a> : "This man is not worthy of death, for in the name of Jahveh our God hath he spoken unto us."</body></html>
