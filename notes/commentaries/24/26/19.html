There is no special record of the repentance thus referred to, but it is quite in accord with Hezekiah’s general character, as seen in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_chronicles/29-6.htm" title="For our fathers have trespassed, and done that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD our God, and have forsaken him, and have turned away their faces from the habitation of the LORD, and turned their backs.">2Chronicles 29:6-10</a> (which may be the occasion referred to) and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-26.htm" title="Notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart, both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of the LORD came not on them in the days of Hezekiah.">2Chronicles 32:26</a>. The whole tone of the advice of “old experience,” approximating to something like “prophetic strain,” in this case, reminds us of the counsels of Gamaliel in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/5-35.htm" title="And said to them, You men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what you intend to do as touching these men.">Acts 5:35-39</a>. The closing words, “Thus might we procure great evil to our souls,” present an exact parallel to “lest haply we be found even to fight against God.” The result of the counsel thus given is left to be inferred. It obviously left the prophet free to continue his work as a preacher, though probably under a kind of police surveillance, like that implied in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/36-1.htm" title="And it came to pass in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, that this word came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,">Jeremiah 36:1-5</a>. The favourable result is attributed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-24.htm" title="Nevertheless the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah, that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death.">Jeremiah 26:24</a> to the influence of Ahikam.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/26.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>26:16-24 When secure sinners are threatened with taking away the Spirit of God, and the kingdom of God, it is what is warranted from the word of God. Hezekiah who protected Micah, prospered. Did Jehoiakim, who slew Urijah, prosper? The examples of bad men, and the bad consequences of their sins, should deter from what is evil. Urijah was faithful in delivering his message, but faulty in leaving his work. And the Lord was pleased to permit him to lose his life, while Jeremiah was protected in danger. Those are safest who most simply trust in the Lord, whatever their outward circumstances may be; and that He has all men's hearts in his hands, encourages us to trust him in the way of duty. He will honour and recompense those who show kindness to such as are persecuted for his sake.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thus might we procure ... - Rather, And we should commit a great evil against our own souls; i. e., by putting Jeremiah to death, we should commit a sin which would prove a great misfortune to ourselves. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/26.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19.

Now if we should take a quite contrary course, and put this man to death, we should do contrary to what that good prince did, (and that with good success,) do ourselves no good, but <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">procure great evil against our souls; </span> that is, against ourselves, both bodies and souls strictly taken. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/26.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him at all to death?.... No, they did not: neither the king, by his own authority; nor the sanhedrim, the great court of judicature, for the nation; they never sought to take away his life, nor sat in council about it; they never arraigned him, and much less condemned him: <p>did he not fear the Lord, and besought the Lord; that is, Hezekiah; he did, as knowing that Micah was a prophet of the Lord, and sent by him; wherefore he received his prophecy with great awe and reverence, as coming from the Lord, and made his supplications to him that he would avert the judgments threatened: <p>and the Lord repented of the evil which he had pronounced against them? the king and his people, the city and the temple; and so the threatened evil came not upon them in their days: <p>thus might we procure great evil against our souls; should we put Jeremiah to death: it is therefore much more advisable to do as Hezekiah did, pray unto the Lord to avert the threatened evil, or otherwise it will be worse with us.

[The words of Micah had been to the full as harsh-sounding as any that had been uttered by Jeremiah. Jeremiah was attacked for predicting the fall of the Temple and city; but Micah had said the same thing and no action was taken against him. The precedent supplied by the case of the former prophet therefore, the elders argue, is in favour of him who is now attacked. The passage is important as shewing that the reforms of Hezekiah were far from being attributable to the influence of Isaiah alone.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">intreat the favour</span>] lit. <span class="ital">smooth the face</span>, i.e. remove the frown (of an offended deity), appease; an anthropomorphism.

But the word serves at any rate to remind us that “all prophecy is conditional. The prophets declare the great principles of God’s moral government, and apply them to individual cases. But, if the moral conditions of the cases to which these principles are applied be altered, the threatening or the promise is postponed, modified, or recalled.” C.B. (Cheyne) on Micah, <span class="ital">l.c</span>. In the present case the destruction here described was never altogether fulfilled. Co. points out the special interest that attaches to the above episode, as indicating what a deep impression the utterances of a prophet made upon the people, even after the lapse of a century.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thus might we procure</span>, etc.; rather, <span class="accented">and we are about to commit a great evil against our souls</span> (not merely "against ourselves").

With these last words they appeal to the people standing round who had heard the prophecy, for the princes had not reached the temple till after Jeremiah had been apprehended. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-12.htm">Jeremiah 26:12</a>. To this Jeremiah answered in his own defence before the princes and all the people: "Jahveh hath sent me to prophesy against (&#1488;&#1500; for &#1506;&#1500;) this house and against this city all the words which ye have heard. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-13.htm">Jeremiah 26:13</a>.

But I, behold, I am in your hand; do with me as seemeth to you good and right. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-15.htm">Jeremiah 26:15</a>. Only ye must know, that if ye put me to death, ye bring innocent blood upon you, and upon this city, and upon her inhabitants; for of a truth Jahveh hath sent me to you to speak in your ears all these words." - As to "make your ways good," cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-3.htm">Jeremiah 7:3</a>. This defence made an impression on the princes and on all the people. From the intimation that by reform it was possible to avert the threatened calamity, and from the appeal to the fact that in truth Jahveh had sent him and commanded him so to speak, they see that he is a true prophet, whose violent death would bring blood-guiltiness upon the city and its inhabitants. They therefore declare to the accusers, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-16.htm">Jeremiah 26:16</a> : "This man is not worthy of death, for in the name of Jahveh our God hath he spoken unto us."</body></html>
