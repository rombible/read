He must “obey God rather than man” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-29.htm" title="Then Peter and the other apostles answered and said, We ought to obey God rather than men.">Acts 5:29</a>). And in this instance the prophet has nothing in the way of credentials but the message itself. He worked no signs or wonders.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/26.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>26:7-15 The priests and prophets charged Jeremiah as deserving death, and bore false witness against him. The elders of Israel came to inquire into this matter. Jeremiah declares that the Lord sent him to prophesy thus. As long as ministers keep close to the word they have from God, they need not fear. And those are very unjust who complain of ministers for preaching of hell and damnation; for it is from a desire to bring them to heaven and salvation. Jeremiah warns them of their danger if they go on against him. All men may know, that to hurt, or put to death, or to show hatred to their faithful reprovers, will hasten and increase their own punishment.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The answer of Jeremiah is simple and straightforward. Yahweh, he affirmed, had truly sent him, but the sole object of his prophesying had been to avert the evil by leading them to repentance. If they would amend their ways God would deliver them from the threatened doom. As for himself he was in their hands, but if they put him to death they would bring the guilt of shedding innocent blood upon themselves and upon the city. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/26.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. Lord sent me&#8212;a valid justification against any laws alleged against him.<p>against &#8230; against&#8212;rather, "concerning." Jeremiah purposely avoids saying, "against," which would needlessly irritate. They had used the same Hebrew word (Jer 26:11), which ought to be translated "concerning," though they meant it in the unfavorable sense. Jeremiah takes up their word in a better sense, implying that there is still room for repentance: that his prophecies aim at the real good of the city; for or concerning this house &#8230; city [Grotius].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/26.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The priests having given Jeremiah his charge, he makes his defence. The sum of which was, he acknowledgeth that he had prophesied against the temple, and against the city, and tacitly acknowledgeth their power to take cognizance of seditious persons and false prophets, and doth not deny but such persons deserved to die; but denieth that he was a false prophet, or guilty of any design to stir up sedition, for he had said nothing but what God had sent him to speak; and therefore could not prophesy what was false, nor was to be charged with any seditious design. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/26.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then spake Jeremiah unto all the princes, and to all the people, saying,.... In his own defence; which, as Jerom observes, was with prudence, humility, and constancy: <p>the Lord sent me to prophesy against this house, and against this city, all the words that ye have heard; he does not deny but that he had prophesied against the city of Jerusalem and against the temple, and that they should both come to ruin, unless the people repented and reformed; but then he urges, that he was sent by the Lord on this errand, and that every word that he had said, and they had heard, he was ordered to say by the Lord; and therefore what was he, that he should withstand God? he surely was not to be blamed for doing what the Lord commanded him to do; besides, all this was threatened only in case they continued obstinate and impenitent; wherefore he renews his exhortations to them in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-13.htm">Jeremiah 26:13</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/26.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Then Jeremiah spoke to all the princes and to all the people, saying, The LORD <span class="cverse3">{h}</span> sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that ye have heard.</span><p>(h) He both shows the cause of his doings plainly and also threatens them that nothing would help, though they should put him to death, but heap greater vengeance on their heads.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/26.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">12</span>. Jeremiah’s defence is that the message is from God and therefore true. His conviction is unshaken. Let his accusers beware, lest in putting him to death they be really fighting against God. Cp.

He is conscious that he has not spoken uncommissioned, and leaves the result. He urges the people to amendment of life, while there is time, and warns them that his own unmerited death will bring a curse upon themselves. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/26.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Accusation and Acquittal of Jeremiah. - <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-1.htm">Jeremiah 26:1-7</a>. His prophecy that temple and city would be destroyed gave occasion to the accusation of the prophet. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-1.htm">Jeremiah 26:1</a>. "In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah king of Judah, came this word from Jahveh, saying: <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-2.htm">Jeremiah 26:2</a>. Thus said Jahveh: Stand in the court of the house of Jahveh, and speak to all the cities of Judah which come to worship in Jahveh's house, all the words that I have commanded thee to speak to them; take not a word therefrom. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-3.htm">Jeremiah 26:3</a>. Perchance they will hearken and turn each from his evil way, that I may repent me of the evil which I purpose to do unto them for the evil of their doings. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-4.htm">Jeremiah 26:4</a>. And say unto them: Thus saith Jahveh: If ye hearken not to me, to walk in my law which I have set before you, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-5.htm">Jeremiah 26:5</a>. To hearken to the words of my servants the prophets whom I sent unto you, from early morning on sending, but ye have not hearkened. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-6.htm">Jeremiah 26:6</a>. Then I make this house like Shiloh, and this city a curse to all the peoples of the earth. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-7.htm">Jeremiah 26:7</a>. And the priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of Jahveh."<p>In the discourse of <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7.htm">Jeremiah 7</a>, where he was combating the people's false reliance upon the temple, Jeremiah had already threatened that the temple should share the fate of Shiloh, unless the people turned from its evil ways. Now, since that discourse was also delivered in the temple, and since <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-2.htm">Jeremiah 26:2-6</a> of the present chapter manifestly communicate only the substance of what the prophet said, several comm. have held these discourses to be identical, and have taken it for granted that the discourse here referred to, belonging to the beginning of Jehoiakim's reign, was given in full in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7.htm">Jeremiah 7</a>, while the history of it has been given in the present chapter by way of supplement (cf. the introductory remarks to <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7.htm">Jeremiah 7</a>). But considering that it is a peculiarity of Jeremiah frequently to repeat certain of the main thoughts of his message, the saying of God, that He will do to the temple as He has done to Shiloh, is not sufficient to warrant this assumption. Jeremiah frequently held discourses in the temple, and more than once foretold the destruction of Jerusalem; so that it need not be surprising if on more than one occasion he threatened the temple with the fate of Shiloh. Between the two discourses there is further this distinction: Whereas in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7.htm">Jeremiah 7</a> the prophet speaks chiefly of the spoliation or destruction of the temple and the expulsion of the people into exile, here in brief incisive words he intimates the destruction of the city of Jerusalem as well; and the present chapter throughout gives the impression that by this, so to speak, peremptory declaration, the prophet sought to move the people finally to decide for Jahveh its God, and that he thus so exasperated the priests and prophets present, that they seized him and pronounced him worthy of death. - According to the heading, this took place in the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim. The like specification in the heading of <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27.htm">Jeremiah 27</a> does not warrant us to refer the date to the fourth year of this king. "The beginning" intimates simply that the discourse belongs to the earlier period of Jehoiakim's reign, without minuter information as to year and day. "To Jeremiah" seems to have been dropped out after "came this word," <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-1.htm">Jeremiah 26:1</a>. The court of the house of God is not necessarily the inner or priests' court of the temple; it may have been the outer one where the people assembled; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-14.htm">Jeremiah 19:14</a>. All the "cities of Judah" for their inhabitants, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-12.htm">Jeremiah 11:12</a>. The addition: "take not a word therefrom," cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-2.htm">Deuteronomy 4:2</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/13-1.htm">Deuteronomy 13:1</a>, indicates the peremptory character of the discourse. In full, without softening the threat by the omission of anything the Lord commanded him, i.e., he is to proclaim the word of the Lord in its full unconditional severity, to move the people, if possible, to repentance, acc. to <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-3.htm">Jeremiah 26:3</a>. With <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-3.htm">Jeremiah 26:3</a>, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-8.htm">Jeremiah 18:8</a>, etc. - In <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-4.htm">Jeremiah 26:4-6</a> we have the contents of the discourse. If they hearken not to the words of the prophet, as has hitherto been the case, the Lord will make the temple as Shiloh, and this city, i.e., Jerusalem, a curse, i.e., an object of curses (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-9.htm">Jeremiah 24:9</a>), for all peoples. On this cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-12.htm">Jeremiah 7:12</a>. But ye have not hearkened.
