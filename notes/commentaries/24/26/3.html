He did give them time, for it was after this eleven years before the captivity of Jehoiakim, and two and twenty before that of Zedekiah; and for means, God afforded them the ministry of this prophet. Repentance applied to man signifieth a change of heart and counsels, as well as of his course of actions: in the unchangeable God it only signifieth the turning of the course of his providence, not bringing that evil upon them for the evil of their doings which, supposing their progress and obstinacy in their sinful courses, he had fully resolved to bring upon them. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/26.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>If so be they will hearken,....

This is intimated in the summons to howl and lament addressed to the shepherds, i.e., the kings and rulers on earth (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-21.htm">Jeremiah 10:21</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-22.htm">Jeremiah 22:22</a>, etc.), and to the lordly or glorious of the flock, i.e., to the illustrious, powerful, and wealthy. With "sprinkle you," cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-26.htm">Jeremiah 6:26</a>. Your days are full or filled for the slaughter, i.e., the days of your life are full, so that ye shall be slain; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-18.htm">Lamentations 4:18</a>. &#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1508;&#1493;&#1510;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501; is obscure and hard to explain. It is so read by the Masora, while many codd. and editt. have &#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1508;&#1493;&#1468;&#1510;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501;. According to this latter form, Jerome, Rashi, Kimchi, lately Maur. and Umbr., hold the word for a substantive: your dispersions. But whether we connect this with what precedes or what follows, we fail to obtain a fitting sense from it. Your days are full and your dispersions, for: the time is come when ye shall be slain and dispersed, cannot be maintained, because "dispersions" is not in keeping with "are full." Again: as regards your dispersions, ye shall fall, would give a good meaning, only if "your dispersions" meant: the flock dispersed by the fault of the shepherds; and with this the second pers. "ye shall fall" does not agree. The sig. of fatness given by Ew. to the word is wholly arbitrary. Hitz., Gr. and Ng. take the word to be a Tiphil (like &#1514;&#1492;&#1512;&#1492;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-5.htm">Jeremiah 12:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-15.htm">Jeremiah 22:15</a>), and read &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1497;&#1510;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501;, I scatter you. This gives a suitable sense; and there is no valid reason for attaching to the word, as Hitz. and Gr. do, the force of &#1508;&#1468;&#1510;&#1509; or &#1504;&#1508;&#1509;, smite in pieces. The thought, that one part of the flock shall be slain, the other scattered, seems quite apt; so also is that which follows, that they are scattered shall fall and break like precious, i.e., fine, ornamental vases. Hence there was no occasion for Ew.'s conjectural emendation, &#1499;&#1468;&#1499;&#1512;&#1497;, like precious lambs. Nor does the lxx rendering: &#x3b7;&#788;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1; &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#788; &#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#788; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;, give it any support; for &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; does not mean rams, but lambs. The similar comparison of Jechoniah to a worthless vessel (22:28) tells in favour of the reading in the text (Graf). - In <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-35.htm">Jeremiah 25:35</a> the threatening is made more woeful by the thought, that the shepherds shall find no refuge, and that no escape will be open to the sheep.</body></html>
