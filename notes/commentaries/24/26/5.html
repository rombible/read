See how God waits to be gracious. If they persisted in disobedience, it would ruin their city and temple. Can any thing else be expected?

As a young lion forsakes his covert to seek for prey, so Jahveh has gone forth out of His heavenly habitation to hold judgment on the people; for their (the shepherds') land becomes a desert. The perff. are prophetic. &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; has grounding force. The desolation of the land gives proof that the Lord has arisen to do judgment. &#1495;&#1512;&#1493;&#1503; &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1504;&#1492; seems strange, since the adjective &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1504;&#1492; never occurs independently, but only in connection with &#1495;&#1512;&#1489; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-16.htm">Jeremiah 46:16</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-16.htm">Jeremiah 50:16</a>, and with &#1506;&#1497;&#1512;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/3-1.htm">Zechariah 3:1</a>). &#1495;&#1512;&#1493;&#1503;, again, is regularly joined with '&#1488;&#1507; &#1497;, and only three times besides with a suffix referring to Jahveh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-7.htm">Exodus 15:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-5.htm">Psalm 2:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-14.htm">Ezekiel 7:14</a>). In this we find justification for the conjecture of Hitz., Ew., Gr., etc., that we should read with the lxx and Chald. &#1495;&#1512;&#1489; . The article with the adj. after the subst. without one, here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-16.htm">Jeremiah 46:16</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-16.htm">Jeremiah 50:16</a>, is to be explained by the looseness of connection between the participle and its noun; cf.
