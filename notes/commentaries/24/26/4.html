To walk in God’s laws is expounded by hearkening unto them, or (as in other places) by observing, keeping, and doing them.

The priests and the prophets interfere, arrest Jeremiah, and accuse him of a capital crime. It would appear that some at least of the "false prophets" were priests; thus Pashur, we are told, was a priest (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-6.htm">Jeremiah 20:6</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/25.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The prophet is already hearing in spirit the lamentation to which in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-34.htm">Jeremiah 25:34</a> he has called them, because Jahveh has laid waste the pastures of the shepherds and their flocks, and destroyed the peaceful meadows by the heat of His anger. - In <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-38.htm">Jeremiah 25:38</a>, finally, the discourse is rounded off by a repetition and expansion of the thought with which the description of the judgment was begun in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-30.htm">Jeremiah 25:30</a>. As a young lion forsakes his covert to seek for prey, so Jahveh has gone forth out of His heavenly habitation to hold judgment on the people; for their (the shepherds') land becomes a desert. The perff. are prophetic. &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; has grounding force. The desolation of the land gives proof that the Lord has arisen to do judgment. &#1495;&#1512;&#1493;&#1503; &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1504;&#1492; seems strange, since the adjective &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1504;&#1492; never occurs independently, but only in connection with &#1495;&#1512;&#1489; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-16.htm">Jeremiah 46:16</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-16.htm">Jeremiah 50:16</a>, and with &#1506;&#1497;&#1512;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/3-1.htm">Zechariah 3:1</a>). &#1495;&#1512;&#1493;&#1503;, again, is regularly joined with '&#1488;&#1507; &#1497;, and only three times besides with a suffix referring to Jahveh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-7.htm">Exodus 15:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-5.htm">Psalm 2:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-14.htm">Ezekiel 7:14</a>). In this we find justification for the conjecture of Hitz., Ew., Gr., etc., that we should read with the lxx and Chald. &#1495;&#1512;&#1489; . The article with the adj. after the subst. without one, here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-16.htm">Jeremiah 46:16</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-16.htm">Jeremiah 50:16</a>, is to be explained by the looseness of connection between the participle and its noun; cf.
