The new sin would lead to a new punishment. A tone of irony is perceptible in the words, “Ye will surely accomplish your vows.” That, at all events, was a promise they were likely to keep, however faithless they might have shown themselves in keeping their vows to the God of their fathers. But the Lord of Israel meets that vow by another. By that “great name” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-16.htm" title="And said, By myself have I sworn, said the LORD, for because you have done this thing, and have not withheld your son, your only son:">Genesis 22:16</a>) of the Lord God (<span class= "ital">Jehovah Adonai</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>which they had slighted and profaned, He declares that it shall be profaned no more by the Egyptian exiles, not because they, of their own accord, would cease to use it, but because none of them should be left there. The small remnant that survived the sword and the famine should return to Judah as a witness of the judgment that had fallen on them, and of the truth of the prophet’s warning. The words of Jehovah should stand, while those of men should fail.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/jeremiah/44.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/44-24.htm" title="Moreover Jeremiah said to all the people, and to all the women, Hear the word of the LORD, all Judah that are in the land of Egypt:...">Jeremiah 44:24-28</a></span>. <span class="ital">Jeremiah said, Hear all Judah that are in the land of Egypt</span> — That is, all you men and women that belong to Judah, and are now come to dwell in Egypt; <span class="ital">ye and your wives have spoken </span>— The Hebrew word <span class="greekheb">תדברנה</span>, rendered <span class="ital">have spoken, </span>is of the feminine gender, and implies that the women were first and principally concerned in this idolatry, and that the men’s guilt lay chiefly in conniving at them, and suffering themselves to be seduced by them; <span class="ital">saying, We will surely perform our vows, </span>&c. — They insist on their unlawful vows as obligations in conscience, which could not be dispensed with, just as Herod did on his unlawful oath, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/14-9.htm" title="And the king was sorry: nevertheless for the oath's sake, and them which sat with him at meat, he commanded it to be given her.">Matthew 14:9</a> : as if, though to <span class="ital">burn incense to the queen of heaven </span>were a sin, yet their having vowed to do it were sufficient to justify them in the doing of it; whereas no man can, by his vow, make that lawful to himself, much less his duty, which God had before made sin. <span class="ital">Ye will surely accomplish your vows, </span>&c. — You are resolved upon it, and there is no moving you from your resolution. <span class="ital">Therefore hear ye the word of the Lord </span>— Hear what is God’s resolution. <span class="ital">Behold, I have sworn by my great name, saith the Lord </span>— I also have made a solemn vow, in opposition to that wicked one of yours, and have confirmed it by an oath. <span class="ital">I have sworn and will not repent: That my name shall no more be named by any man of Judah in the land of Egypt, </span>&c. — “These Jews seem to have joined the worship of the true God with that of idols, as the Samaritans did before them, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-33.htm" title="They feared the LORD, and served their own gods, after the manner of the nations whom they carried away from there.">2 Kings 17:33</a>.

Since they were determined to persist in their idolatry, God would go on to punish them. What little remains of religion were among them, would be lost. The creature-comforts and confidences from which we promise ourselves most, may fail as soon as those from which we promise ourselves least; and all are what God makes them, not what we fancy them to be.

"Then all the men who knew that their wives burned incense to other gods, and all the women standing [there], a great multitude, and all the people who dwelt in the land of Egypt, in Pathros, answered Jeremiah, saying, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-16.htm">Jeremiah 44:16</a>. [As for] the word which thou hast spoken unto us in the name of Jahveh, we will not hearken unto thee: <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-17.htm">Jeremiah 44:17</a>. But we will certainly perform every word that has proceeded out of our own mouth, by burning incense to the queen of heaven, and pouring out libations to her, just as we have done, we and our fathers, our kings and our princes, in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem; and we were filled with bread, and became prosperous, and saw no evil. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-18.htm">Jeremiah 44:18</a>. But since we ceased to offer incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out libations to her, we have been in want of everything, and are consumed by sword and famine. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-19.htm">Jeremiah 44:19</a>. And when we [women] have been burning incense to the queen of heaven, and poured out libations to her, have we made cakes to her without our husbands, making an image of her, and offering libations to her?" To the word of the prophet the men and women oppose their pretended experience, that the adoration of the queen of heaven has brought them comfort and prosperity, while the neglect of this worship, on the other hand, has brought want and misfortune. No doubt they inferred this, by the argument post hoc, ergo propter hoc, from the fact that, after idolatry had been rooted out by Josiah, adversity had befallen the land of Judah; while, up till that time, the kingdom of Judah had been independent, and, for more than a century before, had been spared the suffering of misfortune. Thus, through their blindness, peculiar to the natural man, they had overlooked the minor transient evils with which the Lord visits His people when they sin. Not till near the end of Josiah's reign did misfortune fall on Judah: this was when the Egyptian army, under Pharaoh-Necho, marched through Palestine; Josiah was slain in the battle he had lost, the land was laid waste by the enemy, and its inhabitants perished by sword and famine. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-15.htm">Jeremiah 44:15</a>, those who are represented speaking are all the men who knew of their wives' idolatry, i.e., who permitted it, and all the women, "a great company," i.e., gathered together in great numbers, and all the rest of the people who lived in Egypt. The specification "in Pathros" is not in apposition to the words "in the land of Egypt," but belongs to the verb &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;; it tells where the gathering took place, viz., in a district of Upper Egypt. From the presence of a large number of women, we may conclude that the assembly was a festival in honour of the queen of heaven. The former portion of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-16.htm">Jeremiah 44:16</a> forms an absolute clause, from &#1492;&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; to &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501;, "as regards the word which...we will not listen to thee," i.e., with regard to this word we obey thee not. The expression, "the word which has gone forth out of our mouth," points to the uttering of vows: cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/30-13.htm">Numbers 30:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-24.htm">Deuteronomy 23:24</a>. '&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; means "all that we have uttered as a vow," every vow to offer incense, etc., i.e., to present meat and drink offerings to the queen of heaven, - that shall we keep, fulfil, as we and our fathers have done in the land of Judah. On this mode of worship, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-17.htm">Jeremiah 7:17</a>., and the remarks there made. "And we were satisfied with bread," i.e., in consequence of this worship we had amply sufficient food. Towbiym &#1496;&#1493;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501;, "good," well, comfortable; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-16.htm">Jeremiah 22:16</a>. &#1502;&#1503; &#1488;&#1494;, "from that time"  equals  since. &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; is for &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, from &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1501;, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/17-1.htm">Numbers 17:1-13</a> :28; cf. Ewald, 197, a. To this statement on the part of the men, the women further add, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-19.htm">Jeremiah 44:19</a>, that they do not engage in this sacrificial worship or prepare the sacrificial cakes without their husbands, i.e., without their knowledge and approval. This is put forward by the women in the way of self-vindication; for, according to the law, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/30-9.htm">Numbers 30:9</a>., the husband could annul, i.e., declare not binding, any vow which had been made by his wife without his knowledge. Although it is women who are speaking, the masc. &#1502;&#1511;&#1496;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; is used as being the gender which most commonly occurs; it also pretty often stands for the feminine. The inf. constr. &#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492;&#1505;&#1468;&#1498; (with &#1500;) is here employed, in conformity with later usage, instead of the inf. abs., for the finite verb, by way of continuation; cf. Ewald, 351, c, where, however, many passages have been set down as falling under this rule that demand a different explanation. The meaning of &#1500;&#1492;&#1506;&#1510;&#1489;&#1492; is disputed; the final &#1492; is a suffix, written with Raphe, though Mappik also occurs in some MSS. The Hiphil of this verb is found elsewhere only in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/78-40.htm">Psalm 78:40</a>, and there in the signification of vexing, grieving, like the Piel in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-10.htm">Isaiah 63:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/66-6.htm">Psalm 66:6</a>. Ewald translates "in order to move her," i.e., make her well-disposed, - but quite arbitrarily, for to provoke is the very opposite of rendering propitious. The verb &#1506;&#1510;&#1468;&#1489; also signifies "to form, shape," <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-8.htm">Job 10:8</a>; and in this sense the Hiphil is used here, "in order to put them into shape," i.e., to form the moon-goddess (queen of heaven) in or on the sacrificial cakes (Kimchi, Raschi, Dahler, Maurer, Graf, etc.). The sacrificial cakes (&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-18.htm">Jeremiah 7:18</a>) probably had the form of a crescent, or even of the full moon, like the &#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; of the Greeks, which used to be offered in Athens at the time of the full moon in the month of Munychion, to Artemis, as goddess of the moon; cf. Hermann, gottesdienstliche Alterthmer der Griechen, 2 Ausg. S. 146, Anm. 13, u. S. 414. </body></html>
