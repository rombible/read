This was the evil which the prophet had all along dreaded, and which had made him from the first, like his predecessor, Isaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-2.htm" title="That walk to go down into Egypt, and have not asked at my mouth; to strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh, and to trust in the shadow of Egypt!">Isaiah 30:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/31-1.htm" title="Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help; and stay on horses, and trust in chariots, because they are many; and in horsemen, because they are very strong; but they look not to the Holy One of Israel, neither seek the LORD!">Isaiah 31:1</a>), hostile to every plan of an alliance with Egypt.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/jeremiah/44.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/44-8.htm" title="In that you provoke me to wrath with the works of your hands, burning incense to other gods in the land of Egypt, where you be gone to dwell, that you might cut yourselves off, and that you might be a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth?...">Jeremiah 44:8-10</a></span>. <span class="ital">Ye provoke me unto wrath with the works of your hands </span>— By making and setting up idols to worship. <span class="ital">That ye might cut yourselves off, </span>&c. — This is not to be so taken as if they did these things with a design to cut off themselves and their posterity: but only as signifying that their utter ruin would be the certain consequence of their continuing so to act. <span class="ital">Have ye forgotten the wickedness of your fathers? </span>&c. — Have you forgotten what great wickedness your fathers committed, and what great punishments were in consequence thereof inflicted upon them? We may be truly said to have forgotten that the sight of which, or reflection thereon, makes no such impression upon us as produces a suitable practice. <span class="ital">Which they have committed in the land of Judah, </span>&c. — To have practised these things in any place would have been to contract great guilt; but to have done them in the land of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, in the valley of vision, and in the holy city, where there were such means of information and such helps to piety, was still more aggravated and inexcusable wickedness. <span class="ital">They are not humbled even unto this day — </span>Neither they nor you are yet properly humbled, and prepared for receiving mercy. <span class="ital">Neither have they feared, nor walked in my law </span>— Hence we learn, that reformation and obedience are the proper fruit of true contrition and humiliation; God does not account those to be humbled, but hardened, who are not reformed and made obedient, let their pretended contrition or humiliation be, in outward appearance, what it may.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/44.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>44:1-14 God reminds the Jews of the sins that brought desolations upon Judah. It becomes us to warn men of the danger of sin with all seriousness: Oh, do not do it! If you love God, do not, for it is provoking to him; if you love your own souls, do not, for it is destructive to them. Let conscience do this for us in the hour of temptation. The Jews whom God sent into the land of the Chaldeans, were there, by the power of God's grace, weaned from idolatry; but those who went by their own perverse will into the land of the Egyptians, were there more attached than ever to their idolatries. When we thrust ourselves without cause or call into places of temptation, it is just with God to leave us to ourselves. If we walk contrary to God, he will walk contrary to us.
