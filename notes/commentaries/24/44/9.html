It becomes us to warn men of the danger of sin with all seriousness: Oh, do not do it! If you love God, do not, for it is provoking to him; if you love your own souls, do not, for it is destructive to them. Let conscience do this for us in the hour of temptation. The Jews whom God sent into the land of the Chaldeans, were there, by the power of God's grace, weaned from idolatry; but those who went by their own perverse will into the land of the Egyptians, were there more attached than ever to their idolatries. When we thrust ourselves without cause or call into places of temptation, it is just with God to leave us to ourselves. If we walk contrary to God, he will walk contrary to us.

And I sent unto you all my servants the prophets, rising early and sending (them), to say, Do not this abominable thing which I hate. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-5.htm">Jeremiah 44:5</a>. But they did not hear, nor inclined their ear to turn from their wickedness, by not burning incense to other gods. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-6.htm">Jeremiah 44:6</a>.
