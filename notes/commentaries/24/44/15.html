As of old—as, we may add, in the Rome of the Empire (Juvenal, Sat. vi. 526–534)—the women practised a <span class= "ital">cultus </span>in which their husbands acquiesced, even though they did not join in it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/jeremiah/44.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-15.htm" title="Then all the men which knew that their wives had burned incense to other gods, and all the women that stood by, a great multitude, even all the people that dwelled in the land of Egypt, in Pathros, answered Jeremiah, saying,">Jeremiah 44:15</a></span>. <span class="ital">Then all the men and all the women that dwelt in Pathros </span>— Which was Upper Egypt; <span class="ital">answered Jeremiah, </span>&c. — From this it appears with how much reason it was that God ordered Jeremiah to endeavour to prevent their going into Egypt, since the Israelitish women imitated the idolatry of the inhabitants of it, as soon as they came thither, and no people were immersed in a more absurd and shameful idolatry than the Egyptians. It is probable that when the Jewish women perceived the Egyptians to abound in riches and plenty, and to live in peace and security, they foolishly concluded that the gods which the Egyptians worshipped were more powerful, or more beneficent, than Jehovah, whom the Jews worshipped.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/44.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>44:15-19 These daring sinners do not attempt excuses, but declare they will do that which is forbidden. Those who disobey God, commonly grow worse and worse, and the heart is more hardened by the deceitfulness of sin. Here is the real language of the rebellious heart. Even the afflictions which should have parted them from their sins, were taken so as to confirm them in their sins. It is sad when those who should quicken each other to what is good, and so help one another to heaven, harden each other in sin, and so ripen one another for hell. To mingle idolatry with Divine worship, and to reject the mediation of Christ, are provoking to God, and ruinous to men. All who worship images, or honour saints, and angels, and the queen of heaven, should recollect what came from the idolatrous practices of the Jews.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/44.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Had burned incence - Omit "had;" burned incense. This appeal of the prophet was made at a public festival held somewhere in Pathros, i. e., Upper Egypt: for the women are assembled in a great congregation (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-9.htm">Jeremiah 26:9</a>), here formed for religious purposes. As they advance in regular procession to worship the moon-goddess, in accordance as it seems with a vow <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-17.htm">Jeremiah 44:17</a>, Jeremiah meets them, makes the procession halt upon its way, and pronounces in Yahweh's name words of solemn warning. The reply that all the settlers in Egypt were formally putting themselves under the Queen of heaven's protection was made by the heads of the congregation. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/44.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15. their wives&#8212;The idolatry began with them (1Ki 11:4; 1Ti 2:14). Their husbands' connivance implicated them in the guilt.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/44.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The burning of incense was a religious rite, which God had appointed the Jews as a piece of Divine homage to be paid to him alone, and by an ordinary figure is put for worship; so as burning incense to other gods is the same with worshipping other gods. It should seem that all the Jews had not been thus far guilty, and those that did it were mostly women, or at least they were the leaders in this idolatry; and one would think the phrase implieth that those who were thus culpable did it with some privacy, so as all their husbands did not know of it; but those that did were as bad as their wives, conniving at them, and justifying them in their idolatry, and joining with them in the following peremptory answer to and contempt of the prophet. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/44.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then all the men which knew that their wires had burnt incense unto other gods,....

This is immediately afterwards more exactly specified by '&#1500;&#1492;&#1499;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;, to exterminate the whole of you, without an exception. As to the enumeration "man and woman," etc., cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-3.htm">1 Samuel 15:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-19.htm">1 Samuel 22:19</a>.

For the expression "the works of your hands," see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-16.htm">Jeremiah 1:16</a>. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-8.htm">Jeremiah 44:8</a>, an object must be supplied from <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-7.htm">Jeremiah 44:7</a> for the expression &#1500;&#1502;&#1506;&#1503; &#1492;&#1499;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; &#1500;&#1499;&#1501;; for, to take &#1500;&#1499;&#1501; (with Hitzig) in a reflexive sense is a very harsh construction. On '&#1500;&#1511;&#1500;&#1500;&#1492; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/42-18.htm">Jeremiah 42:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-6.htm">Jeremiah 26:6</a>. The answer to the question now asked follows in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-9.htm">Jeremiah 44:9</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-10.htm">Jeremiah 44:10</a>, in the form of the further question, whether they have forgotten those former sins, and that these sins have been the cause of the evil which has befallen the land. The interrogation expresses the reproach that they have been able to forget both, as is evidenced by their continuance in sin. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-9.htm">Jeremiah 44:9</a>, the expression "the evil deeds of his wives" (&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1493;) is remarkable. Hitzig and Ngelsbach, following Kimchi, refer the suffix to the kings, since there was always but one king at a time. But this is an unnatural explanation; the suffix refers to Judah as a nation, and is used in order to comprehend the wives of the fathers and of the kings together. It is quite arbitrary in Ewald and Graf to change &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1493; to &#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493;, following the lxx &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;; for these translators have mutilated the text by the omission of the following &#1493;&#1488;&#1514; &#1512;&#1506;&#1514;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501;. &#1512;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514; &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1493; is not merely conserved, but even required, by &#1493;&#1488;&#1514; &#1512;&#1506;&#1514; &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501;. But the prophet gives special prominence to the evil deeds of the wives, since it was they who were most zealous in worshipping the queen of heaven; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-15.htm">Jeremiah 44:15</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-19.htm">Jeremiah 44:19</a>. &#1500;&#1488; &#1491;&#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;, "they have not been crushed," viz., by repentance and sorrow for these sins. The transition to the third person is not merely accounted for by the fact that the subject treated of is the sins of the fathers and of the present generation, - for, as is shown by the expression "till this day," the prophet has chiefly his own contemporaries in view; but he speaks of these in the third person, to signify the indignation with which he turns away from men so difficult to reform. On the expression, "they had not walked in my law," cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-4.htm">Jeremiah 26:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-12.htm">Jeremiah 9:12</a>. For this the Lord will punish them severely, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-11.htm">Jeremiah 44:11-14</a>. All those who have fled to Egypt, with the intention of remaining there, will be quite exterminated. On "Behold, I will set my face," etc., cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-10.htm">Jeremiah 21:10</a>. "For evil" is more exactly defined by "to cut off all Judah," i.e., those of Judah who are in Egypt, not those who are in Babylon. This limitation of the words "all Judah" is necessarily required by the context, and is plainly expressed in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-12.htm">Jeremiah 44:12</a>, where "Judah" is specified as "the remnant of Judah that were determined to go to Egypt." &#1500;&#1511;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; has the meaning of taking away, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-15.htm">Jeremiah 15:15</a>. &#1493;&#1514;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; are to be taken by themselves; and &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; &#1502;&#1510;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, as is shown by the accents, is to be attached to what follows, on which, too, the emphasis is placed; in like manner, '&#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1512;&#1489;  are to be attached to the succeeding verb. The arrangement of the words, like the accumulation of sentences all expressing the same meaning, reveals the spirit of the address in which God vents His wrath. On "they shall become an execration," etc., see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/42-18.htm">Jeremiah 42:18</a>. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-13.htm">Jeremiah 44:13</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-14.htm">Jeremiah 44:14</a>, the threatened extermination is further set forth. Those who dwelling Egypt shall be punished with sword, famine, and plague, like Jerusalem. The inhabitants of Egypt generally are meant; and by the judgment which is to fall on that country, the remnant of Judah there shall be so completely destroyed, that none shall escape. The leading member of the sentence is continued by &#1493;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;, "and that they should return to the land of Judah, after which their soul longs, that they may live there." A reason is further assigned, and with this the address, reduced within becoming limits, concludes: "for there shall return none except (&#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1488;&#1501;) fugitives," i.e., except a few individual fugitives who shall come back. This last clause shows that we are not to understand the declaration "none shall escape" in the strictest meaning of the words. Those who escape and return to Judah shall be so few, in comparison with those who shall perish in Egypt, as to be quite inconsiderable. Cf. the like instance of a seeming contradiction in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-27.htm">Jeremiah 44:27</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-28.htm">Jeremiah 44:28</a>.
