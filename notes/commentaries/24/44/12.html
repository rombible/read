It becomes us to warn men of the danger of sin with all seriousness: Oh, do not do it! If you love God, do not, for it is provoking to him; if you love your own souls, do not, for it is destructive to them. Let conscience do this for us in the hour of temptation. The Jews whom God sent into the land of the Chaldeans, were there, by the power of God's grace, weaned from idolatry; but those who went by their own perverse will into the land of the Egyptians, were there more attached than ever to their idolatries. When we thrust ourselves without cause or call into places of temptation, it is just with God to leave us to ourselves. If we walk contrary to God, he will walk contrary to us. The most awful miseries to which men are exposed, are occasioned by the neglect of offered salvation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/44.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>All Judah - i. e., all Judah in Egypt, yet even there with exceptions (see <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-14.htm">Jeremiah 44:14</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-28.htm">Jeremiah 44:28</a>), while Judah in Babylon was entirely exempt from this denunciation. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/44.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11.

Because of their wickedness which they have done, by provoking me through going to burn incense, (and) to serve other gods whom they knew not, (neither) they (nor) ye, nor your fathers. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-4.htm">Jeremiah 44:4</a>. And I sent unto you all my servants the prophets, rising early and sending (them), to say, Do not this abominable thing which I hate. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-5.htm">Jeremiah 44:5</a>. But they did not hear, nor inclined their ear to turn from their wickedness, by not burning incense to other gods. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-6.htm">Jeremiah 44:6</a>. Therefore my wrath and mine anger poured itself out, and burned up the cities of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem; so that they have become a desolation and a waste, as at this day. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-7.htm">Jeremiah 44:7</a>. Now therefore thus saith Jahveh of hosts, the God of Israel: Why do ye great evil against your souls, by cutting off from yourselves man and women, child and suckling, out of the midst of Judah, so leaving no remnant for yourselves; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-8.htm">Jeremiah 44:8</a>. Through provoking me by the works of your hands, burning incense to other gods in the land of Egypt, whither ye have gone to sojourn, that ye might bring destruction on yourselves, and that ye might become a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth? <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-9.htm">Jeremiah 44:9</a>. Have ye forgotten the evil deeds of your fathers, and the evil deeds of the kings of Judah, and the evil deeds of their wives, and your own evil deeds, and the evil deeds of your wives, which they committed in the land of Judah and on the streets of Jerusalem? <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-10.htm">Jeremiah 44:10</a>.

Therefore thus saith Jahveh of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will set my face against you for evil, and to cut off all Judah. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-12.htm">Jeremiah 44:12</a>. And I will take the remnant of Judah, that have set their faces to go to the land of Egypt in order to sojourn there, and they shall all be consumed; in the land of Egypt shall they fall, by sword and famine shall they be consumed; small and great, by sword and famine shall they die, and they shall become an execration and an astonishment, and a curse and a reproach. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-13.htm">Jeremiah 44:13</a>.

"Ye have seen all the evil," etc.; all the cities are laid waste and depopulated, because their inhabitants have roused the anger of the Lord, and have not let themselves be dissuaded by the admonitions of the prophets whom God has sent.
