The picture was true of part, but not of the whole, of the region of the wanderings. But the people had forgotten this. There was no seeking for the Lord who had then been so gracious.

Those who desert religion, commonly oppose it more than those who never knew it. For this they could have no excuse. God's spiritual Israel must own their obligations to him for safe conduct through the wilderness of this world, so dangerous to the soul.

The prophet brings their thanklessness into bolder relief by depicting in the strongest colours the care lavished upon them of old.

The remainder of the description, however, shows that "wilderness" is here meant, as often (e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/35-1.htm">Isaiah 35:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/50-2.htm">Isaiah 50:2</a>), in the sense of "desert." Though recent travelers have shown that the Sinaitie peninsula is not by any means universally a "desert," and that in ancient times it was still less so, it is not unnatural that an agricultural people should regard it as a most inhospitable region, and should even idealize its terrors (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-15.htm">Deuteronomy 8:15</a>). "Pits," i.e. rents and fissures in the soil, in which the unwary traveler might lose his life (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-20.htm">Jeremiah 18:20, 22</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The interpretation of the symbols is followed by a charge to Jeremiah to address himself stoutly to his duties, and to discharge them fearlessly, together with still further and fuller assurance of powerful divine assistance.<p>"But thou, gird up thy loins, and arise, and speak to them all that I command thee: be not dismayed before them, lest I dismay thee before them. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-18.htm">Jeremiah 1:18</a>. And I, behold I make thee this day a strong city, an iron pillar, a brazen wall against the whole land, the kings of Judah its princes, its priests, and the people of the land. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-19.htm">Jeremiah 1:19</a>. They shall strive against thee, but not prevail against thee; for I am with thee, saith Jahveh, to save thee." To gird up the loins, i.e., to fasten or tuck up with the girdle the long wide garment, in order to make oneself fit and ready for labour, for a journey, or a race (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-11.htm">Exodus 12:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-46.htm">1 Kings 18:46</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-29.htm">2 Kings 4:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-1.htm">2 Kings 9:1</a>), or for battle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-3.htm">Job 38:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/40-7.htm">Job 40:7</a>). Meaning: equip thyself and arise to preach my words to the inhabitants of the land. In '&#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;  and ' &#1488;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1498; &#1500;there is a play on words. The Niph. sig. broken in spirit by terror and anxiety; the Hiph. to throw into terror and anguish. If Jeremiah appears before his adversaries in terror, then he will have cause to be terrified for them; only if by unshaken confidence in the power of the word he preaches in the name of the Lord, will he be able to accomplish anything. Such confidence he has reason to cherish, for God will furnish him with the strength necessary for making a stand, will make him strong and not to be vanquished. This is the meaning of the pictorial statement in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-18.htm">Jeremiah 1:18</a>. A strong city resists the assaults of the foes; the storm cannot shatter an iron pillar; and walls of brass defy the enemy's missiles. Instead of the plural &#1495;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;, the parallel passage <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-20.htm">Jeremiah 15:20</a> has the sing. &#1495;&#1493;&#1502;&#1514;, the plural being used as frequently as the singular to indicate the wall encircling the city; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-10.htm">2 Kings 25:10</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-1.htm">1 Kings 3:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-13.htm">Nehemiah 2:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-1.htm">Nehemiah 4:1</a> with <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/1-3.htm">Nehemiah 1:3</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-17.htm">Nehemiah 2:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-10.htm">Nehemiah 4:10</a>. With such invincible power will God equip His prophet "against the whole land," i.e., so that he will be able to hold his own against the whole land. The mention of the component parts of "all the land," i.e., the several classes of the population, is introduced by &#1500;&#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1497;, so that "the kings," etc., is to be taken as an apposition to "against all the land." Kings in the plural are mentioned, because the prophet's labours are to extend over several reigns. &#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; are the chiefs of the people, the heads of families and clans, and officers, civil and military. "The people of the land" is the rest of the population not included in these three classes, elsewhere called men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-25.htm">Jeremiah 17:25</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-32.htm">Jeremiah 32:32</a>, and frequently. &#1488;&#1500;&#1497;&#1498; for &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1498;; so in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-20.htm">Jeremiah 15:20</a>, and often.
