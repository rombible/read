The world is, to those who make it their home and their portion, a wilderness and a land of darkness; but those who dwell in God, have the lines fallen to them in pleasant places. Here is the language of presumptuous sinners. The Jews had long thrown off serious thoughts of God. How many days of our lives pass without suitable remembrance of him! The Lord was displeased with their confidences, and would not prosper them therein. Men employ all their ingenuity, but cannot find happiness in the way of sin, or excuse for it. They may shift from one sin to another, but none ever hardened himself against God, or turned from him, and prospered.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Your own sword hath detoured your prophets - An allusion probably to Manasseh <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-16.htm">2 Kings 21:16</a>.

Or, "for vanity" (g); for vain speaking, for making vain oaths and vows; so it is explained in the Talmud (h); but the sense is, that the rod of chastisement was used in vain; the afflictions that came upon them had no effect on them to amend and reform them; they were never the better for them: <p>they received no correction; or instruction by them; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-3.htm">Jeremiah 5:3</a>, <p>your own sword hath devoured your prophets; as Isaiah, Zechariah, and Uriah, who were sent to them to reprove and correct them, but they were so far from receiving their correction, that they put them to death; though Kimchi mentions it as the sense of his father, and which he approves of, that this is to be understood, not of the true prophets of the Lord, but of false prophets; wherefore it is said, "your prophets"; and they had no prophets but false prophets, whose prophecy was the cause of the destruction of souls, and this brought ruin upon the prophets themselves; and this sense of the words Jerom gives into; it follows: <p>like a destroying lion; that is, the sword of the Lord, according to the latter sense; the judgments of God, by which the people fall, and their false prophets with them, were like a lion that destroys and devours all that come near it. The Septuagint and Arabic versions add, <p>and ye were not afraid; which confirms what was before said, that chastisement and correction were in vain. <p>(g) "propter vanitatem, sive vaniloquentiam", Vatablus.

But the passage may well point to the comparatively recent massacres by Manasseh, traditionally including Isaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-16.htm" title="For thus has the LORD said to me, Within a year, according to the years of an hireling, and all the glory of Kedar shall fail:">Isaiah 21:16</a>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Have I smitten your children</span>. The cities and towns of Judah are represented as so many mothers, and the populations as their children. It would, no doubt, be more natural to take "children" literally; but then we must read the verb in the next clause, "Ye have received," as the Septuagint actually renders. In the former case the "smiting" will refer to all God's "sore judgments" -sword, drought, famine, pestilence; in the latter, to the loss of life in battle. <span class="cmt_word">Your own sword hath devoured your prophets</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-21.htm">2 Chronicles 24:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-16.htm">2 Kings 21:16</a>). Manasseh's persecution (which extended, according to Josephus, especially to the prophets) may  account for the preponderance of "false prophets" referred to in ver. 8 (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-29.htm">Matthew 23:29</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-24.htm">Jeremiah 2:24</a> &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;&#1468; is variously interpreted. Thus much is beyond all doubt, that the words are still a part of the figure, i.e., of the comparison between the idolatrous people and the wild ass. The use of the 3rd person stands in the way of the direct reference of the words to Israel, since in what precedes and in what follows Israel is addressed (in 2nd pers.). &#1495;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473; can thus mean neither the new moon as a feast (L. de Dieu, Chr. B. Mich.), still less tempus menstruum (Jerome, etc.), but month; and the suffix in &#1492;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;&#1468; is to be referred, not with Hitz. to &#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1504;&#1514;&#1492;&#1468;, but to &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492;. The suffixes in &#1502;&#1489;&#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1492; and &#1497;&#1502;&#1510;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492; absolutely demand this. "Her month" is the month appointed for the gratification of the wild ass's natural impulse, i.e., as Bochart rightly explains it (Hieroz. ii. p. 230, ed. Ros.) mensis quo solent sylvestres asinae maris appetitu fervere. The meaning of the comparison is this: the false gods do not need anxiously to court the favour of the people; in its unbridled desires it gives itself up to them; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-2.htm">Jeremiah 3:2</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/2-7.htm">Hosea 2:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-15.htm">Hosea 2:15</a>. With this is suitably coupled the warning of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-25.htm">Jeremiah 2:25</a> : hold back, i.e., keep thy foot from getting bare (&#1497;&#1492;&#1507; is subst. not adjective, which would have had to be fem., since &#1512;&#1490;&#1500; is fem.), and thy throat from thirst, viz., by reason of the fever of running after the idols. This admonition God addresses by the prophet to the people. It is not to wear the sandals off its feet by running after amours, nor so to heat its throat as to become thirsty. Hitz. proposes unsuitably, because in the face of the context, to connect the going barefoot with the visiting of the sanctuary, and the thirsting of the throat (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-26.htm">1 Kings 18:26</a>) with incessant calling on the gods. The answer of the people to this admonition shows clearly that it has been receiving an advice against running after the gods. The Chet. &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;&#1512;&#1504;&#1498; is evidently a copyists's error for &#1493;&#1468;&#1490;&#1512;&#1493;&#1504;&#1498;. The people replies: &#1504;&#1493;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;, desperatum (est), i.e., hopeless; thy advice of all in vain; cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-12.htm">Jeremiah 18:12</a>, and on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-10.htm">Isaiah 57:10</a>. The meaning is made clearer by &#1500;&#1493;&#1488;: no; for I love the aliens, etc. &#1494;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; are not merely strange gods, but also strange peoples. Although idolatry is the matter chiefly in hand, yet it was so bound up with intriguing for the favour of the heathen nations that we cannot exclude from the words some reference to this also. </body></html>
