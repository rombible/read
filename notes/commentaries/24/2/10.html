He pleads with us, what we should plead with ourselves. Be afraid to think of the wrath and curse which will be the portion of those who throw themselves out of God's grace and favour. Grace in Christ is compared to water from a fountain, it being cooling and refreshing, cleansing and making fruitful: to living water, because it quickens dead sinners, revives drooping saints, supports and maintains spiritual life, and issues in eternal life, and is ever-flowing. To forsake this Fountain is the first evil; this is done when the people of God neglect his word and ordinances. They hewed them out broken cisterns, that could hold no water. Such are the world, and the things in it; such are the inventions of men when followed and depended on. Let us, with purpose of heart, cleave to the Lord only; whither else shall we go?

They were a pastoral tribe (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-11.htm" title="Let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up their voice, the villages that Kedar does inhabit: let the inhabitants of the rock sing, let them shout from the top of the mountains.">Isaiah 42:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-7.htm" title="All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered together to you, the rams of Nebaioth shall minister to you: they shall come up with acceptance on my altar, and I will glorify the house of my glory.">Isaiah 60:7</a>) and were bowmen (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-17.htm" title="And the residue of the number of archers, the mighty men of the children of Kedar, shall be diminished: for the LORD God of Israel has spoken it.">Isaiah 21:17</a>) living on the north-west of Arabia, and extending to the borders of Palestine.

Thus saith Jahveh, What have your fathers found in me of wrongfulness, that they are gone far from me, and have gone after vanity, and are become vain? <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-6.htm">Jeremiah 2:6</a>. And they said not, Where is Jahveh that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, that led us in the wilderness, in the land of steppes and of pits, in the land of drought and of the shadow of death, in a land that no one passes through and where no man dwells? <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-7.htm">Jeremiah 2:7</a>.

The rebuke for ungrateful, faithless apostasy is directed against the whole people. The "house of Jacob" is the people of the twelve tribes, and the parallel member, "all families of the house of Israel," is an elucidative apposition. The "fathers" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-5.htm">Jeremiah 2:5</a> are the ancestors of the now living race onwards from the days of the Judges, when the generation arising after the death of Joshua and his contemporaries forsook the Lord and served the Baals (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-10.htm">Judges 2:10</a>.). &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;, perversity, wrongfulness, used also of a single wicked deed in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/7-4.htm">Psalm 7:4</a>, the opposite to acting in truth and good faith.

The question, what have they found...? is answered in the negative by <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-6.htm">Jeremiah 2:6</a>. To remove far from me and follow after vanity, is tantamount to forsaking Jahveh and serving the false gods (Baals), <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-11.htm">Judges 2:11</a>. &#1492;&#1489;&#1500;, lit., breath, thence emptiness, vanity, is applied so early as the song of Moses, <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-21.htm">Deuteronomy 32:21</a>, to the false gods, as being nonentities. Here, however, the word means not the gods, but the worship of them, as being groundless and vain; bringing no return to him who devotes himself to it, but making him foolish and useless in thought and deed.
