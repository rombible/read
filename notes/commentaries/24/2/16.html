The LXX. translators, following, we must believe, an Egyptian tradition, identify the Hebrew Noph with Memphis in northern Egypt; later critics, with Napata in the south. Its conjunction with Tahapanes, the Daphnæ of the Greeks, which was on the Pelusiac mouth of the Nile, and on the frontier, seems in favour of the former view.<p><span class= "bld">Have broken.</span>—More accurately, <span class= "ital">shall feed on, lay waste, depasture, </span>so as to produce baldness.

Noph &#8230; Tahapanes&#8212;Memphis, capital of Lower Egypt, on the west bank of the Nile, near the pyramids of Gizeh, opposite the site of modern Cairo. Daphne, on the Tanitic branch of the Nile, near Pelusium, on the frontier of Egypt towards Palestine. Isa 30:4 contracts it, Hanes. These two cities, one the capital, the other that with which the Jews came most in contact, stand for the whole of Egypt. Tahapanes takes its name from a goddess, Tphnet [Champollion]. Memphis is from Man-nofri, "the abode of good men"; written in Hebrew, Moph (Ho 9:6), or Noph. The reference is to the coming invasion of Judah by Pharaoh-necho of Egypt, on his return from the Euphrates, when he deposed Jehoahaz and levied a heavy tribute on the land (2Ki 23:33-35). Josiah's death in battle with the same Pharaoh is probably included (2Ki 23:29, 30).<p>have broken&#8212;rather, shall feed down the crown, &c., that is, affect with the greatest ignominy, such as baldness was regarded in the East (Jer 48:37; 2Ki 2:23). Instead of "also," translate, "even" the Egyptians, in whom thou dost trust, shall miserably disappoint thy expectation [Maurer]. Jehoiakim was twice leagued with them (2Ki 23:34, 35): when he received the crown from them, and when he revolted from Nebuchadnezzar (2Ki 24:1, 2, 7). The Chaldeans, having become masters of Asia, threatened Egypt. Judea, situated between the contending powers, was thus exposed to the inroads of the one or other of the hostile armies; and unfortunately, except in Josiah's reign, took side with Egypt, contrary to God's warnings.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Noph and Tahapanes; </span> two of the king of Egypt’s principal seats.

These were cities in Egypt. Noph is the same with Moph in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-6.htm">Hosea 9:6</a> and which we there rightly render Memphis; as Noph is here by the Targum, Septuagint, Vulgate Latin, Syriac, and Arabic versions; and was formerly, as Pliny (g) says, the palace of the kings of Egypt. It is the same that is now called Alcairo, or Grand Cairo. According to Herodotus (h), it was built by Menes, the first king of Egypt; and who also makes mention of a city of Egypt, called Momemphis (i). Tahapanes is the same with Hanes in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-4.htm">Isaiah 30:4</a>, and here, in the Arabic version, is called Daphnes; and is thought by some to be the same with Daphnae Pelusiae, a city in Egypt. This Tahapanes was the metropolis of Egypt, and the seat of their kings; mention is made of Pharaoh's house in it, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/43-9.htm">Jeremiah 43:9</a>, now the inhabitants of these, called the children of them, and who are put for the people of Egypt in general, were the allies of the Jews, and in whom they trusted for help, when attacked by their enemies, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-2.htm">Isaiah 30:2</a> and yet <p>even these have broken the crown of thy head; which is interpreted, by the Targum, of slaying their mighty men, and spoiling their goods; perhaps it had its accomplishment when Pharaohnecho king of Egypt came out against the king of Assyria, and Josiah king of Judah went out to meet him, and was slain by him at Megiddo; and his son Jehoahaz he put in bonds, and carried him to Egypt, and put his brother upon the throne, and took tribute of gold and silver of him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-29.htm">2 Kings 23:29</a>. <p>(g) Nat.

It bears an important part in the history contained in the later chapters of Jeremiah. Johanan and the other captains went there in spite of the prophet’s directions (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/43-7.htm" title="So they came into the land of Egypt: for they obeyed not the voice of the LORD: thus came they even to Tahpanhes.">Jeremiah 43:7</a>). It was on the eastern branch of the Nile, and commanded the road to Palestine, thus being a frontier post of great importance. The towns of Noph and Tahpanhes would both be well known to the Jews even in Josiah’s day, the former as a capital city, the latter from its position. The two places occur again in conjunction in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-1.htm" title="The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews which dwell in the land of Egypt, which dwell at Migdol, and at Tahpanhes, and at Noph, and in the country of Pathros, saying,">Jeremiah 44:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-14.htm" title="Declare you in Egypt, and publish in Migdol, and publish in Noph and in Tahpanhes: say you, Stand fast, and prepare you; for the sword shall devour round about you.">Jeremiah 46:14</a>. The pyramids and extensive necropolis still draw multitudes of visitors to Memphis. The site of Tahpanhes has been excavated by Dr Flinders Petrie with interesting results relating to Ptolemaic and Roman times. See HDB. <span class="ital">s.v</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">have broken</span>] mg. <span class="ital">fed on</span>. The latter rendering represents the sense of the Hebrew verb according to the vowel points assigned it by the Massoretes, but the figure is too strange a one to be easily accepted. That of the text, on the other hand, would require different vocalisation (<span class="ital">yĕro‘uk</span> for <span class="ital">yir‘uk</span>), but in this case too the figure is over strong for the circumstances; seeing what is meant is nothing more than some affliction coming from Egypt. At any rate it is best to render by a future rather than a present tense. There is however a third way of pointing the word which is far from improbable, though it also involves the transposing of two consonants, viz. <span class="ital">yĕ‘aruk</span>, “will <span class="ital">shave</span> the crown of your head.” It is true that we must assume the existence of the Hebrew verb in that sense, but the supposition is scarcely a precarious one, as the Hebrew for ‘razor’ is apparently derived from this root. In that case the <span class="ital">v</span>. may be paraphrased thus: the Assyrians <span class="ital">have</span> ravaged thee. The Egyptians, to whom some of you are looking for help, <span class="ital">will</span> presently <span class="ital">fleece</span> you (as they did, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-35.htm" title="And Jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharaoh; but he taxed the land to give the money according to the commandment of Pharaoh: he exacted the silver and the gold of the people of the land, of every one according to his taxation, to give it to Pharaohnechoh.">2 Kings 23:35</a>). A shaven head was the sign of disgrace or of mourning (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/47-5.htm" title="Baldness is come on Gaza; Ashkelon is cut off with the remnant of their valley: how long will you cut yourself?">Jeremiah 47:5</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-37.htm" title="For every head shall be bald, and every beard clipped: on all the hands shall be cuttings, and on the loins sackcloth.">Jeremiah 48:37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-17.htm" title="Therefore the LORD will smite with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion, and the LORD will discover their secret parts.">Isaiah 3:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-24.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, that instead of sweet smell there shall be stink; and instead of a girdle a rent; and instead of well set hair baldness; and instead of a stomacher a girding of sackcloth; and burning instead of beauty.">Isaiah 3:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/15-2.htm" title="He is gone up to Bajith, and to Dibon, the high places, to weep: Moab shall howl over Nebo, and over Medeba: on all their heads shall be baldness, and every beard cut off.">Isaiah 15:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-12.htm" title="And in that day did the Lord GOD of hosts call to weeping, and to mourning, and to baldness, and to girding with sackcloth:">Isaiah 22:12</a>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Also the children of Noph</span>, <span class="accented">etc</span>. This is the climax of the calamity. Noph, called Moph in the Hebrew text of <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-6.htm">Hosea 9:6</a>, is generally identified with Memphis (after the Septuagint), which was called in the inscriptions Mennufr, or "the good abode," but may possibly be Napata, the Nap of the inscriptions, the residency of the Ethiopian dynasty (De Rouge'). <span class="cmt_word">Tahapanes</span>. The Hebrew form is <span class="accented">Takhpanes</span> or <span class="accented">Tahhpanhhes</span>. This was a fortified frontier town on the Pelusiot arm of the Nile, called in Greek Daphnae (Herod., 2:20), or Taphnae (Septuagint here). <span class="cmt_word">Have broken,</span> etc.; rather, <span class="accented">shall break</span>, or (for the pointing in the Hebrew Bible requires this change) <span class="accented">shall feed off</span> (or <span class="accented">depasture</span>). From this verse onwards, Judah is personified as a woman, as appears from the suffixes in the Hebrew. Baldness was a great mark of disgrace (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-23.htm">2 Kings 2:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-45.htm">Jeremiah 48:45</a>). There is a striking parallel to this passage in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-18.htm">Isaiah 7:18-20</a>, where, in punishment of the negotiations of Ahaz with Assyria, the prophet threatens an invasion of Judah both by Assyria and by Egypt: and employs the very. same figure (see ver. 20). So here, the devastation threatened by Jeremiah is the punishment of the unhallowed coquetting with the Egyptian power of which the Jewish rulers had been recently guilty. The fact which corresponds to this prediction is the defeat of Josiah at Megiddo, and the consequent subjugation of Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-29.htm">2 Kings 23:29</a>). The abruptness with which ver. 16 follows upon ver. 15 suggests that some words have fallen out of the text. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Such backsliding from God is unexampled and appalling. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-9.htm">Jeremiah 2:9</a>. "Therefore will I further contend with you, ad with your children's children will I contend. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-10.htm">Jeremiah 2:10</a>. For go over to the islands of the Chittim, and see; and send to Kedar, and observe well, and see if such things have been; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-11.htm">Jeremiah 2:11</a>. whether a nation hath changed it gods, which indeed are no gods? but my people hath changed its glory for that which profits not. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-12.htm">Jeremiah 2:12</a>.

For double evil hath my people done; me have they forsaken, the fountain of living waters, to hew out for themselves cisterns, broken cisterns, the hold no water." <p>In the preceding verses the fathers were charged with the backsliding from the Lord; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-9.htm">Jeremiah 2:9</a> punishment is threatened against the now-living people of Israel, and on their children's children after them. For the people in its successive and even yet future generations constitutes a unity, and in this unity a moral personality. Since the sins of the fathers transmit themselves to the children and remoter descendants, sons and grandsons must pay the penalty of the fathers' guilt, that is, so long as they share the disposition of their ancestors. The conception of this moral unity is at the foundation of the threatening. That the present race persists in the fathers' backsliding from the Lord is clearly expressed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-17.htm">Jeremiah 2:17</a>. In "I will further chide or strive," is intimated implicite that God had chidden already up till now, or even earlier with the fathers. &#1512;&#1497;&#1489;, contend, when said of God, is actual striving or chastening with all kinds of punishment. This must God do as the righteous and holy one; for the sin of the people is an unheard of sin, seen in no other people. "The islands of the Chittim" are the isles and coast lands of the far west, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-6.htm">Ezekiel 27:6</a>; &#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; having originally been the name for Cyprus and the city of Cition, see in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-4.htm">Genesis 10:4</a>. In contrast with these distant western lands, Kedar is mentioned as representative of the races of the east. The Kedarenes lived as a pastoral people in the eastern part of the desert between Arabia Petraea and Babylonia; see in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-13.htm">Genesis 25:13</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-21.htm">Ezekiel 27:21</a>.

Ew. 324, c. The unheard of, that which has happened amongst no people, is put interrogatively for rhetorical effect. Has any heathen nation changed its gods, which indeed are not truly gods? No; no heathen nation has done this; but the people of Jahveh, Israel, has exchanged its glory, i.e., the God who made Himself known to it in His glory, for false gods that are of no profit. &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1491; is the glory in which the invisible God manifested His majesty in the world and amidst His people. Cf. the analogous title given to God, ,&#1504;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1503;  &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1488;&#1500; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-7.htm">Amos 8:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/5-5.htm">Hosea 5:5</a>. The exact antithesis to &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1491;&#1493; would be &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-24.htm">Jeremiah 3:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-13.htm">Jeremiah 11:13</a>; but Jeremiah chose  &#1500;&#1488;to represent the exchange as not advantageous. God showed His glory to the Israelites in the glorious deeds of His omnipotence and grace, like those mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-5.htm">Jeremiah 2:5</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-6.htm">Jeremiah 2:6</a>.

Before the sin of Israel is more fully set forth, the prophet calls on heaven to be appalled at it. The heavens are addressed as that part of the creation where the glory of God is most brightly reflected. The rhetorical aim is seen in the piling up of words. &#1495;&#1512;&#1489;, lit., to be parched up, to be deprived of the life-marrow. Israel has committed two crimes: a. It has forsaken Jahveh, the fountain of living water.  ,&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;living water, i.e., water that originates and nourishes life, is a significant figure for God, with whom is the fountain of life (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/36-10.htm">Psalm 36:10</a>), i.e., from whose Spirit all life comes. Fountain of living water (here and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-13.htm">Jeremiah 17:13</a>) is synonymous with well of life in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-11.htm">Proverbs 10:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-14.htm">Proverbs 13:14</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-27.htm">Proverbs 14:27</a>, Sir. 21:13. b. The other sin is this, that they hew or dig out wells, broken, rent, full of crevices, that hold no water. The delineation keeps to the same figure. The dead gods have no life and can dispense no life, just as wells with rents or fissures hold no water. The two sins, the forsaking of the living God and the seeking out of dead gods, cannot really be separated. Man, created by God and for God, cannot live without God. If he forsake the living God, he passes in spite of himself into the service of dead, unreal gods. Forsaking the living God is eo ipso exchanging Him for an imaginary god. The prophet sets the two moments of the apostasy from God side by side, so as to depict to the people with greater fulness of light the enormity of their crime. The fact in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-11.htm">Jeremiah 2:11</a> that no heathen nation changes its gods for others, has its foundation in this, that the gods of the heathen are the creations of men, and that the worship of them is moulded by the carnal-mindedness of sinful man; so that there is less inducement to change, the gods of the different nations being in nature alike. But the true God claims to be worshipped in spirit and in truth, and does not permit the nature and manner of His worship to depend on the fancies of His worshippers; He makes demands upon men that run counter to carnal nature, insisting upon the renunciation of sensual lusts and cravings and the crucifixion of the flesh, and against this corrupt carnal nature rebels. Upon this reason for the fact adduced, Jeremiah does not dwell, but lays stress on the fact itself. This he does with the view of bringing out the distinction, wide as heaven, between the true God and the false gods, to the shaming of the idolatrous people; and in order, at the same time, to scourge the folly of idolatry by giving prominence to the contrast between the glory of God and the nothingness of the idols. </body></html>
