Such a girdle, like the marriage ring with us, would be treasured by the bride all her life long. Even the outward memorial of her union with her husband would be dear to her.

The world is, to those who make it their home and their portion, a wilderness and a land of darkness; but those who dwell in God, have the lines fallen to them in pleasant places. Here is the language of presumptuous sinners. The Jews had long thrown off serious thoughts of God. How many days of our lives pass without suitable remembrance of him! The Lord was displeased with their confidences, and would not prosper them therein. Men employ all their ingenuity, but cannot find happiness in the way of sin, or excuse for it. They may shift from one sin to another, but none ever hardened himself against God, or turned from him, and prospered.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A bride treasures all her life the girdle, which first indicated that she was a married woman, just as brides now treasure the wedding ring; but Israel, Yahweh's bride <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-2.htm">Jeremiah 2:2</a>, cherishes no fond memorials of past affection. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>32.

But the word only occurs again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-20.htm">Isaiah 3:20</a>, and its precise signification is uncertain. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>And yet idolatry brings to the people only disgrace, giving no help in the time of need. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-26.htm">Jeremiah 2:26</a>. "As a thief is shamed when he is taken, so is the house of Israel put to shame; they, their kings, their princes, their priests, and their prophets. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-27.htm">Jeremiah 2:27</a>. Because they say to the wood, Thou art my father; and to the stone, Thou hast borne me: for they have turned to me the back and not the face; but in the time of their trouble they say, Arise, and help us. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-28.htm">Jeremiah 2:28</a>. Where then are thy gods that thou hast made thee? let them arise, if they can help thee in the time of thy trouble; for as many as are thy cities, so many are thy gods, Judah." The thought in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-26.htm">Jeremiah 2:26</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-27.htm">Jeremiah 2:27</a> is this, Israel reaps from its idolatry but shame, as the thief from stealing when he is caught in the act. The comparison in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-26.htm">Jeremiah 2:26</a> contains a universal truth of force at all times. The perf. &#1492;&#1493;&#1489;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468; is the timeless expression of certainty (Hitz.), and refers to the past as well as to the future. Just as already in past time, so also in the future, idolatry brings but shame and confusion by the frustration of the hopes placed in the false gods. The "house of Israel" is all Israel collectively, and not merely the kingdom of the ten tribes. To give the greater emphasis to the reproaches, the leading ranks are mentioned one by one. &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, not: who say, but because (since) they say to the wood, etc., i.e., because they hold images of wood and stone for the gods to whom they owe life and being; whereas Jahveh alone is their Creator or Father and Genitor, <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-6.htm">Deuteronomy 32:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-18.htm">Deuteronomy 32:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/64-7.htm">Isaiah 64:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/2-10.htm">Malachi 2:10</a>. &#1488;&#1489;&#1503; is fem., and thus is put for mother. The Keri &#1497;&#1500;&#1491;&#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; is suggested solely by the preceding &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, while the Chet. is correct, and is to be read &#1497;&#1500;&#1491;&#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;, inasmuch as each one severally speaks thus. - With "for they have turned" follows the reason of the statement that Israel will reap only shame from its idolatry. To the living God who has power to help them they turn their back; but when distress comes upon them they cry to Him for help (&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492;  &#1493;&#1492;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1506;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/3-8.htm">Psalm 3:8</a>). But then God will send the people to their gods (idols); then will it discover they will not help, for all so great as their number is. The last clause of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-28.htm">Jeremiah 2:28</a> runs literally: the number of thy cities are thy gods become, i.e., so great is the number of thy gods; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-13.htm">Jeremiah 11:13</a>. Judah is here directly addressed, so that the people of Judah may not take for granted that what has been said is of force for the ten tribes only. On the contrary, Judah will experience the same as Israel of the ten tribes did when disaster broke over it. </body></html>
