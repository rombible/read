They did not, indeed, think themselves to be created or made by these images, but thus they addressed the gods whom they thought to be present in the consecrated images. But as there was in fact no such deity residing in the image, but it was <span class="ital">a mere nothing, </span>a fiction of the idolaters, their worship in reality centred in, or went no higher than, the image itself. <span class="ital">For they have turned their back unto me </span>— A token of contempt and aversion; <span class="ital">and not their face </span>— Which they turn wholly toward their idols. <span class="ital">But in the time of their trouble </span>— A time which is approaching; <span class="ital">they will say, Arise, and save us </span>— As they did formerly; see the margin. When they prove, by experience, the vanity of their idols, and their own folly in relying on things that cannot help or save them, and in rejecting me, then they will apply to me for relief and aid. <span class="ital">But where are thy gods? </span>— Thy idols, the gods of thy own making? <span class="ital">Let them arise </span>— From the places where they are fixed; <span class="ital">if they can save thee in the time of thy trouble </span>— In thy great distress, when thou art in such need of help. <span class="ital">For according to the number of thy cities are thy gods </span>— For thou hast a sufficient number of them, every country and city having its peculiar deity, imitating the heathen, who, according to Varro, had above thirty thousand gods.

Men are often as much under the power of their unbridled desires and their sinful lusts, as the brute beasts. But the Lord here warns them not to weary themselves in pursuits which could only bring distress and misery. As we must not despair of the mercy of God, but believe that to be sufficient for the pardon of our sins, so neither must we despair of the grace of God, but believe that it is able to subdue our corruptions, though ever so strong.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>God the true husband exhorts Israel not to run barefoot, and with parched throat, like a shameless adulteress, after strangers.<p>There is no hope - i. e., It is in vain. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>26. is ashamed&#8212;is put to shame.<p>thief&#8212;(Joh 10:1).<p>Israel&#8212;that is, Judah (Jer 2:28).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Ashamed when he is found; </span> not ashamed of his sin of theft, but that he is found, that his shifts and blinds would serve him no longer, especially if he have had the reputation of an honest man. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The house of Israel; </span> or families, the twelve tribes; a metonymy of the subject. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Ashamed; </span> or, confounded, in the passive voice; viz. when they shall be taken by Nebuchadnezzar, then their idols, which they went a whoring after, shall be discovered, and so put them to shame: in the active voice, their inability to help them, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-28.htm" title="But where are your gods that you have made you? let them arise, if they can save you in the time of your trouble: for according to the number of your cities are your gods, O Judah.">Jeremiah 2:28</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-29.htm" title="For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which you have desired, and you shall be confounded for the gardens that you have chosen.">Isaiah 1:29</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-19.htm" title="The wind has bound her up in her wings, and they shall be ashamed because of their sacrifices.">Hosea 4:19</a></span>; and their shame will be the more, because they had the repute of being my people. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Their kings, their princes, and their priests, and their prophets; </span> rulers and teachers, such as should have given better examples, and better instruction. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>As the thief is ashamed when be is found,....

"For of old time thou hast broken thy yoke, torn off thy bands; and hast said: I will not serve; but upon every high hill, and under every green tree, thou stretchedst thyself as a harlot. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-21.htm">Jeremiah 2:21</a>. And I have planted thee a noble vine, all of genuine stock: and how hast thou changed thyself to me into the bastards of a strange vine? <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-22.htm">Jeremiah 2:22</a>.

Keep thy foot from going barefoot, and thy throat from thirst; but thou sayest, It is useless; no; for I have loved strangers, and after them I go." <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-20.htm">Jeremiah 2:20</a>. &#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501;, from eternity, i.e., from immemorial antiquity, has Israel broken the yoke of the divine law laid on it, and torn asunder the bands of decency and order which the commands of God, the ordinances of the Torah, put on, to nurture it to be a holy people of the Lord; torn them as an untamed bullock (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-18.htm">Jeremiah 31:18</a>) or a stubborn cow, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-16.htm">Hosea 4:16</a>. &#1502;&#1493;&#1505;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;, bands, are not the bands or cords of love with which God drew Israel, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/11-4.htm">Hosea 11:4</a> (Graf), but the commands of God whose part it was to keep life within the bounds of purity, and to hold the people back from running riot in idolatry. On this head see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-5.htm">Jeremiah 5:5</a>; and for the expression, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-3.htm">Psalm 2:3</a>. The Masoretes have taken &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1512;&#1514;&#1497; and &#1504;&#1514;&#1511;&#1514;&#1497; for the 1st person, pointing accordingly, and for &#1488;&#1506;&#1489;&#1493;&#1491;, as unsuitable to this, they have substituted &#1488;&#1506;&#1489;&#1493;&#1512;. Ewald has decided in favour of these readings; but he is thus compelled to tear the verse to pieces and to hold the text to be defective, since the words from &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1497; onwards are not in keeping with what precedes. Even if we translate: I offend transgress not, the thought does not adapt itself well to the preceding; I have of old time broken thy yoke, etc.; nor can we easily reconcile with it the grounding clause; for on every high hill,...thou layest a whoring, where Ew. is compelled to force on &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; the adversative sig. Most commentators, following the example of the lxx and Vulg., have taken the two verbs for 2nd person; and thus is maintained the simple and natural thought that Israel has broken the yoke laid on it by God, renounced allegiance to Him, and practised idolatry on every hand. The spelling ,&#1504;&#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; ,&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; i.e., the formation of the 2nd pers. perf. with y, is frequently found in Jer.; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-33.htm">Jeremiah 2:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-4.htm">Jeremiah 3:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-19.htm">Jeremiah 4:19</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-21.htm">Jeremiah 13:21</a>, etc. It is really the fuller original spelling tiy which has been preserved in Aramaic, though seldom found in Hebrew; in Jer. it must be accounted an Aramaism; cf. Ew. 190, c; Gesen. 44, 2, Rem. 4. With the last clause, on every high hill, etc., cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-13.htm">Hosea 4:13</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-13.htm">Ezekiel 6:13</a> with the comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-2.htm">Deuteronomy 12:2</a>.
