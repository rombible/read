The salt had lost its savour. The light had become darkness. The rebuke, we must remember, came from the lips of one who was himself a priest.<p><span class= "bld">The priests said not, Where is the Lord?</span>—The same failure to seek as that condemned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-6.htm" title="Neither said they, Where is the LORD that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, that led us through the wilderness, through a land of deserts and of pits, through a land of drought, and of the shadow of death, through a land that no man passed through, and where no man dwelled?">Jeremiah 2:6</a>. To them, too, all was a routine. Jehovah was absent from their thoughts even in the very act of worship.<p><span class= "bld">They that</span> <span class= "bld">handle the law.</span>—These, probably, were also of the priestly order, to whom this function was assigned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-10.htm" title="They shall teach Jacob your judgments, and Israel your law: they shall put incense before you, and whole burnt sacrifice on your altar.">Deuteronomy 33:10</a>. The order of non-priestly scribes, in the sense of interpreters of the law, does not appear till after the captivity. Their sin was that they “dealt with the law” as interpreters and judges, and forgot Jehovah who had given it.<p><span class= "bld">The pastors.</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">shepherds, </span>the English “pastors” having gained a too definitely religious connotation. The Hebrew word was general in its significance, but in its Old Testament use was applied chiefly to civil rulers, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-71.htm" title="From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.">Psalm 78:71</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-17.htm" title="And he said, I saw all Israel scattered on the hills, as sheep that have not a shepherd: and the LORD said, These have no master: let them return every man to his house in peace.">1Kings 22:17</a>. Even in Ezekiel 34, where the spiritual aspect of rule is most prominent, the contrast between the false shepherds and the one true shepherd of the house of David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-23.htm" title="How can you say, I am not polluted, I have not gone after Baalim? see your way in the valley, know what you have done: you are a swift dromedary traversing her ways;">Jeremiah 2:23</a>) shows that the kingly, not the priestly, office was in the prophet’s mind.<p><span class= "bld">The prophets prophesied by Baal.</span>—The precise form of the sin described was probably connected with the oracular power ascribed to Baal-zebub, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-2.htm" title="And Ahaziah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber that was in Samaria, and was sick: and he sent messengers, and said to them, Go, inquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron whether I shall recover of this disease.">2Kings 1:2</a>. The evil was of long standing. It was one of the sins of the people in Isaiah’s time that they were “soothsayers like the Philistines” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-6.htm" title="Therefore you have forsaken your people the house of Jacob, because they be replenished from the east, and are soothsayers like the Philistines, and they please themselves in the children of strangers.">Isaiah 2:6</a>). When Ahab first introduced the Phœnician worship, it was by the prophets rather than the priests of Baal that the new <span class= "ital">cultus </span>was propagated (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-19.htm" title="Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel to mount Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the groves four hundred, which eat at Jezebel's table.">1Kings 18:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-6.htm" title="Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said to them, Shall I go against Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for the LORD shall deliver it into the hand of the king.">1Kings 22:6</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Things that do not profit.</span>—The word had acquired an almost proverbial force as applied to idols (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-21.htm" title="And turn you not aside: for then should you go after vain things, which cannot profit nor deliver; for they are vain.">1Samuel 12:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-9.htm" title="They that make a graven image are all of them vanity; and their delectable things shall not profit; and they are their own witnesses; they see not, nor know; that they may be ashamed.">Isaiah 44:9</a>). So the phrase is repeated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-11.htm" title="Has a nation changed their gods, which are yet no gods? but my people have changed their glory for that which does not profit.">Jeremiah 2:11</a>.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:1-8 Those who begin well, but do not persevere, will justly be upbraided with their hopeful and promising beginnings. Those who desert religion, commonly oppose it more than those who never knew it. For this they could have no excuse. God's spiritual Israel must own their obligations to him for safe conduct through the wilderness of this world, so dangerous to the soul. Alas, that many, who once appeared devoted to the Lord, so live that their professions aggravate their crimes!

He remembered to the people Israel the love of its youth. &#1495;&#1505;&#1491;, ordinarily, condescending love, graciousness and favour; here, the self-devoting, nestling love of Israel to its God. The youth of Israel is the time of the sojourn in Egypt and of the exodus thence (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-17.htm">Hosea 2:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/11-1.htm">Hosea 11:1</a>); here the latter, as is shown by the following: lovingness of the courtship. The courtship comprises the time from the exodus out of Egypt till the concluding of the covenant at Sinai (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-8.htm">Exodus 19:8</a>). When the Lord redeemed Israel with a strong hand out of the power of Egypt, He chose it to be His spouse, whom He bare on eagles' wings and brought unto Himself, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-4.htm">Exodus 19:4</a>. The love of the bride to her Lord and Husband, Israel proved by its following Him as He went before in the wilderness, the land where it is not sown, i.e., followed Him gladly into the parched, barren wilderness. "Thy going after me" is decisive for the question so much debated by commentators, whether &#1495;&#1505;&#1491; and &#1488;&#1492;&#1489;&#1492; stand for the love of Israel to its God, or God's love to Israel. The latter view we find so early as Chrysostom, and still in Rosenm. and Graf; but it is entirely overthrown by the &#1500;&#1499;&#1514;&#1468;&#1498;  &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;, which Chrysost. transforms into &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;, while Graf takes no notice of it. The reasons, too, which Graf, after the example of Rosenm. and Dathe, brings in support of this and against the only feasible exposition, are altogether valueless. The assertion that the facts forbid us to understand the words of the love of Israel to the Lord, because history represents the Israelites, when vixdum Aegypto egressos, as refractarios et ad aliorum deorum cultum pronos, cannot be supported by a reference to <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-6.htm">Deuteronomy 9:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-24.htm">Deuteronomy 9:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-8.htm">Isaiah 48:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-25.htm">Amos 5:25</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-7.htm">Psalm 106:7</a>. History knows of no apostasy of Israel from its God and no idolatry of the people during the time from the exodus out of Egypt till the arrival at Sinai, and of this time alone Jeremiah speaks. All the rebellions of Israel against its God fall within the time after the conclusion of the covenant at Sinai, and during the march from Sinai to Canaan. On the way from Egypt to Sinai the people murmured repeatedly, indeed, against Moses; at the Red Sea, when Pharaoh was pursuing with chariots and horsemen (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-11.htm">Exodus 14:11</a>.); at Marah, where they were not able to drink the water for bitterness (15:24); in the wilderness of Sin, for lack of bread and meat (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-2.htm">Jeremiah 16:2</a>.); and at Massah, for want of water (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-2.htm">Jeremiah 17:2</a>.). But in all these cases the murmuring was no apostasy from the Lord, no rebellion against God, but an outburst of timorousness and want of proper trust in God, as is abundantly clear from the fact that in all these cases of distress and trouble God straightway brings help, with the view of strengthening the confidence of the timorous people in the omnipotence of His helping grace. Their backsliding from the Lord into heathenism begins with the worship of the golden calf, after the covenant had been entered into at Sinai (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/32.htm">Exodus 32</a>), and is continued in the revolts on the way from Sinai to the borders of Canaan, at Taberah, at Kibroth-hattaavah (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/11.htm">Numbers 11</a>), in the desert of Paran at Kadesh (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/13.htm">Numbers 13</a>; 20); and each time it was severely punished by the Lord.<p>Neither are we to conclude, with J. D. Mich., that God interprets the journey through the desert in meliorem partem, and makes no mention of their offences and revolts; nor with Graf, that Jeremiah looks steadily away from all that history tells of the march of the Israelites through the desert, of their discontent and refractoriness, of the golden calf and of Baal Peor, and, idealizing the past as contrasted with the much darker present, keeps in view only the brighter side of the old times. Idealizing of this sort is found neither elsewhere in Jeremiah nor in any other prophet; nor is there anything of the kind in our verse, if we take up rightly the sense of it and the thread of the thought. It becomes necessary so to view it, only if we hold the whole forty years' sojourn of the Israelites in the wilderness to be the espousal time, and make the marriage union begin not with the covenanting at Sinai, but with the entrance of Israel into Canaan. Yet more entirely without foundation is the other assertion, that the words rightly given as the sense is, "stand in no connection with the following, since then the point in hand is the people's forgetfulness of the divine benefits, its thanklessness and apostasy, not at all the deliverances wrought by Jahveh in consideration of its former devotedness." For in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-2.htm">Jeremiah 2:2</a> it is plainly enough told how God remembered to the people its love. Israel was so shielded by Him, as His sanctuary, that whoever touched it must pay the penalty. &#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473; are all gifts consecrated to Jahveh. The Lord has made Israel a holy offering consecrated to Him in this, that He has separated it to Himself for a &#1505;&#1490;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;, for a precious possession, and has chosen it to be a holy people: <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5</a>.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-2.htm">Deuteronomy 14:2</a>. We can explain from the Torah of offering the further designation of Israel: his first-fruits; the first of the produce of the soil or yield of the land belonged, as &#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;, to the Lord: <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-19.htm">Exodus 23:19</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/8-8.htm">Numbers 8:8</a>, etc. Israel, as the chosen people of God, as such a consecrated firstling. Inasmuch as Jahveh is Creator and Lord of the whole world, all the peoples are His possession, the harvest of His creation. But amongst the peoples of the earth He has chosen Israel to Himself for a firstling-people (,&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514;  &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-1.htm">Amos 6:1</a>), and so pronounced it His sanctuary, not to be profaned by touch. Just as each laic who ate of a firstling consecrated to God incurred guilt, so all who meddled with Israel brought guilt upon their heads. The choice of the verb &#1488;&#1499;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; is also to be explained from the figure of firstling-offerings. The eating of firstling-fruit is appropriation of it to one's own use. Accordingly, by the eating of the holy people of Jahveh, not merely the killing and destroying of it is to be understood, but all laying of violent hands on it, to make it a prey, and so all injury or oppression of Israel by the heathen nations. The practical meaning of &#1497;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468; is given by the next clause: mischief came upon them. The verbs &#1497;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468; and &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1488; dna &#1497;&#1488; are not futures; for we have here to do not with the future, but with what did take place so long as Israel showed the love of the espousal time to Jahveh. Hence rightly Hitz.: "he that would devour it must pay the penalty." An historical proof of this is furnished by the attack of the Amalekites on Israel and its result, <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/17-8.htm">Exodus 17:8-15</a>. </body></html>
