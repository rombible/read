Here he has Hosea as giving a prototype (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-5.htm" title="For their mother has played the harlot: she that conceived them has done shamefully: for she said, I will go after my lovers, that give me my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, my oil and my drink.">Hosea 2:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-7.htm" title="And she shall follow after her lovers, but she shall not overtake them; and she shall seek them, but shall not find them: then shall she say, I will go and return to my first husband; for then was it better with me than now.">Hosea 2:7</a>), perhaps also Isaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/23-15.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in that day, that Tyre shall be forgotten seventy years, according to the days of one king: after the end of seventy years shall Tyre sing as an harlot.">Isaiah 23:15-16</a>). The picture may probably enough have been drawn from the life, but that sketched in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/proverbs/7-10.htm" title="And, behold, there met him a woman with the attire of an harlot, and subtle of heart.">Proverbs 7:10-23</a> may well have supplied the outline. Jehovah, as her true husband, bids the apostate wife to refrain for very shame from acting as the harlot, rushing barefoot into the streets, panting, as with a thirst that craves to be quenched, for the gratification of her desires. The “unshod” may possibly refer to one feature of the worship of Baal or Ashtaroth, men and women taking off their shoes when they entered into their temples, as being holy ground (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-5.htm" title="And he said, Draw not near here: put off your shoes from off your feet, for the place where on you stand is holy ground.">Exodus 3:5</a>), and joining in orgiastic dances.<p><span class= "bld">Thou saidst, There is no hope: no.</span>—Here also we find a parallel to the thought and language of Hosea. There the one effectual remedy for the evil into which the apostate wife had fallen was to speak to her heart, and to open the door of hope (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hosea/2-14.htm" title="Therefore, behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak comfortably to her.">Hosea 2:14-15</a>). Now the malignity of the evil is shown by the loss of all hope of recovery in returning to Jehovah:—<p>“Small sins the heart first desecrate,<p>At last despair persuades to great.”<p>Like Gomer, she will go after her “lovers,” though they are “strangers,” as if they were her only protectors. It would seem, from the recurrence of the phrase in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-12.htm" title="And they said, There is no hope: but we will walk after our own devices, and we will every one do the imagination of his evil heart.">Jeremiah 18:12</a>, as if it were the formula of a despairing fatalism, like the proverb of the fathers eating sour grapes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/31-29.htm" title="In those days they shall say no more, The fathers have eaten a sour grape, and the children's teeth are set on edge.">Jeremiah 31:29-30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-2.htm" title="What mean you, that you use this proverb concerning the land of Israel, saying, The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge?">Ezekiel 18:2</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/jeremiah/2.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-25.htm" title="Withhold your foot from being unshod, and your throat from thirst: but you said, There is no hope: no; for I have loved strangers, and after them will I go.">Jeremiah 2:25</a></span>. <span class="ital">Withhold thy foot from being unshod, </span>&c. — “Do not wear out thy shoes, or sandals, and expose thyself to thirst and weariness in undertaking long journeys, to make new alliances with idolaters.” Thus Lowth, and many other expositors. “But I rather take it,” says Blaney, “to be a warning to beware of the consequences of pursuing the courses they were addicted to: as if it had been said, Take care that thou dost not expose thyself, by thy wicked ways, to the wretched condition of going into captivity unshod, as the manner is represented <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/20-4.htm" title="So shall the king of Assyria lead away the Egyptians prisoners, and the Ethiopians captives, young and old, naked and barefoot, even with their buttocks uncovered, to the shame of Egypt.">Isaiah 20:4</a>; and of serving thine enemies in hunger, and in thirst, and in want of the necessaries of life,” <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-48.htm" title="Therefore shall you serve your enemies which the LORD shall send against you, in hunger, and in thirst, and in nakedness, and in want of all things: and he shall put a yoke of iron on your neck, until he have destroyed you.">Deuteronomy 28:48</a>. <span class="ital">But thou saidst, There is no hope </span>— The language of desperate sinners, who are resolved to continue in their wickedness, in spite of every reason that can be offered to the contrary. <span class="ital">No; for I have loved strangers </span>— Strange gods, idols; <span class="ital">and after them will I go </span>— The Jews probably did not really speak in this manner, but they acted thus: this, the prophet signifies was the language of their conduct.

That it may not be unshod, be naked and bare. The sense is, either, as some, do not take long journeys into foreign countries for help, as into Assyria and Egypt, whither they used to go barefoot; or wore out their shoes by their long journeys, and so returned without; or refrain from idolatry, as Jarchi interprets it, that thou mayest not go naked into captivity; or this is an euphemism, as others think, forbidding adulterous actions, showing the naked foot, the putting off of the shoes, in order to lie upon the bed, and prostitute herself to her lovers; and is to be understood of idolatry: <p>and thy throat from thirst; after wine, which excites lust; abstain from eager and burning lust after adulterous, that is, idolatrous practices; so the Targum, <p>"refrain thy feet from being joined with the people, and thy mouth from worshipping the idols of the people.'' <p>The words are paraphrased in the Talmud (e) thus, <p>"withhold thyself from sinning, that thy foot may not become naked; (the gloss is, "when thou goest into captivity") refrain thy tongue from idle words, that thy throat may not thirst:'' <p>this was said by the Lord, or by the prophets of the Lord sent unto them, to which the following is an answer: <p>but thou saidst, there is no hope; of ever being prevailed upon to relinquish those idolatrous practices, or of being received into the favour of God after such provocations: no; I will never refrain from them; I will not be persuaded to leave them: <p>for I have loved strangers; the strange gods of the nations: <p>and after them will I go; and worship them; so the Targum, <p>"I love to he joined to the people, and after the Worship of their idols will I go.'' <p>(e) T.

This thy forsaking of Jahveh makes or prepares for thee. &#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; is neuter; the infin. &#1506;&#1494;&#1489;&#1498; is the subject of the clause, and it is construed as a neuter, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-23.htm">1 Samuel 18:23</a>. The fact that thou hast forsaken Jahveh thy God has brought this evil on thee. At the time when He led thee on the way. The participle &#1502;&#1493;&#1500;&#1497;&#1498; is subordinated to &#1506;&#1514; in the stat. constr. as a partic. standing for the praeterit. durans; cf. Ew. 337, c. &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498; is understood by Ros. and Hitz. of the right way (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-8.htm">Psalm 25:8</a>); but in this they forget that this acceptation is incompatible with the &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1514;, which circumscribes the leading within a definite time. God will lead His people on the right way at all times. The way on which He led them at the particular time is the way through the Arabian desert, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-6.htm">Jeremiah 2:6</a>, and &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498; is to be understood as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-33.htm">Deuteronomy 1:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/18-8.htm">Exodus 18:8</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/23-20.htm">Exodus 23:20</a>, etc. Even thus early their fathers forsook the Lord: At Sinai, by the worship of the golden calf; then when the people rose against Moses and Aaron in the desert of Paran, called a rejecting (&#1504;&#1488;&#1509;) of Jahveh in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-11.htm">Numbers 14:11</a>; and at Shittim, where Israel joined himself to Baal Peor, <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/25-1.htm">Numbers 25:1-3</a>. The forsaking of Jahveh is not to be limited to direct idolatry, but comprehends also the seeking of help from the heathen; this is shown by the following 18th verse, in which the reproaches are extended to the present bearing of the people. ' &#1502;&#1492;&#1470;&#1500;&#1468;&#1498;  &#1500;&#1491;&#1512;&#1498;  &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;, lit., what is to thee in reference to the way of Egypt (for the expression, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/14-9.htm">Hosea 14:9</a>), i.e., what hast thou to do with the way of Egypt? Why dost thou arise to go into Egypt, to drink the water of the Nile? &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1493;&#1512;, the black, turbid stream, is a name for the Nile, taken from its dark-grey or black mud. The Nile is the life-giving artery of Egypt, on whose fertilizing waters the fruitfulness and the prosperity of the country depend. To drink the waters of the Nile is as much as to say to procure for oneself the sources of Egypt's life, to make the power of Egypt useful to oneself. Analogous to this is the drinking the waters of the river, i.e., the Euphrates. What is meant is seeking help from Egyptians and Assyrians. The water of the Nile and of the Euphrates was to be made to furnish them with that which the fountain of living water, i.e., Jahveh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-14.htm">Jeremiah 2:14</a>), supplied to them. This is an old sin, and with it Israel of the ten tribes is upbraided by Hosea (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/7-11.htm">Hosea 7:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/12-2.htm">Hosea 12:2</a>). From this we are not to infer "that here we have nothing to do with the present, since the existing Israel, Judah, was surely no longer a suitor for the assistance of Assyria, already grown powerless" (Hitz.). The limitation of the reproach solely to the past is irreconcilable with the terms of the verse and with the context (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-19.htm">Jeremiah 2:19</a>).  &#1502;&#1492;&#1470;&#1500;&#1468;&#1498; &#1500;&#1491;&#1512;&#1498;cannot grammatically be translated: What hadst thou to do with the way; just as little can we make &#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1505;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498; hath chastised thee, since the following: know and see, is then utterly unsuitable to it. &#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1505;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498; and &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1499;&#1497;&#1495;&#1498; are not futures, but imperfects, i.e., expressing what is wont to happen over again in each similar case; and so to be expressed in English by the present: thy wickedness, i.e., thy wicked work, chastises thee. The wickedness was shown in forsaking Jahveh, in the &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514;, backslidings, the repeated defection from the living God; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-22.htm">Jeremiah 3:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-6.htm">Jeremiah 5:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-7.htm">Jeremiah 14:7</a>. As to the fact, we have no historical evidence that under Josiah political alliance with Egypt or Assyria was compassed; but even if no formal negotiations took place, the country was certainly even then not without a party to build its hopes on one or other of the great powers between which Judah lay, whenever a conflict arose with either of them. -  &#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1506;&#1497;, with the Vav of consecution (see Ew. 347, a): Know then, and at last comprehend, that forsaking the Lord thy God is evil and bitter, i.e., bears evil and bitter fruit, prepares bitter misery for thee. "To have no fear of me" corresponds "to forsake," lit., thy forsaking, as second subject; lit.,: and the no fear of me in thee, i.e., the fact that thou hast no awe of me. &#1508;&#1468;&#1495;&#1491;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497;, awe of me, like &#1508;&#1468;&#1495;&#1491;&#1468;&#1498; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-25.htm">Deuteronomy 2:25</a>. </body></html>
