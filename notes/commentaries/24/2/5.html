The Niph. sig. broken in spirit by terror and anxiety; the Hiph. to throw into terror and anguish. If Jeremiah appears before his adversaries in terror, then he will have cause to be terrified for them; only if by unshaken confidence in the power of the word he preaches in the name of the Lord, will he be able to accomplish anything. Such confidence he has reason to cherish, for God will furnish him with the strength necessary for making a stand, will make him strong and not to be vanquished. This is the meaning of the pictorial statement in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-18.htm">Jeremiah 1:18</a>. A strong city resists the assaults of the foes; the storm cannot shatter an iron pillar; and walls of brass defy the enemy's missiles. Instead of the plural &#1495;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;, the parallel passage <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-20.htm">Jeremiah 15:20</a> has the sing. &#1495;&#1493;&#1502;&#1514;, the plural being used as frequently as the singular to indicate the wall encircling the city; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-10.htm">2 Kings 25:10</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-1.htm">1 Kings 3:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-13.htm">Nehemiah 2:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-1.htm">Nehemiah 4:1</a> with <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/1-3.htm">Nehemiah 1:3</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-17.htm">Nehemiah 2:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-10.htm">Nehemiah 4:10</a>. With such invincible power will God equip His prophet "against the whole land," i.e., so that he will be able to hold his own against the whole land. The mention of the component parts of "all the land," i.e., the several classes of the population, is introduced by &#1500;&#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1497;, so that "the kings," etc., is to be taken as an apposition to "against all the land." Kings in the plural are mentioned, because the prophet's labours are to extend over several reigns. &#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; are the chiefs of the people, the heads of families and clans, and officers, civil and military. "The people of the land" is the rest of the population not included in these three classes, elsewhere called men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-25.htm">Jeremiah 17:25</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-32.htm">Jeremiah 32:32</a>, and frequently. &#1488;&#1500;&#1497;&#1498; for &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1498;; so in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-20.htm">Jeremiah 15:20</a>, and often.
