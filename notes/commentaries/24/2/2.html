The “espousals” are thought of as coinciding with the great covenant of <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-8.htm" title="And Moses took the blood, and sprinkled it on the people, and said, Behold the blood of the covenant, which the LORD has made with you concerning all these words.">Exodus 24:8</a>, when the people solemnly entered into the relation to which God called them.

The covenant which God made with the Israelites, at mount Sinai, is commonly represented under the metaphor of a marriage contract.

God's spiritual Israel must own their obligations to him for safe conduct through the wilderness of this world, so dangerous to the soul. Alas, that many, who once appeared devoted to the Lord, so live that their professions aggravate their crimes!

Jeremiah contrasts the present unfriendly relations between Yahweh and His people with their past love. Israel, as often elsewhere, is represented as a young bride <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-8.htm">Ezekiel 16:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-20.htm">Hosea 2:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-8.htm">Joel 1:8</a>. The walking after God in the wilderness was an act of love on Israel's part. Israel did leave Egypt at Moses' bidding, and at Sinai was solemnly espoused to Yahweh. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. cry&#8212;proclaim.<p>Jerusalem&#8212;the headquarters and center of their idolatry; therefore addressed first.<p>thee&#8212;rather, "I remember in regard to thee" [Henderson]; "for thee" [Maurer].<p>kindness of thy youth&#8212;not so much Israel's kindness towards God, as the kindness which Israel experienced from God in their early history (compare Eze 16:8, 22, 60; 23:3, 8, 19; Ho 2:15). For Israel from the first showed perversity rather than kindness towards God (compare Ex 14:11, 12; 15:24; 32:1-7, &c.). The greater were God's favors to them from the first, the fouler was their ingratitude in forsaking Him (Jer 2:3, 5, &c.).<p>espousals&#8212;the intervals between Israel's betrothal to God at the exodus from Egypt, and the formal execution of the marriage contract at Sinai. Ewald takes the "kindness" and "love" to be Israel's towards God at first (Ex 19:8; 24:3; 35:20-29; 36:5; Jos 24:16-17). But compare De 32:16, 17; Eze 16:5, 6, 15, 22 ("days of thy youth") implies that the love here meant was on God's side, not Israel's.<p>thou wentest after me in &#8230; wilderness&#8212;the next act of God's love, His leading them in the desert without needing any strange god, such as they since worshipped, to help Him (De 2:7; 32:12). Jer 2:6 shows it is God's "leading" of them, not their following after God in the wilderness, which is implied.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Go, viz. from Anathoth to Jerusalem. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Cry in the ears; </span> proclaim it so that they may hear it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Of Jerusalem; </span> declare God’s will to the inhabitants thereof; a metonymy of the subject. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Thus saith the Lord; </span> the prophet’s usual form of words in this book, whereby he frequently intimates that he came with God’s message, not his own; and therefore directs his sermon here, as in God’s name and person, to the whole body of the people. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I remember thee; </span> I record, or I mind thee of the kindness that was between us: though this be sometimes taken in a way of favour, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-31.htm" title="And for the wood offering, at times appointed, and for the first fruits.

Of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the metropolis of Judea. The prophet seems now to have been at Anathoth, and therefore is bid to go from thence to Jerusalem, and there prophesy before the people in it, as the Targum paraphrases it: <p>saying, thus saith the Lord, I remember thee; the Lord never forgets his people, though they sometimes think he does; it cannot be for they are engraven on the palms of his hands, yea, are set as a seal on his heart; nor does he forget his covenant with them, nor favours and blessings promised them: or, "I remember for thee"; or, "to thee" (w): things in thy favour, and which will be to thy advantage: <p>the kindness of thy youth; either the lovingkindness of the Lord, which he had shown unto them; and the benefits, as the fruits thereof, which he had bestowed upon them in former times, when they were brought out of Egypt, and into the wilderness, which was the infancy both of their civil and church state; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/11-1.htm">Hosea 11:1</a> and when they received many favours from the Lord, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-2.htm">Jeremiah 31:2</a> or the kindness of the people of Israel to the Lord, which was influenced and drawn forth by his love to them; though this can only be understood of some few of them, since the greater part tempted him, grieved, and provoked him: <p>the love of thine espousals; for the covenant God made with that people, when he brought them out of Egypt, was in the form of a marriage contract; he became their husband, and they became his spouse and bride; and which is an aggravation of their violation of it, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-32.htm">Jeremiah 31:32</a> and this love, as before, may be understood either of the love of God to them, or of their love to him. The Targum interprets the former clause of the divine goodness to them, and this of their love to him, paraphrasing the whole thus, <p>"I remember unto you the blessings of ancient days, and the love of your fathers, who believed in my word:'' <p>when thou wentest after me; the Lord going before them in a pillar of cloud by day, and in a pillar of fire by night; even the angel of God's presence, who was their leader, guide, and preserver: <p>in the wilderness, in a land that was not sown; where they passed through many difficulties, and lived upon the providence of God, which, in a wonderful manner, supported them with the necessaries of life, which otherwise they could not have had. The Targum is, <p>"and they walked after my two messengers, after Moses and Aaron, in the wilderness forty years without food, in a land that was not sown.'' <p>The whole of this may be applied to the case of God's people at first conversion, when they are as newly born babes, and become young men in Christ; at which time they are openly espoused to him, having been secretly betrothed in covenant before; but now, through the efficacy of the Spirit attending the word, they are made willing to give up themselves to the Lord, and are espoused to one husband, Christ, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-2.htm">2 Corinthians 11:2</a> at which time also great kindness and love is expressed both by the Lord to them, by quickening them who before were dead; by bringing them out of a most miserable condition; by speaking comfortably to them; by manifesting and applying his pardoning grace; and by openly taking them into his family: and also by them to him again; for the grace of love is then implanted, which, as it is hearty and sincere, is very ardent and fervent; which shows itself by parting with and bearing all for Christ; and by a concern for his company and presence; and by a regard to his people, Gospel, ways, and worship; particularly by following him in his ordinances with great zeal, fervency, and constancy, even though attended with many difficulties and discouragements; and though the way may seem to flesh and blood very unpleasant and unpromising; all which is remembered by the Lord when forgotten by them; and when their love is become cold to him, he not only remembers them, and his love to them, which is always the same, but also their love to him. <p>(w)  "recordor tibi", Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator; so Schmidt, and some in Vatablus; which is preferred by Gussetius, Ebr.

It is an open question whether the "kindness" spoken of is that of God towards the people, or of the people towards God. The usage of the Hebrew (<span class="accented">khesed</span>) admits of either acceptation; comp. for the first, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/5-7.htm">Psalm 5:7</a>, 36:5, and many other passages; for the second, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/6-4.htm">Hosea 6:4, 6</a> (in ver. 6 rendering for "mercy," "goodness") and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-1.htm">Isaiah 57:1</a> (rendering "men of piety"). But the context, which dwells so strongly on the oblivion into which the Divine benefits had been allowed to pass, is decidedly in favor of the first view. How beautiful is this condescending language! Jehovah's past feelings come Back to him; at least, so it appears to the believer, when God lets the light of his countenance shine forth again (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-20.htm">Jeremiah 31:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-10.htm">Hosea 9:10</a>). He even condescends to overlook the weakness and inconsistency of the Israel of antiquity. He idealizes it (i.e. Jeremiah is permitted to do so). This is in harmony with other prophetic passages (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-26.htm">Isaiah 1:26</a> ("as at the first"); <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/11-1.htm">Hosea 11:1, 3, 4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-6.htm">Ezekiel 16:6-14</a>).

"They will set each his throne." The representatives of the kingdoms are meant, the kings and generals.

"Before the gates of Jerusalem:" not merely in order to besiege the city and occupy the outlets from it (Jerome and others), but to lord it over the city and its inhabitants. If we take the figurative expression in this sense, the further statement fits well into it, and we have no need to take refuge in Hitzig's unnatural view that these clauses are not dependent on &#1504;&#1514;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;' but on &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;. For the words: they set up their dominion against the calls of Jerusalem, and against all cities of Judah, give the suitable sense, that they will use violence against the walls and cities. </body></html>
