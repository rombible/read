Their “blood” is on the “skirts” of her raiment; perhaps, if we take another reading, on the “palms” of her hands. The last clause is, however, obscure enough. We have to choose, according to variations of reading and construction, between (1) <span class= "ital">I have not found it as by secret search </span>(literally, <span class= "ital">by digging, </span>as men dig through the wall of a house in search of plunder), <span class= "ital">but under every oak </span>or <span class= "ital">terebinth, </span>or, more probably, as in the Authorised version, <span class= "ital">upon all these</span>—<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the sin was patent, flagrant, everywhere; and (2) <span class= "ital">Thou didst not find them </span>(those who had been put to death) <span class= "ital">in the place of breaking through</span>—<span class= "ital">i.e., in the act of the robber that would have deserved death </span>(<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-2.htm" title="If a thief be found breaking up, and be smitten that he die, there shall no blood be shed for him.">Exodus 22:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-16.htm" title="In the dark they dig through houses, which they had marked for themselves in the daytime: they know not the light.">Job 24:16</a>); <span class= "ital">but because of all this</span>—<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>thou didst slay them through thy passion for idolatry.

The world is, to those who make it their home and their portion, a wilderness and a land of darkness; but those who dwell in God, have the lines fallen to them in pleasant places. Here is the language of presumptuous sinners. The Jews had long thrown off serious thoughts of God. How many days of our lives pass without suitable remembrance of him! The Lord was displeased with their confidences, and would not prosper them therein. Men employ all their ingenuity, but cannot find happiness in the way of sin, or excuse for it.

Either of the innocent infants of poor persons, who were sacrificed to Moloch; or of the poor prophets of the Lord, whom they slew, because they faithfully reproved them for their sins; and the blood of those being found in their skirts is expressive of the publicness and notoriety of their sin, and also of the large quantity of blood shed, inasmuch as the skirts of their garments were filled with it, as if they had trod and walked in blood; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-3.htm">Isaiah 63:3</a>. <p>I have not found it by secret search; or, "by digging" (q); there was no need to dig for it; it lay above ground; it was upon their skirts, public enough: or, "in ditches", as the Septuagint and Vulgate Latin (r) versions; as when murders are privately and secretly committed; but these were done openly.

The persons whom Israel had thus treated were in no such position, but such was nevertheless their fate.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">but upon all these</span>] The words are obscure and probably the text of the whole verse is corrupt. As it stands, “these” must refer to the misdeeds indicated or to the (bloodstained) “skirts” incriminating the offenders. By a slight modification of the MT. we get the LXX rendering of “all these,” viz. <span class="ital">every oak</span>. This, however, can hardly be defended.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Also in thy skirts</span>, etc.; or, <span class="accented">there is even fennel in thy skirts</span> (or, perhaps, <span class="accented">in thy sleeves</span> - the wide sleeves of an Eastern mantle). The fact which follows is adduced as the crowning evidence of wickedness. <span class="cmt_word">Blood of the souls</span> is explained by the statement in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>, "The soul of the flesh [i.e. of the body] is in the blood;" hence the importance of the blood in the Mosaic sacrifices. The historical reference of this passage of Jeremiah may well be to the persecution of Manasseh, who is said to have "shed innocent blood very much" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-16.htm">2 Kings 21:16</a>). It is Judah, no doubt, who is addressed, but the prophets mostly assume the "solidarity" of king and people (analogous to that of a forefather and his posterity); Manasseh, moreover, probably had the support of a large section of the population, at any rate in so far as he favored the inveterate cultus of the high places or local sanctuaries. <span class="cmt_word">I have not found it by secret search</span>; rather, <span class="accented">thou hast not found them breaking through</span> (<span class="accented">houses</span>). The phraseology agrees with that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-2.htm">Exodus 22:2</a>, the law against "breaking through;" it suggests that the houses of all but the highest class in ancient as well as often in modern Palestine, were made of mere sun-dried brick, which could be easily "dug into" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-5.htm">Ezekiel 12:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19, 20</a>, in the Greek). [Lieut. Conder states, it is true, that in hilly districts of Palestine the houses of the villages are built of stone, but he adds that the stone is simply taken from the ruins of the ancient towns.] Burglars caught in the act might be killed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-2.htm">Exodus 22:2</a>), but the innocent victims of persecution could not be brought under this category, and hence those who slew them were really guilty of murder. <span class="cmt_word">But upon all these</span>; rather, <span class="accented">but because of all these things</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. not for any crime, but because of thine things," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-7.htm">Jeremiah 3:7</a>); so Hitzig, Keil Payne Smith; less naturally De Dieu, "because of those false gods" <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>And yet idolatry brings to the people only disgrace, giving no help in the time of need. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-26.htm">Jeremiah 2:26</a>. "As a thief is shamed when he is taken, so is the house of Israel put to shame; they, their kings, their princes, their priests, and their prophets. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-27.htm">Jeremiah 2:27</a>. Because they say to the wood, Thou art my father; and to the stone, Thou hast borne me: for they have turned to me the back and not the face; but in the time of their trouble they say, Arise, and help us. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-28.htm">Jeremiah 2:28</a>. Where then are thy gods that thou hast made thee? let them arise, if they can help thee in the time of thy trouble; for as many as are thy cities, so many are thy gods, Judah." The thought in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-26.htm">Jeremiah 2:26</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-27.htm">Jeremiah 2:27</a> is this, Israel reaps from its idolatry but shame, as the thief from stealing when he is caught in the act. The comparison in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-26.htm">Jeremiah 2:26</a> contains a universal truth of force at all times. The perf. &#1492;&#1493;&#1489;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468; is the timeless expression of certainty (Hitz.), and refers to the past as well as to the future. Just as already in past time, so also in the future, idolatry brings but shame and confusion by the frustration of the hopes placed in the false gods. The "house of Israel" is all Israel collectively, and not merely the kingdom of the ten tribes. To give the greater emphasis to the reproaches, the leading ranks are mentioned one by one. &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, not: who say, but because (since) they say to the wood, etc., i.e., because they hold images of wood and stone for the gods to whom they owe life and being; whereas Jahveh alone is their Creator or Father and Genitor, <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-6.htm">Deuteronomy 32:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-18.htm">Deuteronomy 32:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/64-7.htm">Isaiah 64:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/2-10.htm">Malachi 2:10</a>. &#1488;&#1489;&#1503; is fem., and thus is put for mother. The Keri &#1497;&#1500;&#1491;&#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; is suggested solely by the preceding &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, while the Chet. is correct, and is to be read &#1497;&#1500;&#1491;&#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;, inasmuch as each one severally speaks thus. - With "for they have turned" follows the reason of the statement that Israel will reap only shame from its idolatry. To the living God who has power to help them they turn their back; but when distress comes upon them they cry to Him for help (&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492;  &#1493;&#1492;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1506;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/3-8.htm">Psalm 3:8</a>). But then God will send the people to their gods (idols); then will it discover they will not help, for all so great as their number is. The last clause of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-28.htm">Jeremiah 2:28</a> runs literally: the number of thy cities are thy gods become, i.e., so great is the number of thy gods; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-13.htm">Jeremiah 11:13</a>. Judah is here directly addressed, so that the people of Judah may not take for granted that what has been said is of force for the ten tribes only. On the contrary, Judah will experience the same as Israel of the ten tribes did when disaster broke over it. </body></html>
