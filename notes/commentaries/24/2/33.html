Houbigant’s translation of this verse is, “Why dost thou strew thy way, that thou mayest find lovers; and teachest thy ways to thy companions?” The original word, rendered <span class="ital">trimmest, </span><span class="greekheb">תישׂבי</span>, properly means, <span class="ital">to make good, right, </span>or <span class="ital">agreeable. </span>Noldius expounds the clause, “Why dost thou justify thy ways, or insist upon thy innocence?” And the French interpret the verse, “Why wouldest thou justify thy conduct, to enter into favour with me? so long as thou hast taught to others the evil which thou hast done; and while (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-34.htm" title="Also in your skirts is found the blood of the souls of the poor innocents: I have not found it by secret search, but on all these.">Jeremiah 2:34</a>) in thy skirts,” &c. <span class="ital">Also in thy skirts is found the blood of the souls, </span>&c. — This would be better rendered, <span class="ital">Also in thy skirts is found the blood of poor and innocent persons, </span>for by <span class="ital">souls </span>is meant <span class="ital">persons; </span>and by the <span class="ital">blood being found </span>in <span class="ital">their skirts, </span>the prophet means their committing murders and oppressions, secretly, perhaps; but their guilt was as manifest as though the blood of the persons slain had been found sprinkled upon their garments. The LXX. render the clause <span class="greekheb">εν ταις χερσι σου ευρεθησαν αιματα ψυχων αθωων</span>, <span class="ital">in thy hands have been found the blood of innocent souls, or persons. </span>Their sacrificing of their little children to their idols, as well as their oppressing and murdering of adult persons, is intended to be comprised here. <span class="ital">I have not found it by secret search </span>— The LXX., with whom all the ancient versions agree, render the clause <span class="greekheb">ουκ εν διορυγμασιν ευρον αυτους</span>, <span class="ital">I have not found them in digged holes, </span>or <span class="ital">ditches, </span>but upon all these. The LXX. and Syriac render <span class="greekheb">על כל אלה</span>, here, <span class="ital">upon every oak. </span>“The meaning of which,” says Blaney, “is this: In the law it is commanded, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/17-13.htm" title="And whatever man there be of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among you, which hunts and catches any beast or fowl that may be eaten; he shall even pour out the blood thereof, and cover it with dust.">Leviticus 17:13</a>,) that the blood of animals killed in hunting should be covered with dust, in order, no doubt, to create a horror at the sight of blood. In allusion to this command, it is urged against Jerusalem, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-7.htm" title="For her blood is in the middle of her; she set it on the top of a rock; she poured it not on the ground, to cover it with dust;">Ezekiel 24:7</a>,) that she had not only shed blood in the midst of her, but that <span class="ital">she had set it upon the top of a rock, and poured it not upon the ground to cover it with dust; </span>that is, she had seemed to glory in the crime, by doing it in the most open and audacious manner, so as to challenge God’s vengeance. In like manner it is said here, that God had not discovered the blood that was shed in holes under ground, but that it was sprinkled upon every oak before which their inhuman sacrifices had been performed.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:29-37 The nation had not been wrought upon by the judgements of God, but sought to justify themselves. The world is, to those who make it their home and their portion, a wilderness and a land of darkness; but those who dwell in God, have the lines fallen to them in pleasant places. Here is the language of presumptuous sinners. The Jews had long thrown off serious thoughts of God. How many days of our lives pass without suitable remembrance of him! The Lord was displeased with their confidences, and would not prosper them therein. Men employ all their ingenuity, but cannot find happiness in the way of sin, or excuse for it.

The Cetib, or writing, is  "I have taught"; as if they were the words of God, saying, "wherefore I have taught"; or, "will teach"; that is, by punishing thee; <p>that thy ways are evil; or, as Kimchi explains it, <p>"I have taught thee by thy ways that they are evil, and evil shall come unto thee because of them.'' <p>The Keri, or reading, is  "thou hast taught"; which is confirmed by the Targum; and is followed by the Septuagint, Vulgate Latin, and other versions. It is by some rendered, "seeing thou hast taught others thy evil ways" (p); not content to sin themselves, but taught others to do so, and yet would be thought good. <p>(p) "Quandoquidem etiam (alios) malas docuisti vias tuas", Noldius, p. 507. vid.

"As a thief is shamed when he is taken, so is the house of Israel put to shame; they, their kings, their princes, their priests, and their prophets. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-27.htm">Jeremiah 2:27</a>. Because they say to the wood, Thou art my father; and to the stone, Thou hast borne me: for they have turned to me the back and not the face; but in the time of their trouble they say, Arise, and help us. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-28.htm">Jeremiah 2:28</a>. Where then are thy gods that thou hast made thee? let them arise, if they can help thee in the time of thy trouble; for as many as are thy cities, so many are thy gods, Judah." The thought in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-26.htm">Jeremiah 2:26</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-27.htm">Jeremiah 2:27</a> is this, Israel reaps from its idolatry but shame, as the thief from stealing when he is caught in the act. The comparison in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-26.htm">Jeremiah 2:26</a> contains a universal truth of force at all times. The perf. &#1492;&#1493;&#1489;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468; is the timeless expression of certainty (Hitz.), and refers to the past as well as to the future. Just as already in past time, so also in the future, idolatry brings but shame and confusion by the frustration of the hopes placed in the false gods. The "house of Israel" is all Israel collectively, and not merely the kingdom of the ten tribes. To give the greater emphasis to the reproaches, the leading ranks are mentioned one by one. &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, not: who say, but because (since) they say to the wood, etc., i.e., because they hold images of wood and stone for the gods to whom they owe life and being; whereas Jahveh alone is their Creator or Father and Genitor, <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-6.htm">Deuteronomy 32:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-18.htm">Deuteronomy 32:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/64-7.htm">Isaiah 64:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/2-10.htm">Malachi 2:10</a>. &#1488;&#1489;&#1503; is fem., and thus is put for mother. The Keri &#1497;&#1500;&#1491;&#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; is suggested solely by the preceding &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, while the Chet. is correct, and is to be read &#1497;&#1500;&#1491;&#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;, inasmuch as each one severally speaks thus. - With "for they have turned" follows the reason of the statement that Israel will reap only shame from its idolatry. To the living God who has power to help them they turn their back; but when distress comes upon them they cry to Him for help (&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492;  &#1493;&#1492;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1506;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/3-8.htm">Psalm 3:8</a>). But then God will send the people to their gods (idols); then will it discover they will not help, for all so great as their number is. The last clause of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-28.htm">Jeremiah 2:28</a> runs literally: the number of thy cities are thy gods become, i.e., so great is the number of thy gods; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-13.htm">Jeremiah 11:13</a>. Judah is here directly addressed, so that the people of Judah may not take for granted that what has been said is of force for the ten tribes only. On the contrary, Judah will experience the same as Israel of the ten tribes did when disaster broke over it. </body></html>
