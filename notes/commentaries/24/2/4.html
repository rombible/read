Those who desert religion, commonly oppose it more than those who never knew it. For this they could have no excuse. God's spiritual Israel must own their obligations to him for safe conduct through the wilderness of this world, so dangerous to the soul. Alas, that many, who once appeared devoted to the Lord, so live that their professions aggravate their crimes!

The Lord, by the prophet, having observed his great kindness to this people, what they were unto him, and what a regard he had for them, proceeds to upbraid them with their ingratitude, and requires an attention to what he was about to say; all are called upon, because, all were guilty. This respects the two tribes of Judah and Benjamin, and the several families in them.

And I, behold I make thee this day a strong city, an iron pillar, a brazen wall against the whole land, the kings of Judah its princes, its priests, and the people of the land. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-19.htm">Jeremiah 1:19</a>. They shall strive against thee, but not prevail against thee; for I am with thee, saith Jahveh, to save thee." To gird up the loins, i.e., to fasten or tuck up with the girdle the long wide garment, in order to make oneself fit and ready for labour, for a journey, or a race (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-11.htm">Exodus 12:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-46.htm">1 Kings 18:46</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-29.htm">2 Kings 4:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-1.htm">2 Kings 9:1</a>), or for battle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-3.htm">Job 38:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/40-7.htm">Job 40:7</a>). Meaning: equip thyself and arise to preach my words to the inhabitants of the land. In '&#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;  and ' &#1488;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1498; &#1500;there is a play on words. The Niph. sig. broken in spirit by terror and anxiety; the Hiph. to throw into terror and anguish. If Jeremiah appears before his adversaries in terror, then he will have cause to be terrified for them; only if by unshaken confidence in the power of the word he preaches in the name of the Lord, will he be able to accomplish anything. Such confidence he has reason to cherish, for God will furnish him with the strength necessary for making a stand, will make him strong and not to be vanquished. This is the meaning of the pictorial statement in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-18.htm">Jeremiah 1:18</a>. A strong city resists the assaults of the foes; the storm cannot shatter an iron pillar; and walls of brass defy the enemy's missiles. Instead of the plural &#1495;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;, the parallel passage <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-20.htm">Jeremiah 15:20</a> has the sing. &#1495;&#1493;&#1502;&#1514;, the plural being used as frequently as the singular to indicate the wall encircling the city; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-10.htm">2 Kings 25:10</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-1.htm">1 Kings 3:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-13.htm">Nehemiah 2:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-1.htm">Nehemiah 4:1</a> with <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/1-3.htm">Nehemiah 1:3</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-17.htm">Nehemiah 2:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-10.htm">Nehemiah 4:10</a>. With such invincible power will God equip His prophet "against the whole land," i.e., so that he will be able to hold his own against the whole land. The mention of the component parts of "all the land," i.e., the several classes of the population, is introduced by &#1500;&#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1497;, so that "the kings," etc., is to be taken as an apposition to "against all the land." Kings in the plural are mentioned, because the prophet's labours are to extend over several reigns. &#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; are the chiefs of the people, the heads of families and clans, and officers, civil and military. "The people of the land" is the rest of the population not included in these three classes, elsewhere called men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-25.htm">Jeremiah 17:25</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-32.htm">Jeremiah 32:32</a>, and frequently. &#1488;&#1500;&#1497;&#1498; for &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1498;; so in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-20.htm">Jeremiah 15:20</a>, and often.
