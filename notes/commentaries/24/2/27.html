Men are often as much under the power of their unbridled desires and their sinful lusts, as the brute beasts. But the Lord here warns them not to weary themselves in pursuits which could only bring distress and misery. As we must not despair of the mercy of God, but believe that to be sufficient for the pardon of our sins, so neither must we despair of the grace of God, but believe that it is able to subdue our corruptions, though ever so strong.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>"Stone" being feminine in Hebrew is here represented as the mother.<p>Arise, and save us - Whether it be idolatry or infidelity, it satisfies only in tranquil and prosperous times.

The “stock” and “stone” symbolize the god worshipped, and doubtless include the wooden poles (Asherahs) and stone obelisks or pillars by which they were represented. The words addressed to them by the worshippers do not imply that the latter considered the spirits of their ancestors to be there embodied. Such worship was not a Hebrew practice.

I have planted thee a noble vine; not, with noble vines, as we translate in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-2.htm">Isaiah 5:2</a>, where Israel is compared to a vineyard. Here Israel is compared to the vine itself, a vine which Jahveh has planted; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80-9.htm">Psalm 80:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/10-1.htm">Hosea 10:1</a>.

The article in &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1508;&#1503; is generic: wild shoots of the species of the wild vine; but this is not the first determining word; cf. for this exposition of the article <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-4.htm">Jeremiah 13:4</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-30.htm">2 Samuel 12:30</a>, etc., Ew. 290, a3); and for the omission of the article with &#1504;&#1499;&#1512;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;, cf. Ew. 293, a. Thus are removed the grammatical difficulties that led Hitz. to take ' &#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;quite unnaturally as vocative, and Graf to alter the text. "A strange vine" is an interloping vine, not of the true, genuine stock planted by Jahveh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-10.htm">Jeremiah 2:10</a>), and which bears poisonous berries of gall. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-32.htm">Deuteronomy 32:32</a>.</body></html>
