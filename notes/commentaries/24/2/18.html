Great rivers were, in the poetry of the prophets, the natural symbols of the kingdoms through which they flowed. Sihor (= the turbid or muddy river) here, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/23-3.htm" title="And by great waters the seed of Sihor, the harvest of the river, is her revenue; and she is a mart of nations.">Isaiah 23:3</a> the Nile (though in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-3.htm" title="From Sihor, which is before Egypt, even to the borders of Ekron northward, which is counted to the Canaanite: five lords of the Philistines; the Gazathites, and the Ashdothites, the Eshkalonites, the Gittites, and the Ekronites; also the Avites:">Joshua 13:3</a> it stands for the border stream between Palestine and Egypt), represented Egypt. The “river,” or “flood,” needing no other name as pre-eminent in its greatness (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/joshua/24-14.htm" title="Now therefore fear the LORD, and serve him in sincerity and in truth: and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the flood, and in Egypt; and serve you the LORD.">Joshua 24:14-15</a>), the Euphrates, stood for Assyria (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-7.htm" title="Now therefore, behold, the Lord brings up on them the waters of the river, strong and many, even the king of Assyria, and all his glory: and he shall come up over all his channels, and go over all his banks:">Isaiah 8:7</a>). The words point to the tendency to court the alliance now of one, now of the other of the great kingdoms of the world. The policy was no new one. Menahem in Israel, Ahaz in Judah, had courted Assyria (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-19.htm" title="And Pul the king of Assyria came against the land: and Menahem gave Pul a thousand talents of silver, that his hand might be with him to confirm the kingdom in his hand.">2Kings 15:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/16-7.htm" title="So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglathpileser king of Assyria, saying, I am your servant and your son: come up, and save me out of the hand of the king of Syria, and out of the hand of the king of Israel, which rise up against me.">2Kings 16:7-8</a>); Hezekiah, Babylon (Isaiah 39); Hoshea had sought help from Egypt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-4.htm" title="And the king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea: for he had sent messengers to So king of Egypt, and brought no present to the king of Assyria, as he had done year by year: therefore the king of Assyria shut him up, and bound him in prison.">2Kings 17:4</a>). The prophet Hosea had rebuked both policies (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/5-13.htm" title="When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah saw his wound, then went Ephraim to the Assyrian, and sent to king Jareb: yet could he not heal you, nor cure you of your wound.">Hosea 5:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/7-11.htm" title="Ephraim also is like a silly dove without heart: they call to Egypt, they go to Assyria.">Hosea 7:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/8-9.htm" title="For they are gone up to Assyria, a wild ass alone by himself: Ephraim has hired lovers.">Hosea 8:9</a>). Even under Hezekiah there was a party seeking the Egyptian alliance (Isaiah 18, 19, 31. Under Manasseh and Amon that party was in power, and the very name of the latter probably bears witness to its influence. Josiah kept as far as possible the position of a neutral, but, when forced into action, and probably guided by the counsels of Hilkiah, resisted the advance of Pharaoh-nechoh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-29.htm" title="In his days Pharaohnechoh king of Egypt went up against the king of Assyria to the river Euphrates: and king Josiah went against him; and he slew him at Megiddo, when he had seen him.">2Kings 23:29</a>). On his death the Egyptian party again gained ground under Jehoiakim, while Jeremiah, opposing its strength, urged the wisdom of accepting the guidance of events, and submitting to the Chaldæans (so far continuing the line of action adopted by Hezekiah), and ultimately was accused of deserting his own people and “falling away” to their oppressors (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-13.htm" title="And when he was in the gate of Benjamin, a captain of the ward was there, whose name was Irijah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah; and he took Jeremiah the prophet, saying, You fall away to the Chaldeans.">Jeremiah 37:13</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/jeremiah/2.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-18.htm" title="And now what have you to do in the way of Egypt, to drink the waters of Sihor? or what have you to do in the way of Assyria, to drink the waters of the river?">Jeremiah 2:18</a></span>. <span class="ital">And now what hast thou to do, </span>&c. — “The kings of Egypt and Assyria were the most potent monarchs in the neighbourhood of Judea; and according as either of these was the stronger, the Jews made their court to him, and desired his assistance.

The Septuagint and Arabic versions render it "the waters of Geon", or "Gihon": and this also is the same with the Nile, as Josephus (k) affirms, who says, <p>"Geon, which runs through Egypt, is the same which the Greeks call Nile.'' <p>So Jerom (l) from Eusebius, <p>"Geon is a river, which with the Egyptians is called Nile.'' <p>The Vulgate Latin version renders it, "troubled water"; and such were the waters of the Nile, which had its name of Sihor from the blackness of it; and hence, by the Greeks (m), was called Melas; and by the Latines (n), Melo. Hence, as Braunius (o) observes, it was represented by a black stone, as other rivers by a white one; for which reason the black colour was very grateful to the Egyptians; and for the same reason Osiris, which is the very Nile itself, was reckoned black; and the ox Apis they worshipped was a black one, at least part of it, and was covered with black linen cloth; and its priests were also clothed in black, hence called Chemarim, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/10-5.htm">Hosea 10:5</a>. <p>Or what hast thou to do in the way of Assyria; to go after their idolatrous practices, or to send to them for help; for this was the usual method of the Jews; when the Assyrians oppressed them, then they sent to Egypt for help; and when the Egyptians were upon them, then they applied to the Assyrians; and in both cases acted wrong, for they ought to have sought the Lord their God only: <p>to drink the waters of the river? of the river Euphrates. The sense is, that they preferred the waters of the Nile and of Euphrates, or the gods of the Egyptians and Assyrians, or the help of these people, before the Lord, the fountain of living waters, and his worship and powerful help.

Ever since the time when Psammetichus I (b.c. 663–610), king of Egypt, reduced under his own sway the twelve separate kingdoms into which that country had been formed, there was a party of statesmen at Jerusalem who favoured an Egyptian alliance.

Hoshea sought the aid of Egypt to enable him to throw off the Assyrian yoke, while Josiah met his death in fighting against it and on behalf of the Eastern empire, Assyria’s successor. Thus subservience now to one now to the other quarter was familiar to those whom Jeremiah addressed. Hosea (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-2.htm" title="Stand in the gate of the LORD's house, and proclaim there this word, and say, Hear the word of the LORD, all you of Judah, that enter in at these gates to worship the LORD.">Jeremiah 7:2</a>) had likened Israel in its vacillation to “a silly dove, without understanding.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">to drink the waters of the River</span>] Euphrates, the great river, on which was built Babylon.

Isaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-2.htm">Isaiah 30:2-5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/31-1.htm">Isaiah 31:1</a>) and Hosea (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/7-11.htm">Hosea 7:11, 16</a>) had already inveighed against an Egyptian alliance. The name given by Manasseh to his sen and successor (Amen) suggests that at one period in his reign an Egyptian policy was in the ascendant, which coincides with the tradition preserved in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-11.htm">2 Chronicles 33:11</a>, of an Assyrian captivity of Manasseh. Jehoiakim at a later period was a vassal of Egypt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-31.htm">2 Kings 23:31, 35</a>). <span class="cmt_word">To drink the waters</span>; taking up the idea of the second clause of ver. 13. <span class="cmt_word">Sihor</span>, or Shihor, occurs again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/23-3.htm">Isaiah 23:3</a>, as a name of the Nile. It properly means, not so much "the black" as "the dark grey" (connected with <span class="accented">shakhar</span>, the morning grey), from the color of the water. Rosenm&uuml;ller's contrast between the muddy waters of foreign streams and the "fountain of living waters" is uncalled for; besides, the Nile water has always been held in high esteem.

It is true that Assyria was, to say the least, powerless to interfere for good or for evil, when these words were written. But in ver. 5 the prophet has already warned us that his complaints are partly retrospective. It would seem that the Assyrian party from time to time gained the upper hand over the Egyptian in the councils of the State. Or perhaps the prophet may refer to the Quixotic fidelity to Assyria of Josiah (see below on ver. 36). <span class="cmt_word">The river</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the Euphrates, "the great river" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>).

For the people in its successive and even yet future generations constitutes a unity, and in this unity a moral personality. Since the sins of the fathers transmit themselves to the children and remoter descendants, sons and grandsons must pay the penalty of the fathers' guilt, that is, so long as they share the disposition of their ancestors. The conception of this moral unity is at the foundation of the threatening. That the present race persists in the fathers' backsliding from the Lord is clearly expressed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-17.htm">Jeremiah 2:17</a>. In "I will further chide or strive," is intimated implicite that God had chidden already up till now, or even earlier with the fathers. &#1512;&#1497;&#1489;, contend, when said of God, is actual striving or chastening with all kinds of punishment. This must God do as the righteous and holy one; for the sin of the people is an unheard of sin, seen in no other people. "The islands of the Chittim" are the isles and coast lands of the far west, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-6.htm">Ezekiel 27:6</a>; &#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; having originally been the name for Cyprus and the city of Cition, see in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-4.htm">Genesis 10:4</a>.

The Kedarenes lived as a pastoral people in the eastern part of the desert between Arabia Petraea and Babylonia; see in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-13.htm">Genesis 25:13</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-21.htm">Ezekiel 27:21</a>.

Ew. 324, c. The unheard of, that which has happened amongst no people, is put interrogatively for rhetorical effect. Has any heathen nation changed its gods, which indeed are not truly gods? No; no heathen nation has done this; but the people of Jahveh, Israel, has exchanged its glory, i.e., the God who made Himself known to it in His glory, for false gods that are of no profit. &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1491; is the glory in which the invisible God manifested His majesty in the world and amidst His people. Cf. the analogous title given to God, ,&#1504;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1503;  &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1488;&#1500; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-7.htm">Amos 8:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/5-5.htm">Hosea 5:5</a>. The exact antithesis to &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1491;&#1493; would be &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-24.htm">Jeremiah 3:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-13.htm">Jeremiah 11:13</a>; but Jeremiah chose  &#1500;&#1488;to represent the exchange as not advantageous. God showed His glory to the Israelites in the glorious deeds of His omnipotence and grace, like those mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-5.htm">Jeremiah 2:5</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-6.htm">Jeremiah 2:6</a>.

Before the sin of Israel is more fully set forth, the prophet calls on heaven to be appalled at it. The heavens are addressed as that part of the creation where the glory of God is most brightly reflected. The rhetorical aim is seen in the piling up of words. &#1495;&#1512;&#1489;, lit., to be parched up, to be deprived of the life-marrow. Israel has committed two crimes: a. It has forsaken Jahveh, the fountain of living water.  ,&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;living water, i.e., water that originates and nourishes life, is a significant figure for God, with whom is the fountain of life (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/36-10.htm">Psalm 36:10</a>), i.e., from whose Spirit all life comes. Fountain of living water (here and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-13.htm">Jeremiah 17:13</a>) is synonymous with well of life in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-11.htm">Proverbs 10:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-14.htm">Proverbs 13:14</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-27.htm">Proverbs 14:27</a>, Sir. 21:13. b. The other sin is this, that they hew or dig out wells, broken, rent, full of crevices, that hold no water. The delineation keeps to the same figure. The dead gods have no life and can dispense no life, just as wells with rents or fissures hold no water. The two sins, the forsaking of the living God and the seeking out of dead gods, cannot really be separated. Man, created by God and for God, cannot live without God. If he forsake the living God, he passes in spite of himself into the service of dead, unreal gods. Forsaking the living God is eo ipso exchanging Him for an imaginary god. The prophet sets the two moments of the apostasy from God side by side, so as to depict to the people with greater fulness of light the enormity of their crime. The fact in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-11.htm">Jeremiah 2:11</a> that no heathen nation changes its gods for others, has its foundation in this, that the gods of the heathen are the creations of men, and that the worship of them is moulded by the carnal-mindedness of sinful man; so that there is less inducement to change, the gods of the different nations being in nature alike. But the true God claims to be worshipped in spirit and in truth, and does not permit the nature and manner of His worship to depend on the fancies of His worshippers; He makes demands upon men that run counter to carnal nature, insisting upon the renunciation of sensual lusts and cravings and the crucifixion of the flesh, and against this corrupt carnal nature rebels. Upon this reason for the fact adduced, Jeremiah does not dwell, but lays stress on the fact itself. This he does with the view of bringing out the distinction, wide as heaven, between the true God and the false gods, to the shaming of the idolatrous people; and in order, at the same time, to scourge the folly of idolatry by giving prominence to the contrast between the glory of God and the nothingness of the idols. </body></html>
