The figs in one basket were very good, those in the other basket very bad. What creature viler than a wicked man? and what more valuable than a godly man? This vision was to raise the spirits of those gone into captivity, by assuring them of a happy return; and to humble and awaken the proud and secure spirits of those yet in Jerusalem, by assuring them of a miserable captivity. The good figs represents the pious captives. We cannot determine as to God's love or hatred by what is before us. Early suffering sometimes proves for the best. The sooner the child is corrected, the better effect the correction is likely to have. Even this captivity was for their good; and God's intentions never are in vain. By afflictions they were convinced of sin, humbled under the hand of God, weaned from the world, taught to pray, and turned from sins, particularly from idolatry. God promises that he will own them in captivity. The Lord will own those who are his, in all conditions. God assures them of his protection in trouble, and a glorious deliverance in due time. When our troubles are sanctified to us, we may be sure that they will end well. They shall return to him with their whole heart. Thus they should have liberty to own him for their God, to pray to him, and expect blessings from him. The bad figs were Zedekiah and those of his party yet in the land. These should be removed for their hurt, and forsaken of all mankind. God has many judgments, and those that escape one, may expect another, till they are brought to repent. Doubtless, this prophecy had its fulfilment in that age; but the Spirit of prophecy may here look forward to the dispersion of the unbelieving Jews, in all the nations of the earth. Let those who desire blessings from the Lord, beg that he will give them a heart to know him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Fig-trees bear three crops of figs, of which the first is regarded as a great delicacy. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/24.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. figs &#8230; first ripe&#8212;the "boccora," or early fig (see on [923]Isa 28:4). Baskets of figs used to be offered as first-fruits in the temple. The good figs represent Jeconiah and the exiles in Babylon; the bad, Zedekiah and the obstinate Jews in Judea. They are called good and bad respectively, not in an absolute, but a comparative sense, and in reference to the punishment of the latter. This prophecy was designed to encourage the despairing exiles, and to reprove the people at home, who prided themselves as superior to those in Babylon and abused the forbearance of God (compare Jer 52:31-34).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/24.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> God afterwards explaineth to the prophet, and he to the king’s house, the significancy of this vision. The figs first ripe are usually best. By these <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">good figs, </span> as will appear by the following verses, are intended Jeconiah or Jehoiachin, with the ten thousand mentioned <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-14.htm" title="And he carried away all Jerusalem, and all the princes, and all the mighty men of valor, even ten thousand captives, and all the craftsmen and smiths: none remained, save the poorest sort of the people of the land.">2 Kings 24:14</a></span>, and the seven thousand mentioned <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-16.htm" title="And all the men of might, even seven thousand, and craftsmen and smiths a thousand, all that were strong and apt for war, even them the king of Babylon brought captive to Babylon.">2 Kings 24:16</a></span>, which went with him into captivity. By the other figs which were very bad, not to be eaten, are signified Zedekiah and the residue of the people carried with him into captivity. Some may object that Jeconiah and the people then carried away were wicked enough, why else were they carried away? and being so, how are they compared to good figs? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Answ.</span> 1. Though they were bad, yet they might be comparatively good; this people, for the eleven years they continued in their own land, after that their brethren were carried away, not only continuing in their former courses, but still growing worse and worse. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. They seem not to be called good or bad figs with respect to their manners or quality, but in respect to what God intended to do to them, viz. to use them as bad figs are used, not fit to: be eaten. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/24.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>One basket had very good figs, even like the figs that are first ripe,.... As there are some figs that are ripe sooner than others, and which are always the most desirable and acceptable; and such were they that were presented to the Lord, <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/7-1.htm">Micah 7:1</a>; these signified those that were carried captive into Babylon with Jeconiah, among whom were some very good men, as Ezekiel, and others; and all might be said to be so, in comparison of those that were at Jerusalem, who were very wicked, and grew worse and worse: <p>and the other basket had very naughty figs, which could not be eaten, they were so bad; as nothing is more sweet and luscious, and agreeable to the taste than a sound ripe fig, and especially a first ripe one; so nothing is more nauseous than a naughty rotten one: these signified the wicked Jews at Jerusalem indulging themselves in all manner of sin; so those who seemed to be the worst, through their being carried captive, were the best; and those who, seemed to be the best, by their prosperity, were the worst. This is to be understood in a comparative sense, as Calvin observes; though this does not so much design the quality of persons, as the issue of things, with respect unto them. The captivity of the one would issue in their good, and so are compared to good figs; when the sins of the other would bring upon them utter ruin and destruction without recovery, and therefore compared to bad figs that cannot be eaten. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/24.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">One basket had very good figs, even like the figs that are first ripe: and the other basket had very naughty figs, which could not be eaten, they were so bad.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/24.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">2</span>. <span class="ital">the figs that are first ripe</span>] The proper time for gathering figs in Palestine is in August.

"And when this people, or the prophet, or a priest ask thee, saying: What is the burden of Jahveh? then say to them: What the burden is - now I will cast you off, saith Jahveh. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-34.htm">Jeremiah 23:34</a>. And the prophet, the priest, and the people that shall say: burden of Jahveh, on that man will I visit it and on his house. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-35.htm">Jeremiah 23:35</a>. Thus shall ye say each to the other, and each to his brother: What hath Jahveh answered, and what hath Jahveh spoken? <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-36.htm">Jeremiah 23:36</a>. But burden of Jahveh shall ye mention no more, for a burden to every one shall his own word be; and ye wrest the words of the living God Jahveh of hosts, our God. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-37.htm">Jeremiah 23:37</a>. Thus shalt thou say to the prophet: What hath Jahveh answered thee, and what hath He spoken? <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-38.htm">Jeremiah 23:38</a>. But if ye say: burden of Jahveh, therefore thus saith Jahveh: Because ye say this word: burden of Jahveh, and yet I have sent unto you, saying, Ye shall not say: burden of Jahveh; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-39.htm">Jeremiah 23:39</a>. Therefore, behold, I will utterly forget you, and cast away from my face you and this city that I gave you and your fathers, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-40.htm">Jeremiah 23:40</a>. And will lay upon you everlasting reproach, and everlasting, never-to-be-forgotten disgrace."<p>The word &#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1488;, from &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;, lift up, bear, sig. burden, and, like the phrase: lift up the voice, means a saying of weighty or dread import. The word has the latter sig. in the headings to the prophecies of threatening character; see on <a href="http://biblehub.com/nahum/1-1.htm">Nahum 1:1</a>, where this meaning of the word in the headings is asserted, and the widespread opinion that it means effatum is refuted. Jeremiah's adversaries - as appears from these verses - used the word "burden" of his prophetic sayings by way of mockery, meaning burdensome prophecies, in order to throw ridicule on the prophet's speeches, by them regarded as offensive. Thus if the people, or a prophet, or a priest ask: What is the burden of Jahveh, i.e., how runs it, or what does it contain? he is to answer: The Lord saith: I will cast you off, i.e., disburden myself of you, as it were - the idea of "burden" being kept up in the answer to the question. The article on the word prophet is used to show that the word is used generally of the class of prophets at large. The &#1488;&#1514; in the answering clause is nota accus., the following phrase being designedly repeated from the question; and hence the unusual combination &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1502;&#1492;. The sense is: as regards the question what the burden is, I will cast you away. There is no reason to alter the text to fit the lxx translation: &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;, or Vulg.: vos estis onus, as Cappell., J. D. Mich., Hitz., Gr., etc., do. The lxx rendering is based, not on another reading, but on another division of the words, viz., &#1488;&#1514;&#1501; &#1492;&#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;. - In <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-34.htm">Jeremiah 23:34</a> the meaning of this answer is more fully explained. On every one that uses the word "burden" in this sneering way God will avenge the sneer, and not only on his person, but on his house, his family as well. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-35.htm">Jeremiah 23:35</a> they are told how they are to speak of prophecy. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-36.htm">Jeremiah 23:36</a>. They are no longer to make use of the phrase "burden of Jahveh," "for the burden shall his word be to each one," i.e., the word "burden" will be to each who uses it a burden that crushes him down. "And ye wrest," etc., is part of the reason for what is said: and ye have  equals  for ye have wrested the words of the living God. The clause is properly a corollary which tells what happens when they use the forbidden word.</body></html>
