The figs in one basket were very good, those in the other basket very bad. What creature viler than a wicked man? and what more valuable than a godly man? This vision was to raise the spirits of those gone into captivity, by assuring them of a happy return; and to humble and awaken the proud and secure spirits of those yet in Jerusalem, by assuring them of a miserable captivity. The good figs represents the pious captives. We cannot determine as to God's love or hatred by what is before us. Early suffering sometimes proves for the best. The sooner the child is corrected, the better effect the correction is likely to have. Even this captivity was for their good; and God's intentions never are in vain. By afflictions they were convinced of sin, humbled under the hand of God, weaned from the world, taught to pray, and turned from sins, particularly from idolatry. God promises that he will own them in captivity. The Lord will own those who are his, in all conditions. God assures them of his protection in trouble, and a glorious deliverance in due time. When our troubles are sanctified to us, we may be sure that they will end well. They shall return to him with their whole heart. Thus they should have liberty to own him for their God, to pray to him, and expect blessings from him. The bad figs were Zedekiah and those of his party yet in the land. These should be removed for their hurt, and forsaken of all mankind. God has many judgments, and those that escape one, may expect another, till they are brought to repent. Doubtless, this prophecy had its fulfilment in that age; but the Spirit of prophecy may here look forward to the dispersion of the unbelieving Jews, in all the nations of the earth. Let those who desire blessings from the Lord, beg that he will give them a heart to know him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Acknowledge ... for their good - Specially their spiritual good.

Their conversion from idolatry to the one true God, through the chastening effect of the Babylonish captivity, is here expressed in language which, in its fulness, applies to the more complete conversion hereafter of the Jews, "with their whole heart" (Jer 29:13), through the painful discipline of their present dispersion.

This knowledge designs not the first knowledge of the Lord, but an increase of it; and not head knowledge, but heart knowledge; a knowledge of God, joined with love and affection to him, high esteem, and approbation of him; and including communion with him, and an open profession and acknowledgment of him: and it is an appropriating knowledge also; a knowing him for themselves, and as their own; and such a knowledge or heart to know the Lord is a pure gift of his, and without which none can have it: and it may be observed, that in captivity it was given them; afflictions were the means of it; and happy it is when hereby men come to have a knowledge of God, and to be better acquainted with him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/92-12.htm">Psalm 92:12</a>; <p>and they shall be my people, and I will be their God; that is, it shall appear that they are so, by the above blessings of grace and goodness bestowed upon them; the Lord hereby owning them for his people, and they hereby coming to know that he is their God: <p>for, or "when" (e). <p>they shall return unto me with their whole heart; affectionately, sincerely, and unfeignedly.

"Jahveh caused me to see, and behold two baskets of figs set before the temple of Jahveh, after Nebuchadrezzar had carried captive Jechoniah, the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and the princes of Judah, and the work-people and the smiths from Jerusalem, and had brought them to Babylon. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-2.htm">Jeremiah 24:2</a>. One basket had very good figs like the early figs, the other basket very bad figs, which could not be eaten for badness. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-3.htm">Jeremiah 24:3</a>. And Jahveh said to me: What seest thou, Jeremiah? and I:said: Figs; the good figs are very good, and the bad figs very bad, which cannot be eaten for badness. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-4.htm">Jeremiah 24:4</a>. Then came the word of Jahveh unto me, saying: <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-5.htm">Jeremiah 24:5</a>. Thus saith Jahveh, the God of Israel: Like these good figs, so will I look on the captives of Judah, whom I have sent out of this place into the land of the Chaldeans, for good; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-6.htm">Jeremiah 24:6</a>. And I will set mine eye upon them for good, and will bring them back again to this land, and build them and not pull down, and plant them and not pluck up. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-7.htm">Jeremiah 24:7</a>. And I give them an heart to know me, that I am Jahveh; and they shall be my people, and I will be their God; for they will return unto me with their whole heart. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-8.htm">Jeremiah 24:8</a>. And as the bad figs, which cannot be eaten for badness, yea thus saith Jahveh, so will I make Zedekiah the king of Judah, and his princes and the residue of Jerusalem, them that are left remaining in this land and them that dwell in Egypt. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-9.htm">Jeremiah 24:9</a>. I give them up for ill-usage, for trouble to all kingdoms of the earth, for a reproach and a by-word, for a taunt and for a curse in all the places whither I shall drive them. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-10.htm">Jeremiah 24:10</a>. and I send among them the sword, the famine, and the plague, till they be consumed from off the land that I gave to them and to their fathers."<p>This vision resembles in form and substance that in <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/8-1.htm">Amos 8:1-3</a>. The words: Jahveh caused me to see, point to an inward event, a seeing with the eyes of the spirit, not of the body. The time is, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-1.htm">Jeremiah 24:1</a>, precisely given: after Nebuchadnezzar had carried to Babylon King Jechoniah, with the princes and a part of the people; apparently soon after this deportation, at the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah, the king set up by Nebuchadnezzar over Judah. Cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-14.htm">2 Kings 24:14-17</a>. - The Lord caused the prophet to see in spirit two baskets of figs (&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501;, from &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497;, equivalent to &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-2.htm">Jeremiah 24:2</a>), &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; (from &#1497;&#1506;&#1491;) in the place appointed therefor (&#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491;( rofereh) before the temple. We are not to regard these figs as an offering brought to Jahveh (Graf); and so neither are we to think here of the place where first-fruits or tithes were offered to the Lord, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-19.htm">Exodus 23:19</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-2.htm">Deuteronomy 26:2</a>. The two baskets of figs have nothing to do with first-fruits. They symbolize the people, those who appear before the Lord their God, namely, before the altar of burnt-offering; where the Lord desired to appear to, to meet with His people (&#1504;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-42.htm">Exodus 29:42</a>.), so as to sanctify it by His glory, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-43.htm">Exodus 29:43</a>. &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; therefore means: placed in the spot appointed by the Lord for His meeting with Israel. </body></html>
