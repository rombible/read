That meaning is, of course, out of the question here. On the whole there seems no reason for altering the English version, though the precise combination of words is an unusual one.<p><span class= "bld"><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/25.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>25:30-38 The Lord has just ground of controversy with every nation and every person; and he will execute judgment on all the wicked.

The Hebrew for "oppressing" means also a "dove": there may be, therefore, a covert allusion to the Chaldean standard bearing a dove on it, in honor of Semiramis, the first queen, said in popular superstition to have been nourished by doves when exposed at birth, and at death to have been transformed into a dove. Her name may come from a root referring to the cooing of a dove. That bird was held sacred to the goddess Venus. Vulgate so translates "the anger of the dove."<p>his &#8230; anger&#8212;If the anger of Nebuchadnezzar cannot be evaded, how much less that of God (compare Jer 25:37)!   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/25.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> God had before compared himself to a lion, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-30.htm" title="Therefore prophesy you against them all these words, and say to them, The LORD shall roar from on high, and utter his voice from his holy habitation; he shall mightily roar on his habitation; he shall give a shout, as they that tread the grapes, against all the inhabitants of the earth.">Jeremiah 25:30</a></span>; here he declares himself to be about to move like a lion, who when he goeth out to seek his prey, leaveth his covert: see <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-44.htm" title="Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan to the habitation of the strong: but I will make them suddenly run away from her: and who is a chosen man, that I may appoint over her? for who is like me? and who will appoint me the time? and who is that shepherd that will stand before me?">Jeremiah 50:44</a></span>. The effects of this rising up of God out of his covert is the desolation of the land through the fierceness of the enemy, caused from the fierce anger of God now ready to be poured out upon this people. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/25.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>He hath forsaken his covert as a lion,.... Which some understand of God leaving Jerusalem, or the temple, where he dwelt; who, while he made it his residence, protected it; but when he forsook it, it became exposed to the enemy. Kimchi says it may be understood of the destruction of the first temple by Nebuchadnezzar; but he thinks it is most correct to interpret it of the destruction of the second temple; that is, by the Romans, when it was left desolate by Christ, the Lion of the tribe of Judah. But it may be understood of Nebuchadnezzar leaving Babylon, his den, and ranging about like a lion for his prey; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-7.htm">Jeremiah 4:7</a>. So the Targum, <p>"and a king has removed from his tower or fortress;'' <p>and the land is desolate; the land of Judea, or whatsoever country he comes into with his army; that, or Egypt, or any other: <p>because of the fierceness of the oppressor; the tyrant Nebuchadnezzar; or "oppressing sword" (w), as some supply it, it being feminine; and so the Targum, <p>"from before the sword of the enemy.'' <p>Some render it, "because of the fierceness of the dove"; so the Vulgate Latin; and understand it of the Babylonians or Chaldeans; who, as the Romans had an eagle, they had the dove on their standards or ensigns; which they received from the Assyrians, when they succeeded them in their monarchy; and those from Semiramis their first queen, who had it, it is said, on her standard (x); and was retained in honour of her, and in memory of her being nourished by a dove, and turned into one after her death, as commonly believed (y); and who had her name, as is affirmed (z), from the word  "semira", signifying, in the Chaldee language, the song or cooing of the dove; but fierceness ill agrees with the dove, which is a meek and harmless creature; <p>and because of his fierce anger; either of God, or of the king of Babylon his instrument, in destroying nations; not Judea only, but many others. <p>(w) "gladii opprimentis", Junius &amp; Tremellius; "gladii abripientis", Piscator.

As the lion seeks other shelter, when that which he has dwelt in hitherto is destroyed, so Jehovah forsakes his land now that it has become desolate.

Owing to the word rendered “oppressing” being scarcely found elsewhere except as an adjective in the expression “oppressing sword” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-16.htm" title="He made many to fall, yes, one fell on another: and they said, Arise, and let us go again to our own people, and to the land of our nativity, from the oppressing sword.">Jeremiah 46:16</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-16.htm" title="Cut off the sower from Babylon, and him that handles the sickle in the time of harvest: for fear of the oppressing sword they shall turn every one to his people, and they shall flee every one to his own land.">Jeremiah 50:16</a>), a reading which by a slight alteration of the Hebrew for “fierceness” (supported by LXX) we obtain here, we may safely adopt it, discarding “the fierceness of.” The Vulg. renders the Hebrew word above referred to in its more ordinary sense of <span class="ital">a dove</span>, i.e. Nebuchadnezzar, in reference to the Jewish belief that his standards bore that device.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and because of his fierce anger</span>] This clause is not found in LXX, but is wanted for parallelism, and so very possibly to be retained.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 38.</span> - Close of the prophecy with a fuller enunciation of the thought with which the paragraph was introduced. <span class="cmt_word">He hath forsaken</span>; comp. ver. 30, and notice the impressive non-mention of the subject (as <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-13.htm">Jeremiah 4:13</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Their land</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> that of the shepherds. <span class="cmt_word">The fierceness of the oppressor</span>.
