The thought of the scattered flock suggested the idea of a dispersion or breaking-up of another kind, even that of the “pleasant vessel” (literally, <span class= "ital">the vessel of desire, i.e., </span>a vase made as for kingly and honourable uses), falling with a crash and shivered into fragments, which Jeremiah had presented to the people in his acted parable and spoken words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/19-10.htm" title="Then shall you break the bottle in the sight of the men that go with you,">Jeremiah 19:10-11</a>, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-28.htm" title="Is this man Coniah a despised broken idol? is he a vessel wherein is no pleasure? why are they cast out, he and his seed, and are cast into a land which they know not?">Jeremiah 22:28</a>.

It is no uncommon thing in Scripture to call kings and civil magistrates shepherds; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-1.htm">Jeremiah 23:1</a>; <p>and wallow yourselves in the ashes, ye principal of the flock; or "roll yourselves in dust", as a token of mourning; as being in the utmost distress, and incapable of helping themselves, and redressing the grievances of their people; and therefore lie down and tumble about as in the greatest anxiety and trouble, the Targum is, <p>"cover your heads with ashes, ye mighty of the people;'' <p>meaning those who were in the highest posts of honour and profit; the chief as to authority and power, riches and wealth; <p>for the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions are accomplished; the time is come when they who were the fat of the flock, and were nourished up for slaughter, should be slain. The allusion to shepherds and sheep is still kept up; and such who should escape that, should be scattered up and down the world, as a flock of sheep is by the wolf, or any other beast of prey, when some are seized and devoured, and others dispersed; and this was not the case of the Jews only, but of other nations in their turn; <p>and ye shall fall like a pleasant vessel; a vessel of worth and value, and so desirable; as vessels of glass, of gems, or of earth, as of Venice glass, of alabaster, of China; which when they fall and are broken, become useless, and are irreparable; signifying hereby, that their desirableness and excellency would not secure them from destruction, and that their ruin would be irretrievable. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/25.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Howl, <span class="cverse3">{z}</span> ye shepherds, and cry; and wallow yourselves <i>in the ashes</i>, ye chief of the flock: for the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions are accomplished; and ye shall fall like a <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> pleasant vessel.</span><p>(z) You that are chief rulers, and governors.<p>(a) Which are most easily broken.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/25.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">34</span>. <span class="ital">wallow yourselves</span> in ashes] rather, <span class="bld">sprinkle yourselves</span>.

These might the less unsuitably be inserted after <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-16.htm">Jeremiah 25:16</a>, inasmuch as what there is further of the divine command in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-27.htm">Jeremiah 25:27-29</a> is, if we examine its substance, little else than an enforcement of the command. The prophet is not merely to declare to them what is the meaning of this drinking of wrath (Hitz.), but is to tell them that they are to drink the cup of wrath to the bottom, so that they shall fall for drunkenness and not be able to stand again (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-27.htm">Jeremiah 25:27</a>); and that they must drink, because when once Jahveh has begun judgment on His own people, He is determined not to spare any other people. &#1511;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468; from &#1511;&#1497;&#1492;  equals  &#1511;&#1493;&#1488; serves to strengthen the &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;; in the second hemistich the figurative statement passes into the real, as at <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-16.htm">Jeremiah 25:16</a>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-28.htm">Jeremiah 25:28</a> &#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1493; &#1514;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; is a peremptory command; ye shall  equals  must drink. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-29.htm">Jeremiah 25:29</a> gives the reason; since God spares not His own people, then the heathen people need not count on immunity. "And ye think to go unpunished" is a question of surprise. Judgment is to be extended over all the inhabitants of the earth.<p>As to the fulfilment of this prophecy, see detail sin the exposition of the oracles against the nations, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46.htm">Jeremiah 46-51</a>. Hence it appears that most of the nations here mentioned were subject to Nebuchadnezzar. Only of Elam is no express mention there made; and as to Media, Jeremiah has given no special prophecy. As to both these peoples, it is very questionable whether Nebuchadnezzar ever subdued them. For more on this, see on <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-34.htm">Jeremiah 49:34-39</a>. Although it is said in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-9.htm">Jeremiah 25:9</a> of the present chapter and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-5.htm">Jeremiah 27:5</a>. that God has given all peoples, all the lands of the earth, into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, yet it does not follow thence that Nebuchadnezzar really conquered all. The meaning of the prophetic announcement is simply that the king of Babylon will obtain dominion over the world for the coming period, and that when his time is run, he too must fall beneath the judgment. The judgment executed by Nebuchadnezzar on the nations is the beginning of that upon the whole earth, before which, in course of time, all inhabitants of the earth fall, even those whom Nebuchadnezzar's sword has not reached. In the beginning of the Chaldean judgment the prophet sees the beginning of judgment upon the whole earth. </body></html>
