What is meant is that the law of retribution will in due time be seen in its action upon those who were now masters of the world.

"All the families of the north" points back to all the tribes of the kingdoms of the north, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-14.htm">Jeremiah 1:14</a>. &#1493;&#1488;&#1500; &#1504;&#1489;&#1493;&#1498; cannot be joined with "and take," but must depend from &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495; in such a way that that verb is again repeated in thought. Ew. proposes to read &#1493;&#1488;&#1514; according to some codd., especially as Syr., Chald., Vulg. have rendered by an accusative. Against this Graf has justly objected, that then Nebuchadnezzar would be merely mentioned by the way as in addition to the various races, whereas it is he that brings these races and is the instrument of destruction in God's hand. Ew.'s reading is therefore to be unhesitatingly rejected. No valid reason appears for pronouncing the words: and to Nebuchadrezzar...my servant, to be a later interpolation (Hitz., Gr.) because they are not in the lxx. There is prominence given to Nebuchadnezzar by the very change of the construction, another "send" requiring to be repeated before "to Nebuchadrezzar." God calls Nebuchadnezzar His servant, as the executor of His will on Judah, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-6.htm">Jeremiah 27:6</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/43-10.htm">Jeremiah 43:10</a>. The "them" in "and bring them" refers to Nebuchadnezzar and the races of the north. "This land" is Judah, the &#1492;&#1494;&#1468;&#1488;&#1514; being &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c2;; so too the corresponding &#1492;&#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;, "all these peoples round about;" so that we need have no doubt of the genuineness of the demonstrative. The peoples meant are those found about Judah, that are specified in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-19.htm">Jeremiah 25:19-25</a>. &#1492;&#1495;&#1512;&#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, used frequently in Deuteronomy and Joshua for the extirpation of the Canaanites, is used by Jeremiah, besides here, only in the prophecy against Babylon, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-21.htm">Jeremiah 50:21</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-26.htm">Jeremiah 50:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-3.htm">Jeremiah 51:3</a>.

With "everlasting desolations," cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-13.htm">Jeremiah 49:13</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-12.htm">Isaiah 58:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/61-4.htm">Isaiah 61:4</a>. - With <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-10.htm">Jeremiah 25:10</a> cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-9.htm">Jeremiah 16:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-34.htm">Jeremiah 7:34</a>. But here the thought is strengthened by the addition: the sound of the mill and the light of the lamp. Not merely every sound of joyfulness shall vanish, but even every sign of life, such as could make known the presence of inhabitants. </body></html>
