The seventy years are commonly reckoned from B.C. 606, the date of the deportation of Jehoiakim and his princes, to B.C. 536, when the decree for the return of the exiles was issued by Cyrus. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-21.htm" title="To fulfill the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land had enjoyed her sabbaths: for as long as she lay desolate she kept sabbath, to fulfill three score and ten years.">2Chronicles 36:21</a> the number is connected with the land “enjoying her Sabbaths,” as though the long desolation came as a retribution for the people’s neglect of the law of the Sabbatical year, and, perhaps, also for their non-observance of the weekly Sabbaths. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/56-4.htm" title="For thus said the LORD to the eunuchs that keep my sabbaths, and choose the things that please me, and take hold of my covenant;">Isaiah 56:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/17-21.htm" title="Thus said the LORD; Take heed to yourselves, and bear no burden on the sabbath day, nor bring it in by the gates of Jerusalem;">Jeremiah 17:21-22</a>.)

This was near two years before the heathen chronologers in general begin his reign, his father being still living. After his father’s death, according to Ptolemy’s canon, he reigned forty-three years; Ilverodamus, or Evil-merodach, his son two, Neriglissar four, and Nabonadius, supposed to be Belshazzar, the grandson of Nebuchadnezzar, seventeen; to which, if we add two years of Darius the Mede, who is said, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-1.htm" title="In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of the Medes, which was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans;">Daniel 9:1</a>, to have been made king over the realm of the Chaldeans, we shall find the nations to have continued all that time, nearly seventy years, in subjection, more or less, to the king of Babylon. But after the accession of Cyrus, who put an end to the Babylonish monarchy, the nations could serve the king of Babylon no longer, because there was no longer a king of Babylon to serve; for the kings of Persia were never called kings of Babylon; but Babylon became itself a subject and dependant province, under a subordinate governor, and began from that instant to experience, in some degree, those divine visitations which terminated at length in what is so justly called, in the next verse, <span class="ital">perpetual desolations.” </span>— Blaney.

The exact number of years of Sabbaths in four hundred ninety years, the period from Saul to the Babylonian captivity; righteous retribution for their violation of the Sabbath (Le 26:34, 35; 2Ch 36:21). The seventy years probably begin from the fourth year of Jehoiakim, when Jerusalem was first captured, and many captives, as well as the treasures of the temple, were carried away; they end with the first year of Cyrus, who, on taking Babylon, issued an edict for the restoration of the Jews (Ezr 1:1).

It will have to be reckoned, not from the deportation of Jehoiachin’s time (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/24-14.htm" title="And he carried away all Jerusalem, and all the princes, and all the mighty men of valor, even ten thousand captives, and all the craftsmen and smiths: none remained, save the poorest sort of the people of the land....">2 Kings 24:14-16</a>), but from (604 b.c.) the 4th year of Jehoiakim to (537 b.c.) the return. It is quite sufficient to make an approximation to the number seventy. The Jewish love for round numbers and especially for one so significant in symbolism, as having for its elements seven and ten, would cause the number seventy to their ears when used in such a connexion to stand for any number not differing by much from that amount.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years</span>. Widely different opinions are held as to the meaning of this prophecy. The most probable view is that "seventy" is an indefinite or round number (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/23-17.htm">Isaiah 23:17</a>), equivalent to "a very long time." This is supported by the analogy of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-7.htm">Jeremiah 27:7</a>, where the captivity is announced as lasting through the reigns of Nebuchadnezzar, his son, and his grandson - a statement evidently vague and indefinite (see <span class="accented">ad</span> loc.), and in any case not answering to a period of seventy years. Besides, we find the "seventy years" again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-10.htm">Jeremiah 29:10</a>, a passage written probably eleven years later. Others think the number is to be taken literally, and it is certainly true that from  <span class="date">B.C. 606</span>, the fourth year of Jehoiakim, to the fall of Babylon,  <span class="date">B.C. 539</span>, sixty-seven years elapsed. But is it desirable to press this against the internal evidence that Jeremiah himself took the number indefinitely? <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/25.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The seventy years' Chaldean bondage of Judah and the peoples. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-3.htm">Jeremiah 25:3</a>.

And this land shall become a desert, a desolation, and these peoples shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years."<p>The very beginning of this discourse points to the great crisis in the fortunes of Judah. Jeremiah recalls into the memory of the people not merely the whole time of his own labours hitherto, but also the labours of many other prophets, who, like himself, have unremittingly preached repentance to the people, called on them to forsake idolatry and their evil ways, and to return to the God of their fathers - but in vain (<a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-3.htm">Jeremiah 25:3-7</a>).
