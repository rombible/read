Who can avoid trembling when God speaks in displeasure? The days are fully come; the time fixed in the Divine counsels, which will make the nations wholly desolate. The tender and delicate shall share the common calamity. Even those who used to live in peace, and did nothing to provoke, shall not escape. Blessed be God, there is a peaceable habitation above, for all the sons of peace. The Lord will preserve his church and all believers in all changes; for nothing can separate them from his love.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/25.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Principal of the flock - i. e., noble ones.<p>Wallow yourselves in the ashes - Rather, roll yourselves on the ground.<p>For ... - Read; "for your days for being slaughtered are accomplished, and I will scatter you" (or, (dash you in pieces).<p>Fall like a pleasant vessel - The comparison suggests the idea of change from a thing of value into worthless fragments.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/25.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>35.

These might the less unsuitably be inserted after <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-16.htm">Jeremiah 25:16</a>, inasmuch as what there is further of the divine command in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-27.htm">Jeremiah 25:27-29</a> is, if we examine its substance, little else than an enforcement of the command. The prophet is not merely to declare to them what is the meaning of this drinking of wrath (Hitz.), but is to tell them that they are to drink the cup of wrath to the bottom, so that they shall fall for drunkenness and not be able to stand again (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-27.htm">Jeremiah 25:27</a>); and that they must drink, because when once Jahveh has begun judgment on His own people, He is determined not to spare any other people. &#1511;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468; from &#1511;&#1497;&#1492;  equals  &#1511;&#1493;&#1488; serves to strengthen the &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;; in the second hemistich the figurative statement passes into the real, as at <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-16.htm">Jeremiah 25:16</a>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-28.htm">Jeremiah 25:28</a> &#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1493; &#1514;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; is a peremptory command; ye shall  equals  must drink. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-29.htm">Jeremiah 25:29</a> gives the reason; since God spares not His own people, then the heathen people need not count on immunity. "And ye think to go unpunished" is a question of surprise. Judgment is to be extended over all the inhabitants of the earth.<p>As to the fulfilment of this prophecy, see detail sin the exposition of the oracles against the nations, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46.htm">Jeremiah 46-51</a>. Hence it appears that most of the nations here mentioned were subject to Nebuchadnezzar. Only of Elam is no express mention there made; and as to Media, Jeremiah has given no special prophecy. As to both these peoples, it is very questionable whether Nebuchadnezzar ever subdued them. For more on this, see on <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-34.htm">Jeremiah 49:34-39</a>. Although it is said in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-9.htm">Jeremiah 25:9</a> of the present chapter and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-5.htm">Jeremiah 27:5</a>. that God has given all peoples, all the lands of the earth, into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, yet it does not follow thence that Nebuchadnezzar really conquered all. The meaning of the prophetic announcement is simply that the king of Babylon will obtain dominion over the world for the coming period, and that when his time is run, he too must fall beneath the judgment. The judgment executed by Nebuchadnezzar on the nations is the beginning of that upon the whole earth, before which, in course of time, all inhabitants of the earth fall, even those whom Nebuchadnezzar's sword has not reached. In the beginning of the Chaldean judgment the prophet sees the beginning of judgment upon the whole earth. </body></html>
