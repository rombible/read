The words are interesting as showing that Jeremiah was probably seconded in his work by other prophets whose names have not come down to us.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/25.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>25:1-7 The call to turn from evil ways to the worship and service of God, and for sinners to trust in Christ, and partake of his salvation, concerns all men. God keeps an account how long we possess the means of grace; and the longer we have them, the heavier will our account be if we have not improved them. Rising early, points out the earnest desire that this people should turn and live. Personal and particular reformation must be insisted on as necessary to a national deliverance; and every one must turn from his own evil way. Yet all was to no purpose. They would not take the right and only method to turn away the wrath of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/25.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Turn ye - i. e., Repent ye; the great summons of God to mankind at all times (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-47.htm">Luke 24:47</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-38.htm">Acts 2:38</a>; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-2.htm">Matthew 3:2</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/25.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5.

The prophets: this was the substance of their discourses and prophecies, what follows: <p>turn ye again now everyone from his evil way, and from the evil of your doings; repent of sins, and reform from them; particularly their idolatries, to which they were prone, and are after mentioned: <p>and dwell in the land that the Lord hath given unto you to your fathers for ever and ever; that is, the land of Canaan, which was given to them, and their fathers before them, by the Lord, for an everlasting inheritance, provided they behaved towards him aright; for they held the possession of it by their obedience to his law; and now, notwithstanding all that they had done, or had been threatened with; yet, if they repented and reformed, they should still dwell in the land, and enjoy it, and all the blessings and privileges of it. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/25.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">They <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> said, Turn ye again now every one from his evil way, and from the evil of your doings, and dwell in the land that the LORD hath given to you and to your fathers for ever and ever:</span><p>(d) He shows that the prophets, wholly with one consent laboured to pull the people from those vices, which then reigned, that is, from idolatry and the vain confidence of men: for under these two all others were contained, 2Ki 17:13, Jer 18:11,35:15, Jon 3:8.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/24.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>And as one deals with the bad uneatable figs, i.e., throws them away, so will the Lord deliver up to ignominious ruin Zedekiah with his princes and the remainder of the people, both those still staying in the land and those living in Egypt. This, the fate awaiting them, is more fully described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-9.htm">Jeremiah 24:9</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-10.htm">Jeremiah 24:10</a>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-8.htm">Jeremiah 24:8</a> the "yea, thus saith," is inserted into the sentence by way of repetition of the "thus saith," <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-5.htm">Jeremiah 24:5</a>. &#1499;&#1468;&#1503; is resumed and expanded by &#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1514;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-9.htm">Jeremiah 24:9</a>. The "princes" are Zedekiah's courtiers. Those in Egypt are they who during the war had fled thither to hide themselves from judgment. From the beginning of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-9.htm">Jeremiah 24:9</a> to &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; is verbally the same as <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-4.htm">Jeremiah 15:4</a>, save that &#1500;&#1512;&#1506;&#1492; is added to make more marked the contrast to &#1500;&#1496;&#1493;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-5.htm">Jeremiah 24:5</a> - the evil, namely, that is done to them. Hitz., Ew., Umbr., Gr., following the lxx, delete this word, but without due cause. The further description of the ill-usage in "for a reproach," etc., is based on <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-37.htm">Deuteronomy 28:37</a>; and is intensified by the addition of "and for an object of cursing," to show that in their case the curse there recorded will be fulfilled. From the last words, according to which disgrace will light on them in all the lands they are driven into, it appears that captivity will fall to the lot of such as are yet to be found in the land. But captivity involves new hostile invasions, and a repeated siege and capture of Jerusalem; during which many will perish by sword, famine, and plague. Thus and by deportation they shall be utterly rooted out of the land of their fathers. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-17.htm">Jeremiah 29:17</a>., where Jeremiah repeats the main idea of this threatening. </body></html>
