Under this figure is represented the desolation then coming upon that part of the world, of which Nebuchadnezzar, who had just began to reign and act, was to be the instrument; but this destroying sword would come from the hand of God. The desolations the sword should make in all these kingdoms, are represented by the consequences of excessive drinking. This may make us loathe the sin of drunkenness, that the consequences of it are used to set forth such a woful condition. Drunkenness deprives men of the use of their reason, makes men as mad. It takes from them the valuable blessing, health; and is a sin which is its own punishment. This may also make us dread the judgments of war. It soon fills a nation with confusion. They will refuse to take the cup at thy hand. They will not believe Jeremiah; but he must tell them it is the word of the Lord of hosts, and it is in vain for them to struggle against Almighty power. And if God's judgments begin with backsliding professors, let not the wicked expect to escape.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/25.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The mingled people - Either auxiliaries; or, rather, a constituent portion of the people of Egypt, who were not of pure blood.<p>Azzah - i. e., Gaza.<p>The remnant of Ashdod - A sentence which none but a contemporary writer could have used.

Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, and her kings, her princes, to make them a desolation and an astonishment, an hissing and a curse, as it is this day; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-19.htm">Jeremiah 25:19</a>.

For, behold, on the city upon which my name is named I begin to bring evil, and ye think to go unpunished?

The symbolical action imposed upon the prophet and, acc. to <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-17.htm">Jeremiah 25:17</a>, performed by him, serves to give emphasis to the threatening, and is therefore introduced by &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;; of which Graf erroneously affirms that it conveys a meaning only when <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-11.htm">Jeremiah 25:11-14</a> are omitted. Giving the peoples to drink of the cup of wrath is a figure not uncommon with the prophets for divine chastisements to be inflicted; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-12.htm">Jeremiah 49:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-7.htm">Jeremiah 51:7</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-17.htm">Isaiah 51:17</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-22.htm">Isaiah 51:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-31.htm">Ezekiel 23:31</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-15.htm">Habakkuk 2:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/60-5.htm">Psalm 60:5</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/75-9.htm">Psalm 75:9</a>, etc. The cup of wine which is wrath (fury). &#1492;&#1495;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; is an explanatory apposition to "wine." The wine with which the cup is filled is the wrath of God. &#1492;&#1494;&#1468;&#1488;&#1514; belongs to &#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;, which is fem., cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-32.htm">Ezekiel 23:32</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-34.htm">Ezekiel 23:34</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-21.htm">Lamentations 4:21</a>, whereas &#1488;&#1493;&#1514;&#1493; belongs to the wine which is wrath. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-16.htm">Jeremiah 25:16</a>, where the purpose with which the cup of wrath is to be presented is given, figure is exchanged for fact: they shall reel and become mad because of the sword which the Lord sends amidst them. To reel, sway to and fro, like drunken men. &#1492;&#1514;&#1492;&#1500;&#1500;, demean oneself insanely, be mad. The sword as a weapon of war stands often for war, and the thought is: war with its horrors will stupefy the peoples, so that they perish helpless and powerless. </body></html>
