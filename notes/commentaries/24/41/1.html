The month Tisri, which answers to part of our September, and part of October; according to the Jewish (b) chronicle, it was on the third day of this month, fifty two days after the destruction of the temple, that Gedaliah was slain; on which day a fast was kept by the Jews, after their return from captivity, on this occasion, called the fast of the seventh month, <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/7-5.htm">Zechariah 7:5</a>; though, according to Kimchi and Ben Melech, this event happened on the first day of the month, the beginning of the new year; but the fast was kept the day following, because the first day was a festival. Josephus (c) says it was thirty days after Johanan had departed from Gedaliah, having given him information of the conspiracy against him: <p>that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah the son of Elishama, of the seed royal: not the son of King Zedekiah, but one of the remoter branches of the family; whether Elishama his father was the same with Elishama the scribe is not certain, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-12.htm">Jeremiah 36:12</a>; the Jews have a tradition that he descended from Jerahmeel, whose wife, Atarah, was the daughter of a Heathen king, and was a proselyte, which Kimchi on the place relates; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-26.htm">1 Chronicles 2:26</a>; this circumstance, of his being akin to the royal family, is mentioned, to show that he envied the governor, and bore him a grudge for the honour he had, thinking that he had a better title to it, as being of the seed royal: <p>and the princes of the king, even ten men with him; some of the nobles of Zedekiah, who fled with him from Jerusalem, and deserted him when he was pursued and taken, and ever since had remained in the land; even ten of these joined with Ishmael in the conspiracy against Gedaliah, whom they bore an ill will to, for going over to the Chaldeans, and envying the power he was now possessed of. Some think these were ten ruffians, besides the princes of the king, since it may be rendered, "and the princes of the king, and ten men with him"; whom Ishmael and the princes took with them, as fit persons to assassinate the governor; and, besides, it is thought that eleven men were not sufficient to slay the Jews and the Chaldeans, as afterwards related; though it may be observed, that Ishmael, and these ten princes, did not come alone, as it can hardly be imagined they should, but with a number of servants and soldiers with them: these <p>came unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah: they had been with him before, to whom he had swore, and given them assurance of security; and they departed from him to their respective cities, seemingly satisfied; and now return, to pay him a friendly visit, as they pretended: <p>and there they did eat bread together at Mizpah; had a feast, and kept holiday together, it being a new moon, the first day of the month, and the beginning of the new year too; so that it was a high festival: and perhaps this season was fixed upon the rather, to cover their design, and to perpetrate it; pretending they came to keep the festival with him, and who, no doubt, liberally provided for them; for bread here is put for all provisions and accommodations. <p>(b) Seder Olam Rabba, c. 26. p. 76.

It seems strange, however, that the occurrences related in ch. 40. and 41. should have taken so short a time. Gratz calls in question the accuracy of the chronological statement. He quotes <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-24.htm">Ezekiel 33:24-29</a>, which shows that at least six months (according to his calculation) after the fall of Jerusalem Jewish fugitives still lingered on, and hoped to obtain possession of their fatherland, and points out that time was necessary for Gedaliah to erect a temple at Mizpah (see on ver. 5), for cities to arise out of their ruins, and for cultivation of the soil to be resumed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/40-10.htm">Jeremiah 40:10</a>). Besides, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-30.htm">Jeremiah 52:30</a>, a third deportation of Jews is mentioned. How can this be accounted for, if, only two months after the fall of Jerusalem, the remnant of the Jewish population emigrated under Johanan ben Kareah to Egypt? Gratz shows reason for thinking that this last deportation stands in close connection with Gedaliah's death, and that consequently the interval between this latter event and the fall of Jerusalem lasted, not two months, but five years. <span class="cmt_word">The son of Elishama.</span> Perhaps the Elishama men. tioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-12.htm">Jeremiah 36:12</a> as a secretary of state; or perhaps a son of David of that name (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-18.htm">2 Samuel 5:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-8.htm">1 Chronicles 3:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/14-7.htm">1 Chronicles 14:7</a>; "son" being taken here in a wider sense). <span class="cmt_word">And the princes of the king;</span> rather, <span class="accented">and</span> (<span class="accented">one of</span>) <span class="accented">the princes of the king. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Even ten men;</span> rather, <span class="accented">and</span> ten men.

These men, who had borne arms against the Chaldeans, were concerned for their safety when they returned into the country.

And as for me, behold, I shall remain at Mizpah to stand before the Chaldeans who will come to us," i.e., as lieutenant of the king of Babylon, to represent you before the Chaldean officers and armies, to maintain your rights and interests, so that you may be able to settle down where you choose, without anxiety, and cultivate the land.
