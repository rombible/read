The name of Chimham throws us back on the history of Barzillai in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-37.htm" title="Let your servant, I pray you, turn back again, that I may die in my own city, and be buried by the grave of my father and of my mother. But behold your servant Chimham; let him go over with my lord the king; and do to him what shall seem good to you.">2Samuel 19:37</a>. When the Gileadite chief pleaded his age as a ground for not accepting David’s invitation to live at his court, the offer was transferred to his son Chimham. On the king’s death-bed he was specially commended to the care of Solomon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-7.htm" title="But show kindness to the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be of those that eat at your table: for so they came to me when I fled because of Absalom your brother.">1Kings 2:7</a>). It seems probable that some part of David’s personal patrimony, as distinct from his royal domains, had been bestowed on him, and that he had perpetuated his gratitude by erecting a resting-place for travellers, probably enough identical with the “inn” of the Nativity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-7.htm" title="And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn.">Luke 2:7</a>). The plan of the fugitives under Johanan took them to Bethlehem, as lying on the road to Egypt, where they hoped to find a refuge both from the anarchy in which the land had been left by the death of Gedaliah, and from the severe punishment which the Chaldæans were likely to inflict, without too careful an inquiry into the question who had been guilty of it, for the murder of the ruler whom they had appointed. The mere fact of their having remained with Ishmael might be construed into circumstantial evidence of complicity. There they halt, and take counsel.<p><span class= "bld"><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/41.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>41:11-18 The success of villany must be short, and none can prosper who harden their hearts against God. And those justly lose comfort in real fears, who excuse themselves in sin by pretended fears.

The Masoretes read: Geruth-Chimham, the Khan or Caravanserai of Chimham, son of the rich Barzillai (marginal reference). The substitution is incapable now of proof or disproof, but it is possibly right. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/41.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17. dwelt&#8212;for a time, until they were ready for their journey to Egypt (Jer 42:1-22).<p>habitation to Chimham&#8212;his "caravanserai" close by Beth-lehem. David, in reward for Barzillai's loyalty, took Chimham his son under his patronage, and made over to him his own patrimony in the land of Beth-lehem. It was thence called the habitation of Chimham (Geruth-Chimham), though it reverted to David's heirs in the year of jubilee. "Caravanserais" (a compound Persian word, meaning "the house of a company of travellers") differ from our inns, in that there is no host to supply food, but each traveller must carry with him his own.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/41.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> When Johanan had (as was before expressed) recovered the Jews whom Ishmael had carried away as prisoners, he came and dwelt with them in the <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">habitation of Chimham.</span> Concerning this <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Chimham, </span> all that we read in Scripture is <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-37.htm" title="Let your servant, I pray you, turn back again, that I may die in my own city, and be buried by the grave of my father and of my mother.

David agreeth it, and promiseth to do for him whatsoever his father should desire on his behalf: possibly David, having an estate near thereabouts, might give a portion of it to him, which though it returned to the family of David in the year of jubilee, yet from Chimham’s house there might retain the name of the <span class="ital">habitation of Chimham</span>. Into those parts Johanan retired, with a further design to go into Egypt. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/41.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And they departed,.... From Mizpah, Johanan, and the captains of the forces, and all the people rescued from Ishmael: <p>and dwelt in the habitation of Chimham, which is by Bethlehem: so called perhaps from Chimham, the son of Barzillai the Gileadite, to whom David or Solomon might give this place to dwell in, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-37.htm">2 Samuel 19:37</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-7.htm">1 Kings 2:7</a>. The Targum is express for the former, calling it <p>"the habitation which David gave to Chimham, the son of Barzillai the Gileadite;'' <p>and as it was near Bethlehem, it might be a part of the patrimony which belonged to David, as a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite; which he might give to Chimham, out of respect to his father Barzillai, who showed kindness to him when he was obliged to flee from Absalom; which, though it returned to David's family in the year of jubilee, as all inheritances did, yet might continue to be called after the name of Chimham, in commemoration of the royal grant of it to him. Josephus (r) calls the name of the place Mandra. The reason why Johanan and those with him pitched on this place was, because it lay in the way <p>to go to enter into Egypt; where they had an inclination to go; having still a friendly regard to that people, and a confidence in them, as appears by some following chapters; and that they might be ready and at hand to flee thither, should the Chaldeans come against them, which they feared. <p>(r) Antiqu. l. 10. c. 9. sect. 5. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/41.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And they departed, and dwelt in the habitation of <span class="cverse3">{i}</span> Chimham, which is by Bethlehem, to go to enter into Egypt,</span><p>(i) Which place David of old had given to Chimham the son of Barzillai the Gileadite, 2Sa 19:38.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/41.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">17</span>. <span class="ital">Geruth Chimham</span>] For Chimham see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_samuel/19-37.htm" title="Let your servant, I pray you, turn back again, that I may die in my own city, and be buried by the grave of my father and of my mother.

Josephus and Aquila, however, appear to have read "by the hurdles of Chimham" - a very possible name for a locality in such a pastoral country. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/41.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div> - <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/41-11.htm">Jeremiah 41:11</a>. When Johanan and the rest of the captains heard of what had taken place in Mizpah, they marched out with all their men to fight Ishmael, and came on him at the great water at Gibeon, i.e., by the pool at Gibeon which is mentioned <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-13.htm">2 Samuel 2:13</a>, one of the large receptacles for water which are still found there; see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-13.htm">2 Samuel 2:13</a>. Gibeon, now called el Jib (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/9-3.htm">Joshua 9:3</a>), was situated only about two miles north from Mizpah; from which we may conclude that it was soon known what had happened, and the captains quickly assembled their men and marched after Ishmael. </body></html>
