He does not tell them of the murder; but assuming that they have heard of Gedaliah’s appointment as Satrap, invites them to come and see him, as being now within the bounds of his jurisdiction. The LXX., it may be noted, represents the pilgrims, and not Ishmael, as weeping.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/jeremiah/41.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/41-6.htm" title="And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went forth from Mizpah to meet them, weeping all along as he went: and it came to pass, as he met them, he said to them, Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam....">Jeremiah 41:6-8</a></span>. <span class="ital">And Ishmael went forth to meet them, weeping all along as he went </span>— As if he sympathized with them, and bewailed, as they did, the desolations of Jerusalem.

As death often meets men where they least expect it, we should continually search whether we are in such a state and frame of mind, as we would wish to be found in when called to appear before our Judge. Sometimes the ransom of a man's life is his riches. But those who think to bribe death, saying, Slay us not, for we have treasures in the field, will find themselves wretchedly deceived. This melancholy history warns us, never to be secure in this world.

Hearing there was such a number of men upon the road to Jerusalem, in such a habit, and upon such a design, he thought it advisable to go out and meet them, and stop them, and decoy them into the city, and there destroy them; lest, if they should have got any hint of what had been done by him, they should spread it, and raise the country upon him, before he had executed his whole design: <p>weeping all along as he went; pretending equal concern for the destruction of the land, city, and temple, as they had: <p>and it came to pass, as he met them; when he came up to them, and some discourse had passed between them: <p>he said unto them, come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam; as if he was alive, and for whom he had a great respect, and whose character was well known to these men; and thought that this would be an inducement to come along with him: this he said either to try them, whether they had heard anything upon the road of the death of him; or as an argument to come into the city, suggesting the governor would gladly receive, and liberally entertain them. This looks as if their design was not to come to Mizpah, but to go on their way to Jerusalem, had they not been met with by him, and had he not thus solicited them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/41.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went forth from Mizpah to meet them, weeping all along as he went: and it came to pass, as he met them, he said to them, Come <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam.</span><p>(e) For his death was kept secret, and he pretended that he lamented for the destruction of Jerusalem and the temple but later slew them when they seemed to favour Gedaliah.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/41.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">6</span>. <span class="ital">weeping all along</span>] so as to feign equal concern with them for the fate of the Temple, and thus put them off their guard.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Come to Gedaliah</span>] probably as governor, to whom therefore they should shew respect and offer greeting.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/41.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Weeping all along as he went.</span> To testify his sympathy with their grief.

The words "that were in the country" are neither a gloss, nor a thoughtless repetition by some scribe from <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/40-7.htm">Jeremiah 40:7</a> (as Hitzig and Graf suppose), but they are repeated for the purpose of distinguishing plainly between the captains with their men from the Jews who had returned out of Moab, Ammon, and Edom. &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;, "to strike the soul, life"  equals  to kill; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/37-21.htm">Genesis 37:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-6.htm">Deuteronomy 19:6</a>. What induced the king of Ammon to think of assassination - whether it was personal hostility towards Gedaliah, or the hope of destroying the only remaining support of the Jews, and thereby perhaps putting himself in possession of the country, - cannot be determined. That he employed Ishmael for the accomplishment of his purpose, may have been owing to the fact that this man had a personal envy of Gedaliah; for Ishmael, being sprung from the royal family (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/40-1.htm">Jeremiah 40:1</a>), probably could not endure being subordinate to Gedaliah. - The plot had become known, and Gedaliah was secretly informed of it by Johanan; but the former did not believe the rumour. Johanan then secretly offered to slay Ishmael, taking care that no one should know who did it, and urged compliance in the following terms: "Why should he slay thee, and all the Jews who have gathered themselves round thee be scattered, and the remnant of Judah perish?" Johanan thus called his attention to the evil consequences which would result to the remnant left in the land were he killed; but Gedaliah replied, "Do not this thing, for thou speakest a lie against Ishmael."
