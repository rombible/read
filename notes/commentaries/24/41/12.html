Gibeon, retaining its name with little alteration in the modern <span class= "ital">El-jibe, </span>lay about two miles from Mizpah; so that Ishmael must have halted on thinking himself safe against attack. On the east side of the hill on which it stands there are the remains of a large tank, about 120 feet by 100. It appears as the “pool of Gibeon” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-13.htm" title="And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out, and met together by the pool of Gibeon: and they sat down, the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool.">2Samuel 2:13</a>, as the scene of a conflict between Joab and Abner. Josephus (<span class= "ital">Ant. x.</span> 9-15) places the attack on Ishmael at “the pool in Hebron,” which is mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/4-12.htm" title="And David commanded his young men, and they slew them, and cut off their hands and their feet, and hanged them up over the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ishbosheth, and buried it in the sepulcher of Abner in Hebron.">2Samuel 4:12</a>. This, however, would hardly have been in Ishmael’s route to the country of the Ammonites.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/41.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>41:11-18 The success of villany must be short, and none can prosper who harden their hearts against God. And those justly lose comfort in real fears, who excuse themselves in sin by pretended fears.

These great waters were the same with the pool at Gibeon, where the servants of Ishbosheth and the servants of David met, and sat one on one side, and the other on the other; and where twelve young men on each side slew one another, and from thence called Helkathhazzurim, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-12.htm">2 Samuel 2:12</a>; and the Targum calls it <p>"the pool of many waters, which were in Gibeon.'' <p>Josephus (p) calls it a fountain in Hebron; which perhaps should be read Gibeon. <p>(p) Antiqu. l. 10. c. 9. sect. 5. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/41.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Then they took all the men, and went to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and found him by the great waters that are in Gibeon.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/41.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">12</span>. <span class="ital">Gibeon</span>] See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/28-1.htm" title="And it came to pass the same year, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fourth year, and in the fifth month, that Hananiah the son of Azur the prophet, which was of Gibeon, spoke to me in the house of the LORD, in the presence of the priests and of all the people, saying,">Jeremiah 28:1</a>.

But when they had entered the city, "Ishmael slew them into the midst of the pit" (which was there), i.e., killed them and cast their corpses into the pit. </body></html>
