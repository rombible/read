The god whom Babylon worshipped is, as before, thought of as sharing her downfall. He is made to disgorge his spoil, the vessels of the Temple of Jehovah that had been placed in his temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/5-2.htm" title="Belshazzar, whiles he tasted the wine, commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels which his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the temple which was in Jerusalem; that the king, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, might drink therein.">Daniel 5:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/1-7.htm" title="Also Cyrus the king brought forth the vessels of the house of the LORD, which Nebuchadnezzar had brought forth out of Jerusalem, and had put them in the house of his gods;">Ezra 1:7</a>).<p><span class= "bld">The wall of Babylon shall fall.</span>—The words, though they repeat the statement of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-15.htm" title="Shout against her round about: she has given her hand: her foundations are fallen, her walls are thrown down: for it is the vengeance of the LORD: take vengeance on her; as she has done, do to her.">Jeremiah 50:15</a>, have here a special significance. The two great walls of the city bore, as has been stated above, the names of Imgur-Bel (= Bel protects) and Nimetti-Bel (= the dwelling of Bel), and were thus specially consecrated to him as their tutelary deity (Oppert, <span class= "ital">Expédit. en Mésop., </span>i. p. 227; <span class= "ital">Records of the Past, </span>v. 124). The name of the last king of Babylon, Belshazzar, is a further indication of the reverence felt for him as the supreme object of worship.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/jeremiah/51.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-44.htm" title="And I will punish Bel in Babylon, and I will bring forth out of his mouth that which he has swallowed up: and the nations shall not flow together any more to him: yes, the wall of Babylon shall fall.">Jeremiah 51:44</a></span>. <span class="ital">And I will punish Bel in Babylon </span>— The heathen ascribed the honour of all their successes to their idols; and, upon any great victory, offered the best part of the spoils to their gods, and deposited them in their temples, as a grateful acknowledgment that the success was owing to their assistance. So Nebuchadnezzar, upon every victory over the Jews, carried away part of the furniture of the sanctuary and put it in the temple of his idol: see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-7.htm" title="Nebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of the house of the LORD to Babylon, and put them in his temple at Babylon.">2 Chronicles 36:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/1-2.htm" title="And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God: which he carried into the land of Shinar to the house of his god; and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god.">Daniel 1:2</a>. The restoring of the holy vessels to their right owner, and to their former use, is what is here foretold by <span class="ital">bringing forth out of his mouth that which he hath swallowed, </span>which was done by Cyrus, upon his proclamation for rebuilding the temple, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/1-7.htm" title="Also Cyrus the king brought forth the vessels of the house of the LORD, which Nebuchadnezzar had brought forth out of Jerusalem, and had put them in the house of his gods;">Ezra 1:7</a>. But the full accomplishment of this prediction Dr. Prideaux places in Xerxes’ demolishing the temple of Belus, and plundering it of its vast wealth, which, from Diodorus Siculus’s account of it, he computes to amount to twenty-one millions of our money: see his <span class="ital">Connect., </span>pp. 100, 101. <span class="ital">And the nations shall not flow together any more unto him </span>— There shall be no more costly presents brought by foreign nations unto the temple of Bel, as a compliment to that monarchy; just as, under the Roman empire, people that were conquered by it, sent golden crowns to Jupiter Capitolinus: see Lowth. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/51.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>51:1-58 The particulars of this prophecy are dispersed and interwoven, and the same things left and returned to again. Babylon is abundant in treasures, yet neither her waters nor her wealth shall secure her. Destruction comes when they did not think of it. Wherever we are, in the greatest depths, at the greatest distances, we are to remember the Lord our God; and in the times of the greatest fears and hopes, it is most needful to remember the Lord. The feeling excited by Babylon's fall is the same with the New Testament Babylon, Re 18:9,19. The ruin of all who support idolatry, infidelity, and superstition, is needful for the revival of true godliness; and the threatening prophecies of Scripture yield comfort in this view. The great seat of antichristian tyranny, idolatry, and superstition, the persecutor of true Christians, is as certainly doomed to destruction as ancient Babylon. Then will vast multitudes mourn for sin, and seek the Lord. Then will the lost sheep of the house of Israel be brought back to the fold of the good Shepherd, and stray no more. And the exact fulfilment of these ancient prophecies encourages us to faith in all the promises and prophecies of the sacred Scriptures.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/51.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The sacred vessels plundered from Jerusalem, and laid up in the very temple of Bel, should be restored; the men and women dragged from other lands to people the city, released; and its wall falling would show the insignificance to which it should be reduced. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/51.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>44.

The idol of the Babylonians, who had a temple in Babylon, where he was worshipped: the same is called Belus by Aelianus (g), Curtius (h), and Pausanias (i); perhaps the same Herodian (k) calls Belis, and says some take him to be Apollo; for more of him; see Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/46-1.htm">Isaiah 46:1</a>; and See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-2.htm">Jeremiah 50:2</a>; who was punished when his temple was demolished, and plundered of its wealth; this golden image of Belus was broke to pieces, and the gold of it carried away. The Targum is, <p>"I will visit or punish them that worship Bel in Babylon:'' <p>and I will bring forth out of his mouth that which he hath swallowed up; the rich offerings made to him when victories were obtained; all success being ascribed to him; and the spoils of conquered enemies, which were brought and laid up in his temple, particularly the vessels of the sanctuary at Jerusalem, which were deposited there; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-7.htm">2 Chronicles 36:7</a>; and which were restored by Cyrus, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/1-7.htm">Ezra 1:7</a>; which restoration of them greatly fulfilled this prophecy; and was a refunding of what was lodged with him, or a vomiting what he had swallowed up; compare with this the story of "Bel and the dragon": <p>and the nations shall not flow together any more unto him; either to worship him, or bring their presents to him, to ingratiate themselves with the king of Babylon: <p>yea, the wall of Babylon shall fall; which Bel was not able to defend; and therefore should be deserted by his worshippers. The Targum renders it in the plural, the walls of Babylon; of which; see Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-58.htm">Jeremiah 51:58</a>. Some think that not the wall of the city is here meant: but the temple of Bel, which was as a wall or fortress to the city; but now should fall, and be so no more; since it is not easy to give a reason why mention here should be made of the fall of the walls of the city; and seeing express mention is made of this afterwards. <p>(g) Var.

When, in their revelries, they will be heated over their prey, the Lord will prepare for them a banquet by which they shall become intoxicated, so that they sink down, exulting (i.e., staggering while they shout), into an eternal sleep of death. &#1495;&#1502;&#1468;&#1501;, "their heat," or heating, is the glow felt in gluttony and revelry, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/7-4.htm">Hosea 7:4</a>., not specially the result or effect of a drinking-bout; and the idea is not that, when they become heated through a banquet, then the Lord will prepare another one for them, but merely this, that in the midst of their revelry the Lord will prepare for them the meal they deserve, viz., give them the cup of wrath to drink, so that they may fall down intoxicated into eternal sleep, from which they no more awake. These words are certainly not a special prediction of the fact mentioned by Herodotus (i. 191) and Xenophon (Cyrop. vii. 23), that Cyrus took Babylon while the Babylonians were celebrating a feast and holding a banquet; they are merely a figurative dress given to the thought that the inhabitants of Babylon will be surprised by the judgment of death in the midst of their riotous enjoyment of the riches and treasure taken as spoil from the nations. In that fact, however, this utterance has received a fulfilment which manifestly confirms the infallibility of the word of God.
