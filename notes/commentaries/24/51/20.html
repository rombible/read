It is a question who is thus addressed—Babylon, or Cyrus as the destroyer of Babylon, or Israel. On the whole, the second seems the more probable answer. The “hammer of the whole earth” is broken by a mightier weapon than itself.

Babylon is abundant in treasures, yet neither her waters nor her wealth shall secure her. Destruction comes when they did not think of it. Wherever we are, in the greatest depths, at the greatest distances, we are to remember the Lord our God; and in the times of the greatest fears and hopes, it is most needful to remember the Lord. The feeling excited by Babylon's fall is the same with the New Testament Babylon, Re 18:9,19. The ruin of all who support idolatry, infidelity, and superstition, is needful for the revival of true godliness; and the threatening prophecies of Scripture yield comfort in this view. The great seat of antichristian tyranny, idolatry, and superstition, the persecutor of true Christians, is as certainly doomed to destruction as ancient Babylon. Then will vast multitudes mourn for sin, and seek the Lord. Then will the lost sheep of the house of Israel be brought back to the fold of the good Shepherd, and stray no more. And the exact fulfilment of these ancient prophecies encourages us to faith in all the promises and prophecies of the sacred Scriptures.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/51.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Or, Thou art my maul, weapons of war etc. The maul or mace <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/25-18.htm">Proverbs 25:18</a> only differs from the hammer <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-23.htm">Jeremiah 50:23</a> in being used for warlike purposes.<p>Omit the "will" in "will I break."

This is said by the Lord, either to Cyrus, as some, to which our version inclines, whom God made use of as an instrument to subdue nations and kingdoms, and destroy them; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-1.htm">Isaiah 45:1</a>; or rather Babylon, and the king of it, who had been the hammer of the earth, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-23.htm">Jeremiah 50:23</a>; as it may be rendered here, "thou art my hammer" (s); or, "hast been"; an instrument in his hands, of beating the nations to pieces, as stones by a hammer, and of destroying them, as by weapons of war: this, and what follows, are observed to show, that though Babylon had been used by the Lord for the destruction of others, it should not be secure from it itself, but should share the same fate; unless this is to be understood of the church of God, and kingdom of Christ, which in the latter day will break in pieces all the kingdoms of the earth, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-44.htm">Daniel 2:44</a>; which sense seems to have some countenance and confirmation from <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-24.htm">Jeremiah 51:24</a> "in your sight".

It had an ornamented head, which was sometimes very beautifully modelled, and generally a strap or string at the lower end, by which it could be grasped with greater firmness.” (Rawlinson’s <span class="ital">Anc. Mon</span>. I. p. 458.) For this figure, as applied to Babylon, cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-23.htm" title="How is the hammer of the whole earth cut asunder and broken! how is Babylon become a desolation among the nations!">Jeremiah 50:23</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">20–24</span>.

The future tenses can as well be rendered as presents, denoting what Babylon has hitherto been accustomed to do as the instrument of Jehovah. This view also harmonizes with <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-14.htm" title="The LORD of hosts has sworn by himself, saying, Surely I will fill you with men, as with caterpillars; and they shall lift up a shout against you.">Jeremiah 51:14</a></span> (while we omit 15–19; see note there), as well as with <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-25.htm" title="Behold, I am against you, O destroying mountain, said the LORD, which destroy all the earth: and I will stretch out my hand on you, and roll you down from the rocks, and will make you a burnt mountain.">Jeremiah 51:25</a></span> ff., where Babylon is certainly the subject.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/51.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 20-26.</span> - Israel is now to be Jehovah's hammer, striking down everything, even the Chaldean colossus.

The mace (for a picture of which, see Rawlinson, 'Ancient Monarchies,' 1:459) was a weapon constantly employed by the Assyrians and presumably by the Babylonian kings. The battle axe was much less frequently used. But who is addressed by this terrible title? The commentators are divided, some inclining to Babylon, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> because Babylon was the last person addressed (see ver. 14), and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> because a similar title was given to Babylon in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-23.htm">Jeremiah 50:23</a>: others to Israel, on the ground that the tenses are the same throughout the passage (vers. 20-24). The latter view is probably the best. How could Babylon be said to shatter her own "governors" and "viceroys" (for the prophet deliberately chooses the  Babylonian official names)? The argument from the context is not very weighty; for it is clear that the connection of the parts of this prophecy is very loose. We may assume, then, that ver. 20 begins a fresh paragraph, standing quite apart from that which precedes. The objection of Graf and Keil, is that Israel could not himself be styled a "mace," it being Israel's destiny to be delivered by others. But is not a very similar statement made of Israel in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-15.htm">Isaiah 41:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/149-7.htm">Psalm 149:7-9</a>?

Many take &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1488;&#1501; in the sense of &#1488;&#1501; &#1500;&#1488; in oaths: "truly, certainly." But this use of the expression is neither fully established, nor suitable in this connection. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-21.htm">2 Samuel 15:21</a> (the only passage that can be cited in its behalf), the meaning "only" gives good enough sense. Ewald (356, b) wrongly adduces <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/5-20.htm">2 Kings 5:20</a> in support of the above meaning, and three lines below he attributes the signification "although" to the passage now before us. Moreover, the asseveration, "Verily I have filled thee with men as with locusts, and they shall sing the Hedad over thee," can have a suitable meaning only if we take "I have filled thee" prophetically, and understand the filling with men as referring to the enemy, when the city has been reduced (Hitzig). But to fill a city with men hardly means quite the same as to put a host of enemies in it. &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; serves merely to introduce the oath, and &#1488;&#1501; means "although," - as, for instance, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-15.htm">Job 9:15</a>. The meaning is not, "When I filled thee with men, as with locusts, the only result was, that a more abundant wine-pressing could be obtained" (Ngelsbach), for this though is foreign to the context; the meaning rather is, "Even the countless multitudes of men in Babylon will not avail it" (Ewald), will not keep it from ruin. &#1492;&#1497;&#1491;&#1491;, the song sung at the pressing of wine, is, from the nature of the case, the battle-song; see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-30.htm">Jeremiah 25:30</a>. </body></html>
