Babylon is abundant in treasures, yet neither her waters nor her wealth shall secure her. Destruction comes when they did not think of it. Wherever we are, in the greatest depths, at the greatest distances, we are to remember the Lord our God; and in the times of the greatest fears and hopes, it is most needful to remember the Lord. The feeling excited by Babylon's fall is the same with the New Testament Babylon, Re 18:9,19. The ruin of all who support idolatry, infidelity, and superstition, is needful for the revival of true godliness; and the threatening prophecies of Scripture yield comfort in this view. The great seat of antichristian tyranny, idolatry, and superstition, the persecutor of true Christians, is as certainly doomed to destruction as ancient Babylon. Then will vast multitudes mourn for sin, and seek the Lord. Then will the lost sheep of the house of Israel be brought back to the fold of the good Shepherd, and stray no more. And the exact fulfilment of these ancient prophecies encourages us to faith in all the promises and prophecies of the sacred Scriptures.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/51.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Ararat, see the <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/8-4.htm">Genesis 8:4</a> note.

The setting up of standards, and blowing of trumpets, are military signs of the will of those princes or captains-general whose those standards are, and to whom those trumpets belong, that those soldiers who are under their command should gather themselves together to the places where those standards are set up, and those trumpets blown.

Not in Chaldea, but rather in any land; or in all the countries which belonged to Media and Persia; where Cyrus's standard is ordered to be set up, to gather soldiers together, and enlist in his service, in order to go with him in his expedition against Babylon: <p>blow the trumpet among the nations; for the same purpose, to call them to arms, to join the forces of Cyrus, and go with him into the land of Chaldea: <p>prepare the nations against her: animate them, stir up their spirits against her, and furnish them with armour to engage with her: or, "sanctify" (x) them; select a certain number out of them fit for such work: <p>call together the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashchenaz; the two former are generally thought to intend Armenia the greater, and the lesser; and the latter Ascania, a country in Phrygia; and certain it is that Cyrus first conquered these countries, and had many Armenians, Phrygians, and Cappadocians, in his army he brought against Babylon, as Xenophon (y) relates. The Targum is, declare <p>"against her to the kingdoms of the land of Kardu, the army of Armenia and Hadeb,'' <p>or Adiabene: <p>appoint a captain against her; over all these forces thus collected: Cyrus seems to be intended; unless the singular is put for the plural, and so intends a sufficient number of general officers of the army: <p>cause the horses to come up as the rough caterpillars; or "locusts" (z); which though generally smooth, yet some fire hairy and rough; to which the horses in Cyrus's army are compared, for their multitude, the shape of their heads, long manes, and manner of going, leaping, and prancing. So the Targum, <p>"they shall cause the horses to come up, leaping like the shining locust;'' <p>that is of a yellow colour, and shines like gold. So the word the Targum here uses is used by Jonathan in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/13-32.htm">Leviticus 13:32</a>; of hair yellow as gold, and here to be understood of hairy locusts: and, as Aelianus (a) says, there were locusts of a golden colour in Arabia. And such may be meant here by the Chaldee paraphrase, which well expresses their motion by leaping; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-5.htm">Joel 2:5</a>; and which agrees with that of horses. The word rendered "rough" has the signification of horror in it, such as makes the hair to stand upright; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-15.htm">Job 4:15</a>; and so some (b) render it here. And Bochart (c), from Alcamus, an Arabic writer, observes, that there is a sort of locusts which have two hairs upon their head, which are called their horn, which when erected may answer to this sense of the word; and he brings in the poet Claudian (d), as describing the locust by the top of its head, as very horrible and terrible; and that some locusts? have hair upon their heads seems manifest from <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/9-8.htm">Revelation 9:8</a>; though it may be, the reason why they are here represented as so dreadful and frightful may not be so much on account of their form, as for the terror they strike men with, when they come in great numbers, and make such terrible havoc of the fruits of the earth as they do; wherefore the above learned writer proposes to render the words, "as the horrible locusts" (e). <p>(x) "sanctificate", Piscator, Schmidt.

The whole passage is repeated verbatim, on till a change made in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-19.htm">Jeremiah 51:19</a>, where &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1488;&#1500; is omitted before &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1496; &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1514;&#1493;, and these words are connected with what precedes: "He is the former of all, and of the tribe which belongs to Him as His own property," i.e., Israel.

This the lxx have rendered &#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#787; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837;  &#787;&#x399;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#x3b2;, instead of &#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#787; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7; &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;  &#787;&#x399;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3b2;. Having done so, it was impossible for them to continue, &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9; &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;, because they could not predicate this of &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c2;, which they evidently did not take to mean God. And if they were to connect &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; with what followed, they were bound to omit the two words, for it would never have done to take together &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; &#1493;&#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1488;&#1500; &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1496; &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1514;&#1493;. They therefore simply omitted the troublesome words, and went on to translate: &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9; &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;. Cf. Ngelsbach. Jeremia u. Babylon, S. 94.)<p>As to the rest, see the exposition of <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-12.htm">Jeremiah 10:12-16</a>. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-20.htm">Jeremiah 51:20-26</a> the destruction of Babylon and its power is further carried out in two figures. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-20.htm">Jeremiah 51:20-24</a> Babylon is compared to a hammer, which God uses for the purpose of beating to pieces nations and kingdoms, with their forces and their inhabitants, but on which He will afterwards requite the evil done to Zion. &#1502;&#1508;&#1468;&#1509; is equivalent to &#1502;&#1508;&#1497;&#1509; ot tnelaviuqe si, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/25-18.htm">Proverbs 25:18</a>, one who breaks in pieces; hence a battle-hammer. Hitzig takes &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497; to be a singular, "formed thus in order to avoid an accumulation of i sounds (cf. &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1496;&#1497;&#1501; with &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1496;&#1497;)." This is possible, but neither necessary nor probable. The plural, "weapons of war," is added, because the battle-hammer is considered as including all weapons of war. By the hammer, Ewald understands "the true Israel;" Hitzig, Cyrus, the destroyer of Babylon; Ngelsbach, an ideal person. These three views are based on the fact that the operation performed by means of the hammer (breaking to pieces) is marked by perfects with &#1493; relative (&#1493;&#1504;&#1508;&#1468;&#1510;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;), which is also true of the retribution to be made on Babylon: from this it is inferred that the breaking with the hammer, as well as the retribution, is still future, and that the meaning is, "When I hammer in this way with thee, I will requite Babylon" (Hitzig); while Ewald concludes from nothing but the context that the words refer to Israel.<p>But none of these reasons is decisive, nor any of the three views tenable. The context gives decided support to the opinion that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-20.htm">Jeremiah 51:20</a>. it is Babylon that is addressed, just as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-13.htm">Jeremiah 51:13</a>. and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-25.htm">Jeremiah 51:25</a>; a further proof is, that as early as <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-23.htm">Jeremiah 50:23</a>, Babylon is called "the hammer of the whole earth." Only very weighty reasons, then, could induce us to refer the same figure, as used here, to another nation. The word &#1508;&#1468;&#1496;&#1468;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-23.htm">Jeremiah 50:23</a>), "hammer, smith's hammer" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-7.htm">Isaiah 41:7</a>), is not essentially different from &#1502;&#1508;&#1468;&#1509;, which is used here. The figure is quite inapplicable to Israel, because "Israel is certainly to be delivered through the destruction of Babylon, but is not to be himself the instrument of the destruction" (Graf). Finally, the employment of the perfect with w relative, both in connection with the shattering to pieces which God accomplishes with (by means of) Babylon, and also the retribution He will execute on Babylon, is explained by the fact, that just as, in prophetic vision, what Babylon does to the nations, and what happens to it, was not separated into two acts, distinct from one another, but appeared as one continuous whole, so also the work of Babylon as the instrument of destruction was not yet finished, but had only begun, and still continuing, was partly future, like the retribution which it was to receive for its offence against Zion; just as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-13.htm">Jeremiah 51:13</a> Babylon is viewed as then still in the active exercise of its power; and the purpose for which God employs it, as well as the fate that is to befall it, is presented together in something like this manner: "O Babylon, who art my hammer with which I break peoples and kingdoms in pieces, thee will I requite!" There is separate mention made of the instances of breaking, in a long enumeration, which becomes tedious through the constant repetition of the verb - something like the enumeration in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-35.htm">Jeremiah 50:35-38</a>, where, however, the constant repetition of &#1495;&#1512;&#1489; gives great emphasis to the address. First comes the general designation, nations and kingdoms; then military forces; then (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-25.htm">Jeremiah 51:25</a>) the inhabitants of the kingdoms, arranged, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-6.htm">Ezekiel 23:6</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-23.htm">Ezekiel 23:23</a>, according to sex, age, and class, labouring classes (shepherds, and husbandmen with their cattle); and lastly dignitaries, satraps and lieutenant-governors, &#1508;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514; &#1493;&#1468;&#1505;&#1490;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-6.htm">Ezekiel 23:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-23.htm">Ezekiel 23:23</a>. &#1508;&#1468;&#1495;&#1492; probably comes from the Zendic pavan (root pa), of which a dialectic form is pagvan, "upholder of government;" see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/1-1.htm">Haggai 1:1</a>. &#1505;&#1490;&#1503; corresponds to the &#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2; of the Athenians, "lieutenant-governor;" but it is not much that has hitherto been ascertained with regard to this office; see Delitzsch on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-25.htm">Isaiah 41:25</a> Clark's translation. On '&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-6.htm">Jeremiah 51:6</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-15.htm">Jeremiah 50:15</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-29.htm">Jeremiah 50:29</a>; "before your eyes," towards the end of this verse, belongs to this verb in the main clause.<p>This retribution is set forth in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-25.htm">Jeremiah 51:25</a>. under a new figure. Babylon is called the "mountain of destruction;" this name is immediately explained by the predicate, "that destroys the whole earth," brings destruction on it. The name &#1492;&#1512; &#1492;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1497;&#1514; is applied in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-13.htm">2 Kings 23:13</a> to the Mount of Olives, or its southern summit, the so-called mons offensionis vel scandali of ecclesiastical tradition, on which Solomon had erected idolatrous altars for his foreign wives; the name refers to the pernicious influence thereby exercised on the religious life of Israel. In this verse, "destruction" is used in a comprehensive sense of the physical and moral ruin which Babylon brought on the nations. Babylon is a "mountain," as being a powerful kingdom, supereminent above others; whether there is also a reference in the title to its lofty buildings (C. B. Michaelis) seems doubtful. "I will roll thee down from the rocks," de petris, in quarum fastigiis hucusque eminuisti. Non efferes te amplius super alia regna (C. B. Mich.). To this Hitzig adds, by way of explanation: "The summit of the mountain is sometimes changed into the very position occupied by the crater." From what follows, "I will make thee a mountain of burning," i.e., either a burning, or burnt, burnt-out mountain, modern expositors infer, with J. D. Michaelis, that the prophet has before his mind a volcano in active eruption, "for no other kind of mountains could devastate countries; it is just volcanoes which have been hollowed out by fire that fall in, or, it may be, tumble down into the valley below, scattering their constituent elements here and there; the stones of such mountains, too, are commonly so much broken and burnt, that they are of no use for building" (Hitzig). Of the above remarks this much is correct, that the words, "I will make thee a burning mountain," are founded on the conception of a volcano; any more extended application, however, of the figure to the whole verse is unwarranted. The clause, "I will roll thee down from the rocks," cannot possibly be applied to the action of a volcano in eruption (though Ngelsbach does so apply it), unless we are ready to impute to the prophet a false notion regarding the eruptions of volcanoes. By the eruption, a mountain is not loosened from the rock on which it rests, and hurled down into the valleys round about; it is only the heart of the mountain, or the rocks on which its summit rests, that seem to be vomited out of it. Besides, the notion that there is a representation of an active volcano in the first clauses of the verse, is disproved by the very fact that the mountain, Babylon, does not bring ruin on the earth, as one that is burning; it is not to become such until after it has been rolled down from the rocks on which it rests. The laying waste of the countries is not ascribed to the fire that issues from the mountain, but the mountain begins to burn only after it has been rolled down from its rocks. Babylon, as a kingdom and city, is called a mountain, because it mightily surpassed and held sway over them; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-14.htm">Isaiah 2:14</a>. It brings ruin on the whole earth by subjugation of the nations and devastation of the countries. The mountain rests on rocks, i.e., its power has a foundation as firm as a rock, until the Lord rolls it down from its height, and burns the strong mountain, making it like an extinct volcano, the stones of which, having been rendered vitreous by the fire, no longer furnish material that can be employed for the foundation of new buildings. "A corner-stone," etc., is explained by C. B. Michaelis, after the Chaldee, Kimchi, and others, to mean, "no one will appoint a king or a prince any more out of the stock of the Chaldeans." This is against the context, according to which the point treated of is, not the fall of the kingdom in or of Babylon, but the destruction of Babylon as a city and kingdom. Hitzig and Graf, accordingly, take the meaning to be this: Not a stone of the city will be used for a new building - no one will any more build for himself among their ruins, and out of the material there. The corner-stone and the foundation (it is further asserted) are mentioned by way of example, not because particularly large and good stones are needed for these parts, but because every house begins with them. But though the following clause, "thou shalt be an everlasting desolation," contains this idea, yet this interpretation neither exhausts nor gives a generally correct view of the meaning of the words, "no one will take from thee a corner-stone or a foundation-stone." The burning of the mountain signifies not merely that Babylon was to be burned to ashes, but that her sway over the world was to be quite at an end; this was only to come about when the city was burnt. When no stone of any value for a new building is to be left after this conflagration, this is equivalent to saying that nothing will be left of the empire that has been destroyed, which would be of any use in the foundation of another state. The last clause also ("for thou shalt be," etc.) refers to more than the destruction of the city of Babylon. This is seen even in the fundamental passage, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-12.htm">Jeremiah 25:12</a>, where the same threat is uttered against the land of the Chaldeans. </body></html>
