Babylon is abundant in treasures, yet neither her waters nor her wealth shall secure her. Destruction comes when they did not think of it. Wherever we are, in the greatest depths, at the greatest distances, we are to remember the Lord our God; and in the times of the greatest fears and hopes, it is most needful to remember the Lord. The feeling excited by Babylon's fall is the same with the New Testament Babylon, Re 18:9,19. The ruin of all who support idolatry, infidelity, and superstition, is needful for the revival of true godliness; and the threatening prophecies of Scripture yield comfort in this view. The great seat of antichristian tyranny, idolatry, and superstition, the persecutor of true Christians, is as certainly doomed to destruction as ancient Babylon. Then will vast multitudes mourn for sin, and seek the Lord. Then will the lost sheep of the house of Israel be brought back to the fold of the good Shepherd, and stray no more. And the exact fulfilment of these ancient prophecies encourages us to faith in all the promises and prophecies of the sacred Scriptures.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/51.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Literally, "Nebuchadrezzar ... hath devoured us, hath crushed us, he hath set as aside as an empty vessel, he hath swallowed as like a crocodile, he hath filled his maw with my delicacies <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/49-20.htm">Genesis 49:20</a>, he hath cast us out.

Zion thus calls her kinsmen (Ro 11:14) slain throughout the country or carried captives to Babylon [Grotius]. Or, as "my blood" follows, it and "my flesh" constitute the whole man: Zion, in its totality, its citizens and all its substance, have been a prey to Babylon's violence (Ps 137:8).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/51.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The words are either a prayer, or a prediction of God’s vengeance upon Babylon; so <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/137-7.htm" title="Remember, O LORD, the children of Edom in the day of Jerusalem; who said, Raze it, raze it, even to the foundation thereof.">Psalm 137:7</a>,8</span>.

The mighty men of Babylon cease to offer resistance, and withdraw dispirited, like women, into inaccessible places, while the enemy sets fire to the houses, breaks the bars, and captures the city. The prophet views all this in spirit as already present, and depicts in lively colours the attack on the city and its capture. Hence the historic tenses, &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1506;&#1513;&#1473;, &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1500;, &#1495;&#1491;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;, etc. &#1511;&#1502;&#1492; is used of the permanence, i.e., of the realization of the divine counsels, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-23.htm">Jeremiah 44:23</a>. On the singular, see Ewald, 317, a. "To make the land," etc., as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-7.htm">Jeremiah 4:7</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-16.htm">Jeremiah 18:16</a>, etc. "They sit (have taken up their position) in the strongholds" (Mountain fastnesses), i.e., in inaccessible places; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-16.htm">1 Samuel 13:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-14.htm">2 Samuel 23:14</a>. &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1492; is but to be regarded as a Kal form from &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;; on its derivation from &#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1514;, see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-17.htm">Isaiah 41:17</a>. "They have become women;" cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-37.htm">Jeremiah 50:37</a>. The subject of the verb &#1492;&#1510;&#1468;&#1497;&#1506;&#1514;&#1493;&#1468; is the enemy, who set fire to the dwellings in Babylon. "Runner runs against runner," i.e., from opposite sides of the city there come messengers, who meet each other running to tell the king in his castle that the city is taken. The king is therefore (as Graf correctly remarks against Hitzig) not to be thought of as living outside of the city, for "in this case &#1500;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488;&#1514; would have no meaning," but as living in the royal castle, which was situated in the middle of the city, on the Euphrates. Inasmuch as the city is taken "from the end" (&#1502;&#1511;&#1468;&#1510;&#1492;), i.e., on all sides, the messengers who bring the news to the king's fortress must meet each other. </body></html>
