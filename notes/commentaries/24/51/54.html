Babylon is abundant in treasures, yet neither her waters nor her wealth shall secure her. Destruction comes when they did not think of it. Wherever we are, in the greatest depths, at the greatest distances, we are to remember the Lord our God; and in the times of the greatest fears and hopes, it is most needful to remember the Lord. The feeling excited by Babylon's fall is the same with the New Testament Babylon, Re 18:9,19. The ruin of all who support idolatry, infidelity, and superstition, is needful for the revival of true godliness; and the threatening prophecies of Scripture yield comfort in this view. The great seat of antichristian tyranny, idolatry, and superstition, the persecutor of true Christians, is as certainly doomed to destruction as ancient Babylon. Then will vast multitudes mourn for sin, and seek the Lord. Then will the lost sheep of the house of Israel be brought back to the fold of the good Shepherd, and stray no more. And the exact fulfilment of these ancient prophecies encourages us to faith in all the promises and prophecies of the sacred Scriptures.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/51.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A cry - i. e., the war-cry. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/51.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>53.

The second part of <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-48.htm">Jeremiah 51:48</a>, "for the destroyers shall come from the north," is logically connected with <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-47.htm">Jeremiah 51:47</a>, to which <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-48.htm">Jeremiah 51:48</a> is to be taken as subordinate, in the sense, "over which heaven and earth rejoice." On <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-48.htm">Jeremiah 51:48</a>, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-3.htm">Jeremiah 50:3</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-9.htm">Jeremiah 50:9</a>,<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-41.htm">Jeremiah 50:41</a>. Both parts of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-49.htm">Jeremiah 51:49</a> are placed in mutual relation by &#1490;&#1468;&#1501;&#1470;&#1490;&#1468;&#1501;. These two particles, thus used, signify "as well as," "not only...but also," or "as...so." Ewald, Hitzig, and Graf have quite missed the meaning of both clauses, since they take &#1495;&#1500;&#1500;&#1497; &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1488;&#1500; as a vocative, and render the whole thus: "Not only must Babylon fall, O ye slain ones of Israel, but slain ones of the whole earth have fallen on the side of Babylon (or through Babylon)." This view of the expression "slain ones of Israel" cannot be established, either from grammatical considerations or from a regard to the meaning of the whole. Not only is there no occasion for a direct address to the slain ones of Israel; but by such a view of the expression, the antithesis indicated by &#1490;&#1468;&#1502;&#1512;&#1512;&#1512;&#1490;&#1468;&#1501;, between "the slain ones of Israel" and "the slain ones of the earth," is thereby destroyed. Viewed grammatically, "the slain ones of Israel" can only be the subject dependent on the inf. &#1500;&#1504;&#1508;&#1468;&#1500;: "the fall of the slain ones of Israel." Kimchi has long ago hit the meaning in the explanation, &#1490;&#1468;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468;&#1489;&#1500; &#1492;&#1497;&#1514;&#1492; &#1505;&#1489;&#1468;&#1514; &#1500;&#1504;&#1508;&#1468;&#1500;, "as Babylon was the cause of the slain ones of Israel falling." Similarly Jerome: et quomodo fecit Babylon ut caderent occisi ex Israel. This paraphrase may be vindicated on grammatical grounds, for the inf. constr. with &#1500;, with or without &#1492;&#1497;&#1492;, is used to express that on which one is engaged, or what one is on the point of doing; cf. Gesenius, 132, 3, Rem. 1. In this meaning, &#1500;&#1504;&#1508;&#1468;&#1500; stands here without &#1492;&#1497;&#1492;: "Just as Babylon was concerned in making the slain ones of Israel fall;" or better: "Just as Babylon was intent on the fall of slain ones in Israel, so also there fall because of Babylon (prop. dative, for Babylon) slain ones of all the earth;" because there are to be found, in the capital of the empire, people from all quarters of the world, who are slain when Babylon is conquered. The perf. &#1504;&#1508;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468; is prophetic, like &#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1491;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-47.htm">Jeremiah 51:47</a>. </body></html>
