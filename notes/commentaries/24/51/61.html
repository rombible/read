The verb for “read” implies reading aloud. Saraiah was to read the prophecy to those whom it concerned, probably to a chosen few among his own countrymen. The idea that it was to be read to the Babylonians is in the highest degree improbable.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/51.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>51:59-64 This prophecy is sent to Babylon, to the captives there, by Seraiah, who is to read it to his countrymen in captivity. Let them with faith see the end of these threatening powers, and comfort themselves herewith. When we see what this world is, how glittering its shows, and how flattering its proposals, let us read in the book of the Lord that it shall shortly be desolate. The book must be thrown into the river Euphrates. The fall of the New Testament Babylon is thus represented, Re 18:21. Those that sink under the weight of God's wrath and curse, sink for ever. Babylon, and every antichrist, will soon sink and rise no more for ever. Let us hope in God's word, and quietly wait for his salvation; then we shall see, but shall not share, the destruction of the wicked.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/51.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And shalt see, and shalt read - Or, then see that thou read etc.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/51.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>61. read&#8212;not in public, for the Chaldeans would not have understood Hebrew; but in private, as is to be inferred from his addressing himself altogether to God (Jer 51:62) [Calvin].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/51.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Not to the Chaldeans, nor possibly is it to be understood of a mere private reading of them to himself, but to the Jews that were in Babylon, acquainting them with what God had spoken against Babylon by the prophet. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/51.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Jeremiah said to Seraiah,.... At the time he delivered the copy to him: <p>when thou comest to Babylon; or art come to Babylon, to the city of Babylon, and to the captive Jews there: <p>and shalt see them; the captives; or rather the great and populous city of Babylon, its high walls, gates, and towers, whose destruction is foretold in this book, and which might seem incredible. Abarbinel interprets it of his looking into the book given him; which he thinks was not to be opened and looked into till he came to Babylon: <p>and shalt read all these words; not before the king of Babylon and his princes, and yet not privately to himself; but in some proper place, in the presence of the captive Jews, or the chief of them, convened for that purpose. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/51.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And Jeremiah said to Seraiah, When thou comest to Babylon, and shalt see, and shalt read all these words;</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/51.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">61, 62</span>. <span class="ital">then see … and say</span>] From “and say” to the end of <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-62.htm" title="Then shall you say, O LORD, you have spoken against this place, to cut it off, that none shall remain in it, neither man nor beast, but that it shall be desolate for ever.">Jeremiah 51:62</a></span> is probably the addition of a compiler; it is a needless interruption to the close connexion of the preceding words with <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-63.htm" title="And it shall be, when you have made an end of reading this book, that you shall bind a stone to it, and cast it into the middle of Euphrates:">Jeremiah 51:63</a></span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/51.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 61.</span> - (Comp. 50:3; 51:26.) <span class="cmt_word">And shalt see, and shalt read;</span> rather, <span class="accented">See that thou read.</span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/51.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The prophet in the spirit sees these destroyers as already come. A cry of anguish proceeds from Babylon, and great destruction; cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-22.htm">Jeremiah 50:22</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-46.htm">Jeremiah 50:46</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-3.htm">Jeremiah 48:3</a>.

"For there comes on Babylon a destroyer, so that her heroes are made prisoners, and her bows (by synecdoche for weapons) broken in pieces." The Piel &#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1514;&#1492; has here an intransitive sense, "to break or shiver into pieces," like &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1495;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-8.htm">Isaiah 48:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-11.htm">Isaiah 60:11</a>. This must take place, for Jahveh is a God of retribution; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-24.htm">Jeremiah 51:24</a>. This retribution He will execute in such a way as to make the princes, wise men, rulers, and heroes of Babylon sink down into an eternal sleep, by presenting to them the cup of wrath.
