They have done what they could, but all was in vain. The guilt could not be washed away, the punishment could not be averted. The “judgment” is measureless as is the distance from heaven to earth. This is also reproduced in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/18-5.htm" title="For her sins have reached to heaven, and God has remembered her iniquities.">Revelation 18:5</a>. For the phrase, as applied to Nebuchadnezzar, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-20.htm" title="The tree that you saw, which grew, and was strong, whose height reached to the heaven, and the sight thereof to all the earth;">Daniel 4:20</a>. Possibly there may be an allusive reference to the tower of Babel, “reaching unto heaven,” as the type of Babylonian greatness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/11-4.htm" title="And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach to heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad on the face of the whole earth.">Genesis 11:4</a>).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/51.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>51:1-58 The particulars of this prophecy are dispersed and interwoven, and the same things left and returned to again. Babylon is abundant in treasures, yet neither her waters nor her wealth shall secure her. Destruction comes when they did not think of it. Wherever we are, in the greatest depths, at the greatest distances, we are to remember the Lord our God; and in the times of the greatest fears and hopes, it is most needful to remember the Lord. The feeling excited by Babylon's fall is the same with the New Testament Babylon, Re 18:9,19. The ruin of all who support idolatry, infidelity, and superstition, is needful for the revival of true godliness; and the threatening prophecies of Scripture yield comfort in this view. The great seat of antichristian tyranny, idolatry, and superstition, the persecutor of true Christians, is as certainly doomed to destruction as ancient Babylon. Then will vast multitudes mourn for sin, and seek the Lord. Then will the lost sheep of the house of Israel be brought back to the fold of the good Shepherd, and stray no more. And the exact fulfilment of these ancient prophecies encourages us to faith in all the promises and prophecies of the sacred Scriptures.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/51.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Omit would.

These are either the words of the friends of Babylon of her auxiliaries and allies, who did all they could to defend her against the Persians, but to no purpose; it was not in their power to help her; the time of her destruction was come, and there was no avoiding it; or of the prophets and good people of the Jews that were in Babylon, that took pains to convince, the inhabitants of Babylon of their idolatries and other sins, and reform them, that so they might not be their ruin; but all instructions and admonitions were in vain; in like manner many worthy reformers have laboured much to reclaim mystical Babylon, or the church of Rome, from her errors and idolatries; but still she retains them; wherefore it follows: <p>forsake her, and let us go everyone into his own country; so said the auxiliary troops that were in the service of the king of Babylon; since we can do him no good, and are ourselves posed to danger, let us desert him, and provide for our safety by hastening to our own country as fast as we can; this was really the case after the first battle of Cyrus with the Babylonians, in which their king Neriglissar was slain: Croesus and the rest of the allies, seeing their case so distressed and helpless, left them to shift for themselves, and fled by night (h): or so might the Jews say when the city was taken, and they were delivered out of the hands of their oppressors; and so will the people of God say, who shall be called out of mystical Babylon just before its ruin, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/18-4.htm">Revelation 18:4</a>; <p>for her judgment reacheth unto heaven, and is lifted up even to the skies: that is, her sins were so many, that they reached even to heaven; and were taken notice of by God that dwelleth there; and were the cause of judgment or punishment being from thence inflicted on her, which was unavoidable, being the decree of heaven, and the just demerit of her sin; and therefore no help could be afforded her; nor was there any safety by being in her; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/18-5.htm">Revelation 18:5</a>. <p>(h) Xenophon, Cyropaedia l. 4. c. 2.<a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/51.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">We would have healed Babylon, but she is not healed: forsake her, and let <span class="cverse3">{f}</span> us go every one into his own country: for her judgment reacheth to heaven, and is lifted <i>even</i> to the skies.</span><p>(f) Thus the people of God exhort one another to go to Zion and praise God.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/51.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">9</span>. <span class="ital">We would have healed, etc</span>.] As the <span class="ital">v</span>. cannot be taken to express Jewish sentiment, we must suppose it to be put in the mouth of the nations, intoxicated by their share in the splendour of Babylon, and so lamenting its fall and desiring to restore its fortunes.

In the first half of the verse the reading is doubtful, since the Masoretes would have the second &#1497;&#1491;&#1512;&#1491; (Qeri) expunged, probably because (as Bttcher, N. Aehrenl. ii. S. 166, supposes) they considered it merely a repetition. The meaning is not thereby changed. According to the Qeri, we would require to translate, "against him who bends the bow, may there be, or come, one who bends his bow;" according to the Kethib, "against him who bends the bow, may he who bends his bow bend it." As to &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1497;&#1491;&#1512;&#1498; with &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; omitted, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-12.htm">1 Chronicles 15:12</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-4.htm">2 Chronicles 1:4</a>, and Ewald, 333, b. &#1497;&#1514;&#1506;&#1500; &#1489;&#1468;&#1505;' stands in apposition to &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1497;&#1491;&#1512;&#1498; ; &#1497;&#1514;&#1506;&#1500; is the Hithpael from &#1506;&#1500;&#1492;, and means to raise oneself: it is to be taken as the shortened form of the imperfect passive; cf. Gesenius, 128, Rem. 2. Certainly, the Hithpael of &#1506;&#1500;&#1492; occurs nowhere else, but it is quite appropriate here; so that it is unnecessary, with Hitzig, to adduce, for explanation, the Arabic tl', to stretch the head out of anything, or, with Ewald, to derive the form from the Aramaic &#1506;&#1500;&#1500;, Arabic gl, to thrust in. Neither is there any foundation for the remark, that the abbreviated form of the imperfect would be admissible only if &#1488;&#1500; were found instead of &#1488;&#1500;. Indeed, the Syriac, Targum, and Vulgate have actually read and rendered from &#1488;&#1500;, which several codices also present, "Let him not bend his bow, nor stretch himself in his coat of mail." But by this reading the first half of the verse is put in contradiction to the second; and this contradiction is not removed by the supposition of J. D. Michaelis and Hitzig, who refer these clauses to the Chaldeans, and find the thought expressed in them, that the Chaldeans, through loss of courage, cannot set themselves for defence. For, in that case, we would be obliged, with Hitzig, to explain as spurious the words that follow, "and spare ye not her young men;" but for this there is no valid reason. As to &#1492;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-21.htm">Jeremiah 50:21</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-26.htm">Jeremiah 50:26</a>.

The suffix in "her streets" refers to Babylon. </body></html>
