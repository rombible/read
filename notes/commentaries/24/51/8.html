This is spoken ironically, implying her ruin to be irrecoverable. <span class="ital">We would have healed Babylon, but she is not healed — </span>Some think “this is spoken in the name of God’s prophets, and the other witnesses of his truth, importing that they had sufficiently testified against her errors and idolatries, but that she was irreclaimable; and therefore that it was time for all the lovers of truth to depart out of her, lest they should be involved in her punishments.” But it is more probable that the nations which had been subject to Babylon, and were her allies, are the speakers here, declaring that they had assisted her to the utmost of their power, and had endeavoured to support her sinking cause, but all in vain, nothing which they had done or could do availing to save her from destruction. And therefore, as her case was desperate, it was time for them to shift for themselves, and to leave Babylon to its fate, since it seemed to be the decree of Heaven that it should fall. Those who have written of the downfall of Babylon relate, that when its affairs seemed to grow desperate, it was deserted by most of its allies, few or none of them persevering to lend it any assistance. <span class="ital">Her judgment reacheth unto heaven </span>— That is, her sin, bringing down God’s judgments; <span class="ital">and is lifted up even to the skies </span>— It comes to the ears of even God himself, and engages him to take account of it and punish her.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/51.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>51:1-58 The particulars of this prophecy are dispersed and interwoven, and the same things left and returned to again. Babylon is abundant in treasures, yet neither her waters nor her wealth shall secure her. Destruction comes when they did not think of it. Wherever we are, in the greatest depths, at the greatest distances, we are to remember the Lord our God; and in the times of the greatest fears and hopes, it is most needful to remember the Lord. The feeling excited by Babylon's fall is the same with the New Testament Babylon, Re 18:9,19. The ruin of all who support idolatry, infidelity, and superstition, is needful for the revival of true godliness; and the threatening prophecies of Scripture yield comfort in this view. The great seat of antichristian tyranny, idolatry, and superstition, the persecutor of true Christians, is as certainly doomed to destruction as ancient Babylon. Then will vast multitudes mourn for sin, and seek the Lord. Then will the lost sheep of the house of Israel be brought back to the fold of the good Shepherd, and stray no more. And the exact fulfilment of these ancient prophecies encourages us to faith in all the promises and prophecies of the sacred Scriptures.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/51.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Destroyed - literally, broken, as was the hammer <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-23.htm">Jeremiah 50:23</a>.

Or "broken" (g); even into shivers, as a cup is; for when it had been used to answer the purposes designed by the Lord, he let it fall cut of his hands at once, and it was broken; or rather he dashed it in pieces, as a potter's vessel. The destruction of Babylon was brought about in a very short time, considering the strength of it; and was unexpected by the inhabitants of it, and by the nations round about; but, when it was come, it was irreparable: so the destruction of mystical Babylon will be in one hour, and it will be an utter and entire destruction, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/18-8.htm">Revelation 18:8</a>; <p>howl for her; as the inhabitants of Babylon, and her friends and allies that loved her, did no doubt; and as the kings and merchants of the earth, and others, will howl for spiritual Babylon, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/18-9.htm">Revelation 18:9</a>; <p>take balm for her pain, if so be she may be healed: or balsam; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-11.htm">Jeremiah 46:11</a>; which is said by way of derision and mockery, as Kimchi and Abarbinel observe; or in an ironical and sarcastic manner; suggesting, that, let what means soever be made use of, her wound was incurable, her ruin inevitable, and her case irrecoverable. <p>(g) "confracta est", Schmidt; "fracta est", Cocceius; "contrita est", Piscator. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/51.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Babylon is suddenly fallen and destroyed: howl for her; take balm for her pain, if so be she may be healed.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/51.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">8</span>. <span class="ital">take balm</span>] See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-11.htm" title="Go up into Gilead, and take balm, O virgin, the daughter of Egypt: in vain shall you use many medicines; for you shall not be cured.">Jeremiah 46:11</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/51.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Destroyed</span>. The Hebrew, more forcibly, has "is broken." The Authorized Version wished, perhaps, to avoid the objection that a golden cup could not, properly speaking, be broken. But if we once begin to harmonize the language of Hebrew poetry, we shall have no end. It is not the cup which falls, but the state, considered as a house (the "breach" of God's people is constantly referred to; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/60-2.htm">Psalm 60:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-26.htm">Isaiah 30:26</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Howl for her</span>. Sympathetic bystanders are dramatically appealed to. From the next  verse it would seem that they are the various foreigners who, whether by choice or force, have been resident in Babylon, and who have acquired an interest in her fate. Hitzig thinks the foreign mercenaries (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-37.htm">Jeremiah 50:37</a>) or allies are specially referred to. <span class="cmt_word">Take balm for her pain</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-22.htm">Jeremiah 8:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-11.htm">Jeremiah 46:11</a>). The images of fracture and wound are combined, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-26.htm">Isaiah 30:26</a>. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/51.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-1.htm">Jeremiah 51:1-4</a>, the terrible character of the hostile nation is further described. Against Babylon and the inhabitants of Chaldea, God stirs up the "spirit of a destroyer," viz., a savage nation that will massacre the Chaldeans without pity. &#1500;&#1489; , lit., "the heart of mine adversaries," is the word &#1499;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, changed, according to the canon Atbash (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-26.htm">Jeremiah 25:26</a>), for the purpose of obtaining the important meaning that Chaldea is the centre of God's enemies. This explanation of the name involves the thought that all enmity against God the Lord culminates in Babylon; on the basis of this representation Babylon is called, <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/17-5.htm">Revelation 17:5</a>, "the mother of harlots and abominations of the earth." &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1497;&#1514; does not mean &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1; &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; (lxx), ventum pestilentem (Vulgate), "a sharp wind" (Luther), nor, as it is usually translated, "a destroying wind;" for &#1492;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512; &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; is nowhere used of the rousing of a wind, but everywhere means "to rouse the spirit of any one," to stir him up to an undertaking; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/1-14.htm">Haggai 1:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-26.htm">1 Chronicles 5:26</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-16.htm">2 Chronicles 21:16</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-22.htm">2 Chronicles 36:22</a>. Jeremiah also employs it thus in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-11.htm">Jeremiah 51:11</a>, and this meaning is quite suitable here also. &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1497;&#1514; is a substantive, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-7.htm">Jeremiah 4:7</a> : "the spirit of a destroyer." The figure of winnowing, which follows in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-2.htm">Jeremiah 51:2</a>, does not by any means necessarily require the meaning "wind," because the figure contained in the word &#1494;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492; was first called forth by the employment of &#1494;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, "strangers"  equals  barbarians. The sending of the &#1494;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; to Babylon has no connection with the figure of the wind, and it even remains a question whether &#1494;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492; really means here to winnow, because the word is often used of the scattering of a nation, without any reference to the figure of winnowing; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-33.htm">Leviticus 26:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-10.htm">Ezekiel 5:10</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-15.htm">Ezekiel 12:15</a>, etc., also <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-32.htm">Jeremiah 49:32</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-36.htm">Jeremiah 49:36</a>. However, this thought is suggested by what follows, "they empty her hand," although the clause which assigns the reason, "because they are against her round about" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-17.htm">Jeremiah 4:17</a>), does not correspond with this figure, but merely declares that the enemies which attack Babylon on every side disperse its inhabitants and empty the land.</body></html>
