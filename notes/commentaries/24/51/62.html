Let them with faith see the end of these threatening powers, and comfort themselves herewith. When we see what this world is, how glittering its shows, and how flattering its proposals, let us read in the book of the Lord that it shall shortly be desolate. The book must be thrown into the river Euphrates. The fall of the New Testament Babylon is thus represented, Re 18:21. Those that sink under the weight of God's wrath and curse, sink for ever. Babylon, and every antichrist, will soon sink and rise no more for ever. Let us hope in God's word, and quietly wait for his salvation; then we shall see, but shall not share, the destruction of the wicked.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/51.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The sinking of the scroll was not for the purpose of destroying it, but was a symbolic act (compare the marginal reference); and the binding of a stone to it signified the certainty of the hasty ruin of the city.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/51.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>62.

A cry of anguish proceeds from Babylon, and great destruction; cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-22.htm">Jeremiah 50:22</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-46.htm">Jeremiah 50:46</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-3.htm">Jeremiah 48:3</a>.

"Their waves," i.e., the surging masses of the conquering army, roar like many or great waters; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/17-12.htm">Isaiah 17:12</a>. &#1504;&#1514;&#1468;&#1503; , lit., "there is given" (i.e., there sounds) "the noise of their voice," i.e., of the roaring of their waves. "For there comes on Babylon a destroyer, so that her heroes are made prisoners, and her bows (by synecdoche for weapons) broken in pieces." The Piel &#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1514;&#1492; has here an intransitive sense, "to break or shiver into pieces," like &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1495;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-8.htm">Isaiah 48:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-11.htm">Isaiah 60:11</a>. This must take place, for Jahveh is a God of retribution; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-24.htm">Jeremiah 51:24</a>. This retribution He will execute in such a way as to make the princes, wise men, rulers, and heroes of Babylon sink down into an eternal sleep, by presenting to them the cup of wrath.
