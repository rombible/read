The proper work and office of Christ, as Mediator, is to draw near unto God, for us, as the High Priest of our profession. His own undertaking, in compliance with his Father's will, and in compassion to fallen man, engaged him. Jesus Christ was, in all this, truly wonderful. They shall be taken again into covenant with the Lord, according to the covenant made with their fathers. I will be your God: it is his good-will to us, which is the summary of that part of the covenant. The wrath of God against the wicked is very terrible, like a whirlwind. The purposes of his wrath, as well as the purposes of his love, will all be fulfilled. God will comfort all that turn to him; but those who approach him must have their hearts engaged to do it with reverence, devotion, and faith.

That is, the wrath of God, which like a whirlwind comes suddenly, with great force and strength, and carries all before it; there is no withstanding it; such is the wrath of God against the enemies of his church and people: <p>a continuing whirlwind; whirlwinds, as they come suddenly, are generally soon over; but this will continue very boisterous and terrible, until it has done all the execution designed by it: <p>it shall fall with pain upon the head of the wicked; according to some, the wicked Jews, that do not repent and turn to the Lord; but rather the wicked of the nations, as Jarchi; not the Gentiles in general, as distinguished from the Jews, which is his sense, but the antichristian states; for the ruin of antichrist, and the conversion of the Jews, will be much about the same time; and the vials of God's wrath, which will be poured upon them, and fall upon their heads, will give them much pain, both in body and mind; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/16-10.htm">Revelation 16:10</a>; and which wrath and ruin are expressed by a tempest of thunder, lightning, and hail, and by an earthquake, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-18.htm">Jeremiah 30:18</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/30.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Behold, <span class="cverse3">{q}</span> the whirlwind of the LORD goeth forth with fury, a continuing whirlwind: it shall fall with pain upon the head of the wicked.</span><p>(q) Lest the wicked hypocrites should flatter themselves with these promises the prophet shows what will be their portion.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/30.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">23</span>.

He will recompense to his oppressors and spoilers according to their deeds, and will heal his wounds. The enemies of Zion will now meet the fate which they have prepared for Zion. Those who, like rapacious animals, would devour Israel (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-3.htm">Jeremiah 2:3</a>), shall be devoured, and all his oppressors shall go into captivity; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-22.htm">Jeremiah 22:22</a>. The Kethib &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1505;&#1497;&#1498; is the Aramaic form of the participle from  &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1505; for &#1513;&#1473;&#1505;&#1505;; the Qeri substitutes the Hebrew form &#1513;&#1473;&#1505;&#1497;&#1498;, after <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-11.htm">Jeremiah 50:11</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/17-14.htm">Isaiah 17:14</a>. &#1506;&#1500;&#1492; &#1488;&#1512;&#1499;&#1492;, to put on a bandage, lay on a plaster. &#1488;&#1512;&#1499;&#1492; signifies, primarily, not a bandage, but, like the Arabic ari&#770;kah (according to Fleischer in Delitzsch on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-8.htm">Isaiah 58:8</a>), the new skin which forms over a wound as it heals, and (as is shown by the expression of Isaiah, &#1488;&#1512;&#1499;&#1514;&#1498;&#1470;&#1514;&#1468;&#1510;&#1502;&#1495;) proves the healing of the wound. Against the direct transference of the meaning of the word in Arabic to the Hebrew &#1488;&#1512;&#1499;&#1492;, without taking into consideration the passage in Isaiah just referred to, there is the objection that the word is always used in connection with &#1506;&#1500;&#1492;, "to be put on" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-22.htm">Isaiah 8:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-13.htm">2 Chronicles 24:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-1.htm">Nehemiah 4:1</a>), or &#1492;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492;, "to put on" (here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-6.htm">Jeremiah 33:6</a>), which is not the proper verb to be used in speaking of the formation of a new skin over a wound after suppuration has ceased. Hence the word in Hebrew seems to have received the derived sense of "a healing-plaster;" this is confirmed by the employment of the word &#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492;, "plaster," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-13.htm">Jeremiah 30:13</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-11.htm">Jeremiah 46:11</a>. - The second &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-17.htm">Jeremiah 30:17</a>, is subordinate to the clause which precedes. "Because they called thee one rejected," i.e., because the enemies of Zion spoke of her contemptuously, as a city that has been forsaken of God, and the Lord will heal her wounds. </body></html>
