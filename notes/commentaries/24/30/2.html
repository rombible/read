There is no definite point at which we may be certain that the section ends, and there is room for many conjectures as to interpolations here and there, but the opening of Jeremiah 32 suggests the conclusion that it takes in the whole of Jeremiah 30, 31. The general character of the prophecy, probably in part consequent on the acceptance of the prophet’s teaching by the exiles of Babylon, is one of blessing and restoration, and he is thus led on to the great utterance which, from one point of view, makes him more the prophet of the Gospel even than Isaiah. It is here that we find that promise of a New Covenant (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-31.htm" title="Behold, the days come, said the LORD, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah:">Jeremiah 31:31</a>) which both as a word and a fact has been prominent in the history of Christendom.<span class= "bld"><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/jeremiah/30.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/30-2.htm" title="Thus speaks the LORD God of Israel, saying, Write you all the words that I have spoken to you in a book....">Jeremiah 30:2-3</a>. </span><span class="ital">Thus speaketh the Lord, Write thee all the words that I have spoken, </span>&c. — The following words contain a promise of the restoration of God’s people. These God commands to be committed to writing for the use of posterity, to be a support to the Jews, an encouragement to them to trust in God, and a proof of his prescience and overruling providence when the event foretold should be brought about. <span class="ital">I will bring again the captivity of my people Israel and Judah </span>— The people that returned from Babylon were only, or at least chiefly, the people of Judah, who had been carried away captive by Nebuchadnezzar; but here it is foretold, that not the captivity of Judah only should be restored, but that of Israel also, or of those ten tribes that were carried away before by Shalmaneser, king of Assyria; and who still remain in their several dispersions, having never returned, at least in a national capacity; but the terms of this prophecy entitle us to expect, not an obscure and partial, but a complete and universal, restoration, when God will manifest himself, as formerly, the God and patron of all the families of Israel, not of a few only. The reunion also of Judah and Israel, after their restoration, seems to be here clearly foretold.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/30.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>30:1-11 Jeremiah is to write what God had spoken to him. The very words are such as the Holy Ghost teaches. These are the words God ordered to be written; and promises written by his order, are truly his word. He must write a description of the trouble the people were now in, and were likely to be in. A happy end should be put to these calamities. Though the afflictions of the church may last long, they shall not last always. The Jews shall be restored again. They shall obey, or hearken to the Messiah, the Christ, the Son of David, their King. The deliverance of the Jews from Babylon, is pointed out in the prophecy, but the restoration and happy state of Israel and Judah, when converted to Christ their King, are foretold; also the miseries of the nations before the coming of Christ. All men must honour the Son as they honour the Father, and come into the service and worship of God by him. Our gracious Lord pardons the sins of the believer, and breaks off the yoke of sin and Satan, that he may serve God without fear, in righteousness and true holiness before him all the remainder of his days, as the redeemed subject of Christ our King.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/30.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Write ... in a book - To be read and meditated upon by them in private.

Write &#8230; in a book&#8212;After the destruction of Jerusalem Jeremiah is not ordered as heretofore to speak, but to write the succeeding prophecy (Jer 30:4, &c.), so as thereby it might be read by his countrymen wheresoever they might be in their dispersion.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/30.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> It is uncertain whether this was a command from God to Jeremiah to record all the revelations which God had made to him, or only the revelation contained in this and the following chapter, which consists chiefly of promises of the people’s restoration; and so God might command them to be written that they might not be forgotten, but be at hand for the people to read during their captivity, to keep up their faith and hope in God. A book, in the Hebrew dialect, signifieth any parchment or roll; God would have them recorded to testify his truth, and the truth of the prophet, when they should see the things accomplished. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/30.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Thus speaketh the Lord God of Israel,.... Who is their covenant God; has not forgotten them; still has a regard for them; and speaks after the following comfortable manner concerning them: <p>saying, write thee all the words that I have spoken unto thee in a book; being things of consequence, that they might remain to after ages; and be read to the use, comfort, and edification of the Lord's people, in times to come; and be a support to their faith and hope, as well as be a testimony of the truth and faithfulness of God. Some think this charge refers to all the prophecies that go before, as well as follow after, to put them all together in a book or roll, that they might be preserved; though others think it refers only to the present prophecy; and so Kimchi interprets it, write all the words "that I am now speaking unto thee" (o) in a book; which should come to pass in the latter day.

There are, no doubt, numerous allusions to preceding chapters, but ver. 5 seems rather to favour the latter view. The word rendered "book" will equally suit a short discourse like the present (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-60.htm">Jeremiah 51:60</a>) and a large collection of prophecies as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-2.htm">Jeremiah 36:2</a>. Observe, the discourse was to be written down at once, without having been delivered orally; it was to be laid up as a pledge that God would interpose for his people (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-8.htm">Isaiah 30:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-2.htm">Habakkuk 2:2, 3</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/29.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"Because thou hast sent in thy name (without divine commission) letters to all the people in Jerusalem, and to Sephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, and to all the priests, saying." &#1505;&#1508;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; may be a single letter, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-1.htm">2 Kings 10:1-2</a>; but since these were sent to the people, the priest Zephaniah, and all the people, the word doubtless means here letters in the plural. As to Zephaniah ben Maaseiah, see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-1.htm">Jeremiah 21:1</a>. - In <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-26.htm">Jeremiah 29:26-28</a> follows the main substance of the letter: "Jahveh hath set thee to be priest in the stead of the priest Jehoiada, that there should be officers in the house of Jahveh for every man that is mad and prophesieth, that thou shouldest put him in the stocks and in neck-irons. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-27.htm">Jeremiah 29:27</a>. And, now, why hast thou not restrained Jeremiah of Anathoth, that prophesieth to you? <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-28.htm">Jeremiah 29:28</a>. For therefore hath he sent to us to Babylon (a letter) to the effect: It will last long; build houses and dwell (therein), and plant gardens and eat the fruit of them." Zephaniah occupied, acc. to <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-26.htm">Jeremiah 29:26</a>, the post of a chief officer of the temple, was a chief warden, as Pashur had been before him, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-1.htm">Jeremiah 21:1</a>, who had charge of the police regulations of the temple.<p>In the stead of the priest Jehoiada. These words Grot., Hitz., and Gr. refer to the high priest Jehoiada under King Joash, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-18.htm">2 Kings 11:18</a>, who set up officers (&#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;) over the temple. But this view cannot be reconciled with the words of the text: "Jahveh hath set thee to be priest in Jehoiada's stead, that there should be officers;" since from these ambiguous words, Zephaniah filled the same post as Jehoiada had done, and was his successor in office. The other well-known Jehoiada was high priest, who appointed officers; Zephaniah, on the other hand was only "the second priest," and as such had charge of the temple arrangements and of public order there. Nor is there any hint here or elsewhere that Zephaniah was the immediate successor of Pashur in this office, nor any indication to make it unlikely that Jehoiada held the post after Pashur and that Zedekiah succeeded him. The plural "officers" is general: that at all times there should be officers. "For every man that is mad an prophesieth." &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1490;&#1468;&#1506;, the deranged or mad person, is here closely associated with &#1502;&#1514;&#1504;&#1489;&#1468;&#1488;, him that bears himself as prophet. The former word is used in the evil sense of the apparently deranged behaviour of the man on whom the Spirit of God has laid hold, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-11.htm">2 Kings 9:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-7.htm">Hosea 9:7</a>. The idea is not: for (or against) every prophet, but: for every madman that plays the prophet. The temple, i.e., the outer court of the temple, was the usual place for prophets to take their stand. Shemaiah accordingly means that it was the duty of the chief warden of the temple to repress attempts to speak in the temple on the part of pretended prophets, by putting such persons in stocks and irons. As to &#1502;&#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1499;&#1514;, see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-2.htm">Jeremiah 20:2</a>. &#1510;&#1497;&#1504;&#1511; is &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0; &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;.. It certainly does not mean prison after &#1510;&#1504;&#1511;, in Samaritan  equals  clausit; but apparently neck-irons after Arab. zna&#770;q, necklace, ring. Since both words are used together here, and since the meaning is apparently that Jeremiah should be put into both instruments at once, Hitz. conjectures that both together were needed to make the stocks complete, but that each had its own proper name, because it was possible to fix in the neck, leaving hands and feet free, or conversely, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-2.htm">Jeremiah 20:2</a>. -  &#1490;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512;, rebuke, check by threats, restrain, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/2-16.htm">Ruth 2:16</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/malachi/3-11.htm">Malachi 3:11</a>, etc. "For therefore," sc. just because thou hast not restrained him from prophesying he has sent to Babylon. &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495; with &#1500;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; following, send to say, means: to send a message or letter as follows. &#1500;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; &#1488;&#1512;&#1499;&#1492; &#1492;&#1497;&#1488; Hitz. renders: for he thought: it (Babylon) is far away; Jeremiah's meaning being, that in Jerusalem they would know nothing about his letter he was sending to Babylon. But such a hidden purpose is utterly foreign to the character of the prophet. He had publicly predicted in Jerusalem the long seventy years' duration of the exile; and it was not likely to occur to him to wish to make a secret of the letter of like import which he sent to Babylon. Besides, Hitz.'s interpretation is forced. Since there is no &#1500;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; before &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; &#1489;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, the &#1500;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; before &#1488;&#1512;&#1499;&#1492; can only be introductory to the contents of the letter. For &#1488;&#1512;&#1498; used of duration in time, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-1.htm">2 Samuel 3:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/11-9.htm">Job 11:9</a>. "Long-lasting it is," sc. your sojourn in Babylon. These words give the burden of his prophecy, that on which he founded his counsel: build houses, etc.</body></html>
