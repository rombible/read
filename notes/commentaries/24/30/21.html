The word is the same as the “excellent” of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/8-1.htm" title="O LORD, our Lord, how excellent is your name in all the earth! who have set your glory above the heavens.">Psalm 8:1</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Who is this that engaged his heart to approach unto me?</span>—The question points to the ruler of the house of David whom the prophet sees in visions—in other words, to the far-off Messiah. So in Isaiah we have a like introduction of the figure of the conqueror, “Who is this that cometh from Edom?” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-1.htm" title="Who is this that comes from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah? this that is glorious in his apparel, traveling in the greatness of his strength? I that speak in righteousness, mighty to save.">Isaiah 63:1</a>). As in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/11-1.htm" title="And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a Branch shall grow out of his roots:">Isaiah 11:1-3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/42-1.htm" title="Behold my servant, whom I uphold; my elect, in whom my soul delights; I have put my spirit on him: he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles.">Isaiah 42:1-4</a>, the dominant thought is that of one who will not be treacherous or faithless, like the degenerate heirs of the house of David whom Jeremiah had known, but one who would “engage” (literally, <span class= "ital">pledge, </span>or <span class= "ital">give as security</span>) his heart and soul to the service of Jehovah. In the advent of such a king the true relation between God and His people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/1-10.htm" title="Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured nor numbered; and it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said to them, You are not my people, there it shall be said to them, You are the sons of the living God.">Hosea 1:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-7.htm" title="And I will give them an heart to know me, that I am the LORD: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God: for they shall return to me with their whole heart.">Jeremiah 24:7</a>) should yet be re-established. In the words “to approach unto me” we have the germ of the thought that the true King will also be a priest, and will enter, as others could not enter, into the Holy Place (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-19.htm" title="Therefore thus said the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Jonadab the son of Rechab shall not want a man to stand before me for ever.">Jeremiah 35:19</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-5.htm" title="And he spoke to Korah and to all his company, saying, Even to morrow the LORD will show who are his, and who is holy; and will cause him to come near to him: even him whom he has chosen will he cause to come near to him.">Numbers 16:5</a>); a priest, such as <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110-4.htm" title="The LORD has sworn, and will not repent, You are a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.">Psalm 110:4</a> had spoken of, after the order of Melchizedek.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/30.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>30:18-24 We have here further intimations of the favour of God for them after the days of their calamity have expired. The proper work and office of Christ, as Mediator, is to draw near unto God, for us, as the High Priest of our profession. His own undertaking, in compliance with his Father's will, and in compassion to fallen man, engaged him. Jesus Christ was, in all this, truly wonderful. They shall be taken again into covenant with the Lord, according to the covenant made with their fathers. I will be your God: it is his good-will to us, which is the summary of that part of the covenant. The wrath of God against the wicked is very terrible, like a whirlwind. The purposes of his wrath, as well as the purposes of his love, will all be fulfilled. God will comfort all that turn to him; but those who approach him must have their hearts engaged to do it with reverence, devotion, and faith.

Heart is here used for life, to express the courage which it needed to undertake such a tremendous suretyship. The question implies admiration at one being found competent by His twofold nature, as God and man, for the task. Compare the interrogation (Isa 63:1-3).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/30.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Their governor shall proceed from the midst of them:</span> this promise was made good in Zerobabel, and other governors of the Jews after their return out of captivity, till they came to be subdued by the Romans.

Some understand this of the civil governor that should be after the captivity; some understand it of the people; some understand it of Christ. Those that understand it of the governor, make it to signify the special favour that governor should be in with God and his religion; those that understand it of the people, make it to signify the religion of the people, and the favour they should be in with God; those who understand it of Christ, interpret it of his favour with God, by whom also the saints have their access. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">For who is this that engaged his heart to approach unto me?</span> Interpreters are yet more divided about this phrase; some apply it to Christ, either as an admiration of his excellency, or as denoting that none but he could draw near to God in that manner as he did, nor had any such a delight in the sons of men as he, so as for him to be a Mediator betwixt offenders and an offended God; none but he durst look in the face of an angry God. Others understand it of God’s people, intimating that in the day when they should return out of captivity there would be but few that with any serious purpose of heart would apply themselves unto God, or signifying the impotency that is in man heartily to draw nigh to God, till (as it is before said) God causeth him so to do; and some think the words have a reference to the covenant mentioned in the next verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/30.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And their nobles shall be of themselves,.... Or, "his noble One" (d); Jacob's noble One, the Messiah, in whom all the promises centre; and whose incarnation and priesthood are the foundation of all the things above predicted. The Targum interprets these words of him; <p>"their King shall be anointed from them, and their Messiah shall be revealed from the midst of them.'' <p>And so it is applied to him in the Talmud (e), and in other writings of the Jews (f). Kimchi on the place says, <p>"it is known that the King Messiah shall be of Israel.'' <p>He may be called a "noble One", as he is a Nobleman in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-12.htm">Luke 19:12</a>; because he descended from illustrious persons; from David king of Israel, and from a race of kings in his line, as the genealogy of Matthew shows. Or, "his glorious One" (g), as it may be rendered; he is glorious in his nature, being the brightness of his Father's glory; glorious in his perfections, which are the same with his divine Father's; glorious in his names and titles, the King and Lord of glory; glorious in his works and worship, which are the same that are ascribed to God the Father; glorious in his office as Mediator, which he has so well performed; glorious when he was raised from the dead, and had a glory given him; and when he ascended on high, and sat down at his Father's right hand, crowned with glory and honour; glorious in the eyes of God, and of all his people; and, when his kingdom shall be in a more glorious condition, he will reign before his ancients gloriously; and when he comes a second time, he will come in exceeding great glory. Or, his "mighty One" (h); Christ is the mighty God, the mighty Mediator, the mighty Saviour; he is the most Mighty, he is the Almighty. Now, as man, his descent was from them, the Israelites; from Abraham, from Jacob, from Judah, from Jesse and David, and from the people of the Jews; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-4.htm">Romans 9:4</a>; <p>and their Governor shall proceed from the midst of them; meaning the King Messiah, as before; who has the government of the church upon his shoulders; is worthy of all power and authority and has received it; has a power of making laws, and of obliging men to keep them; has a power of pardoning, justifying, and saving men; is the lawgiver that is able to save, and to destroy; and can subject all to his feet, as he will in a short time. This seems to refer to a law in Israel, that not a stranger, but one of their brethren, should be set as king over them, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-15.htm">Deuteronomy 17:15</a>; which is true of the Messiah; <p>and I will cause him to draw near, and he shall approach unto me; expressive of his priestly office; it being the business of a priest to draw nigh to God with the sacrifices of the people, and to intercede for them, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-3.htm">Leviticus 10:3</a>. Christ in eternity drew nigh to his Father, and offered himself as a surety for his people, and became one; and the Greek word for surety,  has the signification of being "near": he drew nigh and interposed between them and his father, and became a Mediator for them; he proposed to do everything for them law and justice required, and whatsoever was his Father's will should be done: he drew nigh and struck hands, stipulated and agreed with him, about the salvation of his people; he asked them of him, and all blessings of grace and glory for them: he drew nigh in time, having assumed their nature, and offered himself a sacrifice unto God, made satisfaction to his justice for them, and redeemed them unto God by his blood; by which means they are made nigh to God, and draw near to him with humble boldness; and now he is gone to heaven, and has taken his place at the right hand of God, where he appears in the presence of God, and makes intercession for them, presenting himself, his blood, righteousness, and sacrifice. Now this is ascribed unto God, as causing him to draw nigh; because he chose, appointed, and called him to be a priest, Mediator, and surety, to which he was entirely free of himself; and therefore it follows, <p>for who is this that engaged his heart to approach unto me? saith the Lord; his drawing to God in the council and covenant of grace, to be the surety of his people, and his undertaking for them, were quite free and voluntary; he came of himself, and surrendered himself into the hands of justice at the time of his sufferings and death; and his intercession in heaven flows from his hearty love to his people; his heart has been, and is, engaged in every branch of his mediatorial work, which is a very singular and wonderful thing. No mere man could have engaged his heart to draw nigh to God, who is a consuming fire; no angel in heaven could have presumed to have done it on the behalf of sinful men; none but Christ himself could, and which is owing to the dignity of his person, and to his wondrous love; for this is a marvellous event. Now, though this is a prophecy of Christ's incarnation and priesthood, yet it is suitably introduced here; because, at the time of the Jews' conversion, he will be made known unto them, as being come of them, and as their Prophet, Priest, and King. <p>(d) "praestans ejus", Montanus.

It is remarkable that no reference is made here to the Messiah, who, in fact, is not as conspicuous a figure in the prophecies of Jeremiah as in those of Isaiah. And yet even in Isaiah there is one  striking prophecy in which the inspired seer uses language not (in the hands of a literalist) reconcilable with the prospect of the personal Messiah. The Messiah appears, as it were, in a lightning flash, and then disappears for a time. The prophecy of Isaiah referred to is <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-1.htm">Isaiah 32:1, 2</a> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-17.htm">Jeremiah 33:17</a>), in which the prospect of a truly God-fearing king, with princes of the same high character, entirely occupies the mind of the writer. "Nothing indicates that the Messiah is intended; king and princes are placed quite on a level, in accordance with the actual state of things under the so called monarchy." <span class="cmt_word">And I will cause him to draw near.</span> It is doubtful whether Israel or Israel's ruler is referred to. A priestly relation (such as "drawing near" implies, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-5.htm">Numbers 16:5</a>) might be predicated of either, at any rate in the regenerate form of the Israelitish commonwealth; but it is more natural to suppose the ruler to be here indicated, for it is scarcely descriptive enough to say that he shall belong to the chosen people. <span class="cmt_word">Who is this that engaged his heart;</span> rather, <span class="accented">that pledgeth his heart</span> (or, <span class="accented">courage</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> that ventureth.

Why criest thou over thy bruise  - [because] thy wound is bad?

For I will put a plaster on thee, and will heal thee of thy wounds, saith Jahveh; for they call thee an outcast, [and say], Zion is she [whom] none seeketh after."<p>This strophe is only a fuller expression of the idea set forth in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-11.htm">Jeremiah 30:11</a>, that the Lord certainly chastises Israel, but will not make an end of him. The chastisement has commenced. From the wounds and blows which Israel has received, he lies motionless and helpless, getting neither sympathy nor aid from his lovers. The feminine suffix and the mention of lovers show that the address turns to the daughter of Zion. On the expression &#1488;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473; , "it is ill with thy bruise," cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-18.htm">Jeremiah 15:18</a>. &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1492; &#1502;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492;, "bad, incurable is the stroke which thou hast received," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-19.htm">Jeremiah 10:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-17.htm">Jeremiah 14:17</a>. &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503; &#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503;, "to execute justice;" cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-28.htm">Jeremiah 5:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-16.htm">Jeremiah 22:16</a>. Hitzig well explains the meaning: "thy claims against thy heathen oppressors." &#1500;&#1502;&#1494;&#1493;&#1512;, although connected by the accents with what precedes, does not agree well with &#1491;&#1468;&#1503; &#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1504;&#1498;; for &#1502;&#1494;&#1493;&#1512; has not the meaning which has been attributed to it, of a "bandage," but, as derived from the verb &#1494;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, "to press a wound," signifies the wound that has been pressed together; see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/5-13.htm">Hosea 5:13</a>. Neither does the figure of the wound agree with the expression, "there is none to judge thy cause," so that we might, with Umbreit, render the passage, "No one gives thee thy due, in pressing thy wounds;" while, as Graf says, " &#1512;&#1508;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; dissociated from &#1500;&#1502;&#1494;&#1493;&#1512; forms a useless synonym with &#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492;," and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-11.htm">Jeremiah 46:11</a>, where the thought is repeated, it is separated from the latter word. Accordingly, with Hitzig and Graf, we connect &#1500;&#1502;&#1494;&#1493;&#1512;  into one clause: "for the wound, there is no healing (or medicine)-no plaster." &#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492; is what is laid upon the wound, a plaster. "All thy lovers," i.e., the nations which were once allied with thee (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-20.htm">Jeremiah 22:20</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-22.htm">Jeremiah 22:22</a>), do not trouble themselves about thee, because I have smitten thee so heavily on account of the multitude of thy transgressions; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-6.htm">Jeremiah 5:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-22.htm">Jeremiah 13:22</a>. &#1506;&#1510;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468; still depends on the preposition &#1506;&#1500;, which continues its force, but as a conjunction. The idea that the Israelites have richly deserved their sufferings is still more plainly presented in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-15.htm">Jeremiah 30:15</a> : "Why criest thou, because thou hast brought this suffering on thee through thy sins?" &#1488;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473; also depends on &#1506;&#1500;, which continues to exert its power in the sentence as a conjunction.</body></html>
