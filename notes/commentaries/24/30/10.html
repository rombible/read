And though this be not accomplished in the Jews of the present age, it shall be made good to their posterity, who are beloved for their fathers’ sake, as St. Paul speaks, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-28.htm" title="As concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sakes: but as touching the election, they are beloved for the father's sakes.">Romans 11:28</a>. <span class="ital">And Jacob shall be in rest and quiet, </span>&c. — Shall enjoy peace and safety. <span class="ital">Though I make a full end of all nations whither I have scattered thee </span>— Such as the Assyrians, Chaldeans, Egyptians; <span class="ital">yet will I not make a full end of thee </span>— The Jews to this day continue a remarkable monument of the truth and immutability of God’s promises. Where now are all the nations which carried them into captivity, and trod them under foot? All, all are perished; their kingdoms overturned, their laws and languages abolished, their very names, as nations, extinct; not the least footsteps remaining of their having ever been a people: for God had determined to make <span class="ital">a full end of them. </span>But the people of the Jews, though carried into captivity, slain by the sword, destroyed by pestilence and famine, and every other method of destruction, do yet remain a people: under all the revolutions and changes of kingdoms, languages, and people, they still exist unmixed; and, though for their heinous sins they are scattered abroad among all nations, they still preserve their name, language, and most of their ancient ceremonies and customs, for God has promised not to <span class="ital">make a full end of them. But I will correct thee in measure</span> — Or, <span class="ital">according to judgment, </span>as <span class="greekheb">למשׁפשׂ</span>signifies, that is, with discretion, not more than thou deservest, nay, not more than thou canst well bear. God’s afflicting his people is in a way of correction, and that correction is always moderated, and always proceeds from love. <span class="ital">And will not leave thee altogether unpunished </span>— As thou art ready to think I should do because of thy relation to me. Observe, reader, a profession of religion, though never so plausible, will be far from securing to us impunity in sin. God is no respecter of persons, but will show his hatred of sin wherever he finds it, and he always hates it most in those that are nearest to him.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/30.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>30:1-11 Jeremiah is to write what God had spoken to him. The very words are such as the Holy Ghost teaches. These are the words God ordered to be written; and promises written by his order, are truly his word. He must write a description of the trouble the people were now in, and were likely to be in. A happy end should be put to these calamities. Though the afflictions of the church may last long, they shall not last always. The Jews shall be restored again. They shall obey, or hearken to the Messiah, the Christ, the Son of David, their King. The deliverance of the Jews from Babylon, is pointed out in the prophecy, but the restoration and happy state of Israel and Judah, when converted to Christ their King, are foretold; also the miseries of the nations before the coming of Christ. All men must honour the Son as they honour the Father, and come into the service and worship of God by him. Our gracious Lord pardons the sins of the believer, and breaks off the yoke of sin and Satan, that he may serve God without fear, in righteousness and true holiness before him all the remainder of his days, as the redeemed subject of Christ our King.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/30.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>These two verses are considered by some very similar in style to the last 27 chapters of Isaiah.

Since the Messiah, who is the Lord God, should be raised up to thorn, whom they should serve, and he should save them; and so had nothing to fear from their enemies; and had no reason to doubt of salvation and deliverance, seeing so great a person was engaged for them. The language is very much like the Prophet Isaiah's: <p>neither be dismayed, O Israel: the same thing in other words; for Jacob and Israel are the same; and to fear and be dismayed are much alike: <p>for, lo, I will save thee from afar; from a far country; not from Babylon only, but from all distant countries where they are dispersed, east, west, north, or south; distance of place should be no hinderance to their salvation, and so need be no objection in their minds to it: <p>and thy seed from the land of their captivity; their children should come forth with them: it seems to respect future times; that though this should not be accomplished in the persons of the Israelites then living, yet should be in their posterity: <p>and Jacob shall return, and shall be in rest, and be quiet, and none shall make him afraid; which was not fulfilled upon the Jews' return from the Babylonish captivity; for they quickly met with much opposition and disturbance in the rebuilding of their city and temple; and afterwards from Antiochus, in the times of the Maccabees, by whom they were greatly disquieted; and at last by the Romans, by whom their nation was subdued and ruined; wherefore this respects the quiet and peaceable times they shall have when they are converted, and have embraced the Christian religion. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/30.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Therefore fear thou not, O my servant Jacob, saith the LORD; neither be dismayed, O Israel: for, lo, I will save thee from afar, and thy seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and shall be in rest, and be quiet, and none shall make him afraid.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/30.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">10</span>. <span class="ital">from afar</span>] from thy distant land of exile.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">none shall make him afraid</span>] Cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/17-2.htm" title="The cities of Aroer are forsaken: they shall be for flocks, which shall lie down, and none shall make them afraid.">Isaiah 17:2</a> (flocks lying undisturbed).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">10, 11</span>.

Graf, in controverting Hitzig's view, points out, however, that the expressions referred to by Hitzig as "Deutero-Isaianic," are also found in other books besides the latter part of Isaiah, and that, on the other hand, "the expressions of ver. 11 are all as foreign to <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40.htm">Isaiah 40-66</a>, as they are current in Jeremiah." As for the expression, "my servant Jacob." (which. only occurs again in Jeremiah in the duplicate of this passage, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-27.htm">Jeremiah 46:27, 28</a>, and which is specially characteristic of the second part of Isaiah), it is worth noticing that it is found once in the Book of Ezekiel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-25.htm">Ezekiel 37:25</a>), which, on Hitzig's theory, was written before the so called Second Isaiah. It still remains for the student to consider whether these two verses are not an insertion by some later hand (without attempting to discover whose that hand was). That the prophetic writings have received additions from editors and scribes is a fact which cannot reasonably be gainsaid, supported as it is by the phenomena of the historical books. It would be very natural for a pious Jew in the Captivity, not wholly devoid himself of the spirit of prophecy, to encourage his people, in the Name of the Lord, with this glowing word of promise. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/30.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The judgment on the nations for the deliverance of Israel. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-4.htm">Jeremiah 30:4</a>. "And these are the words which Jahveh spake concerning Israel and Judah: <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-5.htm">Jeremiah 30:5</a>. For thus saith Jahveh: We have heard a cry of terror, fear, and no peace. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-6.htm">Jeremiah 30:6</a>. Ask now, and see whether a male bears a child? Why do I see every man with his hands on his loins like a woman in childbirth, and every face turned to paleness? <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-7.htm">Jeremiah 30:7</a>. Alas! for that day is great, with none like it, and it is a time of distress for Jacob, but he will be saved out of it. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-8.htm">Jeremiah 30:8</a>.

For I am with thee, saith Jahveh, to save thee; for I will make an end of all the nations whither I have scattered thee, yet of thee will I not make an end, but I will chastise thee properly and will not let thee go quite unpunished."<p>With <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-4.htm">Jeremiah 30:4</a> is introduced the description of Israel's restoration announced in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-3.htm">Jeremiah 30:3</a>. This introduction is not absolutely necessary, but neither is it for that reason spurious and to be expunged, as Hitzig seeks to do; it rather corresponds to the breadth of Jeremiah's representation. The &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-5.htm">Jeremiah 30:5</a> is explicative: "Thus, namely, hath Jahveh spoken." With the lively dramatic power of a poet, the prophet at once transports the hearers or readers of his prophecy, in thought, into the great day to come, which is to bring deliverance to all Israel. As a day of judgment, it brings terror and anguish on all those who live to see it. &#1511;&#1493;&#1500; &#1495;&#1512;&#1491;&#1492;, "A voice (sound) of trembling (or terror) we hear," viz., the people, of whom the prophet is one. &#1508;&#1468;&#1495;&#1491; does not depend on &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, but forms with &#1493;&#1488;&#1497;&#1503; &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1501; an independent clause: "There is fear and not peace" (or safety). <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-6.htm">Jeremiah 30:6</a>. What is the cause of this great horror, which makes all men, from convulsive pains, hold their hands on their loins, so as to support their bowels, in which they feel the pangs, and which makes every countenance pale? In <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-7.htm">Jeremiah 30:7</a> the cause of this horror is declared. It is the great day of judgment that is coming. "That (not hits) day" points to the future, and thus, even apart from other reasons, excludes the supposition that it is the day of the destruction of Jerusalem that is meant. The words "that day is great" refer to <a href="http://biblehub.com/joel/2-11.htm">Joel 2:11</a>, and "there is none like it" is an imitation of <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-2.htm">Joel 2:2</a>; in the latter passage the prophet makes use of a judgment which he had seen passed on Judah - its devastation by locusts - and for the first time presents, as the main element in his prophecy, the idea of the great day of judgment to come on all nations, and by which the Lord will perfect His kingdom on this earth. This day is for Jacob also, i.e., for all Israel, a time of distress; for the judgment falls not merely on the heathen nations, but also on the godless members of the covenant people, that they may be destroyed from among the congregation of the Lord. The judgment is therefore for Israel as well as for other nations a critical juncture, from which the Israel of God, the community of the faithful, will be delivered. This deliverance is described more in detail in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-8.htm">Jeremiah 30:8</a>. The Lord will break the yoke imposed on Israel, free His people from all bondage to strangers, i.e., the heathen, so that they may serve only Him, the Lord, and David, His king, whom He will raise up. The suffix in &#1506;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493; is referred by several expositors (Hitzig, Ngelsbach) to the king of Babylon, "as having been most clearly before the minds of Jeremiah and his contemporaries;" in support of this view we are pointed to <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-27.htm">Isaiah 10:27</a>, as a passage which may have been before the eyes of Jeremiah. But neither this parallel passage nor &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;&#1498; (with the suffix of the second person), which immediately follows, sufficiently justifies this view. For, in the second half also of the verse, the second person is interchanged with the third, and &#1502;&#1493;&#1505;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;&#1498;, which is parallel with &#1506;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;, requires us to refer the suffix in the latter word to Jacob, so that "his yoke" means "the yoke laid on him," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-4.htm">1 Kings 12:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-3.htm">Isaiah 9:3</a>. It is also to be borne in mind that, throughout the whole prophecy, neither Babylon nor the king of Babylon is once mentioned; and that the judgment described in these verses cannot possibly be restricted to the downfall of the Babylonian monarchy, but is the judgment that is to fall upon all nations (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-11.htm">Jeremiah 30:11</a>). And although this judgment begins with the fall of the Babylonian supremacy, it will bring deliverance to the people of God, not merely from the yoke of Babylon, but from every yoke which strangers have laid or will lay on them.</body></html>
