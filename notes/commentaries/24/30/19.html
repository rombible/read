The proper work and office of Christ, as Mediator, is to draw near unto God, for us, as the High Priest of our profession. His own undertaking, in compliance with his Father's will, and in compassion to fallen man, engaged him. Jesus Christ was, in all this, truly wonderful. They shall be taken again into covenant with the Lord, according to the covenant made with their fathers. I will be your God: it is his good-will to us, which is the summary of that part of the covenant. The wrath of God against the wicked is very terrible, like a whirlwind. The purposes of his wrath, as well as the purposes of his love, will all be fulfilled. God will comfort all that turn to him; but those who approach him must have their hearts engaged to do it with reverence, devotion, and faith. How will they escape who neglect so great salvation?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/30.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Them - i. e., the city and palace.

"For thus saith Jahveh: It is ill with thy bruise, thy wound is painful. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-13.htm">Jeremiah 30:13</a>. There is none to judge thy cause; for a sore, healing-plaster there is none for thee. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-14.htm">Jeremiah 30:14</a>. All thy lovers have forgotten thee, thee they seek not; for I have wounded thee with the wound of an enemy, the chastisement of a cruel one, because of the multitude of thine iniquity, [because] thy sins were numerous. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-15.htm">Jeremiah 30:15</a>. Why criest thou over thy bruise  - [because] thy wound is bad? Because of the multitude of thine iniquity, [because] thy sins were numerous, have I done these things to thee. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-16.htm">Jeremiah 30:16</a>. Therefore all those who devour thee shall be devoured; and all thine oppressors, they shall all go into captivity; and they who spoiled thee shall become a spoil, and those that plundered thee I will give up for plunder. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-17.htm">Jeremiah 30:17</a>. For I will put a plaster on thee, and will heal thee of thy wounds, saith Jahveh; for they call thee an outcast, [and say], Zion is she [whom] none seeketh after."<p>This strophe is only a fuller expression of the idea set forth in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-11.htm">Jeremiah 30:11</a>, that the Lord certainly chastises Israel, but will not make an end of him. The chastisement has commenced. From the wounds and blows which Israel has received, he lies motionless and helpless, getting neither sympathy nor aid from his lovers. The feminine suffix and the mention of lovers show that the address turns to the daughter of Zion. On the expression &#1488;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473; , "it is ill with thy bruise," cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-18.htm">Jeremiah 15:18</a>. &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1492; &#1502;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492;, "bad, incurable is the stroke which thou hast received," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-19.htm">Jeremiah 10:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-17.htm">Jeremiah 14:17</a>. &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503; &#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503;, "to execute justice;" cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-28.htm">Jeremiah 5:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-16.htm">Jeremiah 22:16</a>. Hitzig well explains the meaning: "thy claims against thy heathen oppressors." &#1500;&#1502;&#1494;&#1493;&#1512;, although connected by the accents with what precedes, does not agree well with &#1491;&#1468;&#1503; &#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1504;&#1498;; for &#1502;&#1494;&#1493;&#1512; has not the meaning which has been attributed to it, of a "bandage," but, as derived from the verb &#1494;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, "to press a wound," signifies the wound that has been pressed together; see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/5-13.htm">Hosea 5:13</a>. Neither does the figure of the wound agree with the expression, "there is none to judge thy cause," so that we might, with Umbreit, render the passage, "No one gives thee thy due, in pressing thy wounds;" while, as Graf says, " &#1512;&#1508;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; dissociated from &#1500;&#1502;&#1494;&#1493;&#1512; forms a useless synonym with &#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492;," and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-11.htm">Jeremiah 46:11</a>, where the thought is repeated, it is separated from the latter word. Accordingly, with Hitzig and Graf, we connect &#1500;&#1502;&#1494;&#1493;&#1512;  into one clause: "for the wound, there is no healing (or medicine)-no plaster." &#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492; is what is laid upon the wound, a plaster. "All thy lovers," i.e., the nations which were once allied with thee (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-20.htm">Jeremiah 22:20</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-22.htm">Jeremiah 22:22</a>), do not trouble themselves about thee, because I have smitten thee so heavily on account of the multitude of thy transgressions; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-6.htm">Jeremiah 5:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-22.htm">Jeremiah 13:22</a>. &#1506;&#1510;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468; still depends on the preposition &#1506;&#1500;, which continues its force, but as a conjunction. The idea that the Israelites have richly deserved their sufferings is still more plainly presented in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-15.htm">Jeremiah 30:15</a> : "Why criest thou, because thou hast brought this suffering on thee through thy sins?" &#1488;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473; also depends on &#1506;&#1500;, which continues to exert its power in the sentence as a conjunction.</body></html>
