The very words are such as the Holy Ghost teaches. These are the words God ordered to be written; and promises written by his order, are truly his word. He must write a description of the trouble the people were now in, and were likely to be in. A happy end should be put to these calamities. Though the afflictions of the church may last long, they shall not last always. The Jews shall be restored again. They shall obey, or hearken to the Messiah, the Christ, the Son of David, their King. The deliverance of the Jews from Babylon, is pointed out in the prophecy, but the restoration and happy state of Israel and Judah, when converted to Christ their King, are foretold; also the miseries of the nations before the coming of Christ. All men must honour the Son as they honour the Father, and come into the service and worship of God by him. Our gracious Lord pardons the sins of the believer, and breaks off the yoke of sin and Satan, that he may serve God without fear, in righteousness and true holiness before him all the remainder of his days, as the redeemed subject of Christ our King.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/30.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>That day - i. e., the day of the capture of Babylon.<p>It is even the time of Jacob's trouble - Rather, and it is a time of trouble to Jacob, i. e., of anxiety to the Jews, for the usages of war were so brutal that they would be in danger when the enemy made their assault. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/30.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. great&#8212;marked by great calamities (Joe 2:11, 31; Am 5:18; Zep 1:14).<p>none like it &#8230; but he shall be saved&#8212;(Da 12:1).

Its meaning is developed in two directions according to the teaching which the individual prophet desires to convey. Jehovah, they taught, will some day manifest Himself, it may be in executing terrible judgement upon the sin either of His own nation or of others; but it may also be in the restoration of the former to the privileges which they had forfeited. The description is modified in each case by the occasion; e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-12.htm" title="For the day of the LORD of hosts shall be on every one that is proud and lofty, and on every one that is lifted up; and he shall be brought low:">Isaiah 2:12</a> ff. directs the judgement against the material wealth and luxury acquired in the days of Uzziah. Joel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-1.htm" title="Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying,">Jeremiah 2:1</a> ff.) illustrates the punishment by a recent scourge of locusts. Cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-7.htm" title="Hold your peace at the presence of the Lord GOD: for the day of the LORD is at hand: for the LORD has prepared a sacrifice, he has bid his guests.">Zephaniah 1:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-14.htm" title="The great day of the LORD is near, it is near, and hastens greatly, even the voice of the day of the LORD: the mighty man shall cry there bitterly.">Zephaniah 1:14</a> ff.

For, behold, days come, saith Jahveh, when I shall turn the captivity of my people Israel and Judah, saith Jahve, and I shall bring them back to the land which I gave to their fathers, and they shall possess it."<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-1.htm">Jeremiah 30:1</a> contains the heading not merely of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-2.htm">Jeremiah 30:2</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-3.htm">Jeremiah 30:3</a>, as Hitzig erroneously maintains, but of the whole prophecy, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30.htm">Jeremiah 30</a> and 31. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-2.htm">Jeremiah 30:2</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-3.htm">Jeremiah 30:3</a> form the introduction. Jeremiah is to write the following word of God in a book, because it refers to times still future, - regards the deliverance of Israel and Judah from exile, which will not take place till afterwards. In assigning the reason for the command to write down the word of God that had been received, there is at the same time given the subject of the prophecy which follows. From this it is further evident that the expression "all the words which I have spoken to thee" cannot, like <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-2.htm">Jeremiah 36:2</a>, be referred, with J. D. Michaelis, to the whole of the prophecies which Jeremiah had up till that time received; it merely refers to the following prophecy of deliverance. The perfect &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; is thus not a preterite, but only expresses that the address of God to the prophet precedes the writing down of the words he received. As to the expression &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489; &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;, see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-14.htm">Jeremiah 29:14</a>. </body></html>
