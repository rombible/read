It is eminently characteristic of the prophets of Jeremiah’s time (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-13.htm" title="And it came to pass, when I prophesied, that Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died. Then fell I down on my face, and cried with a loud voice, and said, Ah Lord GOD! will you make a full end of the remnant of Israel?">Ezekiel 11:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-17.htm" title="Nevertheless my eye spared them from destroying them, neither did I make an end of them in the wilderness.">Ezekiel 20:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/nahum/1-8.htm" title="But with an overrunning flood he will make an utter end of the place thereof, and darkness shall pursue his enemies.">Nahum 1:8-9</a>). Here the thought, implied elsewhere, and reproduced in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-28.htm" title="Fear you not, O Jacob my servant, said the LORD: for I am with you; for I will make a full end of all the nations where I have driven you: but I will not make a full end of you, but correct you in measure; yet will I not leave you wholly unpunished.">Jeremiah 46:28</a>, is expressed more fully than before, that while the destruction of the national life of the heathen nations on whom judgment was to fall should be complete and irreversible, so that Moab, Ammon, Edom, should no more have a place in the history of the world, the punishment of Israel should be remedial as well as retributive, working out, in due time, a complete restitution. In “correcting in measure” we trace an echo of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/6-1.htm" title="O LORD, rebuke me not in your anger, neither chasten me in your hot displeasure.">Psalm 6:1</a> (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-24.htm" title="O LORD, correct me, but with judgment; not in your anger, lest you bring me to nothing.">Jeremiah 10:24</a>). That thought sustains the prophet in his contemplation of the captivity and apparent ruin of his people. To be left “altogether unpunished” would be, as in the “let him alone “of <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-17.htm" title="Ephraim is joined to idols: let him alone.">Hosea 4:17</a>, the most terrible of all punishments.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/30.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>30:1-11 Jeremiah is to write what God had spoken to him. The very words are such as the Holy Ghost teaches. These are the words God ordered to be written; and promises written by his order, are truly his word. He must write a description of the trouble the people were now in, and were likely to be in. A happy end should be put to these calamities. Though the afflictions of the church may last long, they shall not last always. The Jews shall be restored again. They shall obey, or hearken to the Messiah, the Christ, the Son of David, their King. The deliverance of the Jews from Babylon, is pointed out in the prophecy, but the restoration and happy state of Israel and Judah, when converted to Christ their King, are foretold; also the miseries of the nations before the coming of Christ. All men must honour the Son as they honour the Father, and come into the service and worship of God by him. Our gracious Lord pardons the sins of the believer, and breaks off the yoke of sin and Satan, that he may serve God without fear, in righteousness and true holiness before him all the remainder of his days, as the redeemed subject of Christ our King.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/30.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In measure - See the <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-24.htm">Jeremiah 10:24</a> note. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/30.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11. though &#8230; full end of all nations &#8230; yet &#8230; not &#8230; of thee&#8212;(Am 9:8).

"And these are the words which Jahveh spake concerning Israel and Judah: <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-5.htm">Jeremiah 30:5</a>.

For I am with thee, saith Jahveh, to save thee; for I will make an end of all the nations whither I have scattered thee, yet of thee will I not make an end, but I will chastise thee properly and will not let thee go quite unpunished."<p>With <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-4.htm">Jeremiah 30:4</a> is introduced the description of Israel's restoration announced in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-3.htm">Jeremiah 30:3</a>. This introduction is not absolutely necessary, but neither is it for that reason spurious and to be expunged, as Hitzig seeks to do; it rather corresponds to the breadth of Jeremiah's representation. The &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-5.htm">Jeremiah 30:5</a> is explicative: "Thus, namely, hath Jahveh spoken." With the lively dramatic power of a poet, the prophet at once transports the hearers or readers of his prophecy, in thought, into the great day to come, which is to bring deliverance to all Israel. As a day of judgment, it brings terror and anguish on all those who live to see it. &#1511;&#1493;&#1500; &#1495;&#1512;&#1491;&#1492;, "A voice (sound) of trembling (or terror) we hear," viz., the people, of whom the prophet is one. &#1508;&#1468;&#1495;&#1491; does not depend on &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, but forms with &#1493;&#1488;&#1497;&#1503; &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1501; an independent clause: "There is fear and not peace" (or safety). <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-6.htm">Jeremiah 30:6</a>. What is the cause of this great horror, which makes all men, from convulsive pains, hold their hands on their loins, so as to support their bowels, in which they feel the pangs, and which makes every countenance pale? In <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-7.htm">Jeremiah 30:7</a> the cause of this horror is declared. It is the great day of judgment that is coming. "That (not hits) day" points to the future, and thus, even apart from other reasons, excludes the supposition that it is the day of the destruction of Jerusalem that is meant. The words "that day is great" refer to <a href="http://biblehub.com/joel/2-11.htm">Joel 2:11</a>, and "there is none like it" is an imitation of <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-2.htm">Joel 2:2</a>; in the latter passage the prophet makes use of a judgment which he had seen passed on Judah - its devastation by locusts - and for the first time presents, as the main element in his prophecy, the idea of the great day of judgment to come on all nations, and by which the Lord will perfect His kingdom on this earth. This day is for Jacob also, i.e., for all Israel, a time of distress; for the judgment falls not merely on the heathen nations, but also on the godless members of the covenant people, that they may be destroyed from among the congregation of the Lord. The judgment is therefore for Israel as well as for other nations a critical juncture, from which the Israel of God, the community of the faithful, will be delivered. This deliverance is described more in detail in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-8.htm">Jeremiah 30:8</a>. The Lord will break the yoke imposed on Israel, free His people from all bondage to strangers, i.e., the heathen, so that they may serve only Him, the Lord, and David, His king, whom He will raise up. The suffix in &#1506;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493; is referred by several expositors (Hitzig, Ngelsbach) to the king of Babylon, "as having been most clearly before the minds of Jeremiah and his contemporaries;" in support of this view we are pointed to <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-27.htm">Isaiah 10:27</a>, as a passage which may have been before the eyes of Jeremiah. But neither this parallel passage nor &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;&#1498; (with the suffix of the second person), which immediately follows, sufficiently justifies this view. For, in the second half also of the verse, the second person is interchanged with the third, and &#1502;&#1493;&#1505;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;&#1498;, which is parallel with &#1506;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;, requires us to refer the suffix in the latter word to Jacob, so that "his yoke" means "the yoke laid on him," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-4.htm">1 Kings 12:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-3.htm">Isaiah 9:3</a>. It is also to be borne in mind that, throughout the whole prophecy, neither Babylon nor the king of Babylon is once mentioned; and that the judgment described in these verses cannot possibly be restricted to the downfall of the Babylonian monarchy, but is the judgment that is to fall upon all nations (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-11.htm">Jeremiah 30:11</a>). And although this judgment begins with the fall of the Babylonian supremacy, it will bring deliverance to the people of God, not merely from the yoke of Babylon, but from every yoke which strangers have laid or will lay on them.</body></html>
