Of the six or seven cities that were so called, that which comes before us here was Mizpah of Benjamin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/joshua/18-25.htm" title="Gibeon, and Ramah, and Beeroth,">Joshua 18:25-26</a>), prominent in the history of Samuel and Saul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/7-5.htm" title="And Samuel said, Gather all Israel to Mizpeh, and I will pray for you to the LORD.">1Samuel 7:5-13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/10-17.htm" title="And Samuel called the people together to the LORD to Mizpeh;">1Samuel 10:17-25</a>), not far from Gibeah of Saul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-29.htm" title="They are gone over the passage: they have taken up their lodging at Geba; Ramah is afraid; Gibeah of Saul is fled.">Isaiah 10:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/19-13.htm" title="And he said to his servant, Come, and let us draw near to one of these places to lodge all night, in Gibeah, or in Ramah.">Judges 19:13</a>). It has been identified by Dr. Robinson (B<span class= "ital">ibl. Res. </span>i. 460) with <span class= "ital">Neby-Samwil, </span>about six miles north of Jerusalem. Dean Stanley, Mr. Grove, and Dr. Bonar, however, find it in the ridge which forms a continuation of the Mount of Olives on the north, and which Josephus (<span class= "ital">Wars, </span>v. 2), apparently giving the Greek equivalent of the old Hebrew name, calls <span class= "ital">Skopos, </span>or “the watch-tower.” Mizpah, it may be noted, is twice translated <span class= "ital">Skopia </span>in the LXX. version (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/5-1.htm" title="Hear you this, O priests; and listen, you house of Israel; and give you ear, O house of the king; for judgment is toward you, because you have been a snare on Mizpah, and a net spread on Tabor.">Hosea 5:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-3.htm" title="And David went there to Mizpeh of Moab: and he said to the king of Moab, Let my father and my mother, I pray you, come forth, and be with you, till I know what God will do for me.">1Samuel 22:3</a>). It will be seen that the latter identification fits in better with the narrative than the former.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/40.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>40:1-6 The captain of the guard seems to glory that he had been God's instrument to fulfil, what Jeremiah had been God's messenger to foretell. Many can see God's justice and truth with regard to others, who are heedless and blind as to themselves and their own sins. But, sooner or later, all men shall be made sensible that their sin is the cause of all their miseries. Jeremiah has leave to dispose of himself; but is advised to go to Gedaliah, governor of the land under the king of Babylon. It is doubtful whether Jeremiah acted right in this decision. But those who desire the salvation of sinners, and the good of the church, are apt to expect better times from slight appearances, and they will prefer the hope of being useful, to the most secure situations without it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/40.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Now while he was not yet gone back - Most modern commentators render "And as he yet answered nothing, Return then, he said, to Gedaliah ..."<p>Victuals - A ration of food.<p>A reward - A present. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/40.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. Mizpah&#8212;in Benjamin, northwest of Jerusalem (Jer 41:5, 6, 9). Not the Mizpah in Gilead, beyond Jordan (Jud 10:17). Jeremiah showed his patriotism and piety in remaining in his country amidst afflictions and notwithstanding the ingratitude of the Jews, rather than go to enjoy honors and pleasures in a heathen court (Heb 11:24-26). This vindicates his purity of motive in his withdrawal (Jer 37:12-14).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/40.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Mizpah</span> was built by Asa, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-22.htm" title="Then king Asa made a proclamation throughout all Judah; none was exempted: and they took away the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, with which Baasha had built; and king Asa built with them Geba of Benjamin, and Mizpah.">1 Kings 15:22</a></span>, or rather enlarged or further built, for we read of it as a city belonging to the tribe of Benjamin, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-26.htm" title="And Mizpeh, and Chephirah, and Mozah,">Joshua 18:26</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/40.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then went Jeremiah to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah,.... A city in the tribe of Benjamin, not far from Ramathon; which, as Josephus says, was about five miles from Jerusalem. Jeremiah took the captain's advice, though it might have been better with him had he gone along with him to Babylon; but he chose rather to dwell in his own land, and suffer affliction with the people of God, than to dwell at ease in a foreign and idolatrous land: <p>and dwelt with him among the people that were left in the land; among the poor people that Nebuzaradan left, who dwelt either at Mizpah or at Anathoth, and lived as they did. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/40.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Then Jeremiah went to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> Mizpah; and dwelt with him among the people that were left in the land.</span><p>(c) Which was a city of Judah.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/40.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To Mizpah.</span> A place in the tribe of Benjamin, where Samuel judged, and where Saul was elected king (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-15.htm">1 Samuel 7:15, 16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-17.htm">1 Samuel 10:17</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/39.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Jeremiah's message of comfort to Ebedmelech. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-15.htm">Jeremiah 39:15</a>. "Now to Jeremiah there had come the word of the Lord, while he remained shut up in the court of the prison, as follows: <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-16.htm">Jeremiah 39:16</a>. Go and speak to Ebedmelech the Cushite, saying, Thus saith Jahveh of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will bring my words against this city for evil and not for good, and they shall take place before thee on that day. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-17.htm">Jeremiah 39:17</a>. But I will deliver thee on that day, saith Jahveh; neither shalt thou be given into the hand of the men of whom thou art afraid. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-18.htm">Jeremiah 39:18</a>. For I will surely save thee, neither shalt thou fall by the sword, and thine own life shall be thy spoil, because thou hast trusted me, saith Jahveh." - This word of God for Ebedmelech came to the prophet, no doubt, very soon after his deliverance from the miry pit by this pious Ethiopian; but it is not given till now, and this by way of supplement, lest its introduction previously should break the chain of events which occurred at the time of that deliverance, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-14.htm">Jeremiah 38:14-39:13</a>. Hence &#1492;&#1497;&#1492;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-15.htm">Jeremiah 39:15</a>, is to be translated as a pluperfect. "Go and say," etc., is not inconsistent with the fact that Jeremiah, from being in confinement, could not leave the court of the prison. For Ebedmelech could come into the prison, and then Jeremiah could go to him and declare the word of God. "Behold, I will bring my words against this city," i.e., I shall cause the evil with which I have threatened Jerusalem and its inhabitants to come, or, to be accomplished (&#1502;&#1489;&#1497; with &#1488; dropped, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-15.htm">Jeremiah 19:15</a>, and &#1488;&#1500;&#1470; for &#1506;&#1500;). &#1493;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468; &#1500;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1498;, "and these words are to take place before thy face," i.e., thou shalt with thine own eyes behold their fulfilment, &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493;&#1501; &#1492;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;, i.e., at the time of their occurrence. But thou shalt be saved, not fall into the hands of the enemy and be killed, but carry away thy body out of it all as booty; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-9.htm">Jeremiah 21:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-2.htm">Jeremiah 38:2</a>. "Because thou hast trusted me;" i.e., through the aid afforded to my prophet thou hast continued thy faith in me. </body></html>
