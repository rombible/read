But how soon is this hopeful prospect blighted! When God begins a judgment, he will complete it. While pride, ambition, or revenge, bears rule in the heart, men will form new projects, and be restless in mischief, which commonly ends in their own ruin. Who would have thought, that after the destruction of Jerusalem, rebellion would so soon have sprung up? There can be no thorough change but what grace makes. And if the miserable, who are kept in everlasting chains for the judgment of the great day, were again permitted to come on earth, the sin and evil of their nature would be unchanged. Lord, give us new hearts, and that new mind in which the new birth consists, since thou hast said we cannot without it see thy heavenly kingdom.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/40.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>To serve the Chaldeans - literally, as margin; to be their minister and lieutenant. Gedaliah supposed that officers of high rank would come from time to time from Babylon to look after the king's interests. But whatever was ordered would be done through him, as being the prime minister.<p>Gather ye wine - As Jerusalem was captured in the fifth month, August, it would now be autumn, and there would be fruit upon the trees, enough to maintain the scanty population during the winter.<p>Taken - Or, seized. Every captain had probably occupied some place by force as his head quarters, and Gedaliah bids them retain them.

But when they heard that the king of Babylon had set a governor of their own religion and country over them, they came back to him; and there being few people left in the land, which was of itself wonderfully fruitful, they gathered a great plenty of grapes and other summer fruits which the country produced. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/40.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Even all the Jews returned from all places whither they were driven,.... Through fear of the Chaldean army; they came all of them from the several countries before mentioned; so that here was like to be a happy settlement and a flourishing commonwealth again; here being princes and generals, soldiers and common people, in large numbers, that were returned and coalesced under the government of Gedaliah: <p>and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah, unto Mizpah; they came out of the several countries where they had been for some time, and entered the land of Judah; but did not take up their abode anywhere, till they had presented themselves to the governor, and put themselves under his protection; promising, no doubt, to regard him as such, and to be tributary to the Chaldeans; being assured by him, as the generals and their forces before, that all would be well with them, giving them free liberty to settle in the cities and villages to which they belonged; and accordingly they set out from Mizpah, and went to their respective habitations they had abandoned: <p>and gathered wine and summer fruits very much; See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/40-10.htm">Jeremiah 40:10</a>; the people of the land being carried captive; and the Chaldean army not having ravaged these parts, or however had left an abundance of fruits, which these people, at their return, found and gathered. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/40.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Even all the Jews returned out of all places whither they were driven, and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah, unto Mizpah, and gathered wine and summer fruits very much.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/40.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">12</span>. <span class="ital">gathered wine … very much</span>] This was done in the 6th month (Aug.–Sept.), only two months (cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-2.htm" title="And in the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, the ninth day of the month, the city was broken up.">Jeremiah 39:2</a>) after the capture of the city.

If it please thee to come with me to Babylon, then come, and I will set mine eye upon thee (i.e., take thee under my protection, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-12.htm">Jeremiah 39:12</a>). But if it please thee not to come with me to Babylon, then let it be so. See, the whole country is before thee (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/13-9.htm">Genesis 13:9</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/20-5.htm">Genesis 20:5</a>, etc.); whithersoever it pleases thee, and seems right to thee to go, go." <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/40-5.htm">Jeremiah 40:5</a>. And because Jeremiah had not yet returned, he said, "Go back to Gedaliah,...whom the king of Babylon hath set over the cities of Judah, and remain with him among the people; or go wherever it seemeth right to thee to go." And the commander of the guard gave him what provisions he required and a present, and sent him away; thereafter Jeremiah went to Gedaliah to Mizpah, and remained there among the people who had been left behind in the land (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/40-6.htm">Jeremiah 40:6</a>). The words &#1493;&#1506;&#1491;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;  were certainly misunderstood by the old translators, who made various conjectures as to their meaning; even yet, Dahler, Movers, Graf, and N&#1492;gelsbach are of opinion that "it is impossible to understand" this sentence, and that the text is plainly corrupt. Luther renders: "for no one will any longer return thither." Hitzig considers this translation substantially correct, and only requiring to be a little more exactly rendered: "but there, no one returns home again." Apart, however, from the consideration that on this view &#1506;&#1491;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;, which stands at the head of the sentence, does not get full justice paid to it, the thought does not accord with what precedes, and the reference of the suffix to the indefinite "person" or "one" is extremely forced. According to what goes before, in which Nebuzaradan gives the prophet full liberty of choosing whether he would go with him to Babylon or remain in the country, in whatever part he likes, and from the following advice which he gives him, "Go, or return, to Gedaliah," the words &#1506;&#1491;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; &#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;, on account of the third person (&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;), cannot certainly be an address of the chief captain to Jeremiah, and as little can they contain a remark about going to Babylon. The words are evidently, both as to their form and their contents, a circumstantial clause, containing a statement regarding the relation of Jeremiah to the proposal of the chief captain (and this is the view taken long ago by Kimchi), i.e., a parenthetical remark of the narrator, according to which Nebuzaradan demands that he shall remain with Gedaliah, in the sense, "and yet he was not going back," or, still better, on account of the imperfect &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;, "because he was still unwilling to go back," namely, to this or that place indefinitely; then Nebuzaradan further said, "Return, then, to Gedaliah." If we supply &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; before '&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1492; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;, with which Nebuzaradan brings the matter to a close, the meaning is quite clear. It is evident from <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/40-4.htm">Jeremiah 40:4</a> that Nebuzaradan stopped a little in order to let Jeremiah decide; but since the prophet did not return, i.e., neither decided in the one way nor the other, he adds '&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1492; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;, and thereby puts an end to the indecision. &#1488;&#1512;&#1495;&#1492; means a portion of food, or victuals; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-34.htm">Jeremiah 52:34</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-17.htm">Proverbs 15:17</a>. Mizpah, where Gedaliah had taken up his position, is the Mizpah of the tribe of Benjamin, where Samuel judged the people and chose Saul to be king (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-15.htm">1 Samuel 7:15</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-17.htm">Jeremiah 10:17</a>); doubtless the modern Neby Samwil, five miles north-west from Jerusalem, a short distance south-west from Ramah; see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-26.htm">Joshua 18:26</a>. </body></html>
