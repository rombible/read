The commanders of the armies that had fought against the invader in the open country found it hopeless to continue the struggle after the capture of Jerusalem. What were they to do? The king of Babylon had, by appointing Gedaliah, himself a prince of Judah, shown a disposition to treat the conquered people leniently.

But how soon is this hopeful prospect blighted! When God begins a judgment, he will complete it. While pride, ambition, or revenge, bears rule in the heart, men will form new projects, and be restless in mischief, which commonly ends in their own ruin. Who would have thought, that after the destruction of Jerusalem, rebellion would so soon have sprung up? There can be no thorough change but what grace makes. And if the miserable, who are kept in everlasting chains for the judgment of the great day, were again permitted to come on earth, the sin and evil of their nature would be unchanged. Lord, give us new hearts, and that new mind in which the new birth consists, since thou hast said we cannot without it see thy heavenly kingdom.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/40.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The men would be the old and infirm: the women those whose husbands and protectors had perished in the wars (e. g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/41-10.htm">Jeremiah 41:10</a>).

Even Du. on the other hand accepts it as in the main an extract from Baruch’s memoirs, adding that it forms one of the most remarkable and interesting accounts in the O.T. Difficulties in the narrative as it stands will be mentioned in the notes. The section may be summarized as follows. (i) <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/40-7.htm" title="Now when all the captains of the forces which were in the fields, even they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land, and had committed to him men, and women, and children, and of the poor of the land, of them that were not carried away captive to Babylon;...">Jeremiah 40:7-12</a></span>. On Gedaliah’s being made governor of those left in the land, Ishmael and other captains came to him and received an assurance that, if they were loyal to Babylon, they should receive protection. He exhorts them to occupy themselves in gathering the produce of the land. The same is thereupon done by many Jews who now return from taking refuge in neighbouring countries. (ii) <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/40-13.htm" title="Moreover Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were in the fields, came to Gedaliah to Mizpah,...">Jeremiah 40:13-16</a></span>. Johanan warns Gedaliah that Baalis, king of Ammon, had instigated Ishmael to kill him, and asks permission to slay the latter. Gedaliah refuses to believe the charge. (iii) <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/41-1.htm" title="Now it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, and the princes of the king, even ten men with him, came to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and there they did eat bread together in Mizpah....">Jeremiah 41:1-3</a>.

The heading of our verse cannot refer to this prophecy, not merely for the reason that it is too far removed, but still more because it has a historical notice introducing it, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/42-1.htm">Jeremiah 42:1-6</a>. Our superscription rather refers to <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-1.htm">Jeremiah 1:1-3</a>; and &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; here, as well as there, means, not a single prophecy, but a number of prophecies. Just as &#1491;&#1489;&#1512; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-2.htm">Jeremiah 1:2</a> forms the heading for all the prophecies uttered by Jeremiah from the thirteenth year of Josiah till the destruction of Jerusalem and the carrying away of the people in the eleventh year of Zedekiah, so the words '&#1492;&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; of this verse form the superscription for the prophecies which Jeremiah uttered after the destruction of Jerusalem, i.e., to the section formed by <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/40.htm">Jeremiah 40-45</a>, although <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44.htm">Jeremiah 44</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/45-1.htm">Jeremiah 45:1-5</a> have headings of their own; these, however, are subordinate to the heading of this chapter, in the same way as the titles in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-1.htm">Jeremiah 7:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-11.htm">Jeremiah 11:11</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-1.htm">Jeremiah 14:1</a>, etc. fall under the general title given in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-2.htm">Jeremiah 1:2-3</a>. - Regarding Nebuzaradan and the discharge of Jeremiah at Ramah (i.e., er Rm, see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-15.htm">Jeremiah 31:15</a>), cf. the explanations given on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-13.htm">Jeremiah 39:13</a> (p. 335 of this volume). In what follows, from &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493; onwards, further details are given regarding Jeremiah's liberation. "When he (Nebuzaradan) sent for him, he (Jeremiah), bound with fetters, was among all the captives of Jerusalem and Judah who were being carried away to Babylon." Those who were to be carried away had been gathered together to Ramah, which lies about five miles north from Jerusalem; thence they were to set out for Babylon. &#1488;&#1494;&#1511;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; ( equals  &#1494;&#1511;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/36-8.htm">Job 36:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-14.htm">Isaiah 45:14</a>), "fetters," - here, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/40-4.htm">Jeremiah 40:4</a>, "manacles," by which, perhaps, two or more prisoners were fastened to one another.</body></html>
