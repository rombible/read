But how soon is this hopeful prospect blighted! When God begins a judgment, he will complete it. While pride, ambition, or revenge, bears rule in the heart, men will form new projects, and be restless in mischief, which commonly ends in their own ruin. Who would have thought, that after the destruction of Jerusalem, rebellion would so soon have sprung up? There can be no thorough change but what grace makes. And if the miserable, who are kept in everlasting chains for the judgment of the great day, were again permitted to come on earth, the sin and evil of their nature would be unchanged. Lord, give us new hearts, and that new mind in which the new birth consists, since thou hast said we cannot without it see thy heavenly kingdom.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/40.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>It is difficult to say what object Baalis can have had in murdering Gedaliah. As an ally of Zedekiah <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-3.htm">Jeremiah 27:3</a>, he may have had a spite against the family of Ahikam for opposing, as most probably they did at Jeremiah's instigation, the league proposed <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27.htm">Jeremiah 27</a>. Ishmael's motive was envy and spite at seeing a subject who had always opposed the war now invested with kingly power, in place of the royal family. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/40.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16. thou speakest falsely&#8212;a mystery of providence that God should permit the righteous, in spite of warning, thus to rush into the trap laid for them!

The event related in the following chapter shows that the information was good, and that it was no lie or calumny that was told; and it would have been well for Gedaliah, and the people of the Jews, had he given credit to it; but the time was not come for the Jewish commonwealth to be restored; and things were thus suffered to be, for the further punishment of the sins of that people. <p>(z)    "noli facere hoc verbum", V.

Jeremiah is taken in chains to Ramah. There Nebuzaradan, after declaring that Jerusalem’s fall was a just consequence of the people’s sins, gives the prophet his choice between going with him to Babylon, and dwelling with Gedaliah or elsewhere as he may choose.

These men, who had borne arms against the Chaldeans, were concerned for their safety when they returned into the country. Gedaliah sware to them, i.e., promised them on oath, "Be not afraid to serve the Chaldeans; remain in the country and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you. And as for me, behold, I shall remain at Mizpah to stand before the Chaldeans who will come to us," i.e., as lieutenant of the king of Babylon, to represent you before the Chaldean officers and armies, to maintain your rights and interests, so that you may be able to settle down where you choose, without anxiety, and cultivate the land.
