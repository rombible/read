But how soon is this hopeful prospect blighted! When God begins a judgment, he will complete it. While pride, ambition, or revenge, bears rule in the heart, men will form new projects, and be restless in mischief, which commonly ends in their own ruin. Who would have thought, that after the destruction of Jerusalem, rebellion would so soon have sprung up? There can be no thorough change but what grace makes. And if the miserable, who are kept in everlasting chains for the judgment of the great day, were again permitted to come on earth, the sin and evil of their nature would be unchanged. Lord, give us new hearts, and that new mind in which the new birth consists, since thou hast said we cannot without it see thy heavenly kingdom.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/40.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>To serve the Chaldeans - literally, as margin; to be their minister and lieutenant. Gedaliah supposed that officers of high rank would come from time to time from Babylon to look after the king's interests. But whatever was ordered would be done through him, as being the prime minister.<p>Gather ye wine - As Jerusalem was captured in the fifth month, August, it would now be autumn, and there would be fruit upon the trees, enough to maintain the scanty population during the winter.<p>Taken - Or, seized. Every captain had probably occupied some place by force as his head quarters, and Gedaliah bids them retain them. He frankly accepts the whole existing state of things, as a necessary step toward re-establishing confidence. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/40.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. Fear not&#8212;They were afraid that they should not obtain pardon from the Chaldeans for their acts. He therefore assured them of safety by an oath.<p>serve&#8212;literally, "to stand before" (Jer 40:10; Jer 52:12), that is, to be at hand ready to execute the commands of the king of Babylon.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/40.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> They might reasonably suspect that the Chaldeans would have a jealous eye upon any conflux of people to Jerusalem, especially military men, and therefore be something suspicious of him who was the Chaldean deputy governor; the securing of them from fears on this account was the cause of this voluntary oath taken by Gedaliah. He encourageth them to be servants to the Chaldeans, and to dwell in the land, assuring them that if they would, they should fare well; he was well enough assured of the Chaldeans’ favour, that if they would live peaceably in their own land, they should, they would not come any more to carry them away captive. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/40.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan aware unto them and to their men,.... They might express their fears, that should they continue with Gedaliah, as they were inclined to do, could they be safe; that seeing they had encouraged Zedekiah to hold out the siege to the last against the Chaldeans, and they should hear where they were, would demand them, and they, should be taken and delivered up into their hands; upon which Gedaliah not only promises them safety, but swears to them that they should live safely with him, and never be delivered up to the Chaldeans, and that he would undertake to indemnify them, and preserve them: <p>saying, fear not to serve the Chaldeans; as if it was an evil to do it; or as if their yoke was hard and intolerable; or as if it would be unprofitable, and turn to no account; or they should be always in danger of their lives: <p>dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall he well with you; settle in the land, and do not rove about from place to place like fugitives; nor go out of the land through fear of the king of Babylon, but continue in it, and live in subjection to him, and depend upon it you will live comfortably and safely. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/40.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan sware unto them and to their men, saying, Fear not to serve the Chaldeans: dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/40.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">9</span>. <span class="ital">to serve the Chaldeans</span>] The LXX here have “because of the servants of the Chaldaeans,” i.e. the officers placed here and there through the land by the conquerors. This agrees with MT. in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-24.htm" title="And Gedaliah swore to them, and to their men, and said to them, Fear not to be the servants of the Chaldees: dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon; and it shall be well with you.">2 Kings 25:24</a>, but probably the original reading of the Hebrew in both places (lost through confusing two very similar consonants) is that preserved by LXX in Kgs, viz. <span class="bld">the passing through</span> <span class="ital">of the Chaldaeans</span>, i.e. the danger arising from the frequent passage of Babylonian forces in military operations, such as attacks on Egypt.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/40.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When Jeremiah had been brought, the commander of the guards said to him, "The Lord thy God hath declared this evil against this place, and the Lord hath brought it on (brought it to pass), and hath done as He spake; for ye have sinned against the Lord, and have not hearkened to His voice: thus hath this thing happened to you." The mode of expression is that of Jeremiah; but Nebuzaradan may have expressed the thought, that now there had been fulfilled what Jeremiah had predicted in the name of God, because the people, by their rebellion, had broken the oath they had sworn before their God (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-13.htm">Ezekiel 17:13</a>.), and had thereby sinned against Him.
