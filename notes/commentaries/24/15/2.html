And, without doubt, the king of Babylon removed them into several kingdoms belonging to his large empire. These, it must be observed, are the very words of Moses, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-25.htm" title="The LORD shall cause you to be smitten before your enemies: you shall go out one way against them, and flee seven ways before them: and shall be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth.">Deuteronomy 28:25</a>,) where he threatens the Israelites with a general dispersion over the world, which threatening received its completion, in part, by the Babylonish captivity, but more perfectly after the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans. <span class="ital">Because of Manasseh </span>— In idolatry and other abominations he exceeded all the kings that preceded him: see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/21-7.htm" title="And he set a graven image of the grove that he had made in the house, of which the LORD said to David, and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever:...">2 Kings 21:7-11</a>. In his time the public worship of God was wholly suppressed, and idolatry introduced into the very temple; the law of God was likewise quite laid aside, and, in a manner, forgotten, as appears by the surprise Hilkiah was in when he found the original copy of the law in the house of the Lord. So that his sins filled up the measure of the Jews’ iniquities; and therefore, notwithstanding the reformation wrought afterward by Josiah, the Lord turned not from the fierceness of his wrath kindled against Judah: see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-26.htm" title="Notwithstanding the LORD turned not from the fierceness of his great wrath, with which his anger was kindled against Judah, because of all the provocations that Manasseh had provoked him with.">2 Kings 23:26</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/24-3.htm" title="Surely at the commandment of the LORD came this on Judah, to remove them out of his sight, for the sins of Manasseh, according to all that he did;...">2 Kings 24:3-4</a>. It must be observed, however, that it was not merely for his sins, or the sins of his times, that God so dreadfully punished the Jews in the days of Jehoiakim and Zedekiah; but it was also, and especially because they imitated the wicked example which Manasseh had set them, the reformation effected by Josiah being only partial, and of not long continuance. <span class="ital">For who shall, </span>or, <span class="ital">who will, have pity upon thee, O Jerusalem </span>— Thy sins render thee unworthy of pity, and all that see the calamities brought upon thee will acknowledge them to be just. <span class="ital">Who will go aside, </span>&c. — Who will be so much concerned for thee as to step a little out of his way to inquire after thee; a common instance of respect between persons in any degree acquainted.

The putting of this as a case, though they should stand before him, shows that they do not, and that saints in heaven do not pray for saints on earth. The Jews were condemned to different kinds of misery by the righteous judgment of God, and the remnant would be driven away, like the chaff, into captivity. Then was the populous city made desolate. Bad examples and misused authority often produce fatal effects, even after men are dead, or have repented of their crimes: this should make all greatly dread being the occasion of sin in others.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Cast them out of my sight - Rather, "send them out of My presence, and let them go away."

Death, sword, famine, captivity, lie in wait for them in every possible road. "Death" here means "pestilence" (comp. "the black <span class="accented">death"</span> in the Middle Ages), as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-21.htm">Jeremiah 18:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/27-15.htm">Job 27:15</a>. Similar combinations of evils occur in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/43-11.htm">Jeremiah 43:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-21.htm">Ezekiel 14:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-27.htm">Ezekiel 33:27</a>. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/14.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The words, "and speak unto them this word," surprise us, because no word from God follows, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-12.htm">Jeremiah 13:12</a>, but an exposition of the prophet's feelings in regard to the dreadful judgment announced. Hence Dahl. and Ew. propose to join the words in question with what goes before, while at the same time Ew. hints a suspicion that an entire sentence has been dropped after the words. But for this suspicion there is no ground, and the joining of the words with the preceding context is contrary to the unfailing usage of this by no means infrequent formula. The true explanation is found in Kimchi and Calvin. The prophet is led to exhibit to the hardened people the grief and pain he feels in contemplating the coming ruin of Judah, ut pavorem illis incuteret, si forte, cum haec audirent, resipiscerent (Kimchi). If not his words, then surely his tears; for the terrible calamity he has to announce must touch and stagger them, so that they may be persuaded to examine themselves and consider what it is that tends to their peace. To make impression on their hardened consciences, he depicts the appalling ruin, because of which his eyes run with tears day and night. On "run down," etc., cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-17.htm">Jeremiah 9:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-17.htm">Jeremiah 13:17</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-18.htm">Lamentations 2:18</a>, etc. "Let them not cease" gives emphasis: not be silent, at peace, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-49.htm">Lamentations 3:49</a>, i.e., weep incessantly day and night. The appellation of the people: virgin-daughter of my people, i.e., daughter that is my people, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-11.htm">Jeremiah 8:11</a>, corresponds to the love revealing itself in tears. The depth of sorrow is further shown in the clause: with a blow that is very dangerous, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-19.htm">Jeremiah 10:19</a>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-18.htm">Jeremiah 14:18</a> the prophet portrays the condition of things after the fall of Jerusalem: out upon the field are those pierced with the sword; in the city &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497; , lit., suffering of famine, <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-21.htm">Deuteronomy 29:21</a>, here abstr. pro concr. of those pining in famine; and those that remain in life depart into exile. Instead of the people Jeremiah mentions only the prophets and priests as being the flower of God's people. &#1505;&#1495;&#1512;, to wander about, in Hebr. usually in the way of commerce, here acc. to Aram. usage, possibly too with the idea of begging subjoined. In the &#1493;&#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1491;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468; Graf holds the &#1493; to be entirely out of place, while Hitz. pronounces against him. The words are variously taken; e.g., and know nothing, wander about aimless and helpless. But with this the omission of the article with &#1488;&#1512;&#1509; is incompatible. The omission shows that "and now not" furnishes an attribute to "into a land." We therefore translate: and know it not  equals  which they know not, since the pronominal suffix is wont to be often omitted where it can without difficulty be supplied from the preceding clause. </body></html>
