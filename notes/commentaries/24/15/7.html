The putting of this as a case, though they should stand before him, shows that they do not, and that saints in heaven do not pray for saints on earth. The Jews were condemned to different kinds of misery by the righteous judgment of God, and the remnant would be driven away, like the chaff, into captivity. Then was the populous city made desolate.

"In the gates"; English Version draws the image from a man cleaning corn with a fan; he stands at the gate of the threshing-floor in the open air, to remove the wheat from the chaff by means of the wind; so God threatens to remove Israel out of the bounds of the land [Houbigant].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/15.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">I will fan them with a fan in the gates of the land; </span> not a purging fan by affliction, to separate their chaff and dross from them, but a scattering fan.

The mixture of corn, chaff, and broken straw, produced by threshing, was shaken about with these two implements, usually in some exposed spot, when a wind was blowing (generally in the afternoon or evening, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/3-2.htm" title="And now is not Boaz of our kindred, with whose maidens you were? Behold, he winnows barley to night in the threshing floor.">Ruth 3:2</a>), and the wind carried away the chaff and the straw (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/1-4.htm" title="The ungodly are not so: but are like the chaff which the wind drives away.">Psalm 1:4</a>). If however the wind was too violent it would blow away the corn as well: hence the point of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-11.htm" title="At that time shall it be said to this people and to Jerusalem, A dry wind of the high places in the wilderness toward the daughter of my people, not to fan, nor to cleanse,">Jeremiah 4:11</a>.” <span class="ital">Ibid</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the gates of the land</span>] the <span class="ital">borders</span> (the parts by which men enter and leave the country).

Even Moses and Samuel, who stood so far in God's favour that by their supplications they repeatedly rescued their people from overwhelming ruin (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/17-11.htm">Exodus 17:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-11.htm">Exodus 32:11</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-13.htm">Numbers 14:13</a>., and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-9.htm">1 Samuel 7:9</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-17.htm">Jeremiah 12:17</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/99-6.htm">Psalm 99:6</a>), if they were to come now before the Lord, would not incline His love towards this people. &#1488;&#1500; indicates the direction of the soul towards any one; in this connection: the inclination of it towards the people. He has cast off this people and will no longer let them come before His face. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-2.htm">Jeremiah 15:2-9</a> this is set forth with terrible earnestness. We must supply the object, "this people," to "drive" from the preceding clause. "From my face" implies the people's standing before the Lord in the temple, where they had appeared bringing sacrifices, and by prayer invoking His help (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-12.htm">Jeremiah 14:12</a>). To go forth from the temple  equals  to go forth from God's face. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-2.htm">Jeremiah 15:2</a>. But in case they ask where they are to go to, Jeremiah is to give them the sarcastic direction: Each to the destruction allotted to him. He that is appointed to death, shall go forth to death, etc. The clauses: such as are for death, etc., are to be filled up after the analogy of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-20.htm">2 Samuel 15:20</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-1.htm">2 Kings 8:1</a>, so that before the second "death," "sword," etc., we supply the verb "shall go." There are mentioned four kinds of punishments that are to befall the people. The "death" mentioned over and above the sword is death by disease, for which we have in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-12.htm">Jeremiah 14:12</a> &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;, pestilence, disease; cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/43-11.htm">Jeremiah 43:11</a>, where death, captivity, and sword are mentioned together, with <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-21.htm">Ezekiel 14:21</a>, sword, famine, wild beasts, and disease (&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;), and <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-27.htm">Ezekiel 33:27</a>, sword, wild beasts, and disease. This doom is made more terrible in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-3.htm">Jeremiah 15:3</a>. The Lord will appoint over them (&#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1491; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-21.htm">Jeremiah 13:21</a>) four kinds, i.e., four different destructive powers which shall prepare a miserable end for them. One is the sword already mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-2.htm">Jeremiah 15:2</a>, which slays them; the three others are to execute judgment on the dead: the dogs which shall tear, mutilate, and partly devour the dead bodies (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-35.htm">2 Kings 9:35</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-37.htm">2 Kings 9:37</a>), and birds and beasts of prey, vultures, jackals, and others, which shall make an end of such portions as are left by the dogs. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-4.htm">Jeremiah 15:4</a> the whole is summed up in the threatening of <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-25.htm">Deuteronomy 28:25</a>, that the people shall be delivered over to be abused to all the kingdoms of the earth, and the cause of this terrible judgment is mentioned.
