But here God says, that if these very persons were alive, and in that near attendance to him which they formerly enjoyed, (for that is the import of the phrase, <span class="ital">To stand before him,</span>) yet even their prayers should not avert his judgments from this people.” — Lowth. <span class="ital">Cast them out of my sight </span>— Declare that they shall be cast out, as that which is in the highest degree odious and offensive; or tell them to come no more to me with their supplications, but to go out of my sanctuary. A strong declaration of determined displeasure. Thus the Lord dismisses them with a severity whereof we have few examples in Scripture. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-14.htm" title="Though these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they should deliver but their own souls by their righteousness, said the Lord GOD.">Ezekiel 14:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-16.htm" title="Though these three men were in it, as I live, said the Lord GOD, they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters; they only shall be delivered, but the land shall be desolate.">Ezekiel 14:16</a>.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/15.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>15:1-9 The Lord declares that even Moses and Samuel must have pleaded in vain.

The Jews were condemned to different kinds of misery by the righteous judgment of God, and the remnant would be driven away, like the chaff, into captivity. Then was the populous city made desolate. Bad examples and misused authority often produce fatal effects, even after men are dead, or have repented of their crimes: this should make all greatly dread being the occasion of sin in others.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Cast them out of my sight - Rather, "send them out of My presence, and let them go away."

In answer to his expostulations and entreaties, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-19.htm">Jeremiah 14:19</a>, <p>though Moses and Samuel stood before me; to pray before me, as the Targum; to make intercession for the people. Standing is a prayer gesture. The Jews say there is no standing but prayer, or that is meant when it is mentioned; See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-5.htm">Matthew 6:5</a>. Moses and Samuel were named, because they were eminent for prayer, and had success in it, for the people of Israel. Of Moses, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-11.htm">Exodus 32:11</a> and of Samuel, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-9.htm">1 Samuel 7:9</a> and of both, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/99-6.htm">Psalm 99:6</a>. The Arabic version reads "Moses and Aaron", but wrongly. The Palmists make use of this text to prove the intercession of saints in heaven for those on earth; but the words are only a supposition, and not a fact. The meaning is, that supposing that Moses and Samuel were alive, and made intercession for the people, their prayers would not be regarded; and such a supposition, as it suggests that they were not alive, so that they did not stand before him, and make intercession for Judah; wherefore this is against, and not for, the intercession of saints in heaven: <p>yet my mind could not be towards this people; God could have no good will to them, no delight in them; could not be reconciled to them, or agree to it, that the favours asked for should be granted them, or that they should be continued in their own land; and therefore it was in vain for the prophet to solicit on their account; but, on the other hand, it is ordered as follows: <p>cast them out of my sight; or presence; as persons loathsome and abominable, not to be borne; I cannot look upon them, or have anything to say to them, in a favourable way: <p>and let them go forth; from my presence, from the temple, the city, and out of their own land; that is, declare that so it shall be. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/15.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Then said the LORD to me, <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> Though Moses and Samuel stood before me, <i>yet</i> my mind <i>could</i> not <i>be</i> toward this people: cast <i>them</i> out of my sight, and let them go forth.</span><p>(a) Meaning that if there were any man living moved with so great zeal toward the people as were these two, yet he would not grant this request, as he had determined the contrary, Eze 14:14.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/15.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-1.htm" title="Then said the LORD to me, Though Moses and Samuel stood before me, yet my mind could not be toward this people: cast them out of my sight, and let them go forth."><span class="bld">Jeremiah 15:1</a>.</span> <span class="ital">Though Moses and Samuel stood before me</span>] No advocate, however powerful his intercession, could now prevail with Me.

If even a Moses or a Samuel would intercede in vain, the case of the Judahites must indeed be desperate. For these were the nearest of all the prophets to Jehovah, and repeatedly prayed their people out of grievous calamity (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/99-6.htm">Psalm 99:6</a>). Jeremiah had already sought to intercede for his people (see on Jeremiah 7:16). <span class="cmt_word">Cast them out of my sight;</span> rather, <span class="accented">Dismiss them from my presence</span>. The people are represented as praying or sacrificing in the fore courts of the temple. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/14.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The words, "and speak unto them this word," surprise us, because no word from God follows, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-12.htm">Jeremiah 13:12</a>, but an exposition of the prophet's feelings in regard to the dreadful judgment announced. Hence Dahl. and Ew. propose to join the words in question with what goes before, while at the same time Ew. hints a suspicion that an entire sentence has been dropped after the words. But for this suspicion there is no ground, and the joining of the words with the preceding context is contrary to the unfailing usage of this by no means infrequent formula. The true explanation is found in Kimchi and Calvin. The prophet is led to exhibit to the hardened people the grief and pain he feels in contemplating the coming ruin of Judah, ut pavorem illis incuteret, si forte, cum haec audirent, resipiscerent (Kimchi). If not his words, then surely his tears; for the terrible calamity he has to announce must touch and stagger them, so that they may be persuaded to examine themselves and consider what it is that tends to their peace. To make impression on their hardened consciences, he depicts the appalling ruin, because of which his eyes run with tears day and night. On "run down," etc., cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-17.htm">Jeremiah 9:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-17.htm">Jeremiah 13:17</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-18.htm">Lamentations 2:18</a>, etc. "Let them not cease" gives emphasis: not be silent, at peace, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-49.htm">Lamentations 3:49</a>, i.e., weep incessantly day and night. The appellation of the people: virgin-daughter of my people, i.e., daughter that is my people, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-11.htm">Jeremiah 8:11</a>, corresponds to the love revealing itself in tears. The depth of sorrow is further shown in the clause: with a blow that is very dangerous, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-19.htm">Jeremiah 10:19</a>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-18.htm">Jeremiah 14:18</a> the prophet portrays the condition of things after the fall of Jerusalem: out upon the field are those pierced with the sword; in the city &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497; , lit., suffering of famine, <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-21.htm">Deuteronomy 29:21</a>, here abstr. pro concr. of those pining in famine; and those that remain in life depart into exile. Instead of the people Jeremiah mentions only the prophets and priests as being the flower of God's people. &#1505;&#1495;&#1512;, to wander about, in Hebr. usually in the way of commerce, here acc. to Aram. usage, possibly too with the idea of begging subjoined. In the &#1493;&#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1491;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468; Graf holds the &#1493; to be entirely out of place, while Hitz. pronounces against him. The words are variously taken; e.g., and know nothing, wander about aimless and helpless. But with this the omission of the article with &#1488;&#1512;&#1509; is incompatible. The omission shows that "and now not" furnishes an attribute to "into a land." We therefore translate: and know it not  equals  which they know not, since the pronominal suffix is wont to be often omitted where it can without difficulty be supplied from the preceding clause. </body></html>
