The putting of this as a case, though they should stand before him, shows that they do not, and that saints in heaven do not pray for saints on earth. The Jews were condemned to different kinds of misery by the righteous judgment of God, and the remnant would be driven away, like the chaff, into captivity. Then was the populous city made desolate. Bad examples and misused authority often produce fatal effects, even after men are dead, or have repented of their crimes: this should make all greatly dread being the occasion of sin in others.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>To be removed - Rather, "to be a terror."<p>Because of Manasseh the son of Hezekiah - The name of the pious father intensifies the horror at the wickedness of the son. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. go aside &#8230; how thou doest&#8212;Who will turn aside (in passing by) to salute thee (to wish thee "peace")?<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/15.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The sum of this is, that this people should be in a most miserable, pitiless state and condition; none should regard them in the day of their calamity, nor so much as once inquire after them, or how they fared, or what they did. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/15.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For who shall have pity upon thee, O Jerusalem?....
