The latter part of the sentence is better taken with the LXX., Vulg., and Luther, “<span class= "ital">thou wilt not hearken unto me </span>“; or the form of the question altered so as to imply that answer.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/jeremiah/38.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-15.htm" title="Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, If I declare it to you, will you not surely put me to death? and if I give you counsel, will you not listen to me?">Jeremiah 38:15</a></span>. <span class="ital">Then Jeremiah said, If I declare it unto thee, wilt thou not surely put me to death? — </span>“The prophet had so much experience of the unsteadiness of the king’s temper, of his backwardness in following good counsel, and want of courage to stand by those that durst advise him well, that he might, with good reason, resolve not to venture his life to serve a man that was in a manner incapable of being directed. And although God had showed him what would be the effect of his advice, if it were followed, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-17.htm" title="Then said Jeremiah to Zedekiah, Thus said the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel; If you will assuredly go forth to the king of Babylon's princes, then your soul shall live, and this city shall not be burned with fire; and you shall live, and your house:">Jeremiah 38:17</a>,) yet it doth not appear that he had commanded him to make this known to Zedekiah.” — Lowth. <span class="ital">And if I give thee counsel, wilt thou not hearken unto me? </span>— Rather, <span class="ital">wilt thou hearken unto me? </span>Which is undoubtedly the sense intended, unless we translate the words, as some do, without an interrogation, <span class="ital">thou wilt not hearken unto me. </span>So Jeremiah might well conclude from the king’s former behaviour, for he had often been advised by him, but would never take his advice, and the prophet knew the same would be the case still, that the king would be overruled by a corrupt court and his own aversion to change his state as a king to the state of a prisoner.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/38.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>38:14-28 Jeremiah was not forward to repeat the warnings, which seemed only to endanger his own life, and to add to the king's guilt, but asked whether he feared to do the will of God.

Rather translate, "Thou wilt not hearken to me." Jeremiah judges so from the past conduct of the king. Compare Jer 38:17 with Jer 38:19.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/38.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Jeremiah had reason to caution with the king for his life, considering the easy answer of the king to the princes, moving for his death, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-4.htm" title="Therefore the princes said to the king, We beseech you, let this man be put to death: for thus he weakens the hands of the men of war that remain in this city, and the hands of all the people, in speaking such words to them: for this man seeks not the welfare of this people, but the hurt.">Jeremiah 38:4</a>,5</span>. We must imagine Jeremiah at this time under no Divine command to reveal God’s will in this case unto the king. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Wilt thou not?</span> is here as much as thou wilt not hearken unto me. Zedekiah had often been advised by the prophet, but would never take his advice, and the prophet knew it would be the same case still, that the king would be overruled by a corrupt court, and his own aversion, to change his state, as a king, for the state of a prisoner. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/38.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then Jeremiah said unto Zedekiah,.... Here follows the prophets answer, in which he tacitly desires to be excused saying any thing upon this head, since it might be attended with danger to himself, and be of no service to the king; and therefore prudently thought fit to come into some agreement with the king, to secure himself, if he insisted upon it: <p>if I declare it unto thee, wilt thou not surely put me to death? this he might fear, from past experience of the king's conduct; for, though he might not slay him with his own hands, or give orders to others to do it; yet he might deliver him up to the will and mercy of his princes, as he had done before; not that the prophet was afraid to die, or was deterred through fear of death from delivering the word of the Lord, and doing his work; but he thought it proper to make use of prudent means to preserve his life; besides, he had no express order from the Lord to say anything concerning this matter at this time: <p>and if give thee counsel, wilt thou not hearken to me? or, "thou wilt not hearken to me" (z); so the Targum, Syriac, and Vulgate Latin versions; and therefore it was to no purpose to give him any advice; from all this the king might easily understand the prophet had nothing to say that would be agreeable to him; however, he was very desirous to know what it was, and therefore promises indemnity and security, as follows: <p>(z)   "non audies me", V.

Ebedmelech the Cushite, a eunuch, heard of what had happened to Jeremiah. &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1505;&#1512;&#1497;&#1505; .haimer signifies a eunuch: the &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; shows that &#1505;&#1512;&#1497;&#1505; is here to be taken in its proper meaning, not in the metaphorical sense of an officer of the court. Since the king had many wives (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-22.htm">Jeremiah 38:22</a>.), the presence of a eunuch at the court, as overseer of the harem, cannot seem strange. The law of Moses, indeed, prohibited castration (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-2.htm">Deuteronomy 23:2</a>); but the man was a foreigner, and had been taken by the king into his service as one castrated. &#1506;&#1489;&#1491; &#1502;&#1500;&#1498; is a proper name (otherwise it must have been written &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1498;); the name is a genuine Hebrew one, and probably may have been assumed when the man entered the service of Zedekiah. - On hearing of what had occurred, the Ethiopian went to the king, who was sitting in the gate of Benjamin, on the north wall of the city, which was probably the point most threatened by the besiegers, and said to him, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-9.htm">Jeremiah 38:9</a>, "My lord, O king, these men have acted wickedly in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into the pit; and he is dying of hunger on the spot, for there is no more bread in the city." &#1492;&#1512;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468; &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1488;, lit.,: "they have done wickedly what they have done." &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1502;&#1514; cannot be translated, "and he died on the spot," for Ebedmelech wishes to save him before he dies of hunger. But neither does it stand for &#1493;&#1497;&#1502;&#1514;, "so that he must die." The imperfect with Vav consecutive expresses the consequence of a preceding act, and usually stands in the narrative as a historic tense; but it may also declare what necessarily follows or will follow from what precedes; cf. Ewald, 342, a. Thus &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1502;&#1514; stands here in the sense, "and so he is dying," i.e., "he must die of hunger." &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493;, "on his spot," i.e., on the place where he is; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-23.htm">2 Samuel 2:23</a>. The reason, "for there is no longer any bread (&#1492;&#1500;&#1495;&#1501; with the article, the necessary bread) in the city," is not to be taken in the exact sense of the words, but merely expresses the greatest deficiency in provisions. As long as Jeremiah was in the court of the prison, he received, like the officers of the court, at the king's order, his ration of bread every day (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-21.htm">Jeremiah 37:21</a>). But after he had been cast into the pit, that royal ordinance no longer applied to him, so that he was given over to the tender mercies of others, from whom, in the prevailing scarcity of bread, he had not much to hope for.</body></html>
