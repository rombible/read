The princes went on in their malice. It is common for wicked people to look upon God's faithful ministers as enemies, because they show what enemies the wicked are to themselves while impenitent. Jeremiah was put into a dungeon. Many of God's faithful witnesses have been privately made away in prisons. Ebed-melech was an Ethiopian; yet he spoke to the king faithfully, These men have done ill in all they have done to Jeremiah. See how God can raise up friends for his people in distress. Orders were given for the prophet's release, and Ebed-melech saw him drawn up. Let this encourage us to appear boldly for God. Special notice is taken of his tenderness for Jeremiah. What do we behold in the different characters then, but the same we behold in the different characters now, that the Lord's children are conformed to his example, and the children of Satan to their master?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/38.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Ebed-melech - i. e., the king's slave.

It seems (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-11.htm">2 Kings 23:11</a>) as if such eunuchs (or, chamberlains) took their names from the king, while the royal family and the princes generally bore names compounded with the appellations of the Deity. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/38.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. went forth &#8230; and spake&#8212;not privately, but in public; a proof of fearless magnanimity.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/38.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/38.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Ebedmelech went forth out of the king's house,....

Being confined in the court of the guard attached to the royal palace, Jeremiah had opportunities of conversing with the soldiers stationed there and the people of Judah who came thither (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-1.htm">Jeremiah 38:1</a> with <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-8.htm">Jeremiah 32:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-12.htm">Jeremiah 32:12</a>), and of declaring, in opposition to them, his conviction (which he had indeed expressed from the beginning of the siege) that all resistance to the Chaldeans would be fruitless, and only bring destruction (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-9.htm">Jeremiah 21:9</a>.). On this account, the princes who were of a hostile disposition towards him were so embittered, that they resolved on his death, and obtain from the king permission to cast him into a deep pit with mire at the bottom. In v. 1 four of these princes are named, two of whom, Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashur the son of Malchiah, are known, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-3.htm">Jeremiah 37:3</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-1.htm">Jeremiah 21:1</a>, as confidants of the king; the other two, Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of Pashur, are not mentioned elsewhere. Gedaliah was probably a son of the Pashur who had once put Jeremiah in the stocks (<a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-1.htm">Jeremiah 20:1-2</a>). The words of the prophet, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-2.htm">Jeremiah 38:2</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-3.htm">Jeremiah 38:3</a>, are substantially the same as he had already uttered at the beginning of the siege, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-9.htm">Jeremiah 21:9</a> (&#1497;&#1495;&#1497;&#1492; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-9.htm">Jeremiah 21:9</a>). <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-4.htm">Jeremiah 38:4</a>. The princes said to the king, "Let this man, we beseech thee, be put to death for the construction, see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-14.htm">Jeremiah 35:14</a>; for therefore i.e., because no one puts him out of existence - &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1499;&#1468;&#1503; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-28.htm">Jeremiah 29:28</a> he weakens the hands of the men of war who remain in this city, and the hands of all the people, by speaking words like these to them; for this man does not seek the welfare of this people, but their ill." &#1502;&#1512;&#1508;&#1468;&#1488; for &#1502;&#1512;&#1508;&#1468;&#1488;, to cause the hands of any one to be relaxed, i.e., to make him dispirited; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/4-4.htm">Ezra 4:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/35-3.htm">Isaiah 35:3</a>. &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473; with &#1500; htiw , as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-6.htm">Job 10:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-30.htm">Deuteronomy 12:30</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-19.htm">1 Chronicles 22:19</a>, etc., elsewhere with the accusatival &#1488;&#1514;; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-7.htm">Jeremiah 29:7</a> et passim. On this point cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-7.htm">Jeremiah 29:7</a>. The allegation which the princes made against Jeremiah was possibly correct. The constancy with which Jeremiah declared that resistance was useless, since, in accordance with the divine decree, Jerusalem was to be taken and burnt by the Chaldeans, could not but make the soldiers and the people unwilling any longer to sacrifice their lives in defending the city. Nevertheless the complaint was unjust, because Jeremiah was not expressing his own personal opinion, but was declaring the word of the Lord, and that, too, not from any want of patriotism or through personal cowardice, but in the conviction, derived from the divine revelation, that it was only by voluntary submission that the fate of the besieged could be mitigated; hence he acted from a deep feeling of love to the people, and in order to avert complete destruction from them. The courage of the people which he sought to weaken was not a heroic courage founded on genuine trust in God, but carnal obstinacy, which could not but lead to ruin.</body></html>
