The passage now mentioned (the name does not occur elsewhere) was probably distinct from both these, leading from the lower city, and may therefore have been chosen by Zedekiah as a more suitable place for a private interview with the prophet. It seems probable from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-11.htm" title="And he took away the horses that the kings of Judah had given to the sun, at the entering in of the house of the LORD, by the chamber of Nathanmelech the chamberlain, which was in the suburbs, and burned the chariots of the sun with fire.">2Kings 23:11</a>, that there was a chamber for the chief Eunuch, or chamberlain of the king’s household, and if, it may have been arranged by Ebed-melech that the meeting should take place there. As in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-17.htm" title="Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took him out: and the king asked him secretly in his house, and said, Is there any word from the LORD? And Jeremiah said, There is: for, said he, you shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon.">Jeremiah 37:17</a>, the king has still a secret respect for Jeremiah’s mission, and, it may be, guided now by the Eunuch’s better counsels, hankers after <span class= "bld">a </span>word of the Lord from him.

So beginning with the east they might term it the first or principal entry; the south the second entry; the north the "third entry" of the outer or inner court [Maurer]. The third gate of the temple facing the palace; for through it the entrance lay from the palace into the temple (1Ki 10:5, 12). It was westward (1Ch 26:16, 18; 2Ch 9:11) [Grotius].

When the prophet was taken out of the dungeon, and brought to the court of the prison, of which the king had knowledge, he sent some person or persons to bring him to him, to have some private conversation with him: <p>into the third entry that is in the house of the Lord; what place is meant Jarchi confesses his ignorance of, but conjectures it was the court of the Israelites; the outward court, and the court of the women, being before it. Kimchi rightly takes it to be a place through which they went from the king's house to the house of the Lord; no doubt the same that is called the king's ascent, by which he went up thither, shown to, and admired by, the queen of Sheba, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-5.htm">1 Kings 10:5</a>; in which there were three gates or entrances, as Dr. Lightfoot observes (y); the first, the gate of the foundation; the second, the gate behind the guard; and the third, the gate Coponius; and here the king and the prophet had their interview: <p>and the king said to Jeremiah, I will ask thee a thing, or "a word"; a word of prophecy; or whether there was a word of prophecy from the Lord, concerning him, his people, and city, and what it was; and what would be the event of the present siege, whether it would issue well or ill: <p>hide nothing from me; be it what it will, whether grateful or not; he had been told again and again how things would be; but still he was in hopes that something more favourable and consolatory would come from the Lord to him. <p>(y) Temple-Service, c. 33. p. 2028. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/38.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took Jeremiah the prophet unto him into the third entry that is in the house of the LORD: and the king said unto Jeremiah, I will ask thee a thing; hide nothing from me.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/38.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">14</span>. <span class="ital">the third entry</span>] not mentioned elsewhere by this name, but perhaps identical with that which in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-18.htm" title="And the covert for the sabbath that they had built in the house, and the king's entry without, turned he from the house of the LORD for the king of Assyria.">2 Kings 16:18</a> is called “the king’s entry.” Gi.

Zedekiah again seeks counsel from the prophet, who, after demanding and receiving an assurance of immunity, declares that, if the king surrenders, his life and the city shall be spared, whereas otherwise Jerusalem shall be burned, and Zedekiah himself shall not escape. (ii) <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/38-19.htm" title="And Zedekiah the king said to Jeremiah, I am afraid of the Jews that are fallen to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their hand, and they mock me....">Jeremiah 38:19-28</a></span> <span class="ital">a</span>. The king objects that, if he follow this advice, he will meet personal injury from those Jews who are already in the enemy’s hands. The prophet reassures him on this point and renews his urgent counsel in more detail. He pictures the women of the palace, led out in mournful procession by their captors, and chanting a lamentation as they go; while he repeats that the king shall be taken and the city burnt. Zedekiah pledges Jeremiah to secrecy. Accordingly, on being questioned by the princes as to the purport of the interview, he only reports his request not to be sent back to Jonathan’s house.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/38.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The third entry.</span> What this means exactly is not clear; probably the "entry" led from the palace to the temple.

Ebedmelech the Cushite, a eunuch, heard of what had happened to Jeremiah. &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1505;&#1512;&#1497;&#1505; .haimer signifies a eunuch: the &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; shows that &#1505;&#1512;&#1497;&#1505; is here to be taken in its proper meaning, not in the metaphorical sense of an officer of the court. Since the king had many wives (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-22.htm">Jeremiah 38:22</a>.), the presence of a eunuch at the court, as overseer of the harem, cannot seem strange. The law of Moses, indeed, prohibited castration (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-2.htm">Deuteronomy 23:2</a>); but the man was a foreigner, and had been taken by the king into his service as one castrated. &#1506;&#1489;&#1491; &#1502;&#1500;&#1498; is a proper name (otherwise it must have been written &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1498;); the name is a genuine Hebrew one, and probably may have been assumed when the man entered the service of Zedekiah. - On hearing of what had occurred, the Ethiopian went to the king, who was sitting in the gate of Benjamin, on the north wall of the city, which was probably the point most threatened by the besiegers, and said to him, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-9.htm">Jeremiah 38:9</a>, "My lord, O king, these men have acted wickedly in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into the pit; and he is dying of hunger on the spot, for there is no more bread in the city." &#1492;&#1512;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468; &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1488;, lit.,: "they have done wickedly what they have done." &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1502;&#1514; cannot be translated, "and he died on the spot," for Ebedmelech wishes to save him before he dies of hunger. But neither does it stand for &#1493;&#1497;&#1502;&#1514;, "so that he must die." The imperfect with Vav consecutive expresses the consequence of a preceding act, and usually stands in the narrative as a historic tense; but it may also declare what necessarily follows or will follow from what precedes; cf. Ewald, 342, a. Thus &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1502;&#1514; stands here in the sense, "and so he is dying," i.e., "he must die of hunger." &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493;, "on his spot," i.e., on the place where he is; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-23.htm">2 Samuel 2:23</a>. The reason, "for there is no longer any bread (&#1492;&#1500;&#1495;&#1501; with the article, the necessary bread) in the city," is not to be taken in the exact sense of the words, but merely expresses the greatest deficiency in provisions. As long as Jeremiah was in the court of the prison, he received, like the officers of the court, at the king's order, his ration of bread every day (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-21.htm">Jeremiah 37:21</a>). But after he had been cast into the pit, that royal ordinance no longer applied to him, so that he was given over to the tender mercies of others, from whom, in the prevailing scarcity of bread, he had not much to hope for.</body></html>
