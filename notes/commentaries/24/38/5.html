The princes went on in their malice. It is common for wicked people to look upon God's faithful ministers as enemies, because they show what enemies the wicked are to themselves while impenitent. Jeremiah was put into a dungeon. Many of God's faithful witnesses have been privately made away in prisons. Ebed-melech was an Ethiopian; yet he spoke to the king faithfully, These men have done ill in all they have done to Jeremiah. See how God can raise up friends for his people in distress. Orders were given for the prophet's release, and Ebed-melech saw him drawn up. Let this encourage us to appear boldly for God. Special notice is taken of his tenderness for Jeremiah. What do we behold in the different characters then, but the same we behold in the different characters now, that the Lord's children are conformed to his example, and the children of Satan to their master?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/38.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>All real power was in their hands, and as they affirmed that Jeremiah's death was a matter of necessity, the king did not dare refuse it to them. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/38.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. the king is not he&#8212;Zedekiah was a weak prince, and now in his straits afraid to oppose his princes. He hides his dislike of their overweening power, which prevented him shielding Jeremiah as he would have wished, under complimentary speeches. "It is not right that the king should deny aught to such faithful and wise statesmen"; the king is not such a one as to deny you your wishes [Jerome].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/38.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">He is in your hand; </span> that is, in your power, either by the established law against false prophets, or else I yield up my power to you, I surrender him into your hands. But neither of these seemeth very probable, for here is no mention of the sitting of the sanhedrim to judge him as a false prophet, nor of any judicial proceedings of that nature: and it should seem by Zedekiah’s relieving of him soon after from the dungeon, into which they threw him, that he had not surrendered Jeremiah so into their hands, but he to himself a superintendency upon them to correct their too severe dealings with him. The meaning seems rather to be, If you will do any such thing, I shall not oppose you, but I will not be the author of it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">For the king is not he that can do any thing against you; </span> I see I am as it were no king, I can do nothing against you, you will do what you please. I incline to this sense from the consideration of the favour showed him by Zedekiah, both before and after this. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/38.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then Zedekiah the king said, behold, he is in your hand,.... In your power, to do with him as you please. This is either a grant of the king, allowing them to do as they thought fit; or a declaration of their power, supposing them to be the princes of the sanhedrim, as Grotius thinks, to judge of a false prophet, and condemn him; but that they were such does not appear; nor does their charge of the prophet, or their procedure against him, confirm it. The former sense seems best: <p>for the king is not he that can do any thing against you; which is said either in a flattering way, that such was their interest in him, and so great his regard for them, that he could not deny them any thing. So it is in the old translations, "for the king may deny you nothing"; and, "the king can deny you nothing": or else in a complaining way, suggesting that, he was a king, and no king; that he had no power to oppose them; they would do as they pleased; and therefore it signified nothing applying to him; he should not say any thing against it; he would have no concern in it; they might do as they pleased, since he knew they would. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/38.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Then Zedekiah the king said, Behold, he <i>is</i> in your hand: for the king <i>is</i> not <i>he that</i> can do <i>any</i> <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> thing against you.</span><p>(d) In which he grievously offended in that not only would he not hear the truth spoken by the prophet, but also gave him to the lusts of the wicked to be cruelly treated.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/38.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">5</span>. <span class="ital">the king is not he, etc</span>.] The LXX, perhaps rightly, make this clause a comment of the narrator (“For the king was not able … against them”).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/38.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He is in your hand.</span> The growing power of the "princes" (see on Jeremiah 22:4) seems to have confined the king to a merely secondary <span class="accented">role.</span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/37.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Examination of the prophet by the king, and alleviation of his confinement. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-16.htm">Jeremiah 37:16</a>. "When Jeremiah had got into the dungeon and into the vaults, and had sat there many days, then Zedekiah the king sent and fetched him, and questioned him in his own house (palace) secretly," etc. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-16.htm">Jeremiah 37:16</a> is by most interpreters joined with the foregoing, but the words &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1489;&#1468;&#1488; do not properly permit of this. For if we take the verse as a further confirmation of &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1511;&#1510;&#1508;&#1493;&#1468; &#1492;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, "the princes vented their wrath on Jeremiah, beat him," etc., "for Jeremiah came...," then it must be acknowledged that the account would be very long and lumbering. &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1489;&#1468;&#1488; is too widely separated from &#1497;&#1511;&#1510;&#1508;&#1493;&#1468;. But the passages, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-21.htm">1 Samuel 2:21</a>, where &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1491; is supposed to stand for &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1508;&#1511;&#1491;, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/39-1.htm">Isaiah 39:1</a>, where &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506; is thought to have arisen out of &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/20-12.htm">2 Kings 20:12</a>, are not very strong proofs, since there, as here, no error in writing is marked. The Vulgate has itaque ingressus; many therefore would change &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; into &#1499;&#1468;&#1503;; but this also is quite arbitrary. Accordingly, with Rosenmller, we connect <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-16.htm">Jeremiah 37:16</a> with the following, and take &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; as a temporal particle; in this, the most we miss is &#1493; copulative, or &#1493;&#1497;&#1492;&#1497;. In the preceding sentence the prison of the prophet is somewhat minutely described, in order to prepare us for the request that follows in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-20.htm">Jeremiah 37:20</a>. Jeremiah was in a &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;&#1470;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;, "house of a pit," cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-29.htm">Exodus 12:29</a>, i.e., a subterranean prison, and in &#1492;&#1495;&#1504;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;. This word only occurs here; but in the kindred dialects it means vaults, stalls, shops; hence it possibly signifies here subterranean prison-cells, so that &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1495;&#1504;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; more exactly determines what &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;&#1470;&#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512; is. This meaning of the word is, at any rate, more certain than that given by Eb. Scheid in Rosenmller, who renders &#1495;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493;&#1514; by flexa, curvata; then, supplying ligna, he thinks of the stocks to which the prisoners were fastened. - The king questioned him &#1489;&#1468;&#1505;&#1468;&#1514;&#1512;, "in secret," namely, through fear of his ministers and court-officers, who were prejudiced against the prophet, perhaps also in the hope of receiving in a private interview a message from God of more favourable import. To the question of the king, "Is there any word from Jahveh?" Jeremiah replies in the affirmative; but the word of God is this, "Thou shalt be given into the hand of the king of Babylon," just as Jeremiah had previously announced to him; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-4.htm">Jeremiah 32:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-3.htm">Jeremiah 34:3</a>. - Jeremiah took this opportunity of complaining about his imprisonment, saying, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-18.htm">Jeremiah 37:18</a>, "In what have I sinned against thee, or against thy servants, or against this people, that ye have put me in prison? <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-19.htm">Jeremiah 37:19</a>. And where are your prophets, who prophesied to you, The king of Babylon shall not come against you, nor against this land?" Jeremiah appeals to his perfect innocence (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-18.htm">Jeremiah 37:18</a>), and to the confirmation of his prediction by its event. The interview with the king took place when the Chaldeans, after driving the Egyptians out of the country, had recommenced the siege of Jerusalem, and, as is evident from <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-21.htm">Jeremiah 37:21</a>, were pressing the city very hard. The Kethib &#1488;&#1497;&#1493; is to be read &#1488;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;, formed from &#1488;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; with the suffix &#1493;&#1473;; the idea of the suffix has gradually become obscured, so that it stands here before a noun in the plural. The Qeri requires &#1488;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;. The question, Where are your prophets? means, Let these prophets come forward and vindicate their lying prophecies. Not what these men had prophesied, but what Jeremiah had declared had come to pass; his imprisonment, accordingly, was unjust. - Besides thus appealing to his innocence, Jeremiah, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-20.htm">Jeremiah 37:20</a>, entreats the king, "Let my supplication come before thee, and do not send me back into the house of Jonathan the scribe, that I may not die there." For '&#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1504;&#1488; &#1514; see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-7.htm">Jeremiah 36:7</a>. The king granted this request. "He commanded, and they put Jeremiah into the court of the watch [of the royal palace, see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-2.htm">Jeremiah 32:2</a>], and gave him a loaf of bread daily out of the bakers' street, till all the bread in the city was consumed;" cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-6.htm">Jeremiah 52:6</a>. The king did not give him his liberty, because Jeremiah held to his views, that were so distasteful to the king (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-3.htm">Jeremiah 32:3</a>). "So Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard." </body></html>
