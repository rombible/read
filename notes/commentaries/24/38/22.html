This would be said by the women, either in a mournful manner, by way of complaint; or as scoffing at the king, as a silly foolish man, to hearken to such persons; and so he that was afraid of being mocked by the Jews is jeered at by the women of his house. <p>(a)  "viri pacis tuae", Pagninus, Montanus, Vatablus, Schmidt. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/38.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And, behold, all the women that are <span class="cverse3">{k}</span> left in the king of Judah's house <i>shall be</i> brought forth to the king of Babylon's princes, and those <i>women</i> shall say, Thy friends have set thee on, and have prevailed against thee: thy feet are sunk in the mire, <i>and</i> they are turned away back.</span><p>(k) When Jeconiah and his mother with others were carried away, these women of the king's house were left: who will be taken, says the prophet and tell the king of Babel how Zedekiah has been seduced by his familiar friends and false prophets who have left him in the mire.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/38.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">22</span>. <span class="ital">all the women that are left</span>] the women of the harem generally, concubines and their attendants.

King Zedekiah was desirous of once more hearing a message of God from the prophet, and for this object had him brought into the third entrance in the house of the Lord. Nothing further is known about the situation and the nature of this entrance; possibly it led from the palace to the temple, and seems to have been an enclosed space, for the king could carry on a private conversation there with the prophet. The king said to him, "I ask you about a matter, do not conceal anything from me." He meant a message from God regarding the final issue of the siege, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-7.htm">Jeremiah 37:7</a>. Jeremiah, knowing the aversion of the king to the truth, replies, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-15.htm">Jeremiah 38:15</a> : "If I tell thee [sc. the word of the Lord], wilt thou not assuredly kill me? And if I were to give thee advice, thou wouldst not listen to me." <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-16.htm">Jeremiah 38:16</a>. Then the king sware to him secretly, "As Jahveh liveth, who hath made us this soul, I shall certainly not kill thee, nor deliver thee into the hand of these men who seek thy life." &#1488;&#1514; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-8.htm">Jeremiah 27:8</a>, properly means, "with regard to Him who has created us."
