These words sufficiently show that Zedekiah stood in fear of his courtiers.

But here we see in what a state of miserable subjection this poor prince was to them, in that he could discourse to nobody, but they must come and inquire what he had said. <span class="ital">Thou shalt say, I presented my supplication, </span>&c. — Jeremiah had been formerly kept prisoner in Jonathan’s house, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-15.htm" title="Why the princes were wroth with Jeremiah, and smote him, and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe: for they had made that the prison.">Jeremiah 37:15</a>.

And in the dungeon there was no water, but mire: so Jeremiah sunk in the mire.">Jeremiah 38:6</a> of this chapter: a place which, perhaps, might at this time be put to some other use. <span class="ital">Then came all the princes to Jeremiah </span>— As the king suspected, so it came to pass: his private discourse with the prophet transpired, and all the princes then at court came and inquired of Jeremiah what was the substance of it. <span class="ital">And he told them according to all that the king had commanded </span>— He told them part of the truth, but not all, concealing from them the advice which he had given to the king, with relation to the questions he had proposed to him. For a man is not bound in all cases to discover the whole truth, particularly to those who have no right to the knowledge of it, which, in this case, these princes had not. <span class="ital">So the matter was not perceived </span>— The princes never got to know what was the principal subject of the king’s conference with the prophet. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/38.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>38:14-28 Jeremiah was not forward to repeat the warnings, which seemed only to endanger his own life, and to add to the king's guilt, but asked whether he feared to do the will of God.

This is the righteous judgment of God; those that will not sanctify the Lord of hosts, and make him their fear, shall fear men, whom to fear is much more base and ignoble. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/38.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then said Zedekiah to Jeremiah,.... Not a word signifying his approbation of the counsel given him, or that he intended to take it; his silence showed the reverse: <p>let no man know of these words: that had passed between them; of the conference and conversation they had had together, at least not the particulars of it; the thing itself was known, as appears by what follows, that the king and prophet had been discoursing together; but what they talked of, he desires might be concealed, pretending the prophet's good, though it was his own honour and safety he sought: <p>and thou shall not die; as he had promised he should not, and had sworn to it; but suggests by this, that if he disclosed the conversation, he should took upon himself free from his word and oath; so that this carried something menacing in it: or it may be rendered "that thou die not" (c); intimating, that if the princes should come to the knowledge of what he had said, of the advice he had given, they would surely put him to death; and therefore, for his own safety, he desires the whole may be kept a secret. <p>(c)  "ne moriaris", Gataker, Schmidt; "ut non moriaris", Piscator. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/38.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Then said Zedekiah unto Jeremiah, Let no man know of these words, and thou shalt not die.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/38.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">24</span>. <span class="ital">Let no man know</span>] Zedekiah’s feebleness is again conspicuous in this and the two following verses. Although the saving of the prophet from conditions likely to prove fatal is not directly mentioned in the narrative as preserved to us, it is far from unlikely that it was one subject of the conversation. Thus the prophet may well have held himself justified in limiting his statement to the princes in accordance with Zedekiah’s desire, especially when we remember that moral standards at that age were not altogether identical with our own.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/38.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>After this solemn asseveration of the king, Jeremiah said to him, "Thus saith Jahveh, the God of hosts, the God of Israel: If thou wilt assuredly go out to the princes of the king of Babylon  [i.e., wilt surrender thyself to them, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-31.htm">2 Kings 18:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-12.htm">2 Kings 24:12</a>], then thy soul shall live, and this city shall not be burned with fire, and thou and thy house shall live. But if thou dost not go out to the princes of the king of Babylon, then this city will be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire, and thou shalt not escape out of their hand." The word of God is the same that Jeremiah had already repeatedly announced to the king, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-2.htm">Jeremiah 34:2-5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-4.htm">Jeremiah 32:4</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-4.htm">Jeremiah 21:4-10</a>.
