It is obvious that to all who did not recognise the divine mission of the prophet, words like those which he had then spoken would seem to come from the lips of a traitor. Desertion to the enemy was represented as the only way of safety, and this was the counsel given to those who were defending the city of their fathers against an alien invader. What made it appear worse was that the prophet himself had been caught in an act which, though he denied the charge, might not unnaturally seem like an act of treacherous desertion.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/jeremiah/38.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/38-2.htm" title="Thus said the LORD, He that remains in this city shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence: but he that goes forth to the Chaldeans shall live; for he shall have his life for a prey, and shall live....">Jeremiah 38:2-5</a></span>. <span class="ital">Thus saith the Lord, He that goeth forth to the Chaldeans shall live </span>— This had been the constant tenor of this prophet’s prophecies. The crime of which he was now accused, seems to lie in this, that in such a time of danger he should repeat this prophecy, and also advise the people to leave the city, and go out to the Chaldeans, telling them that if they did so, though the city would be lost, yet they should save their lives, which might induce some to desert their posts. This they interpret to be not seeking the welfare of the people, but their hurt; though, indeed, their welfare was that alone which he sought, knowing that there was no other way for them to save their lives, but by submitting to the Chaldeans. The great men, however, would not believe it; for they would not form their judgments on the revelations which God had been pleased to make of his will, but were determined to judge of their safety from what they wished. Hence, for any one not to be of their opinion was to be an enemy to the state. <span class="ital">Therefore the princes said unto the king </span>— See <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-12.htm" title="Then he went down into the king's house, into the scribe's chamber: and, see, all the princes sat there, even Elishama the scribe, and Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, and Elnathan the son of Achbor, and Gemariah the son of Shaphan, and Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the princes.">Jeremiah 36:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-21.htm" title="So the king sent Jehudi to fetch the roll: and he took it out of Elishama the scribe's chamber. And Jehudi read it in the ears of the king, and in the ears of all the princes which stood beside the king.">Jeremiah 36:21</a>; <span class="ital">We beseech thee, let this man be put to death </span>— His crime deserves no less a punishment; <span class="ital">for he weakeneth the hands of the men of war </span>— By making them despair of success. <span class="ital">Then the king said, Behold he is in your hand </span>— At your disposal; I give him up into your power. Though Zedekiah was convinced that Jeremiah was a prophet sent of God, yet he had not courage to own this conviction, but weakly yielded to the violence of his persecutors. <span class="ital">For the king is not he that can do any thing against you</span> — He speaks as one who did not dare, in such difficult times, to contradict the great men about him. Blaney renders the clause, “For the king can carry no point in competition with you;” observing, “The king evidently speaks this in disgust with the princes for endeavouring to frustrate his clemency. He had once rescued Jeremiah out of their hands, and taken him under his royal protection. But his prerogative, he tells them, was likely to avail but little when opposed by their obstinate and repeated importunities. The power was in reality theirs and not his.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/38.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>38:1-13 Jeremiah went on in his plain preaching. The princes went on in their malice. It is common for wicked people to look upon God's faithful ministers as enemies, because they show what enemies the wicked are to themselves while impenitent. Jeremiah was put into a dungeon. Many of God's faithful witnesses have been privately made away in prisons. Ebed-melech was an Ethiopian; yet he spoke to the king faithfully, These men have done ill in all they have done to Jeremiah. See how God can raise up friends for his people in distress. Orders were given for the prophet's release, and Ebed-melech saw him drawn up. Let this encourage us to appear boldly for God. Special notice is taken of his tenderness for Jeremiah. What do we behold in the different characters then, but the same we behold in the different characters now, that the Lord's children are conformed to his example, and the children of Satan to their master?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/38.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Had spoken - Spake; or, was speaking. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/38.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. life &#8230; a prey&#8212;He shall escape with his life; though losing all else in a shipwreck, he shall carry off his life as his gain, saved by his going over to the Chaldeans.

The crime seemeth to lie in this, that in such a time of extreme danger he should repeat this prophecy, and also advise the people to leave the city, and shift for themselves, by going out to the Chaldeans, telling them that if they did so, though the city would be lost, and their estates in it lost, yet they should save their lives, which words might encourage many of low and cowardly spirits to desert their posts; which indeed had been crime sufficient in an ordinary time, and under ordinary circumstances, but was no crime now that God had revealed his will to the king, princes, and people that the city should be lost; there lay now no further duty upon any to contribute to its defence, but they were obliged to make as good provisions for themselves as they could; but these wicked princes believed no such thing, therefore they make this a great charge. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/38.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Thus saith the Lord, he that remaineth in this city,....

"When Jeremiah had got into the dungeon and into the vaults, and had sat there many days, then Zedekiah the king sent and fetched him, and questioned him in his own house (palace) secretly," etc. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-16.htm">Jeremiah 37:16</a> is by most interpreters joined with the foregoing, but the words &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1489;&#1468;&#1488; do not properly permit of this. For if we take the verse as a further confirmation of &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1511;&#1510;&#1508;&#1493;&#1468; &#1492;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, "the princes vented their wrath on Jeremiah, beat him," etc., "for Jeremiah came...," then it must be acknowledged that the account would be very long and lumbering. &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1489;&#1468;&#1488; is too widely separated from &#1497;&#1511;&#1510;&#1508;&#1493;&#1468;. But the passages, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-21.htm">1 Samuel 2:21</a>, where &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1491; is supposed to stand for &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1508;&#1511;&#1491;, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/39-1.htm">Isaiah 39:1</a>, where &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506; is thought to have arisen out of &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/20-12.htm">2 Kings 20:12</a>, are not very strong proofs, since there, as here, no error in writing is marked. The Vulgate has itaque ingressus; many therefore would change &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; into &#1499;&#1468;&#1503;; but this also is quite arbitrary. Accordingly, with Rosenmller, we connect <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-16.htm">Jeremiah 37:16</a> with the following, and take &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; as a temporal particle; in this, the most we miss is &#1493; copulative, or &#1493;&#1497;&#1492;&#1497;. In the preceding sentence the prison of the prophet is somewhat minutely described, in order to prepare us for the request that follows in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-20.htm">Jeremiah 37:20</a>. Jeremiah was in a &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;&#1470;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;, "house of a pit," cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-29.htm">Exodus 12:29</a>, i.e., a subterranean prison, and in &#1492;&#1495;&#1504;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;. This word only occurs here; but in the kindred dialects it means vaults, stalls, shops; hence it possibly signifies here subterranean prison-cells, so that &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1495;&#1504;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; more exactly determines what &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;&#1470;&#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512; is. This meaning of the word is, at any rate, more certain than that given by Eb. Scheid in Rosenmller, who renders &#1495;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493;&#1514; by flexa, curvata; then, supplying ligna, he thinks of the stocks to which the prisoners were fastened. - The king questioned him &#1489;&#1468;&#1505;&#1468;&#1514;&#1512;, "in secret," namely, through fear of his ministers and court-officers, who were prejudiced against the prophet, perhaps also in the hope of receiving in a private interview a message from God of more favourable import. To the question of the king, "Is there any word from Jahveh?" Jeremiah replies in the affirmative; but the word of God is this, "Thou shalt be given into the hand of the king of Babylon," just as Jeremiah had previously announced to him; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-4.htm">Jeremiah 32:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-3.htm">Jeremiah 34:3</a>. - Jeremiah took this opportunity of complaining about his imprisonment, saying, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-18.htm">Jeremiah 37:18</a>, "In what have I sinned against thee, or against thy servants, or against this people, that ye have put me in prison? <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-19.htm">Jeremiah 37:19</a>. And where are your prophets, who prophesied to you, The king of Babylon shall not come against you, nor against this land?" Jeremiah appeals to his perfect innocence (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-18.htm">Jeremiah 37:18</a>), and to the confirmation of his prediction by its event. The interview with the king took place when the Chaldeans, after driving the Egyptians out of the country, had recommenced the siege of Jerusalem, and, as is evident from <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-21.htm">Jeremiah 37:21</a>, were pressing the city very hard. The Kethib &#1488;&#1497;&#1493; is to be read &#1488;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;, formed from &#1488;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; with the suffix &#1493;&#1473;; the idea of the suffix has gradually become obscured, so that it stands here before a noun in the plural. The Qeri requires &#1488;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;. The question, Where are your prophets? means, Let these prophets come forward and vindicate their lying prophecies. Not what these men had prophesied, but what Jeremiah had declared had come to pass; his imprisonment, accordingly, was unjust. - Besides thus appealing to his innocence, Jeremiah, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-20.htm">Jeremiah 37:20</a>, entreats the king, "Let my supplication come before thee, and do not send me back into the house of Jonathan the scribe, that I may not die there." For '&#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1504;&#1488; &#1514; see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-7.htm">Jeremiah 36:7</a>. The king granted this request. "He commanded, and they put Jeremiah into the court of the watch [of the royal palace, see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-2.htm">Jeremiah 32:2</a>], and gave him a loaf of bread daily out of the bakers' street, till all the bread in the city was consumed;" cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-6.htm">Jeremiah 52:6</a>. The king did not give him his liberty, because Jeremiah held to his views, that were so distasteful to the king (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-3.htm">Jeremiah 32:3</a>). "So Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard." </body></html>
