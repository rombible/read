The less men fear God, the more they fear men; often they dare not act according to their own judgments and consciences.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/38.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Jews that are fallen to the Chaldaeans - These deserters probably formed a numerous party, and now would be the more indignant with Zedekiah for having rejected their original advice to submit. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/38.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19. afraid of the Jews&#8212;more than of God (Pr 29:25; Joh 9:22; 12:43).<p>mock me&#8212;treat me injuriously (1Sa 31:4).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/38.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The Chaldeans shall not do so base an act, but deal with thee as with a prince.

To take off the above excuse, or remove that objection, the prophet assures the king that the Chaldeans would never deliver him into the hands of the Jews; he might depend upon it, it would never be done: <p>obey, I beseech thee, the voice of the Lord, which I speak unto thee; the counsel he had given him, to surrender to the Chaldeans, was not from himself, but from the Lord: and though he had no express order to give it at that time, yet it was what was agreeable to the will of God, and what he had exhorted the people to in the beginning of this chapter; and therefore, since it came from the Lord, as it ought to be attended to, so he might be assured of the divine protection, should he act according to it: <p>so it shall be well with thee, and thy soul shall live; that is, it would not only be much better with him than he feared, but than it would be with him should he obstinately stand out to the last; he should have more respect and honour from the king of Babylon; and not only have his life spared, but enjoy more of the comforts of life; particularly the sight of his eyes, which he lost when taken. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/38.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But Jeremiah said, They shall not deliver thee.

King Zedekiah was desirous of once more hearing a message of God from the prophet, and for this object had him brought into the third entrance in the house of the Lord. Nothing further is known about the situation and the nature of this entrance; possibly it led from the palace to the temple, and seems to have been an enclosed space, for the king could carry on a private conversation there with the prophet. The king said to him, "I ask you about a matter, do not conceal anything from me." He meant a message from God regarding the final issue of the siege, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-7.htm">Jeremiah 37:7</a>. Jeremiah, knowing the aversion of the king to the truth, replies, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-15.htm">Jeremiah 38:15</a> : "If I tell thee [sc. the word of the Lord], wilt thou not assuredly kill me? And if I were to give thee advice, thou wouldst not listen to me." <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-16.htm">Jeremiah 38:16</a>. Then the king sware to him secretly, "As Jahveh liveth, who hath made us this soul, I shall certainly not kill thee, nor deliver thee into the hand of these men who seek thy life." &#1488;&#1514; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-8.htm">Jeremiah 27:8</a>, properly means, "with regard to Him who has created us."
