Of the two officers who are here named, Jehucal appears as accusing the prophets in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-1.htm" title="Then Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of Pashur, and Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashur the son of Malchiah, heard the words that Jeremiah had spoken to all the people, saying,">Jeremiah 38:1</a>, Zephaniah in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-1.htm" title="The word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD, when king Zedekiah sent to him Pashur the son of Melchiah, and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, saying,">Jeremiah 21:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-25.htm" title="Thus speaks the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, Because you have sent letters in your name to all the people that are at Jerusalem, and to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, and to all the priests, saying,">Jeremiah 29:25</a>. They clearly belonged to the anti-Chaldæan party, and were therefore, for the most part, openly hostile to the prophet. Their application to him was either simply an official act in obedience to the king’s commands, or sprang from the hope, as before in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-1.htm" title="The word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD, when king Zedekiah sent to him Pashur the son of Melchiah, and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, saying,">Jeremiah 21:1</a>, that they might, by a show of religious zeal for Jehovah, win him over to their cause. The stress which they lay on his praying to “the Lord our God” indicates the latter alternative as probable.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/jeremiah/37.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/37-3.htm" title="And Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest to the prophet Jeremiah, saying, Pray now to the LORD our God for us....">Jeremiah 37:3-5</a></span>. <span class="ital">Zedekiah sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah </span>— This man came in the place of Pashur, who, together with Zephaniah, brought the former message from Zedekiah; <span class="ital">saying, Pray now unto the Lord our God for us</span> — Wicked men of all ranks are desirous, in their distresses, of the prayers of those whose counsels and admonitions they never regard while they are in prosperity, which is a plain evidence of their acting contrary to the convictions of their own consciences. <span class="ital">Now Jeremiah came in and went out among the people </span>— That is, he was not yet put in prison as he afterward was: see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-15.htm" title="Why the princes were wroth with Jeremiah, and smote him, and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe: for they had made that the prison.">Jeremiah 37:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-2.htm" title="For then the king of Babylon's army besieged Jerusalem: and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the prison, which was in the king of Judah's house.">Jeremiah 32:2</a>.

During this time, it seems, it was that Zedekiah sent to desire the prophet to pray for them.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/37.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>37:1-10 Numbers witness the fatal effects of other men's sins, yet heedlessly step into their places, and follow the same destructive course. When in distress, we ought to desire the prayers of ministers and Christian friends. And it is common for those to desire to be prayed for, who will not be advised; yet sinners are often hardened by a pause in judgments. But if God help us not, no creature can.

The Jews were elated by this temporary relief, and miserably abused it <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-11.htm">Jeremiah 34:11</a>. Zedekiah seems to some extent to have shared their hopes, and to have expected that the prophet would intercede for the city as successfully as Isaiah had done <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-6.htm">Isaiah 37:6</a>. Jehucal was a member of the warlike party <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-1.htm">Jeremiah 38:1</a>, as also was the deputy high priest Zephaniah, but otherwise he was well affected to Jeremiah. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/37.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. Zedekiah &#8230; sent&#8212;fearing lest, in the event of the Chaldeans overcoming Pharaoh-hophra, they should return to besiege Jerusalem. See on [951]Jer 21:1; that chapter chronologically comes in between the thirty-seventh and thirty-eighth chapter. The message of the king to Jeremiah here in the thirty-seventh chapter is, however, somewhat earlier than that in the twenty-first chapter; here it is while the issue between the Chaldeans and Pharaoh was undecided; there it is when, after the repulse of Pharaoh, the Chaldeans were again advancing against Jerusalem; hence, while Zephaniah is named in both embassies, Jehucal accompanies him here, Pashur there. But, as Pashur and Jehucal are both mentioned in Jer 38:1, 2, as hearing Jeremiah's reply, which is identical with that in Jer 21:9, it is probable the two messages followed one another at a short interval; that in this Jer 37:3, and the answer, Jer 37:7-10, being the earlier of the two.<p>Zephaniah&#8212;an abettor of rebellion against God (Jer 29:25), though less virulent than many (Jer 29:29), punished accordingly (Jer 52:24-27).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/37.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This was apparently in the time of the siege; for, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-5.htm" title="Then Pharaoh's army was come forth out of Egypt: and when the Chaldeans that besieged Jerusalem heard tidings of them, they departed from Jerusalem.">Jeremiah 37:5</a></span>, we read of Pharaoh’s army being come to relieve the besieged, whether it was before the Babylonians were departed, or no, is uncertain; but it is plain, if they were departed, the king was afraid they would come back again. That which is most observable for us from hence is this, that wicked men of all ranks are desirous of the prayers of those ministers in their distresses, whose counsels and admonitions they never regard while they are in a time of prosperity; which is an evidence of their acting contrary to the convictions of their consciences, in obedience to their lusts, in their contempt of their instructions and admonitions. When affliction hath cooled their lusts, then their consciences can be heard in dictating their duty to them. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/37.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah, and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest,.... That is, Zephaniah the priest, as the accents shaw; though his father Maaseiah was doubtless a priest too; according to the Syriac version, both Jehucal, called Jucal, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-1.htm">Jeremiah 38:1</a>; and Zephaniah, were priests; since it reads in the plural number, "priests": these the king sent as messengers <p>to the Prophet Jeremiah, saying, pray now unto the Lord our God for us. This message was sent either upon the rumour of the Chaldeans coming against Jerusalem, as some think; or rather when it had departed from the city, and was gone to meet the army of the king of Egypt; so that this petition to the prophet was to pray that the king of Egypt alight get the victory over the Chaldean army, and that that might not return unto them. Thus wicked men will desire the prayers of good men in times of distress, when their words, their cautions, admonitions, exhortations, and prayers too, are despised by them at another time. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/37.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And Zedekiah the king <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest to the prophet Jeremiah, saying, Pray now to the LORD our God for us.</span><p>(c) Because he was afraid of the Chaldeans who came against him.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/37.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">3</span>. <span class="ital">And Zedekiah the king sent</span>] This mission took place later than that related in ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-1.htm" title="The word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD, when king Zedekiah sent to him Pashur the son of Melchiah, and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, saying,">Jeremiah 21:1</a>, which was sent when Nebuchadnezzar’s army was approaching Jerusalem.
