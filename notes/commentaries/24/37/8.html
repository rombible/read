When in distress, we ought to desire the prayers of ministers and Christian friends. And it is common for those to desire to be prayed for, who will not be advised; yet sinners are often hardened by a pause in judgments. But if God help us not, no creature can. Whatever instruments God has determined to use, they shall do the work, though they seem unlikely.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/37.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Jeremiah's answer here is even more unfavorable than that which is given in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-4.htm">Jeremiah 21:4-7</a>.

Then follows, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-3.htm">Jeremiah 37:3-10</a>, a declaration of the prophet regarding the issue of the siege, which he sent to the king by the messengers who were to beseech him for his intercession with the Lord. <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-3.htm">Jeremiah 37:3-5</a>. The occasion of this declaration was the following: Zedekiah sent to Jeremiah two of his chief officers, Jehucal the son of Shelemiah (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-1.htm">Jeremiah 38:1</a>), and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah, the priest (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-1.htm">Jeremiah 21:1</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-25.htm">Jeremiah 29:25</a>), with this charge: "Pray now for us to Jahveh our God." This message was sent to Jeremiah while he still went in and out among the people, and had not yet been put in prison (&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1488;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-4.htm">Jeremiah 37:4</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-31.htm">Jeremiah 52:31</a>, an unusual form for &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-15.htm">Jeremiah 37:15</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-18.htm">Jeremiah 37:18</a>, for which the Qeri would have us in both instances read &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;); the army of Pharaoh (Hophra, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-30.htm">Jeremiah 44:30</a>), too, had marched out of Egypt to oppose the Chaldeans; and the latter, when they heard the report of them (&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;&#1501;, the news of their approach), had withdrawn from Jerusalem (&#1506;&#1500;&#1492; &#1502;&#1506;&#1500;, see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-2.htm">Jeremiah 21:2</a>), viz., in order to repulse the Egyptians. Both of these circumstances are mentioned for the purpose of giving a clear view of the state of things: (a) Jeremiah's freedom to go in and out, not to prepare us for his imprisonment afterwards, but to explain the reason why the king sent two chief officers of the realm to him, whereas, after his imprisonment, he caused him to be brought (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-17.htm">Jeremiah 37:17</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-14.htm">Jeremiah 38:14</a>); and (b) the approach of the Egyptians joined with the raising of the siege, because this event seemed to afford some hope that the city would be saved. - This occurrence, consequently, falls within a later period than that mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-1.htm">Jeremiah 21:1-14</a>. </body></html>
