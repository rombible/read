The word is peculiar to Jeremiah, and occurs only here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-4.htm" title="Moab is destroyed; her little ones have caused a cry to be heard.">Jeremiah 48:4</a>. The vivid picture of the messengers running hither and thither to all wells, and springs, and tanks, reminds us of Ahab’s search for wells or springs in the time of the great drought of his reign (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-5.htm" title="And Ahab said to Obadiah, Go into the land, to all fountains of water, and to all brooks: peradventure we may find grass to save the horses and mules alive, that we lose not all the beasts.">1Kings 18:5</a>), of the “two or three cities wandering” to the one city that was yet supplied with water of <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/4-8.htm" title="So two or three cities wandered to one city, to drink water; but they were not satisfied: yet have you not returned to me, said the LORD.">Amos 4:8</a>.<p><span class= "bld">The pits.</span>—The tanks or reservoirs where, if anywhere, water might be looked for.<p><span class= "bld">Covered their heads.</span>—The extremest sign of a grief too great to utter itself to others, craving to be alone in its wretchedness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-30.htm" title="And David went up by the ascent of mount Olivet, and wept as he went up, and had his head covered, and he went barefoot: and all the people that was with him covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up.">2Samuel 15:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-4.htm" title="But the king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice, O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son!">2Samuel 19:4</a>). The student will recollect it as occurring also in the account of the painting of Agamemnon at the Sacrifice of Iphigenia, ascribed to Timanthes.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/jeremiah/14.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/14-3.htm" title="And their nobles have sent their little ones to the waters: they came to the pits, and found no water; they returned with their vessels empty; they were ashamed and confounded, and covered their heads....">Jeremiah 14:3-6</a></span>. <span class="ital">And their nobles, </span>&c. — This scarcity of water afflicted not poor persons only, who had not such means of supplying their necessities as the rich; but the greatest among them, who sent <span class="ital">their little ones, </span>(or <span class="ital">inferiors, </span>as <span class="greekheb">צעיריהם</span>, seems here rather to signify,) to the places made to receive and retain water; who, finding none, returned with their vessels empty, like persons ashamed, and troubled upon seeing their expectations frustrated.

But it was rather the cry of their trouble, and of their sin, than of their prayer. Let us be thankful for the mercy of water, that we may not be taught to value it by feeling the want of it. See what dependence husbandmen have upon the Divine providence. They cannot plough nor sow in hope, unless God water their furrows. The case even of the wild beasts was very pitiable. The people are not forward to pray, but the prophet prays for them. Sin is humbly confessed. Our sins not only accuse us, but answer against us. Our best pleas in prayer are those fetched from the glory of God's own name. We should dread God's departure, more than the removal of our creature-comforts. He has given Israel his word to hope in. It becomes us in prayer to show ourselves more concerned for God's glory than for our own comfort. And if we now return to the Lord, he will save us to the glory of his grace.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Little ones - mean ones, the common people.

To places where water used to be; to the pools, the upper and the lower, particularly to the fountain of Shiloah, which, Jerom says, was the only one the city of Jerusalem used. The meaning either is, that the nobles in Jerusalem sent their own children to get water for them, they having no servants to attend them, these being put away because they could not support them, the famine being so sore; or rather that they sent their menial servants, their subjects, as the Targum renders it, to fetch them a little water to refresh themselves with: <p>they came to the pits and found no water; their servants came according to order to the pools and cisterns, or to the deep wells, and to such places where there used to be a great confluence of water, and plenty of it, but now they could find none: <p>they returned with their vessels empty; just as they came: <p>they were ashamed and confounded; either the servants that were sent, or rather their masters that sent them, when they saw them come with their empty vessels; having been looking out and longing for their return, expecting they would have brought water with them for their refreshment; but to their great disappointment and confusion brought none: <p>and covered their heads; as persons ashamed, or as mourners used to do, being full of anguish and distress because of the drought. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/14.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And their nobles have sent their little ones to the waters: they came to the pits, <i>and</i> found no water; they returned with their vessels empty; they were ashamed and confounded, and <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> covered their heads.</span><p>(c) That is, with ashes in token of sorrow.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/14.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">3</span>. <span class="ital">little ones</span>] rather, as mg. <span class="ital">inferiors</span>, i.e. servants.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">pits</span>] cisterns, or tanks, where the water was kept till wanted for use.
