They had forsaken his service, therefore he would punish them according to their sins. He forbade Jeremiah to plead for them. The false prophets were the most criminal. The Lord pronounces condemnation on them; but as the people loved to have it so, they were not to escape judgments. False teachers encourage men to expect peace and salvation, without repentance, faith, conversion, and holiness of life. But those who believe a lie must not plead if for an excuse.

And the wild asses stand on the bare-topped heights, gasp for air like the jackals; their eyes fail because there is no herb."<p>The country and the city, the distinguished and the mean, the field and the husbandmen, are thrown into deep mourning, and the beasts of the field pine away because neither grass nor herb grows. This description gives a touching picture of the distress into which the land and its inhabitants have fallen for lack of rain. Judah is the kingdom or the country with its inhabitants; the gates as used poetically for the cities with the citizens. Not mankind only, but the land itself mourns and pines away, with all the creatures that live on it; cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-4.htm">Jeremiah 14:4</a>, where the ground is said to be dismayed along with the tillers of it. The gates of the cities are mentioned as being the places where the citizens congregate. &#1488;&#1502;&#1500;&#1500;, fade away, pine, is strengthened by: are black, i.e., mourn, down to the earth; pregnant for: set themselves mourning on the ground. As frequently, Jerusalem is mentioned alongside of Judah as being its capital. Their cry of anguish rises up to heaven. This universal mourning is specialized from <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-3.htm">Jeremiah 14:3</a> on. Their nobles, i.e., the distinguished men of Judah and Jerusalem, send their mean ones, i.e., their retainers or servants and maids, for water to the wells (&#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501;, pits, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-16.htm">2 Kings 3:16</a>, here cisterns). The Chet. &#1510;&#1506;&#1493;&#1512;, here and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-4.htm">Jeremiah 48:4</a>, is an unusual form for &#1510;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512;, Keri. Finding no water, they return, their vessels empty, i.e., with empty pitchers, ashamed of their disappointed hope. &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468; is strengthened by the synonym &#1492;&#1499;&#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;. Covering the head is a token of deep grief turned inwards upon itself; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-30.htm">2 Samuel 15:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-5.htm">2 Samuel 19:5</a>. &#1492;&#1488;&#1491;&#1502;&#1492; is the ground generally. &#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; is a relative clause: quae consternata est. "Because no rain," etc., literally as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-7.htm">1 Kings 17:7</a>. - Even the beasts droop and perish. &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; is intensive: yea, even. The hind brings forth and forsakes, sc. the new-born offspring, because for want of grass she cannot sustain herself and her young. &#1506;&#1494;&#1493;&#1489;, infin. abs. set with emphasis for the temp. fin., as <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-43.htm">Genesis 41:43</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/8-11.htm">Exodus 8:11</a>, and often; cf. Gesen. 131, 4, a, Ew. 351, c. The hind was regarded by the ancients as tenderly caring for her young, cf. Boch. Hieroz. i. lib. 3, c. 17 (ii. p. 254, ed. Ros.) The wild asses upon the bleak mountain-tops, where these animals choose to dwell, gasp for air, because, by reason of the dreadful drought, it is not possible to get a breath of air even on the hills. Like the &#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, jackals, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-10.htm">Jeremiah 9:10</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-22.htm">Jeremiah 10:22</a>, etc. Vulg. has dracones, with the Aram. versions; and Hitz. and Graf are of opinion that the mention of jackals is not here in point, and that, since &#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; does not mean dracones, the word stands here, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-3.htm">Exodus 29:3</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/32-2.htm">Exodus 32:2</a>, for &#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503;, the monster inhabiting the water, a crocodile or some kind of whale that stretches its head out of the water to draw breath with gaping jaws. On this Ng. has well remarked: he cannot see why the gaping, panting jaws of the jackal should not serve as a figure in such a case as the present. Their eyes fail away - from exhaustion due to want of wear. &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1489;, bushes and under-shrubs, as distinguished from &#1491;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;, green grass. </body></html>
