As <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-15.htm" title="O LORD, you know: remember me, and visit me, and revenge me of my persecutors; take me not away in your long-suffering: know that for your sake I have suffered rebuke.">Jeremiah 15:15</a> -implies that he had already suffered scorn or persecution for his prophetic work, we may reasonably assume some period not earlier than the reign of Jehoiakim.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/jeremiah/14.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-1.htm" title="The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah concerning the dearth.">Jeremiah 14:1</a></span>. <span class="ital">The word of the Lord concerning the dearth </span>— Hebrew, <span class="greekheb">על דברי הבצרות</span>, <span class="ital">respecting the matters of the restraints, </span>that is, the <span class="ital">drought, </span>when the showers were restrained, or, as Moses and Solomon express it, <span class="ital">when the heaven was shut up, and there was no rain. </span>See <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-17.htm" title="And then the LORD's wrath be kindled against you, and he shut up the heaven, that there be no rain, and that the land yield not her fruit; and lest you perish quickly from off the good land which the LORD gives you.">Deuteronomy 11:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-35.htm" title="And in the top of the base was there a round compass of half a cubit high: and on the top of the base the ledges thereof and the borders thereof were of the same.">1 Kings 7:35</a>.

At what precise time this great drought took place, we are not informed in the records of history: nor whether it be the same with that of which an intimation is given chap <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-3.htm" title="Therefore the showers have been withheld, and there has been no latter rain; and you had a whore's forehead, you refused to be ashamed.">Jeremiah 3:3</a>, where see the note. That it was a calamity very incident to the land of Israel, and applied as a punishment of sin, appears from many parts of the Old Testament. The effects of it are described in the next five verses in very elegant and moving language, and afterward earnestly deprecated.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/14.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>14:1-9 The people were in tears. But it was rather the cry of their trouble, and of their sin, than of their prayer. Let us be thankful for the mercy of water, that we may not be taught to value it by feeling the want of it. See what dependence husbandmen have upon the Divine providence. They cannot plough nor sow in hope, unless God water their furrows. The case even of the wild beasts was very pitiable. The people are not forward to pray, but the prophet prays for them. Sin is humbly confessed. Our sins not only accuse us, but answer against us. Our best pleas in prayer are those fetched from the glory of God's own name. We should dread God's departure, more than the removal of our creature-comforts. He has given Israel his word to hope in. It becomes us in prayer to show ourselves more concerned for God's glory than for our own comfort. And if we now return to the Lord, he will save us to the glory of his grace.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The dearth - Really, the drought, <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 14<p>Jer 14:1-22.

Or, "concerning the words of straints" (x); that is, concerning the businesses of a drought, as the Targum; concerning the Lord's restraining rain from the earth, and forbidding the heavens dropping it down; the consequence of which is a drought, or dryness of the earth; and the effect of that a famine; when this was it is not anywhere said; it could not be the famine at the siege of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar, because that only affected the city; this all Judea. Some think it was in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah, long before the siege; and others, that it was in the reign of Jehoiakim, since we read of a fast in his time, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-9.htm">Jeremiah 36:9</a>, which might be on this occasion; and it appears that there was one at this time, though not acceptable to God; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-12.htm">Jeremiah 14:12</a>. <p>(x)   "super verbis, cohibitionum", Junius &amp; Tremellius; "retentionum"; Tigurine version; "prohibitionum", Pagninus, Montanus. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/14.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah concerning the <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> dearth.</span><p>(a) Which came for lack of rain as in Jer 14:4.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The dearth</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the</span> <span class="accented">drought</span>, or, more literally, the droughts, the plural being used to indicate the length of time the drought lasted. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/13.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>This will befall the daughter of Zion for her sore transgressions. Therefore will she be covered with scorn and shame. The manner of her dishonour, discovery of the skirts (here and esp. in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-26.htm">Jeremiah 13:26</a>), recalls <a href="http://biblehub.com/nahum/3-5.htm">Nahum 3:5</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/47-3.htm">Isaiah 47:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-5.htm">Hosea 2:5</a>. Chr. B. Mich. and others understand the violent treatment of the heels to be the loading of the feet with chains; but the mention of heels is not in keeping with this. Still less can the exposure of the heels by the upturning of the skirts be called maltreatment of the heels; nor can it be that, as Hitz. holds, the affront is simply specialized by the mention of the heels instead of the person. The thing can only mean, that the person will be driven forth into exile barefoot and with violence, perhaps under the rod; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-52.htm">Psalm 89:52</a>. </body></html>
