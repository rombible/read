So that by this passage we are to understand, that all the persons who appeared in public were dejected, and put on black, or mourning, on account of the national distress.” <span class="ital">And the cry of Jerusalem is gone up </span>— Namely, to heaven: That is, the cry of the inhabitants of Jerusalem; of their sin and trouble, but not, as it seems, of their confessions, prayers, and supplications.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/14.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>14:1-9 The people were in tears. But it was rather the cry of their trouble, and of their sin, than of their prayer. Let us be thankful for the mercy of water, that we may not be taught to value it by feeling the want of it. See what dependence husbandmen have upon the Divine providence. They cannot plough nor sow in hope, unless God water their furrows. The case even of the wild beasts was very pitiable. The people are not forward to pray, but the prophet prays for them. Sin is humbly confessed. Our sins not only accuse us, but answer against us. Our best pleas in prayer are those fetched from the glory of God's own name. We should dread God's departure, more than the removal of our creature-comforts. He has given Israel his word to hope in. It becomes us in prayer to show ourselves more concerned for God's glory than for our own comfort. And if we now return to the Lord, he will save us to the glory of his grace.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They are black unto the ground - The people assembled at the gates, the usual places of concourse, are in deep mourning and sit humbly on the ground. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. gates&#8212;The place of public concourse in each city looks sad, as being no longer frequented (Isa 3:26; 24:4).<p>black&#8212;that is, they mourn (blackness being indicative of sorrow), (Jer 8:21).<p>unto the ground&#8212;bowing towards it.<p>cry&#8212;of distress (1Sa 5:12; Isa 24:11).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/14.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> By <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Judah</span> is meant the men and women in the whole country of Judah.

The consequential clause introduced by &#1490;&#1468;&#1501; &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501; connects with the possibility suggested in, but denied by, the preceding question: if that could happen, then might even ye do good. The one thing is as impossible as the other. And so the Lord must scatter Judah among the heathen, like stubble swept away by the desert wind, lit., passing by with the desert wind. The desert wind is the strong east wind that blows from the Arabian Desert; see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-11.htm">Jeremiah 4:11</a>. </body></html>
