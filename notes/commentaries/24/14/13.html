The colleges or schools of the prophets had rapidly degenerated from their first ideal, and had become (as the Mendicant Orders did in the history of mediæval Christendom) corrupt, ambitious, seekers after popularity. So Micah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/micah/3-8.htm" title="But truly I am full of power by the spirit of the LORD, and of judgment, and of might, to declare to Jacob his transgression, and to Israel his sin.">Micah 3:8-11</a>), whose words were yet fresh in the memories of men (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-18.htm" title="Micah the Morasthite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and spoke to all the people of Judah, saying, Thus said the LORD of hosts; Zion shall be plowed like a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of a forest.">Jeremiah 26:18</a>), had spoken sharp words of the growing evil.

Being grieved at heart for the people, because he was forbid to pray for them, and because the Lord had resolved on the ruin of them; and the rather he pitied them, because they were deceived by the false prophets, and therefore he tries to excuse them, and lay the blame upon them, as follows: <p>behold, the prophets say unto them; that is, the false prophets, as the Targum; Jeremiah does not call them so, being willing to make the best of it: <p>ye shall not see the sword; the sword of the enemy drawn in your country, or fall by it: <p>neither shall ye have famine; by which it appears, that it was not yet come, only foretold; the contrary to which is here affirmed: <p>but I will give you assured peace in this place; so they spoke as from the Lord, and in his name, with all the confidence imaginable; assuring the people that they should have peace and prosperity, and be in the utmost safety in Jerusalem; and that neither famine nor sword would come to them, nor in the least hurt them.

The greater part of the prophetic order had not kept pace with its more spiritual members (Isaiah, Jeremiah, etc.). They still traded on those natural gifts of divination (<a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/3-6.htm">Micah 3:6</a>) which were, no doubt, where genuine, of Divine origin, but which, even then, needed to be supplemented and controlled by a special impulse from the Spirit of holiness. Jeremiah, however, declares, on the authority of a revelation, that these prophets did not divine by any God-given faculty, but "the deceit of their own heart" (Ver. 14). The Deuteronomic <span class="accented">Torah</span>, discovered after a period of concealment at the outset of Jeremiah's ministry, energetically forbids the practice of the art of divination (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-10.htm">Deuteronomy 18:10</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/14.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The prayer. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-7.htm">Jeremiah 14:7</a>. "If our iniquities testify against us, O Jahveh, deal Thou for Thy name's sake, for many are our backslidings; against Thee have we sinned. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-8.htm">Jeremiah 14:8</a>. Thou hope of Israel, his Saviour in time of need, why wilt Thou be as a stranger in the land, like a wayfarer that hath put up to tarry for a night? <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-9.htm">Jeremiah 14:9</a>. Why wilt Thou be as a man astonied, as a mighty man that cannot help, and yet Thou art in the midst of us, Jahveh, and Thy name is named upon us - O leave us not!"<p>The prophet utters this prayer in the name of his people (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-11.htm">Jeremiah 14:11</a>). It begins with confession of sore transgression. Thus the chastisement which has befallen them they have deserved as a just punishment; but the Lord is besought to help for His name's sake, i.e., not: "for the sake of Thy honour, with which it is not consistent that contempt of Thy will should go unpunished" (Hitz.). This interpretation suits neither the idea of the name of God nor the context. The name of God is the manifestation of God's being. From Moses' time on, God, as Jahveh, has revealed Himself as the Redeemer and Saviour of the children of Israel, whom He had adopted to be His people, and as God, who is merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and of great goodness and faithfulness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6</a>). As such He is besought to reveal Himself now that they confess their backsliding and sin, and seek His grace. Not for the sake of His honour in the eyes of the world, lest the heathen believe He has no power to help, as Graf holds, for all reference to the heathen nations is foreign to this connection; but He is entreated to help, not to belie the hope of His people, because Israel sets its hope in Him as Saviour in time of need (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-9.htm">Jeremiah 14:9</a>). If by withholding rain He makes His land and people to pine, then He does not reveal Himself as the lord and owner of Judah, not as the God that dwells amidst His people; but He seems a stranger passing through the land, who sets up His tent there only to spend the night, who "feels no share in the weal and woe of the dwellers therein" (Hitz.). This is the meaning of the question in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-8.htm">Jeremiah 14:8</a>. The ancient expositors take &#1504;&#1496;&#1492; elliptically, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-8.htm">Genesis 12:8</a> : that stretches out His tent to pass the night. Hitz., again, objects that the wayfarer does not drag a tent about with him, and, like Ew., takes this verb in the sense of swerve from the direct route, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-19.htm">2 Samuel 2:19</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-21.htm">2 Samuel 2:21</a>, etc. But the reason alleged is not tenable; since travellers did often carry their tents with them, and &#1504;&#1496;&#1492;, to turn oneself, is not used absolutely in the sig. to turn aside from the way, without the qualification: to the right or to the left. &#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; is in use for to turn aside to tarry, to turn in, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-5.htm">Jeremiah 15:5</a>. We therefore abide by the old interpretation, since "swerve from the way" has here no suitable meaning. </body></html>
