By some scholars the word is taken as meaning, like a kindred word in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/29-3.htm" title="Speak, and say, Thus said the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against you, Pharaoh king of Egypt, the great dragon that lies in the middle of his rivers, which has said, My river is my own, and I have made it for myself.">Ezekiel 29:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-2.htm" title="Son of man, take up a lamentation for Pharaoh king of Egypt, and say to him, You are like a young lion of the nations, and you are as a whale in the seas: and you came forth with your rivers, and troubled the waters with your feet, and fouled their rivers.">Ezekiel 32:2</a>, “crocodiles,” with their wide gaping jaws.<p><span class= "bld">There was no grass.</span>—The word is not the same as that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-5.htm" title="Yes, the hind also calved in the field, and forsook it, because there was no grass.">Jeremiah 14:5</a>, and implies <span class= "bld">a </span>larger and ranker herbage than that on which the hind fed.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/14.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>14:1-9 The people were in tears. But it was rather the cry of their trouble, and of their sin, than of their prayer. Let us be thankful for the mercy of water, that we may not be taught to value it by feeling the want of it. See what dependence husbandmen have upon the Divine providence. They cannot plough nor sow in hope, unless God water their furrows. The case even of the wild beasts was very pitiable. The people are not forward to pray, but the prophet prays for them. Sin is humbly confessed. Our sins not only accuse us, but answer against us. Our best pleas in prayer are those fetched from the glory of God's own name. We should dread God's departure, more than the removal of our creature-comforts. He has given Israel his word to hope in. It becomes us in prayer to show ourselves more concerned for God's glory than for our own comfort. And if we now return to the Lord, he will save us to the glory of his grace.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Like dragons - "Like jackals" <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-11.htm">Jeremiah 9:11</a>.<p>No grass - The keen sight of the wild donkey is well known, but they look around in vain for herb. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. wild asses&#8212;They repair to "the high places" most exposed to the winds, which they "snuff in" to relieve their thirst.<p>dragons&#8212;jackals [Henderson].<p>eyes&#8212;which are usually most keen in detecting grass or water from the "heights," so much so that the traveller guesses from their presence that there must be herbage and water near; but now "their eyes fail." Rather the reference is to the great boas and python serpents which raise a large portion of their body up in a vertical column ten or twelve feet high, to survey the neighborhood above the surrounding bushes, while with open jaws they drink in the air. These giant serpents originated the widely spread notions which typified the deluge and all destructive agents under the form of a dragon or monster serpent; hence, the dragon temples always near water, in Asia, Africa, and Britain; for example, at Abury, in Wiltshire; a symbol of the ark is often associated with the dragon as the preserver from the waters [Kitto, Biblical Cyclop&aelig;dia].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/14.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The wild asses, </span> wanting water, got upon <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">high places, </span> where was the freest and coolest air, and sucked in the wind, and this it is said they did <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">like dragons, </span> of whom Aristotle and Pliny report, that by reason of the great heat of their bodies, they ordinarily stand upon high places sucking in the cool air, and they tell us those creatures will live upon it for some time. The prophet describing this great drought, tells us the wild asses did the like. But for want of grass their eyes were either almost sunk in their heads, they being almost starved; or else the phrase signifies the frustration of their expectation, which this phrase also sometimes signifies in Scripture, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-3.htm" title="I am weary of my crying: my throat is dried: my eyes fail while I wait for my God.">Psalm 69:3</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/14.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the wild asses did stand in the high places,.... To see where any grass was to be had, or where the wind blows more freely and cooly, to draw it in; as follows. The Targum renders it, "by the brooks"; and so Jarchi interprets it brooks of water; whither they came as usual to drink, and found them now dried up; and where they stood distressed and languishing, not knowing where to go for any: <p>they snuffed up the wind like dragons: which, being of a hot nature, open their mouths, and draw in the wind and air to cool them. Aelianus (b) reports of the dragons in Phrygia, that they open their mouths, and not only draw in the air, but even birds flying. The word used for dragons signifies large fishes, great whales; and some understand it of crocodiles, who will lift up their heads above water to refresh themselves with the air: <p>their eyes did fail; in looking about for grass; or for want of food, being quite starved and famished: <p>because there was no grass; for their food and nourishment. With great propriety is the herb or grass mentioned, this being the proper food of asses, as Aristotle (c) observes; and with which agrees the Scripture; which represents them as content when they have it; and as ranging about the mountains for it when they have none; being creatures very impatient of hunger and thirst; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-5.htm">Job 6:5</a> wherefore the Greek writers surname this animal dry and thirsty; and hence the lying story of Tacitus (d), concerning Moses and the children of Israel; who, he says, being ready to perish for want of water, Moses observed a flock of wild asses going from their pasture to a rock covered with trees, and followed them, taking it for herbage, and found large fountains of water. And very pertinently are their eyes said to fail for want of food, and the sight of them grow dim, which is more or less the case of all creatures in such circumstances; but the rather is this observed of the wild ass, because, as an Arabic writer (e) suggests, it is naturally very sharp and clear sighted. <p>(b) De Animal. l. 2. c. 21.

This shall be thy lot. Hitz. renders &#1502;&#1504;&#1514; &#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1498;: portion of thy garment, that is allotted for the swelling folds of thy garment (cf. Ruth. Jer 3:15; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-39.htm">2 Kings 4:39</a>), on the ground that &#1502;&#1491; never means mensura, but garment only. This is, however, no conclusive argument; since so many words admit of two plural forms, so that &#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; might be formed from &#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1492;; and since so many are found in the singular in the forms of both genders, so that, alongside of &#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1492;, &#1502;&#1491; might also be used in the sense of mensura; especially as both the signiff. measure and garment are derived from the same root meaning of &#1502;&#1491;&#1491;. We therefore adhere to the usual rendering, portio mensurae tuae, the share portioned out to thee. &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, causal, because. Trusted in falsehood, i.e., both in delusive promises (<a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-4.htm">Jeremiah 7:4</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-8.htm">Jeremiah 7:8</a>) and in the help of beingless gods (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-19.htm">Jeremiah 16:19</a>). - In the &#1493;&#1490;&#1501;&#1470;&#1488;&#1504;&#1497; lies the force of reciprocation: because thou hast forgotten me, etc., I too have taken means to make retribution on your unthankfulness (Calv.). The threatening of this verse is word for word from <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/3-5.htm">Nahum 3:5</a>. - For her lewd idolatry Jerusalem shall be carried off like a harlot amid mockery and disgrace. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-27.htm">Jeremiah 13:27</a> the language is cumulative, to lay as great stress as possible on Jerusalem's idolatrous ongoings. Thy lewd neighing, i.e., thy ardent longing for and running after strange gods; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-8.htm">Jeremiah 5:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-24.htm">Jeremiah 2:24</a>. &#1494;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-27.htm">Ezekiel 16:27</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-9.htm">Ezekiel 22:9</a>, etc., of the crime of uncleanness, see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-17.htm">Leviticus 18:17</a>. The three words are accusatives dependent on &#1512;&#1488;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497;, though separated from it by the specification of place, and therefore summed up again in "thine abominations." The addition: in the field, after "upon the hills," is meant to make more prominent the publicity of the idolatrous work. The concluding sentence: thou shalt not become clean for how long a time yet, is not to be regarded as contradictory of <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-23.htm">Jeremiah 13:23</a>, which affirms that the people is beyond the reach of reformation; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-23.htm">Jeremiah 13:23</a> is not a hyperbolical statement, reduced within its true limits here. What is said in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-23.htm">Jeremiah 13:23</a> is true of the present generation, which cleaves immoveably to wickedness. It does not exclude the possibility of a future reform on the part of the people, a purification of it from idolatry. Only this cannot be attained for a long time, until after sore and long-lasting, purifying judgments. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-14.htm">Jeremiah 12:14</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-18.htm">Jeremiah 3:18</a>. </body></html>
