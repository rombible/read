He passes through the deep waters, but struggles out of them to the rock of refuge. The word “terrible” was used with a special significance. Jehovah had promised to deliver the prophet from the “terrible” ones (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-21.htm" title="And I will deliver you out of the hand of the wicked, and I will redeem you out of the hand of the terrible.">Jeremiah 15:21</a>).

But ver. 7 may be read, Thou hast persuaded me, and I was persuaded. Thou wast stronger than I; and didst overpower me by the influence of thy Spirit upon me. So long as we see ourselves in the way of God, and of duty, it is weakness and folly, when we meet with difficulties and discouragements, to wish we had never set out in it. The prophet found the grace of God mighty in him to keep him to his business, notwithstanding the temptation he was in to throw it up. Whatever injuries are done to us, we must leave them to that God to whom vengeance belongs, and who has said, I will repay. So full was he of the comfort of God's presence, the Divine protection he was under, and the Divine promise he had to depend upon, that he stirred up himself and others to give God the glory.

There stands to this day a blot upon the memory of them who persecuted Isaiah, Jeremiah, &c., the apostles, and such faithful ministers as have been since their time. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/20.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But the Lord is with me as a mighty terrible one,.... The Targum is, <p>"the Word of the Lord is for my help.'' <p>"Mighty" to support, uphold, defend, and deliver him; and "terrible" to his enemies. The prophet looks back to the promise the Lord had made him, of his gracious and powerful presence, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-18.htm">Jeremiah 1:18</a>; which he now takes comfort from; and it would have been well if he had kept this always in view, and had continued in the same actings of faith and temper of mind: but this lasted not long, as some following verses show; <p>therefore my persecutors shall stumble, and shall not prevail; though they should very hotly and furiously pursue him, yet they should stumble and fall by the way, and not be able to overtake him, and execute their designs upon him; the Lord, who was with him, and on his side, would throw some things in their way, at which they should stumble, and which should hinder them from proceeding; <p>they shall be greatly ashamed, for they shall not prosper; when they see their schemes are disappointed, and they do not succeed, they shall be filled with shame and confusion: or, "because they do not deal prudently" (g), as the word is rendered, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-13.htm">Isaiah 52:13</a>; they do not act a wise, but a foolish part, and therefore shame will be the consequence of it; <p>their everlasting confusion shall never be forgotten; neither by themselves nor others; the memory of it will always continue, to their everlasting grief and reproach. A very learned man connects these words with the former, thus, "they shall be greatly ashamed, for they shall not prosper, with an everlasting shame never to be forgotten" (h), very rightly; so another learned interpreter (i). <p>(g)   "quia non prudenter egerunt", Montanus, Piscator; "prudenter agunt", Calvin.

"For thus hath Jahveh said: Behold, I make thee a terror to thyself and to all thy friends, and they shall fall by the sword of their enemies and thine eyes behold it; and all Judah will I give into the hand of the king of Babylon, that he may carry them captive to Babylon and smite them with the sword. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-5.htm">Jeremiah 20:5</a>. And I will give all the stores of this city, and all its gains, and all its splendour, and all the treasures of the kings of Judah will I give into the hand of their enemies, who shall plunder them and take and bring them to Babylon. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-6.htm">Jeremiah 20:6</a>. And thou, Pashur, and all that dwell in thine house shall go into captivity, and to Babylon shalt thou come, and there die, and there be buried, thou and all thy friends, to whom thou hast prophesied lyingly." - Pashur will become a fear or terror to himself and all his friends, because of his own and his friend's fate; for he will see his friends fall by the sword of the enemy, and then he himself, with those of his house and his friends not as yet slain, will go forth into exile to Babylon and die there. So that not to himself merely, but to all about him, he will be an object of fear. Ng. wrongly translates &#1504;&#1514;&#1504;&#1498; &#1500;&#1502;&#1490;&#1493;&#1512;, I deliver thee up to fear, and brings into the text the contrast that Pashur is not to become the victim of death itself, but of perpetual fear of death. Along with Pashur's friends, all Judah is to be given into the hand of the king of Babylon, and be partly exiled to Babylon, partly put to death with the sword. All the goods and gear of Jerusalem, together with the king's treasures, are to be plundered and carried off by the enemy. We must not press "all thy friends" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-4.htm">Jeremiah 20:4</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-6.htm">Jeremiah 20:6</a>; and so we escape the apparent contradiction, that while in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-4.htm">Jeremiah 20:4</a> it is said of all the friends that they shall die by the sword, it is said of all in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-6.htm">Jeremiah 20:6</a> that they shall go into exile. The friends are those who take Pashur's side, his partisans. From the last clause of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-6.htm">Jeremiah 20:6</a> we see that Pashur was also of the number of the false prophets, who prophesied the verse of Jeremiah's prediction, namely, welfare and peace (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-17.htm">Jeremiah 23:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-13.htm">Jeremiah 14:13</a>). - This saying of Jeremiah was most probably fulfilled at the taking of Jerusalem under Jechoniah, Pashur and the better part of the people being carried off to Babylon. </body></html>
