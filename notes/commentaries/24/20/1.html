We may probably identify him with the father of the Gedaliah named in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-1.htm" title="Then Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of Pashur, and Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashur the son of Malchiah, heard the words that Jeremiah had spoken to all the people, saying,">Jeremiah 38:1</a> as among the “princes” that at a later date opposed the prophet’s work, and with the section of the priesthood, the sixteenth, named in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/24-14.htm" title="The fifteenth to Bilgah, the sixteenth to Immer,">1Chronicles 24:14</a>, as headed in the time of David by Immer. The name here (like that of “the sons of Korah”) may indicate simply the fact that he belonged to this section; or, possibly, the name of the patriarch (so to speak) who gave its name to it may have re-appeared from time to time in the line of his descendants. The name of Pashur appears again, after the Captivity, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezra/2-37.htm" title="The children of Immer, a thousand fifty and two.">Ezra 2:37-38</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Chief governor.</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">deputy-governor. </span>The word for <span class= "ital">governor </span>is <span class= "ital">Nâgid, </span>and this office was assigned to the high priest as the “ruler of the house of God” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-11.htm" title="And Azariah the son of Hilkiah, the son of Meshullam, the son of Zadok, the son of Meraioth, the son of Ahitub, the ruler of the house of God;">1Chronicles 9:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-13.htm" title="And Jehiel, and Azaziah, and Nahath, and Asahel, and Jerimoth, and Jozabad, and Eliel, and Ismachiah, and Mahath, and Benaiah, were overseers under the hand of Cononiah and Shimei his brother, at the commandment of Hezekiah the king, and Azariah the ruler of the house of God.">2Chronicles 31:13</a>). In the case of Zephaniah, who appears as <span class= "ital">Nâgid </span>in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-26.htm" title="The LORD has made you priest in the stead of Jehoiada the priest, that you should be officers in the house of the LORD, for every man that is mad, and makes himself a prophet, that you should put him in prison, and in the stocks.">Jeremiah 29:26</a>, it was given to him as the “second priest” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-18.htm" title="And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door:">2Kings 25:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-14.htm" title="And all the army of the Chaldeans, that were with the captain of the guard, broke down all the walls of Jerusalem round about.">Jeremiah 52:14</a>). Next in order to him was the <span class= "ital">Pakid, </span>the deputy, or, perhaps, better, <span class= "ital">superintendent. </span>Here Pashur is described by the combination of the two titles, possibly as implying that he was invested, though a “deputy,” with the full powers of the “governor.” By some commentators, however, the relation of the two words is inverted, the <span class= "ital">Nâgid </span>being added to the <span class= "ital">Pakid, </span>to imply that Pashur was the chief warden or overseer. As such, on either view, the act and the words of Jeremiah came under his official notice. That such words should be spoken in the court of the Temple to the multitude assembled there was, we must believe, something new, and Pashur was resolved at any cost to prevent its repetition.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/jeremiah/20.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-1.htm" title="Now Pashur the son of Immer the priest, who was also chief governor in the house of the LORD, heard that Jeremiah prophesied these things.">Jeremiah 20:1</a></span>. <span class="ital">Pashur the son of Immer </span>— Pashur was not the immediate son of Immer, but of Melchiah, as is expressly mentioned <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-12.htm" title="And Adaiah the son of Jeroham, the son of Pashur, the son of Malchijah, and Maasiai the son of Adiel, the son of Jahzerah, the son of Meshullam, the son of Meshillemith, the son of Immer;">1 Chronicles 9:12</a>, and hereafter, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-1.htm" title="The word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD, when king Zedekiah sent to him Pashur the son of Melchiah, and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, saying,">Jeremiah 21:1</a>. Immer was one of his predecessors, and head of the sixteenth sacerdotal class, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/24-14.htm" title="The fifteenth to Bilgah, the sixteenth to Immer,">1 Chronicles 24:14</a>. Pashur was not high-priest, as some of the ancients have thought, but only <span class="ital">captain, </span>or <span class="ital">overseer </span>of the temple. In this capacity he had power to arrest and put in prison the false prophets, and those who caused any disturbance in the temple. This matter is further explained, by Blaney, thus: “The priests being distributed, by David, into twenty-four courses, under as many heads of families, and each of these courses officiating by turns in the temple service; the heads of each course were <span class="ital">governors of the sanctuary; </span>or, according to our translation, <span class="ital">of the house of God. </span>The meaning then will be, that these heads of the courses had not only the chief ordering of the service of the sanctuary, but were invested also with authority, at least within the precincts of the temple, to maintain peace and good order there. These persons I consider as being the same with those who in the New Testament are styled <span class="greekheb">αρχιερεις</span>, <span class="ital">chief priests, </span>being next in dignity and power to the high-priest. Pashur, it seems, was the head of the course of Immer. So that, if the course of Immer was at that time upon duty, Pashur was at the same time the acting ruler or commander in the temple. And this I conceive to be implied in the words here used, <span class="greekheb">נגיד</span>, implying his authority to command, and <span class="greekheb">פקיד</span>, that he was then in the exercise of it; and by virtue of that authority he took upon him to punish Jeremiah as a disturber of the peace. I have given this officer, or magistrate,” (namely, in his translation,) “the military title of <span class="ital">commanding officer, </span>because it was usual to consider the temple as a kind of garrison, held by high-priests under military subordination. And for this reason, no doubt, we find him called by the name of <span class="greekheb">στρατηγος του ιερου</span>, <span class="ital">captain of the temple, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-1.htm" title="And as they spoke to the people, the priests, and the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees, came on them,">Acts 4:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-24.htm" title="Now when the high priest and the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these things, they doubted of them whereunto this would grow.">Acts 5:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-26.htm" title="Then went the captain with the officers, and brought them without violence: for they feared the people, lest they should have been stoned.">Acts 5:26</a>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-52.htm" title="Then Jesus said to the chief priests, and captains of the temple, and the elders, which were come to him, Be you come out, as against a thief, with swords and staves?">Luke 22:52</a>, <span class="ital">captains, </span><span class="greekheb">στρατηγοι</span>, are spoken of, in the plural number; which may perhaps be thus accounted for. As on the great festivals, not only the priests of the ordinary course, but the whole body of priests, were called upon to assist in the sacrifices; so on account of the multitudes that flocked to the temple at these times, the guards were also necessarily doubled, and, of course, a greater number of <span class="ital">captains </span>were on constant duty; and many, if not all these, came to assist in apprehending Jesus, as on a service which might be esteemed hazardous, on account of the number of his disciples.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/20.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>20:1-6 Pashur smote Jeremiah, and put him in the stocks. Jeremiah was silent till God put a word into his mouth. To confirm this, Pashur has a name given him, Fear on every side. It speaks a man not only in distress, but in despair; not only in danger, but in fear on every side. The wicked are in great fear where no fear is, for God can make the most daring sinner a terror to himself. And those who will not hear of their faults from God's prophets, shall be made to hear them from their consciences. Miserable is the man thus made a terror to himself. His friends shall fail him.

This Pashur is distinct from Pashur, son of Melchiah (Jer 21:1). The "captains" (Lu 22:4) seem to have been over the twenty-four guards of the temple, and had only the right of apprehending any who were guilty of delinquency within it; but the Sanhedrim had the judicial power over such delinquents [Grotius] (Jer 26:8, 10, 16).Pashur, smiting Jeremiah.for this prophecy, receiveth a new name, and a fearful doom, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/20-1.htm" title="Now Pashur the son of Immer the priest, who was also chief governor in the house of the LORD, heard that Jeremiah prophesied these things....">Jeremiah 20:1-6</a></span>.

Not the immediate son of Immer, but one that descended from him after many generations; for Immer was a priest in David's time, to whom the sixteenth course of the priests fell by lot, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/24-14.htm">1 Chronicles 24:14</a>; <p>who was also chief governor in the house of the Lord; the temple; not the high priest, since he was of the course of Immer; perhaps he was the head of the course to which he belonged, the chief of the priests of that course. The Targum calls him the "sagan" of the priests. There was such an officer, who was called the "sagan" or deputy to the high priest, who upon certain occasions acted for him; and some think that this man was in the same office; though others take him to be the same with the captain of the temple, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-1.htm">Acts 4:1</a>. Who <p>heard that Jeremiah prophesied these things; some that heard him in the court of the temple prophesying of the evil that should come upon the city, and places adjacent to it, went and told the chief governor of it. Though the words may be rendered, "now Pashur heard (u)----Jeremiah prophesying these things"; he heard him himself; either he was one of the ancients of the priests that went with him to Tophet, and heard him there; or, however, when he came from thence, and stood and prophesied in the court of the temple, he heard him. <p>(u)  "audivit autem", Paschchurus, Schmidt; "audiens autem", Paschhur, Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/20.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Now Pashur the son of Immer the priest, who was also chief governor in the house of the LORD, heard that Jeremiah prophesied these things.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/20.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-1.htm" title="Now Pashur the son of Immer the priest, who was also chief governor in the house of the LORD, heard that Jeremiah prophesied these things."><span class="bld">Jeremiah 20:1</a>.</span> <span class="ital">Now Pashhur the son of Immer the priest</span>] The name seems to have been a common one.

Doubt has been thrown on the authentic character of this passage, inasmuch as in later times Immer (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-37.htm" title="The children of Immer, a thousand fifty and two.">Ezra 2:37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/10-20.htm" title="And of the sons of Immer; Hanani, and Zebadiah.">Ezra 10:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/7-40.htm" title="The children of Immer, a thousand fifty and two.">Nehemiah 7:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-13.htm" title="And his brothers, chief of the fathers, two hundred forty and two: and Amashai the son of Azareel, the son of Ahasai, the son of Meshillemoth, the son of Immer,">Nehemiah 11:13</a>) and apparently Pashhur (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-38.htm" title="The children of Pashur, a thousand two hundred forty and seven.">Ezra 2:38</a> in C.B.) were the names of priestly <span class="ital">families</span>, while in Jeremiah they are <span class="ital">personal</span> names. Moreover, since in b.c. 537 the priestly house of Immer was 1052 strong (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-37.htm" title="The children of Immer, a thousand fifty and two.">Ezra 2:37</a> and so <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/7-40.htm" title="The children of Immer, a thousand fifty and two.">Nehemiah 7:40</a>), it cannot have been named after the father of this P. But “son of Immer,” as Co. points out, may only mean a member of the family named after him as ancestor.

The first series, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-6.htm">Jeremiah 19:6-9</a>, is introduced by &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;, which intimates the meaning of the pitcher; and the other, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-10.htm">Jeremiah 19:10-13</a>, is bound up with the breaking of the pitcher. But both series are, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-6.htm">Jeremiah 19:6</a>, opened by the mention of the locality of the act. As <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-5.htm">Jeremiah 19:5</a> was but an expansion of <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-31.htm">Jeremiah 7:31</a>, so <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-6.htm">Jeremiah 19:6</a> is a literal repetition of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-32.htm">Jeremiah 7:32</a>. The valley of Benhinnom, with its places for abominable sacrifices (&#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1514;, see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-32.htm">Jeremiah 7:32</a>), shall in the future be called Valley of Slaughter; i.e., at the judgment on Jerusalem it will be the place where the inhabitants of Jerusalem and Judah will be slain by the enemy. There God will make void (&#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;, playing on &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1489;&#1468;&#1511;), i.e., bring to nothing; for what is poured out comes to nothing; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-3.htm">Isaiah 19:3</a>. There they shall fall by the sword in such numbers that their corpses shall be food for the beasts of prey (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-33.htm">Jeremiah 7:33</a>), and the city of Jerusalem shall be frightfully ravaged (<a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-8.htm">Jeremiah 19:8</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-16.htm">Jeremiah 18:16</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-9.htm">Jeremiah 25:9</a>, etc.). &#1502;&#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1492; (plural form of suffix without Jod; cf.

That this appalling misery did actually come about during the last siege by the Chaldeans, we learn from <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-10.htm">Lamentations 4:10</a>. - The second series, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-10.htm">Jeremiah 19:10-13</a>, is introduced by the act of breaking the pitcher. This happens before the eyes of the elders who have accompanied Jeremiah thither: to them the explanatory word of the Lord is addressed. As the earthen pitcher, so shall Jerusalem - people and city - be broken to pieces; and that irremediably. This is implied in: as one breaks a potter's vessel, etc. (&#1492;&#1512;&#1508;&#1492; for &#1492;&#1512;&#1508;&#1488;). The next clause: and in Tophet they shall bury, etc., is omitted by the lxx as a repetition from <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-32.htm">Jeremiah 7:32</a>, and is object to by Ew., Hitz., and Graf, as not being in keeping with its context. Ew. proposes to insert it before "as one breaketh;" but this transposition only obscures the meaning of the clause. It connects very suitably with the idea of the incurable breaking in sunder. Because the breaking up of Jerusalem and its inhabitants shall be incurable, shall be like the breaking of a pitcher dashed into countless fragments, therefore there will be lack of room in Jerusalem to bury the dead, and the unclean places of Tophet will need to be used for that purpose. With this the further thought of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-12.htm">Jeremiah 19:12</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-13.htm">Jeremiah 19:13</a> connects simply and suitably. Thus (as had been said at <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-11.htm">Jeremiah 19:11</a>) will I do unto this place and its inhabitants, &#1493;&#1500;&#1514;&#1514;, and that to make the city as Tophet, i.e., not "a mass of sherds and rubbish, as Tophet now is" (Graf); for neither was Tophet then a rubbish-heap, nor did it so become by the breaking of the pitcher. But Josiah had turned all the place of Tophet in the valley of Benhinnom into an unclean region (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-10.htm">2 Kings 23:10</a>). All Jerusalem shall become an unclean place like Tophet. This is put in so many words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-13.htm">Jeremiah 19:13</a> : The houses of Jerusalem shall become unclean like the place Tophet, namely, all houses on whose roofs idolatry has been practised. The construction of &#1492;&#1496;&#1468;&#1502;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501; causes some difficulty. The position of the word at the end disfavours our connecting it with the subject &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;, and so does the article, which does not countenance its being taken as predicate. To get rid of the article, J. D. Mich. and Ew. sought to change the reading into &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; &#1496;&#1502;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501;, after <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-33.htm">Isaiah 30:33</a>. But &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;  means a Tophet-like place, not Tophet itself, and so gives no meaning to the purpose. No other course is open than to join the word with "the place Tophet:" like the place Tophet, which is unclean. The plural would then be explained less from the collective force of &#1502;&#1511;&#1493;&#1501; than from regard to the plural subject. "All the houses" opens a supplementary definition of the subject: as concerning all houses; cf. Ew. 310, a. On the worship of the stars by sacrifice on the housetops, transplanted by Manasseh to Jerusalem, see the expos. of <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-5.htm">Zephaniah 1:5</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-3.htm">2 Kings 21:3</a>. '&#1493;&#1492;&#1505;&#1468;&#1498;, coinciding literally with <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-18.htm">Jeremiah 7:18</a>; the inf. absol. being attached to the verb. finit. of the former clause (Ew. 351, c.). - Thus far the word of the Lord to Jeremiah, which he was to proclaim in the valley of Benhinnom. - The execution of the divine commission is, as being a matter of course, not expressly recounted, but is implied in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-14.htm">Jeremiah 19:14</a> as having taken place. </body></html>
