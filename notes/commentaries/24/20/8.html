The conviction of his own mind that he ought to speak, his zeal for the glory of God, his indignation at the sins of the people, and his compassion for their souls, would not suffer him to rest, or allow him to forbear declaring God’s message.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/20.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>20:7-13 The prophet complains of the insult and injury he experienced.

So long as we see ourselves in the way of God, and of duty, it is weakness and folly, when we meet with difficulties and discouragements, to wish we had never set out in it. The prophet found the grace of God mighty in him to keep him to his business, notwithstanding the temptation he was in to throw it up. Whatever injuries are done to us, we must leave them to that God to whom vengeance belongs, and who has said, I will repay. So full was he of the comfort of God's presence, the Divine protection he was under, and the Divine promise he had to depend upon, that he stirred up himself and others to give God the glory.

Pashur is by the appellation: son of Immer, distinguished from other priests of this name, e.g., Pashur, son of Malchijah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-12.htm">1 Chronicles 9:12</a>. It cannot be determined whether Immer is here the name of the 16th class of priests (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/24-14.htm">1 Chronicles 24:14</a>) or of one of the greater priestly clans (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-37.htm">Ezra 2:37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/7-40.htm">Nehemiah 7:40</a>). Pashur held the office of &#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1497;&#1491; &#1504;&#1490;&#1497;&#1491;, chief overseer in the house of God. &#1504;&#1490;&#1497;&#1491; is an official name attached to &#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1497;&#1491; to explain it. In the latter word lies the idea of overseeing, while the former denotes the official standing or rank of the overseer. The position of &#1504;&#1490;&#1497;&#1491; was a high one, as may be seen from the fact that the priest Zephaniah, who, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-26.htm">Jeremiah 29:26</a>, held this post, is quoted in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-24.htm">Jeremiah 52:24</a> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-18.htm">2 Kings 25:18</a>) as next to the high priest. The compound expression without article implies that there were several &#1504;&#1490;&#1497;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; of the temple. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-8.htm">2 Chronicles 35:8</a> there are three mentioned under Josiah; which is not contradicted by <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-13.htm">2 Chronicles 31:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-11.htm">1 Chronicles 9:11</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-11.htm">Nehemiah 11:11</a>, where particular persons are called '&#1504;&#1490;&#1497;&#1491;. As chief overseer of the temple, Pashur conceived it to be his duty to take summary magisterial steps against Jeremiah, for his public appearance in the temple. To put this procedure of the priest and temple-warden in its proper light, Jeremiah is designated by the name of his office, &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488;.<p>(Note: As this official designation of Jeremiah is not found in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1.htm">Jeremiah 1-19</a>, but occurs frequently in the succeeding chapters, recent critics have taken it to be an idle addition of the editor of the later prophecies, and have laid stress on the fact as a proof of the later composition, or at least later editing, of these pieces; cf. Graf, S. xxxix. Ng., etc. This assumption is totally erroneous. The designation of Jeremiah as &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488; occurs only where the mention of the man's official character was of importance. It is used partly in contradistinction to the false prophets, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/28-5.htm">Jeremiah 28:5-6</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/28-10.htm">Jeremiah 28:10-12</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/28-15.htm">Jeremiah 28:15</a>, to the elders, priests, and false prophets, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-1.htm">Jeremiah 29:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-29.htm">Jeremiah 29:29</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-3.htm">Jeremiah 37:3</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-6.htm">Jeremiah 37:6</a>,<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-13.htm">Jeremiah 37:13</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/42-2.htm">Jeremiah 42:2</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/42-4.htm">Jeremiah 42:4</a>, to the king, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-2.htm">Jeremiah 32:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-6.htm">Jeremiah 34:6</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-2.htm">Jeremiah 37:2</a>, and partly to distinguish from persons of other conditions in life, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/43-6.htm">Jeremiah 43:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/45-1.htm">Jeremiah 45:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-59.htm">Jeremiah 51:59</a>. We never find the title in the headings of the prophecies save in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-2.htm">Jeremiah 25:2</a>, with reference to the fact that here, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-4.htm">Jeremiah 20:4</a>, he upbraids the people for not regarding the sayings of all the prophets of the Lord; and in the oracles against foreign peoples, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-1.htm">Jeremiah 46:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-13.htm">Jeremiah 46:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/47-1.htm">Jeremiah 47:1</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-34.htm">Jeremiah 49:34</a>, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-1.htm">Jeremiah 50:1</a>, where the name of his calling gave him credentials for these prophecies. - There is no further use of the name in the entire book.)<p>In virtue of the summary authority which belonged to him (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-26.htm">Jeremiah 29:26</a>), Pashur smote the prophet, i.e., caused him to be beaten with stripes, perhaps according to the precept <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/25-3.htm">Deuteronomy 25:3</a>, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-24.htm">2 Corinthians 11:24</a>, and then threw him into prison till the following day, and put him in the stocks. &#1502;&#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1499;&#1514;, twisting, was an instrument of torture by which the body was forced into a distorted, unnatural posture; the culprit's hands and feet were presumably bound, so as to keep the position so; see on <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-10.htm">2 Chronicles 16:10</a>, cf. with <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-24.htm">Acts 16:24</a>. The upper gate of Benjamin in the house of Jahveh is the northern gate at the upper, i.e., inner court of the temple, the same with the upper gate or the gate of the inner court, looking northwards, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/9-2.htm">Ezekiel 9:2</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-3.htm">Ezekiel 8:3</a>. By the designation "which is in the house," etc., it is distinguished from the city gate of like name, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-13.htm">Jeremiah 37:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-7.htm">Jeremiah 38:7</a>. - When on the next day Pashur released the prophet from imprisonment, the latter made known to him the divine punishment for his misdeed: "Not Pashur will Jahveh call thy name, but Magor-Missabib" (i.e., Fear round about). The name is expressive of the thing. And so: Jahveh will call the name, is, in other words, He will make the person to be that which the name expresses; in this case, make Pashur to be an object of fear round about. Under the presumption that the name Magor-Missabib conveyed a meaning the most directly opposed to that of Pashur, comm. have in various ways attempted to interpret &#1508;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;. It is supposed to be composed of &#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;, Chald. augeri, and &#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, nobilitas, with the force: abundantia claritatis (Rashi); or after Arab. fs&#768;, gloriatus est de nobilitate (Simonis); or from Arab. hsh, amplus fuit locus, and the Chald. &#1505;&#1495;&#1493;&#1512;, circumcirca: de securitate circumcirca; or finally, by Ew., from &#1508;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473; from &#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;, spring, leap, rejoice (<a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-18.htm">Malachi 3:18</a>), and &#1495;&#1493;&#1512;  equals  &#1495;&#1493;&#1500;, joy round about. All these interpretations are arbitrary. &#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473; sig. leap and gallop about, <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-18.htm">Malachi 3:18</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-8.htm">Habakkuk 1:8</a>, and in Niph. <a href="http://biblehub.com/nahum/3-18.htm">Nahum 3:18</a>, to be scattered (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-8.htm">Habakkuk 1:8</a>); and x#ap@f sig. in <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-11.htm">Lamentations 3:11</a> to tear.

Nor are there, indeed, sufficient grounds for assuming that Jeremiah turned the original name upside down in an etymological or philological reference. The new name given by Jeremiah to Pashur is meant to intimate the man's destiny. On "Fear round about," see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-25.htm">Jeremiah 6:25</a>.
