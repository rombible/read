The word is, however, very variously interpreted, and the meaning of “voice,” or “cry,” in the sense in which the “cry” of Sodom and Gomorrah was great (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-20.htm" title="And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous;">Genesis 18:20</a>), seems more satisfactory.

In the reigns of Manasseh and Amon, who were disposed to idolatry, the people were so too, and all the country was corrupted by it, none fearing the ruin which Israel, by this sin, had brought on themselves. God therefore tried whether they would manifest a different spirit and conduct under a good king, but the evil disposition was still the same, and they returned not to the Lord <span class="ital">with all their hearts, but feignedly </span>— They were forced indeed to an external compliance with Josiah, who went further in destroying idolatry than the best of his predecessors had done, joined with him in keeping a very solemn passover, and in professing to renew their covenants with God, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-32.htm" title="And he caused all that were present in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand to it.

So apparently the ancient versions. The only sense, however, which the word <span class="accented">kol</span> ever has in Hebrew is not "lightness," but "sound," "voice," and perhaps "rumor" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/45-16.htm">Genesis 45:16</a>).

But neither of these seems quite suitable to the context, and if, as King James's translators seem to have felt it necessary to do, we desert the faithful translation, and enter on the path of conjecture, why not emend <span class="accented">kol</span> into <span class="accented">klon</span> (there is no <span class="accented">vav</span>, and such fragments of true readings are not altogether uncommon in the Hebrew text), which at once yields a good meaning - "through the disgrace of her whoredom ?"
