But undoubtedly it was intended to be understood chiefly, in a spiritual sense, of their conversion to Christianity, and their reception into the gospel church, into which they partly have been, and probably hereafter in greater numbers will be admitted, “not all at a time, or in a national capacity, but severally, as individuals, here and there one.” See <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/27-12.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD shall beat off from the channel of the river to the stream of Egypt, and you shall be gathered one by one, O you children of Israel.">Isaiah 27:12</a>.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:12-20 See God's readiness to pardon sin, and the blessings reserved for gospel times.

These promises are fully to come to pass in the bringing back the Jews in after-ages. God will graciously receive those that return to him; and by his grace, he takes them out from among the rest. The ark of the covenant was not found after the captivity. The whole of that dispensation was to be done away, which took place after the multitude of believers had been greatly increased by the conversion of the Gentiles, and of the Israelites scattered among them.

I am married&#8212;literally, "I am Lord," that is, husband to you (so Jer 31:32; compare Ho 2:19, 20; Isa 54:5). Gesenius, following the Septuagint version of Jer 31:32, and Paul's quotation of it (Heb 8:9), translates, "I have rejected you"; so the corresponding Arabic, and the idea of lordship, may pass into that of looking down upon, and so rejecting. But the Septuagint in this passage translates, "I will be Lord over you." And the "for" has much more force in English Version than in that of Gesenius. The Hebrew hardly admits the rendering though [Hengstenberg].<p>take you one of a city&#8212;Though but one or two Israelites were in a (foreign) city, they shall not be forgotten; all shall be restored (Am 9:9).

All of them were children by national adoption, and some by special grace, and yet "backsliders", O monstrous ingratitude! "backsliders", and yet "children", still the relation continues, O marvellous grace! God's own children may backslide, and often do; either in heart, when love waxes cold, faith declines, zeal wanting; when they get into a carnal sleepy frame of spirit, and have not that quick sense of sin, and of duty, as heretofore: or in practice, when private prayer is restrained; public worship is neglected; get into bad company, and fall into gross sins; all which is owing to the prevalence of indwelling sin, the force of Satan's temptations, and the enticing snares of the world; but God will not leave them, he calls unto them again and again to turn unto him by repentance, and to doing their first works; which calls, at length, through powerful grace, become effectual; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-22.htm">Jeremiah 3:22</a> and the arguments used to engage to it follow, <p>for I am married unto you; in a civil sense as a nation, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-32.htm">Jeremiah 31:32</a>, and in a spiritual sense to a remnant of them; Christ is the bridegroom, the church is the bride, which he has secretly betrothed to himself in eternity; openly in time, at the conversion of everyone of them; and will more publicly at the last day, when all are gathered in and prepared for him. This relation, as it is a very near one, so it is very astonishing, considering the disparity between the two parties, and it always continues; love, the bond of it, never alters; the covenant, in which this transaction is carried on, is ever sure; and Christ always behaves agreeably to it; wherefore it is base ingratitude to backslide; and reason there is sufficient why his backsliding spouse should return to him. The Septuagint version is, "because I will rule over you." agreeable to which is Jarchi's note, <p>"because I am your Lord, and it is not for my glory, (or honour) to leave you in the hand of enemies.'' <p>Kimchi's father interprets the word used by  "I loath you", or I am weary of you; the reverse of which is the Targum, <p>"for I am well pleased with you;'' <p>and so the Syriac version, "I delight in you"; which carries in it a much more engaging argument to return, and agrees with what follows: <p>and I will take you one of a city, and two of a family: or tribe, or country; for sometimes a whole country is called a family, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-15.htm">Jeremiah 1:15</a> and here it must design more than a city; for otherwise there are many families in a city; the meaning is, according to Kimchi, that though there may be but one Jew in a city of the Gentiles, or two only in a nation, the Lord would take them from thence; and, according to others, that though one or two, or a few, here and there one of the backsliders, should return to him by true repentance, he would receive them graciously; the smallness of their number would be no objection to him; which is a sense not to be despised: but the phrase seems to denote the distinguishing grace of God to his people; which appears in the choice of them in his Son; the redemption of them by him; and the sanctification of them by his Spirit; and very few are the objects of his grace, as it were one of a city, and two of a tribe; however, they shall none of them be lost, notwithstanding their backslidings, to which they are bent: for it is added, <p>and I will bring you to Zion; to the church of God here, a Gospel church state, whither to come is the great privilege of the saints, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-22.htm">Hebrews 12:22</a> and to the Zion above, the heavenly state, where all the chosen and ransomed, and sanctified ones, shall come, with songs, and everlasting joy upon their heads, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/35-10.htm">Isaiah 35:10</a> and all as the fruit of distinguishing and efficacious grace. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Turn, O backsliding children, saith the LORD; for I am married unto you: and I will take you one of a city, and two of a family, and I will bring you to Zion:</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">14</span>. <span class="ital">one of … family</span>] Very small places were called “cities,” while “family” must mean a considerable number, a clan, or even a larger group.

After Solomon’s time its history is obscure. Was it carried off by Shishak (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-26.htm" title="And he took away the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house; he even took away all: and he took away all the shields of gold which Solomon had made.">1 Kings 14:26</a>), or removed by Manasseh (as suggested by <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-7.htm" title="And he set a carved image, the idol which he had made, in the house of God, of which God had said to David and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen before all the tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever:">2 Chronicles 33:7</a>) to be replaced, according to the Chronicler’s tradition (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-3.htm" title="And said to the Levites that taught all Israel, which were holy to the LORD, Put the holy ark in the house which Solomon the son of David king of Israel did build; it shall not be a burden on your shoulders: serve now the LORD your God, and his people Israel,">2 Chronicles 35:3</a>), by Josiah, though there is no confirmation of this in the parallel account in 2 Kings 23. We therefore cannot be sure that it existed in Jeremiah’s time. The post-exilic Temple had no Ark (Josephus, <span class="ital">Wars</span>, V. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-5.htm" title="Will he reserve his anger for ever? will he keep it to the end?

There is a play upon words, or rather upon senses, in the original, "Turn, ye turned away ones" (comp. ver. 12). To whom is this addressed? To the Israelites in the narrower sense, for there is nothing to indicate a transition. Long as they have been removed from the paternal hearth, they are still "sons." <span class="cmt_word">For I am married unto you</span>. The same Hebrew phrase occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-32.htm">Jeremiah 31:32</a>. Its signification has been a subject of dispute. From the supposed necessities of exegesis in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-32.htm">Jeremiah 31:32</a>, some (e.g. Pococke and Gesenins) have translated, "for I have rejected you," but the connection requires not "for" but "though," which, however, is an inadmissible rendering; besides, the Hebrew verb in question nowhere has the sense of "reject" elsewhere (yet the Septuagint already has it, virtually at least, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-32.htm">Jeremiah 31:32</a>, q.v.). The literal meaning is <span class="accented">for I have been a lord over you</span>, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. a husband. Israel is despondent, and fears to return. Jehovah repeats his invitation, assuring Israel that he does not regard the marriage bond as broken. He is still (in spite of ver. 8) the husband, and Israel the bride (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2.htm">Hosea 2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-1.htm">Isaiah 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-6.htm">Isaiah 54:6</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">One of a city, and two of a family</span>. The promises of God are primarily to communities, but this does not prevent him from devoting the most special care to individuals. "One of a city, and two of a family," even though there should be but one faithful Lot in a city, and two such in a family (larger than a city, a single tribe containing only a few <span class="accented">mishpa-khoth</span>, or clans), yet I will admit these few to the promised blessings." Calvin's remark is worth noticing: "Hie locus dignus est observatu, quia ostendit Deus non esse, cur alii alios expectent; deinde etiam si corpus ipsum populi putreseat in suis peccatis, tamen si pauci ad ipsum redeant, se illis etiam fore placabilem." The historical facts to which the prophecy corresponds are variously regarded. Theodoret, Grotius, etc., suppose it to have been fulfilled exclusively in the return from Babylon; St. Jerome and others think rather of the Messianic period. Hengstenberg finds a continuous fulfillment, beginning at the time of Cyrus, when many belonging to the ten tribes joined themselves to the returning Judahites. He finds a further continuation in the times of the Maccabees, and in fact a continually growing fulfillment in preparation for that complete one brought in by Christ, when the premised blessings were poured out upon the whole <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-36.htm">Luke 2:36</a>). "Zion and the holy land were at that time the seat of the kingdom of God, so that the return to the latter was inseparable from the return to the former." Dr. Guthe, however, the latest critical commentator on Jeremiah, thinks that the passage can be explained otherwise, viz." from each city one by one, and from each family two by two." This gives a more obvious explanation; but the ordinary rendering is more natural, and the explanation based upon it is in the highest degree worthy of the Divine subject. The doubt, of course, is whether in the Old Testament a special providence is extended elsewhere so distinctly to the individual. But Jeremiah is pre-eminently an individualizing prophet; he feels the depth and reality of individual as opposed to corporate life as no one else among the prophets. (At any rate, one point is clear, that the prophet foresees that the number of the exiles who return will be but small compared with the increase to be divinely vouchsafed to them; see ver. 16.) <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Many commentators have taken objection to the &#1493;&#1488;&#1512;&#1488;, because the sentence, "I saw that I had therefore given Israel a bill of divorce," is as little intelligible as "and the faithless Judah saw it, and I saw it, for," etc. Thus e.g., Graf, who proposes with Ew. and Syr. to read &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;, "and she saw," or with Jerome to omit the word from the text. To this we may add, that either the change or the omission destroys the natural relation to one another of the clauses. In either case we would have this connection: "and the faithless one, her sister Judah, saw that, because the backslider Israel had committed adultery, I had put her away...yet the faithless one feared not." But thus the gist of the thing, what Judah saw, namely, the repudiation of Israel, would be related but cursorily in a subordinate clause, and the 7th verse would be shortened into a half verse; while, on the other hand, the 8th verse would be burdened with an unnaturally long protasis. Ros. is right in declaring any change to be unnecessary, provided the two halves of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-7.htm">Jeremiah 3:7</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-8.htm">Jeremiah 3:8</a> are connected in this sense: vidi quod quum adulteram Israelitidem dimiseram, tamen non timeret ejus perfida soror Juda. If we compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-7.htm">Jeremiah 3:7</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-8.htm">Jeremiah 3:8</a> together, the correspondence between the two comes clearly out. In the first half of either verse Israel is spoken of, in the second Judah; while as to Israel, both verses state how God regarded the conduct of Israel, and as to Judah, how it observed and imitated Israel's conduct. &#1493;&#1488;&#1512;&#1488; corresponds to &#1493;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-7.htm">Jeremiah 3:7</a>. God thought the backsliding Israel will repent, and it did not, and this Judah saw. Thus, then, God saw that even the repudiation of the backsliding Israel for her adultery incited no fear in Judah, but Judah went and did whoredom like Israel. The true sense of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-8.htm">Jeremiah 3:8</a> is rendered obscure or difficult by the external co-ordination to one another of the two thoughts, that God has rejected Israel just because it has committed adultery, and, that Judah nevertheless feared not; the second thought being introduced by Vav. In reality, however, the first should be subordinated to the second thus: that although I had to reject Israel, Judah yet feared not. What God saw is not the adultery and rejection or divorce of Israel, but that Judah nevertheless had no fear in committing and persisting in the self-same sin. The &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; belongs properly to &#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492;, but this relation is obscured by the length of the prefixed grounding clause, and so &#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; is introduced by ,&#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1488;&#1491;&#1493;&#1514; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;' .&#1493; yb decud literally: that for all the reasons, because the backslider had committed adultery, I put her away and gave her a bill of divorce; yet the faithless Judah feared not. In plain English: that, in spite of all my putting away the backsliding Israel, and my giving her...because she had committed adultery, yet the faithless Judah feared not.
