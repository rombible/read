Though the two tribes saw the lightness and filthiness of the sin Israel was guilty of, and how the land was defiled with it, the stupidity of it, and the punishment inflicted on account of it: <p>her treacherous sister Judah hath not turned unto me with her whole heart, but feignedly, saith the Lord; there was a show of reformation in Josiah's time, but it was but a show; there was no true, hearty cordial repentance for the sin of idolatry, only a feigned one; there was an outward removal of it, and reformation from it, but inwardly the desires of the heart were to it; the good king, with some few others, were hearty in it, but the greater part played the hypocrite; the following reigns proved the truth of this. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And yet for all this her treacherous sister Judah hath not turned to me with <span class="cverse3">{m}</span> her whole heart, but deceitfully, saith the LORD.</span><p>(m) Judah pretended for a time that she returned, as under Josiah and other good kings, but she was never truly touched, or wholly reformed, as appeared when opportunity was offered by any wicked prince.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For all this</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. though Judah had seen the punishment of apostate Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-7.htm">Jeremiah 3:7, 8</a>). So Rashi, Naegelsbach, Payne Smith. Most commentators suppose the phrase to refer to Judah's obstinate wickedness (ver. 9), but this gives a weak sense. "Judah defiled the land, etc., and yet notwithstanding her repentance was insincere" - this is by no means a natural sequence of ideas. The right exposition increases the probability of the correction proposed at the beginning of ver. 8. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Henceforward, forsooth, it calls upon its God, and expects that His wrath will abate; but this calling on Him is but lip-service, for it goes on in its sins, amends not its life. &#1492;&#1500;&#1493;&#1488;, nonne, has usually the force of a confident assurance, introducing in the form of a question that which is held not to be in the least doubtful. &#1502;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;, henceforward, the antithesis to &#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-20.htm">Jeremiah 2:20</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-27.htm">Jeremiah 2:27</a>, is rightly referred by Chr. B. Mich. to the time of the reformation in public worship, begun by Josiah in the twelfth year of his reign, and finally completed in the eighteenth year, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-3.htm">2 Chronicles 34:3-33</a>. Clearly we cannot suppose a reference to distress and anxiety excited by the drought; since, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-3.htm">Jeremiah 3:3</a>, it is expressly said that this had made no impression on the people. On &#1488;&#1489;&#1497;, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-27.htm">Jeremiah 2:27</a>. &#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1507; &#1504;&#1506;&#1512;&#1497; (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-17.htm">Proverbs 2:17</a>), the familiar friend of my youth, is the dear beloved God, i.e., Jahveh, who has espoused Israel when it was a young nation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-2.htm">Jeremiah 2:2</a>). Of Him it expects that He will not bear a grudge for ever. &#1504;&#1496;&#1512;, guard, then like &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;, cherish ill-will, keep up, used of anger; see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/103-9.htm">Psalm 103:9</a>, etc. A like meaning has &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;, to which &#1488;&#1507;, iram, is to be supplied from the context; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-11.htm">Amos 1:11</a>. - Thus the people speaks, but it does evil. &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;, like &#1511;&#1512;&#1488;&#1514;&#1497; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-4.htm">Jeremiah 3:4</a>, is 2nd pers. fem.; see in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-20.htm">Jeremiah 2:20</a>. Hitz. connects &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; so closely with &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497; as to make &#1492;&#1512;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514; the object to the former verb also: thou hast spoken and done the evil; but this is plainly contrary to the context. "Thou speakest" refers to the people's saying quoted in the first half of the verse: Will God be angry for ever? What they do is the contradiction of what they thus say. If the people wishes that God be angry no more, it must give over its evil life. &#1492;&#1512;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514;, not calamity, but misdeeds, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-33.htm">Jeremiah 2:33</a>. &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500;, thou hast managed it, properly mastered, i.e., carried it through; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/26-25.htm">1 Samuel 26:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-22.htm">1 Kings 22:22</a>. The form is 2nd pers. fem., with the fem. ending dropped on account of the Vav consec. at the end of the discourse, cf. Ew. 191, b. So long as this is the behaviour of the people, God cannot withdraw His anger. </body></html>
