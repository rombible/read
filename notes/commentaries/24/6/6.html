The more we indulge in the pleasures of this life, the more we unfit ourselves for the troubles of this life. The Chaldean army shall break in upon the land of Judah, and in a little time devour all. The day is coming, when those careless and secure in sinful ways will be visited. It is folly to trifle when we have eternal salvation to work out, and the enemies of that salvation to fight against. But they were thus eager, not that they might fulfil God's counsels, but that they might fill their own treasures; yet God thereby served his own purposes. The corrupt heart of man, in its natural state, casts out evil thoughts, just as a fountain casts out her waters. It is always flowing, yet always full.

Hewing down trees was an ordinary feature of Assyrian and Babylonian expeditions. Thus, Assurnacirpal "caused the forests of all (his enemies) to fall" ('Records of the Past,' 3:40, 77), and Shalmaneser calls himself "the trampler on the heads of mountains and all forests "(Ibid. p. 83; comp. p. 90). The timber was partly required for their palaces and fleets, but also, as the context here suggests, for warlike operations. "Trees," as Professor Rawlinson remarks, "were sometimes cut down and built into the mound" (see next note); they would also be used for the "bulwarks" or siege instruments spoken of in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/20-20.htm">Deuteronomy 20:20</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Cast a mount</span>; literally, <span class="accented">pour a mount</span> (or "bank," as it is elsewhere rendered), with reference to the emptying of the baskets of earth required for building up the "mount" (mound). Habakkuk (<a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-10.htm">Habakkuk 1:10</a>) says of the Chaldeans, "He laugheth at every stronghold, and <span class="accented">heapeth up earth</span>, and taketh it" (comp, also <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-15.htm">2 Samuel 20:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-33.htm">Isaiah 37:33</a>). The intention of the mound was not so much to bring the besiegers on a level with the top of the walls as to enable them to work the battering-rams to better advantage (Rawlinson, 'Ancient Monarchies,' 1:472). <span class="cmt_word">She is wholly oppression</span>, etc.; rather, <span class="accented">she is the city that is punished</span>; <span class="accented">wholly oppression is in the midst of her</span>. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-29.htm">Jeremiah 5:29</a> is a refrain-like repetition of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-9.htm">Jeremiah 5:9</a>. - The <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-30.htm">Jeremiah 5:30</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-31.htm">Jeremiah 5:31</a> are, as Hitz. rightly says, "a sort of epimetrum added after the conclusion in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-29.htm">Jeremiah 5:29</a>," in which the already described moral depravity is briefly characterized, and is asserted of all ranks of the people.
