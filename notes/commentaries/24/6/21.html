Sacrifice and incense were to direct them to a Mediator; but when offered to purchase a license to go on in sin, they provoke God. The sins of God's professing people make them an easy prey to their enemies. They dare not show themselves. Saints may rejoice in hope of God's mercies, though they see them only in the promise: sinners must mourn for fear of God's judgments, though they see them only in the threatenings. They are the worst of revolters, and are all corrupters. Sinners soon become tempters. They are compared to ore supposed to have good metal in it, but which proves all dross. Nothing will prevail to part between them and their sins. Reprobate silver shall they be called, useless and worthless. When warnings, corrections, rebukes, and all means of grace, leave men unrenewed, they will be left, as rejected of God, to everlasting misery. Let us pray, then, that we may be refined by the Lord, as silver is refined.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>"Behold," I give unto "this people" causes of stumbling,<p>And they shall stumble against them:<p>Fathers and sons together,<p>"The neighbor and his friend shall perish."<p>This is the natural consequence of their conduct. Their service of Yahweh was a systematic hypocrisy: how then could they walk uprightly with their fellow-men? When God lays stumblingblocks in men's way, it is by the general action of His moral law <a href="http://biblehub.com/james/1-13.htm">James 1:13-14</a>, by which willful sin in one point reacts upon the whole moral nature <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-10.htm">James 2:10</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21. stumbling-blocks&#8212;instruments of the Jews' ruin (compare Mt 21:44; Isa 8:14; 1Pe 2:8).

Because of their immorality and hypocrisy, their contempt of his word, and confidence in legal rites and ceremonies: <p>behold, I will lay stumblingblocks before this people; by which may be meant the judgments of God upon them, raising up enemies against them, and suffering them to invade their land; particularly the Assyrians, as the following words show. Moreover, the prophecies of the false prophets, and the doctrines which they were permitted to spread among the people, were snares and stumblingblocks unto them, they being given up to believe their lies, and to be hardened by them; nay, even true doctrines, the doctrines of justification and salvation by Christ, yea, Christ himself, were a rock of offence, and a stumbling stone to these people, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-14.htm">Isaiah 8:14</a>. <p>and the fathers and the sons together shall fall upon them; or, "by them" (z); the latter following the examples of the forager; and so it denotes, that as the corruption was general, the punishment would be: <p>and the neighbour and his friend shall perish; in the same calamity, being involved in the guilt of the same iniquity, in which they encouraged and hardened one another. The Septuagint and Arabic versions by "stumblingblocks" understand an "infirmity" or "disease", which should come upon the people, and make a general desolation among them. Kimchi interprets the whole of the wickedness of fathers and children, neighbours and friends, and such as were in trade and partnership, and of their delight in mischief; that though they were aware of the stumblingblocks, yet would not give each other warning of them. The whole, according to the accents, should be rendered thus, "and they shall fall upon them, the fathers and the sons together, the neighbour and his friend, and they shall perish"; falling and perishing are said of them all. <p>(z) "in iis", Schmidt; "in eis", Cocceius, Pegnanius. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/6.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Therefore thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will lay stumblingblocks before this people, and the fathers and the sons together shall fall upon them; the neighbour and his friend shall perish.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/6.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">21</span>. <span class="ital">stumblingblocks</span>] The enemy shall trip them up in their easygoing ways.

The perf. is prophetic, representing the matter as being equally certain as if it had been already realized. It cannot bear to be translated either: they should be ashamed (Ros., Umbr. after the Chald.), or: they would be ashamed (Ew.). The following grounding clause adduces the cause of their being put to shame: because they have done abomination; and the next clauses bring in a contrast: yet on the contrary, shame and disgrace they know not; therefore on the day of visitation they will fall with the rest. When these verses are repeated in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-12.htm">Jeremiah 8:12</a>, the Niph. &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1501; is used in place of the Hiph. &#1492;&#1499;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;. It does not, however, follow from this that the Hiph. has here the force of the Niph., but only thus much, that the Hiph. is here used, not in a transitive, but in a simply active meaning: to have shame or disgrace. For &#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1491;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; with the relative omitted, time when I visit, we have in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-12.htm">Jeremiah 8:12</a> the simpler form of the noun &#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1514;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-15.htm">Jeremiah 10:15</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-21.htm">Jeremiah 46:21</a>, and often. Such divergencies do not justify the accommodation of the present passage to these others, since on occasions of repetitions the expression in matters of subordinate importance is often varied. The perf. of the verb has here the force of the fut. exact. </body></html>
