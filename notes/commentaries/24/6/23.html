Sacrifice and incense were to direct them to a Mediator; but when offered to purchase a license to go on in sin, they provoke God. The sins of God's professing people make them an easy prey to their enemies. They dare not show themselves. Saints may rejoice in hope of God's mercies, though they see them only in the promise: sinners must mourn for fear of God's judgments, though they see them only in the threatenings. They are the worst of revolters, and are all corrupters. Sinners soon become tempters. They are compared to ore supposed to have good metal in it, but which proves all dross. Nothing will prevail to part between them and their sins. Reprobate silver shall they be called, useless and worthless. When warnings, corrections, rebukes, and all means of grace, leave men unrenewed, they will be left, as rejected of God, to everlasting misery. Let us pray, then, that we may be refined by the Lord, as silver is refined.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Spear - Properly, a javelin for hurling at the enemy (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-6.htm">1 Samuel 17:6</a> note): an ordinary weapon of the Babylonians.<p>Cruel - ruthless, inhuman.

That is, everyone of them should be furnished with both these pieces of armour, that they might be able to fight near and afar off; they had bows to shoot arrows at a distance, and spears to strike with when near.

The cruelty of the Assyrians and Babylonians seems to have spread general dismay. Nahum calls Nineveh "the city of bloodshed" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/3-1.htm">Nahum 3:1</a>); Habakkuk styles the Chaldeans "bitter and vehement, terrible and dreadful" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-6.htm">Habakkuk 1:6, 7</a>). The customs brought out into view m the monuments justify this most amply, though Professor Rawlinson thinks we cannot call the Assyrians (with whom the Babylonians may of course be coupled) naturally hard. hearted. "The Assyrian listens to the enemy who asks for quarter; he prefers making prisoners go slaying.; he is very terrible in the battle and the assault, but afterwards he forgives and spares" ('Ancient Monarchies,' 1:243). <span class="cmt_word">Their voice roareth</span>.

He caused prophets to rise up amongst them, who called their attention to the threatening evil. Watchers are prophets, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-17.htm">Ezekiel 3:17</a>, who stand upon the watch-tower to keep a lookout, <a href="http://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-1.htm">Habakkuk 2:1</a>, and to give the people warning, by proclaiming what they have seen in spirit. "Hearken to the sound," etc., are not the words of the watchmen (prophets), for it is they who blow the trumpet, but the words of God; so that we have to supply, "and I said." The comparison of the prophets to watchmen, who give the alarm of the imminent danger by means of the sound of the trumpet, involves the comparison of the prophets' utterances to the clang of the signal-horn-suggested besides by <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/3-6.htm">Amos 3:6</a>.</body></html>
