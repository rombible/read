Sacrifice and incense were to direct them to a Mediator; but when offered to purchase a license to go on in sin, they provoke God. The sins of God's professing people make them an easy prey to their enemies. They dare not show themselves. Saints may rejoice in hope of God's mercies, though they see them only in the promise: sinners must mourn for fear of God's judgments, though they see them only in the threatenings. They are the worst of revolters, and are all corrupters. Sinners soon become tempters. They are compared to ore supposed to have good metal in it, but which proves all dross. Nothing will prevail to part between them and their sins. Reprobate silver shall they be called, useless and worthless. When warnings, corrections, rebukes, and all means of grace, leave men unrenewed, they will be left, as rejected of God, to everlasting misery. Let us pray, then, that we may be refined by the Lord, as silver is refined.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Wallow thyself in ashes - Violent distress is accustomed to find relief in eccentric actions, and thus the wallowing in ashes shows that Jerusalem's grief is unbearable.<p>The spoiler - Nebuchadnezzar. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>26. wallow &#8230; in ashes&#8212;(Jer 25:34; Mic 1:10).

And it is likely the prophet doth not so designedly exhort them to repent, as rather describe the state of persons in a lost and despairing condition.

Possibly this was to avoid a supposition which might have occurred to some readers (it has, in fact, occurred to several modern critics) that the "only son" was Adonis, who was certainly "mourned for" by some of the Israelites under the name of Thammuz (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-14.htm">Ezekiel 8:14</a>), and whose Phoenician name is given by Philo of Byblus as <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3b4;</span> (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. probably <span class="accented">Yakhidh</span>, only begotten, the word used by Jeremiah; comp. <span class="greek">&#x392;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3b8;</span>, equivalent to Berith). M. Renan found a vestige of the ancient festival of Adonis at Djebeil (the Phoenician Gebal) even at the present day. There would be nothing singular in the adoption of a common popular phrase by the prophet, in spite of its reference to a heathen custom (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-8.htm">Job 3:8</a>), and the view in question gives additional force to the passage. But the ordinary explanation is perfectly tenable and more obvious. The phrase, "mourning [or, 'lamentation'] for an only begotten one," occurs again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-10.htm">Amos 8:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-10.htm">Zechariah 12:10</a>.
