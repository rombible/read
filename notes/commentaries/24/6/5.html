The more we indulge in the pleasures of this life, the more we unfit ourselves for the troubles of this life. The Chaldean army shall break in upon the land of Judah, and in a little time devour all. The day is coming, when those careless and secure in sinful ways will be visited. It is folly to trifle when we have eternal salvation to work out, and the enemies of that salvation to fight against. But they were thus eager, not that they might fulfil God's counsels, but that they might fill their own treasures; yet God thereby served his own purposes. The corrupt heart of man, in its natural state, casts out evil thoughts, just as a fountain casts out her waters. It is always flowing, yet always full. The God of mercy is loth to depart even from a provoking people, and is earnest with them, that by repentance and reformation, they may prevent things from coming to extremity.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Up! and we will make the assault "by night!"<p>And destroy "her palaces."<p>The generals delay the assault until the next morning.

Since they could not take the city at noon, and by day, as they expected, they propose to attempt it by night; they would lose no time, but proceed on, day and night, until they had accomplished their end; this shows how much they were resolved upon it, and that nothing could discourage from it; and that they were sure of carrying their point: and therefore it follows, <p>and let us destroy her palaces; the tower and strong hold of Zion, the temple of Jerusalem, the king's palace, the houses of the high priest, judges, counsellors, and other civil magistrates, as well as the cottages of the meaner sort of people; for the Vulgate Latin version renders it, "her houses"; which, notwithstanding her strong walls, were not secure from the enemy. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/6.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Arise, and let us go by night, and let us destroy her palaces.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/6.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">5</span>. The impatience of the soldiers at the delay takes the form of a demand for a night assault. Cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/15-1.htm" title="The burden of Moab.

J. Heywood (<span class="ital">J. Th. S.</span> XIII. pp. 66 ff.), who suggests that the word denoted primarily the general outline or ground plan as formed by the ramification of streets and buildings, and that the main reference of the word is to the streets and lanes, rather than to higher erections. See his discussion of numerous passages.
