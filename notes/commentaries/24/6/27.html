The following rendering is given on the authority of the most recent commentators, and has the merit of being in harmony with the metallurgic imagery of the following verses. <span class= "ital">As a prover of ore I have set thee among my people, and thou shalt know and try their way. </span>The words are spoken by Jehovah to the prophet, and describe his work. By others, the first part of the sentence is rendered as follows: <span class= "ital">As a prover of ore I have set thee like a fortress, </span>as if with a reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-18.htm" title="For, behold, I have made you this day a defended city, and an iron pillar, and brazen walls against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, against the princes thereof, against the priests thereof, and against the people of the land.">Jeremiah 1:18</a>, where the same word is used.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/jeremiah/6.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-27.htm" title="I have set you for a tower and a fortress among my people, that you may know and try their way.">Jeremiah 6:27</a></span>. <span class="ital">I have set thee for a tower, </span>&c. — According to this reading, God speaks here by way of encouragement to the prophet, and tells him he had made him a fortified tower, that he might be safe, notwithstanding all the attempts of the wicked against him. But Lowth, with some others, thinks that “the sense would be plainer if the words were translated thus: <span class="ital">I have set thee </span>(in) <span class="ital">a watch-tower, and </span>(in) <span class="ital">a fortress;” </span>that is, God tells the prophet that he hath placed him as a watchman in a high tower, or fortress, to take an account of the people’s behaviour, and to warn them accordingly. <span class="ital">That thou mayest know and try their way </span>— That is, their actions and manners, and how they stand affected toward God and his word; that thou mayest bring their whole conduct under thy strict observation and scrutiny, as refiners do metals. Hereby the prophet is encouraged to reprove them more freely, and with authority, because God promises to defend him from injury, and would give him prudence to see what was amiss, and undauntedness to oppose it. It may be proper to observe here, that this latter clause of the verse favours the sense in which the LXX. and the Vulgate have taken the preceding clause. They render the word <span class="greekheb">בחון</span>, which we translate <span class="ital">a tower, </span><span class="greekheb">δοκιμαστην</span>, <span class="ital">probatorem, a prover, </span>or <span class="ital">trier, </span>which Blaney interprets thus: <span class="ital">“I have appointed thee the office of an assay-master among my people, as to the gold thereof; </span>that is, to try what is in them of genuine worth and excellence, which, like pure gold, will stand the utmost test.” Dr. Dodd considers the passage in the same light, observing, “The prophet in these verses evidently takes his ideas from metals, and the trial of them; and the verbs in the latter clause of this verse, referring to such trial, manifestly require something corresponding in the preceding part. But what has <span class="ital">a tower and fortress </span>to do with the trying of metals? In this view the reader will agree with me, that the passage is rendered much more properly in some of the versions, and indeed more agreeably to the Hebrew, <span class="ital">I have given, </span>or <span class="ital">established, thee as a strong prover, </span>or <span class="ital">trier of metals among my people that thou mightest know, </span>&c.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:18-30 God rejects their outward services, as worthless to atone for their sins. Sacrifice and incense were to direct them to a Mediator; but when offered to purchase a license to go on in sin, they provoke God. The sins of God's professing people make them an easy prey to their enemies. They dare not show themselves. Saints may rejoice in hope of God's mercies, though they see them only in the promise: sinners must mourn for fear of God's judgments, though they see them only in the threatenings. They are the worst of revolters, and are all corrupters. Sinners soon become tempters. They are compared to ore supposed to have good metal in it, but which proves all dross. Nothing will prevail to part between them and their sins. Reprobate silver shall they be called, useless and worthless. When warnings, corrections, rebukes, and all means of grace, leave men unrenewed, they will be left, as rejected of God, to everlasting misery. Let us pray, then, that we may be refined by the Lord, as silver is refined.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Render it:<p>I have set thee among My people as a prover of ore,<p>And thou shalt know and try their way.<p>They are all of them rebels of rebels (i. e., utter rebels):<p>Slander-walkers, were copper and iron,<p>Corrupters all of them.<p>The bellows glow: from their fire lead only!<p>In vain hath the smelter smelted,<p>And the wicked are not separated.<p>Refuse-silver have men called them:<p>For Yahweh hath refused them.<p>The intermixture throughout of moral words and metallurgical terms is remarkable. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>27. tower &#8230; fortress&#8212;(Jer 1:18), rather, "an assayer (and) explorer." By a metaphor from metallurgy in Jer 6:27-30, Jehovah, in conclusion, confirms the prophet in his office, and the latter sums up the description of the reprobate people on whom he had to work. The Hebrew for "assayer" (English Version, "tower") is from a root "to try" metals. "Explorer" (English Version, "fortress") is from an Arabic root, "keen-sighted"; or a Hebrew root, "cutting," that is, separating the metal from the dross [Ewald]. Gesenius translates as English Version, "fortress," which does not accord with the previous "assayer."<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Here God speaks by way of encouragement to the prophet, and tells him he had made him a fortified tower, that he might both discover the carriages of his people, which is one use of a high tower, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-5.htm" title="Prepare the table, watch in the watchtower, eat, drink: arise, you princes, and anoint the shield.">Isaiah 21:5</a>,8 Hab 2:1</span>; and also to assure him, though they shall make several attempts against him, yet he shall be kept safe, os in a castle or fortress, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-20.htm" title="And I will make you to this people a fenced brazen wall: and they shall fight against you, but they shall not prevail against you: for I am with you to save you and to deliver you, said the LORD.">Jeremiah 15:20</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">That thou mayest know and try their way; </span> their courses, actions, and manners, and which way they stand affected; thou mayest bring all to thy strict observation and scrutiny, as goldsmiths or refiners do metals; for so is the word try used, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/66-10.htm" title="For you, O God, have proved us: you have tried us, as silver is tried.">Psalm 66:10</a></span>, and elsewhere.

It was owing to a difficulty presented by the following substantives that this was rendered <span class="ital">tower</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">a fortress</span>] The same word (with slight difference in vocalisation) has the sense of “tower” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/23-13.htm" title="Behold the land of the Chaldeans; this people was not, till the Assyrian founded it for them that dwell in the wilderness: they set up the towers thereof, they raised up the palaces thereof; and he brought it to ruin.">Isaiah 23:13</a>. Hence probably, and with a reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-18.htm" title="For, behold, I have made you this day a defended city, and an iron pillar, and brazen walls against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, against the princes thereof, against the priests thereof, and against the people of the land.">Jeremiah 1:18</a>, the word “fortress” got into the MT. It is quite foreign to the context. If retained, it must be pointed otherwise, but the meaning which must then be given it, viz. <span class="ital">gold-washer</span>, or <span class="ital">gold-extractor</span>, has no valid support.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">27–30</span>. In these <span class="ital">vv</span>. the Lord reassures Jeremiah of his divine commission, and he appears under the figure of one testing metal. The result of the testing process is that no precious metal is found. All is dross.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I have set thee</span>, etc.; literally, <span class="accented">as an assayer have I set thee among my people</span>, <span class="accented">a fortress</span>. Various attempts have been made to avoid giving the last word its natural rendering, "a fortress." Ewald, for instance, would alter the points, and render "a separator [of metals]," thus making the word synonymous with that translated "an assayer;" but this is against Hebrew usage. Hitzig, assuming a doubtful interpretation of <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-24.htm">Job 22:24</a>, renders "... among my people without gold," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. "without there being any gold there for thee to essay" (a very awkward form of expression). These are the two most plausible views, and yet neither of them is satisfactory. Nothing remains but the very simple conjecture, supported by not a few similar phenomena, that <span class="accented">mibhcar</span>, a fortress, has been inserted by mistake from the margin, where an early glossator had written the word, to remind of the parallel passage (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-18.htm">Jeremiah 1:18</a>, "I have made thee this day a fortress-city," '<span class="accented">it mibhcar</span>).
