As the previous words show, the prophet has in his mind the false encouragements given by those who should have been the true guides of the people. Looking at Josiah’s reformation as sufficient to win the favour of Jehovah, they met Jeremiah’s warnings of coming evil by the assurance that all was well, and that invasion and conquest were far-off dangers.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:9-17 When the Lord arises to take vengeance, no sinners of any age or rank, or of either sex escape. They were set upon the world, and wholly carried away by the love of it. If we judge of this sin by God's word, we find multitudes in every station and rank given up to it. Those are to be reckoned our worst and most dangerous enemies, who flatter us in a sinful way. Oh that men would be wise for their souls! Ask for the old paths; the way of godliness and righteousness has always been the way God has owned and blessed. Ask for the old paths set forth by the written word of God. When you have found the good way, go on in it, you will find abundant recompence at your journey's end. But if men will not obey the voice of God and flee to his appointed Refuge, it will plainly appear at the day of judgment, that they are ruined because they reject God's word.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Healed - Rather, "tried to heal."<p>Of the daughter - These words are omitted by a majority of manuscripts, but found in most of the versions.<p>Slightly - literally, "according to," i. e., as if it were, a "trifle: making nothing" of it.
