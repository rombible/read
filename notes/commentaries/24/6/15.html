There was no inward feeling of shame even when they were covered with ignominy and confusion. They had lost the power to blush, and were callous and insensible. This was then, as always, the most hopeless of all states. To “fall among them that fall” was its inevitable sequel.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:9-17 When the Lord arises to take vengeance, no sinners of any age or rank, or of either sex escape. They were set upon the world, and wholly carried away by the love of it. If we judge of this sin by God's word, we find multitudes in every station and rank given up to it. Those are to be reckoned our worst and most dangerous enemies, who flatter us in a sinful way. Oh that men would be wise for their souls! Ask for the old paths; the way of godliness and righteousness has always been the way God has owned and blessed. Ask for the old paths set forth by the written word of God. When you have found the good way, go on in it, you will find abundant recompence at your journey's end. But if men will not obey the voice of God and flee to his appointed Refuge, it will plainly appear at the day of judgment, that they are ruined because they reject God's word.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They are brought to shame because<p>They have "committed abomination:"<p>Shame nevertheless they feel not;<p>To blush nevertheless they know not;<p>"Therefore they shall fall among" the falling;<p>"At the time" when "I visit them, they shall" stumble,<p>"Saith Yahweh."<p>The fact is expressed that their conduct was a disgrace to them, though they did not feel it as such.

This seems chiefly, and in the first place, to respect the false prophets and wicked priests; who when they committed idolatry, or any other sin, and led the people into the same by their doctrine and example, yet, when reproved for it, were not ashamed, being given up to a judicial hardness of heart: <p>nay, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush; they were men of impudent faces, they had a whore's forehead; there was not the least sign or appearance of shame in them; when charged with the foulest crimes, and threatened with the severest punishment, they were not moved by either; they had neither shame nor fear: <p>therefore they shall fall among them that fall; meaning that the prophets and priests should perish among the common people, and with them, who should be slain, and fall by the sword of the Chaldeans; the sacredness of their office would not exempt them; they should fare no better than the rest of the people: <p>at the time that I visit them they shall be cast down, saith the Lord; that is, when the city and temple should be destroyed by the Chaldeans, these would be cast down from their excellency, the high office in which they were, and fall into ruin, and perish with the rest. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/6.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore they shall fall among them that fall: at the time that I visit them they shall be cast down, saith the LORD.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/6.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">15</span>. <span class="ital">Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination</span>?] <span class="bld">They shall be put to shame, because they have committed abomination</span> (so mg.).

"Thus hath Jahveh of hosts said: They shall have a gleaning of the remnant of Israel as of a vine: lay thine hand again as a vine-dresser on the soots. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-10.htm">Jeremiah 6:10</a>. To whom shall I speak, and testify, that they may hear? Behold, uncircumcised is their ear, and they cannot give heed: behold, the word of Jahveh is become to them a reproach; they have no pleasure in it. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-11.htm">Jeremiah 6:11</a>. But of the fury of Jahveh am I full, am weary with holding it in. Pour it out upon the child on the street, and upon the group of young men together; for even the husband with the wife shall be taken, the old man with him that is full of days. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-12.htm">Jeremiah 6:12</a>. And their houses shall pass unto others, fields and wives together; for I stretch out mine hand against the inhabitants of the land, saith Jahveh. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-13.htm">Jeremiah 6:13</a>. For great and small are all of them greedy for gain; and from the prophet to the priest, all use deceit. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-14.htm">Jeremiah 6:14</a>. And they heal the breach of the daughter of my people lightly, saying, Peace, peace, when there is no peace. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-15.htm">Jeremiah 6:15</a>. They are put to shame because they have done abomination, yet they take not shame to themselves, neither know they disgrace; therefore they shall fall among them that fall: at the time that I visit them they shall stumble, hath Jahveh said."<p>The threatening of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-9.htm">Jeremiah 6:9</a> is closely connected with the foregoing. The Lord will make Jerusalem an uninhabited waste, because it will not take warning. The enemy will make a gleaning like vine-dressers, i.e., they will yet search out eve that which is left of the people, and crush it or carry it captive. This still sterner threat does come into contradiction with the repeated pledge, that Israel is not to be wholly extirpated, not to be made an utter end of (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-27.htm">Jeremiah 4:27</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-10.htm">Jeremiah 5:10</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-18.htm">Jeremiah 5:18</a>). For even at the gleaning odd clusters are left, which are not noticed or set store by. The words convey the idea that the enemy will not have done with it after one devastating campaign, but will repeat his inroads. &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1500; is construed with the accus. of the vineyard in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-10.htm">Leviticus 19:10</a>. The "remnant of Israel" is not the kingdom of Judah at large, but Judah already reduced by judgments. In the second clause the idea of the first is repeated in the form of a command to the gleaners. The command is to be looked on as addressed to the enemy by God; and this turn of the expression serves to put the thought with a positiveness that excludes the faintest doubt. To bring back the hand means: yet again to turn it, stretch it out against a person or thing; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-8.htm">Amos 1:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-25.htm">Isaiah 1:25</a>. &#1505;&#1500;&#1505;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; is not baskets, like &#1505;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/40-16.htm">Genesis 40:16</a>, but like &#1494;&#1500;&#1494;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/18-5.htm">Isaiah 18:5</a>, vine-shoots, prop. waving twigs, like &#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, Sol 5:11, from &#1505;&#1500;&#1500;  equals  &#1494;&#1500;&#1500; and &#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1500;, wave (Ew., Hitz.).</body></html>
