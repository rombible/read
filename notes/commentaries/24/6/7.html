It has been rendered, <span class= "ital">As a cistern </span>“<span class= "ital">gathers” </span>or “<span class= "ital">keeps in,” </span>or “<span class= "ital">keeps its waters cool,” </span>or “<span class= "ital">lets them flow.” </span>The general meaning is probably given by the Authorised Version. Jerusalem was literally “overflowing” with wickedness.<p><span class= "bld">Grief.</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">sickness. </span>The word and the imagery are the same as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-5.htm" title="Why should you be stricken any more? you will revolt more and more: the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.">Isaiah 1:5</a>.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:1-8 Whatever methods are used, it is vain to contend with God's judgments. The more we indulge in the pleasures of this life, the more we unfit ourselves for the troubles of this life. The Chaldean army shall break in upon the land of Judah, and in a little time devour all. The day is coming, when those careless and secure in sinful ways will be visited. It is folly to trifle when we have eternal salvation to work out, and the enemies of that salvation to fight against. But they were thus eager, not that they might fulfil God's counsels, but that they might fill their own treasures; yet God thereby served his own purposes. The corrupt heart of man, in its natural state, casts out evil thoughts, just as a fountain casts out her waters. It is always flowing, yet always full. The God of mercy is loth to depart even from a provoking people, and is earnest with them, that by repentance and reformation, they may prevent things from coming to extremity.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>As a fountain casteth out - Better, As a cistern "cooleth."<p>Before me ... - Before My face continually there is disease and wounding: Disease as the result of poverty and want: wounding, or, the commission of deeds of actual violence. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. fountain&#8212;rather, a well dug, from which water springs; distinct from a natural spring or fountain.<p>casteth out&#8212;causeth to flow; literally, "causeth to dig," the cause being put for the effect (2Ki 21:16, 24; Isa 57:20).<p>me&#8212;Jehovah.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> In this verse God aggravates their sin of oppression, mentioned in the former. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">As a fountain casteth out her waters, so she casteth out her wickedness; </span> a metaphor, to express how natural all manner of wickedness is to her, how full she is of it, and how incessant in it, noting her impudence, a fountain being not able to retain its water; and the expression of <span class="ital">casting it out</span> seems to imply her violence in her filthiness, as it is said of the sea, that it <span class="ital">casteth out</span> mire and dirt, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-20.htm" title="But the wicked are like the troubled sea, when it cannot rest, whose waters cast up mire and dirt.">Isaiah 57:20</a></span>, and favoured by the next clause. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Violence and spoil is heard in her:</span> q.d.

In the former water is stored to keep it fresh, in the latter it springs out of the ground. In this application accordingly Jeremiah will mean either (<span class="ital">a</span>) that sin is an alien thing which has been introduced into the heart as a supply upon which to draw, or (<span class="ital">b</span>) that it is innate there. That he held the latter view might seem to draw support from <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-23.htm" title="Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? then may you also do good, that are accustomed to do evil.">Jeremiah 13:23</a>, which however is not conclusive (see note there), and the former is to be preferred. It has the support of the LXX, who also agree with the mg. “keepeth fresh,” thus deriving the Hebrew form from a verb quite different in sense but akin in letters to the rare one in MT., which, though found elsewhere (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-24.htm" title="I have dig and drunk strange waters, and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of besieged places.">2 Kings 19:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-25.htm" title="I have dig, and drunk water; and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of the besieged places.">Isaiah 37:25</a>) only in the sense of <span class="ital">digging for water</span>, yet according to Rabbinic interpretation bears also the meaning given in E.VV.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">sickness and wounds</span>] disease produced by want, and deeds of violence.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As a fountain casteth out</span>; rather, <span class="accented">as a cistern keepeth fresh</span> (literally, cool).

The ear is constantly dinned with the sounds of oppression, and the eye pained with the sight of the bodily sufferings of the victims. The word for" sickness" is applicable to any kind of infirmity (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3, 4</a>), but the context clearly limits it here to bodily trouble. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The judgment breaking over Jerusalem. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-1.htm">Jeremiah 6:1</a>.

Be warned, Jerusalem, lest my soul tear herself from thee, lest I make thee a waste, a land uninhabited."<p>In graphic delineation of the enemy's approach against Jerusalem, the prophet calls on the people to flee. As regarded its situation, Jerusalem belonged to the tribe of Benjamin; the boundary between the tribal domain of Judah and Benjamin passed through the valley of Ben-hinnom on the south side of Jerusalem, and then ran northwards to the west of the city (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-8.htm">Joshua 15:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-16.htm">Joshua 18:16</a>.). The city was inhabited by Judeans and Benjamites, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-2.htm">1 Chronicles 9:2</a>. The summons is addressed to the Benjamites as the prophet's fellow-countrymen. Tekoa lay about two hours' journey southwards from Bethlehem, according to Jerome, on a hill twelve Roman miles south of Jerusalem; see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-59.htm">Joshua 15:59</a>. This town is mentioned because its name admits of a play on the word &#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;. The alarm is given in the country south of Jerusalem, because the enemy is coming from the north, so that the flight will be directed southwards. Beth-haccerem, acc. to Jerome, was a hamlet (vicus) between Jerusalem and Tekoa, qui lingua Syra et Hebraic Bethacharma nominatur, et ipse in monte positus, apparently on what is now called the Frank's Hill, Jebel Fureidis; see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-14.htm">Nehemiah 3:14</a>. &#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;&#1514;, the lifting up, that which raises itself up, or is raised; here a lofty beacon or signal, the nature of which is not further made known. The meaning, fire-signal, or ascending column of smoke, cannot be made good from <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/20-38.htm">Judges 20:38</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/20-40.htm">Judges 20:40</a>, since there &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1503; is appended; nor from the statements of classical authors (in Ros.), that in time of war bodies of troops stationed in different places made their positions known to one another by masses of rising flame during the night, and by columns of smoke in the day time. As to the last clause, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-14.htm">Jeremiah 1:14</a>. "Great destruction," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-6.htm">Jeremiah 4:6</a>. - In <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-2.htm">Jeremiah 6:2</a> the impending judgment is further described. It falls on the daughter of Zion, the capital and its inhabitants, personified as a beautiful and delicately reared woman. &#1504;&#1493;&#1492;, defectively written for &#1504;&#1488;&#1493;&#1492;, contracted from &#1504;&#1488;&#1493;&#1492;, lovely, beautiful. The words are not vocatives, O fair and delicate, but accusatives made to precede their governing verb absolutely, and are explained by "the daughter of Zion," dependent on "I destroy:" the fair and the delicate, namely, the daughter of Zion, I destroy. &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-5.htm">Hosea 4:5</a>. The other meaning of this verb, to be like, to resemble, is wholly unsuitable here; and, besides, in this signification it is construed with &#1488;&#1500; or &#1500;. Ew.'s translation, I mean the daughter of Zion, is not justifiable by the usage of the word, the Piel only, and not the Kal, being capable of this interpretation.</body></html>
