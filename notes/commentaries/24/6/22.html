Sacrifice and incense were to direct them to a Mediator; but when offered to purchase a license to go on in sin, they provoke God. The sins of God's professing people make them an easy prey to their enemies. They dare not show themselves. Saints may rejoice in hope of God's mercies, though they see them only in the promise: sinners must mourn for fear of God's judgments, though they see them only in the threatenings. They are the worst of revolters, and are all corrupters. Sinners soon become tempters. They are compared to ore supposed to have good metal in it, but which proves all dross. Nothing will prevail to part between them and their sins. Reprobate silver shall they be called, useless and worthless. When warnings, corrections, rebukes, and all means of grace, leave men unrenewed, they will be left, as rejected of God, to everlasting misery. Let us pray, then, that we may be refined by the Lord, as silver is refined.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Raised - Or, awakened, to undertake distant expeditions.<p>The sides of the earth - Or ends, the most distant regions (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-32.htm">Jeremiah 25:32</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22. north &#8230; sides of the earth&#8212;The ancients were little acquainted with the north; therefore it is called the remotest regions (as the Hebrew for "sides" ought to be translated, see on [900]Isa 14:13) of the earth.

"Thus hath Jahveh said: Stand on the ways, and look, and ask after the everlasting paths, which (one) is the way of good, and walk therein; so shall ye find rest for your souls. But they say, We will not go. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-17.htm">Jeremiah 6:17</a>. And I have set over you watchmen, (saying): Hearken to the sound of the trumpet; but they say, We will not hearken. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-18.htm">Jeremiah 6:18</a>. Therefore hear, ye peoples, and know, thou congregation, what happens to them. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-19.htm">Jeremiah 6:19</a>. Hear, O earth! Behold, I bring evil on this people, the fruit of their thoughts; for to my words they have not hearkened, and at my law they have spurned. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-20.htm">Jeremiah 6:20</a>. To what end, then, is their incense coming to me from Sheba, and the good spice-cane from a far land? Your burnt-offerings are not a pleasure, and your slain-offerings are not grateful to me. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-21.htm">Jeremiah 6:21</a>. Therefore thus hath Jahveh said: Behold, I lay stumbling-blocks for this people, that thereon fathers and sons may stumble, at once the neighbour and his friend shall perish."<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-16.htm">Jeremiah 6:16</a><p>The Lord has not left any lack of instruction and warning. He has marked out for them the way of salvation in the history of the ancient times. It is to this reference is made when they, in ignorance of the way to walk in, are called to ask after the everlasting paths. This thought is clothed thus: they are to step forth upon the ways, to place themselves where several ways diverge from one another, and inquire as to the everlasting paths, so as to discover which is the right way, and then on this they are to walk. &#1504;&#1514;&#1497;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514; &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501; are paths that have been trod in the hoary time of old, but not all sorts of ways, good and bad, which they are to walk on indiscriminately, so that it may be discovered which of them is the right one (Hitz.). This meaning is not to be inferred from the fact, that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-15.htm">Jeremiah 18:15</a> everlasting paths are opposed to untrodden ways; indeed this very passage teaches that the everlasting ways are the right ones, from which through idolatry the people have wandered into unbeaten paths. Thus the paths of the old time are here the ways in which Israel's godly ancestors have trod; meaning substantially, the patriarchs' manner of thinking and acting. For the following question, "which is the way," etc., does not mean, amongst the paths of old time to seek out that which, as the right one, leads to salvation, but says simply thus much: ask after the paths of the old time, so as thus to recognise the right way, and then, when ye have found it, to walk therein. &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498; &#1492;&#1496;&#1468;&#1493;&#1489;, not, the good way; for &#1492;&#1496;&#1468;&#1493;&#1489; cannot be an objective appended to &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498;, since immediately after, the latter word is construed in &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468; as faem. "The good" is the genitive dependent on "way:" way of the good, that leads to the good, to salvation. This way Israel might learn to know from the history of antiquity recorded in the Torah. Graf has brought the sense well out in this shape: "Look inquiringly backwards to ancient history (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-7.htm">Deuteronomy 32:7</a>), and see how success and enduring prosperity forsook your fathers when they left the way prescribed to them by God, to walk in the ways of the heathen (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-15.htm">Jeremiah 18:15</a>); learn that there is but one way, the way of the fear of Jahveh, on which blessing and salvation are to be found (<a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-39.htm">Jeremiah 32:39-40</a>)." Find (with &#1493; consec.), and find thus  equals  so shall ye find; cf. Ew. 347, b; Ges. 130, 2. To "we will not go," we may supply from the context: on the way of good.</body></html>
