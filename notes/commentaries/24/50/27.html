Come against her, [all of you], from the last to the first; open her storehouses: case her up in heaps, like ruins, and devote her to destruction; let there be no remnant left to her. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-27.htm">Jeremiah 50:27</a>.

[There is] a sound of those who flee and escape out of the land of Babylon, to declare in Zion the vengeance of Jahveh our God, the vengeance of His temple."<p>The punishment of Babylon will be fearful, corresponding to its crimes. The crimes of Babylon and its punishment Jeremiah has comprised, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-21.htm">Jeremiah 50:21</a>, in two names specially formed for the occasion. The enemy to whom God has entrusted the execution of the punishment is to march against the land &#1502;&#1512;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501;. This word, which is formed by the prophet in a manner analogous to Mizraim, and perhaps also Aram Naharaim, means "double rebellion," or "double obstinacy." It comes from the root &#1502;&#1512;&#1492;, "to be rebellious" against Jahveh and His commandments, whence also &#1502;&#1512;&#1497;, "rebellion;" <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/17-1.htm">Numbers 17:1-1324:59:00</a>E<a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/2-5.htm">Zechariah 2:5</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/2-7.htm">Ezekiel 2:7</a>, etc. Other interpretations of the word are untenable: such is that of Frst, who follows the Vulgate "terram dominantium," and, comparing the Aramaic &#1502;&#1512;&#1488;, "Lord," renders it by "dominion" (Herschaft). Utterly indefensible, too, is the translation of Hitzig, "the world of men" (Menschenwelt), which he derives from the Sanskrit martjam, "world," on the basis of the false assumption that the language of the Chaldeans was Indo-Germanic. The only doubtful points are in what respect Babylon showed double obstinacy, and what Jeremiah had in his mind at the time. The view of Hitzig, Maurer, Graf, etc., is certainly incorrect, - that the prophet was thinking of the double punishment of Israel by the Assyrians and by the Babylonians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-17.htm">Jeremiah 50:17</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-33.htm">Jeremiah 50:33</a>); for the name is evidently given to the country which is now about to be punished, and hence to the power of Babylon. Ngelsbach takes a twofold view: (1) he thinks of the defiance shown by Babylon towards both man and God; (2) he thinks of the double obstinacy it exhibited in early times by building the tower, and founding the first worldly kingdom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-8.htm">Genesis 10:8</a>.), and in later times by its conduct towards the theocracy: and he is inclined rather to the latter than to the former view, because the offences committed by Babylon in early and in later times were, in their points of origin and aim, too much one and the same for any one to be able to represent them as falling under two divisions. This is certainly correct; but against the first view there is also the important consideration that &#1502;&#1512;&#1492; is pretty constantly used only of opposition to God and the word of God. If any one, notwithstanding this, is inclined to refer the name also to offences against men, he could yet hardly agree with Ngelsbach in thinking of the insurrections of Babylon against the kings of Assyria, their masters; for these revolts had no meaning in reference to the position of Babylon towards God, but rather showed the haughty spirit in which Babylon trod on all the nations.<p>The opinion of Dahler has most in its favour: "Doubly rebellious, i.e., more rebellious than others, through its idolatry ad its pride, which was exalted it against God, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-24.htm">Jeremiah 50:24</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-29.htm">Jeremiah 50:29</a>." Rosenmller, De Wette, etc., have decided in favour of this view. Although the dual originally expresses the idea of pairing, yet the Hebrew associates with double, twofold, the idea of increase, gradation; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-2.htm">Isaiah 40:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-7.htm">Isaiah 66:7</a>. The object is prefixed for the sake of emphasis; and in order to render it still more prominent, it is resumed after the verb in the expression "against it." &#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1493;&#1491;, an infinitive in form, "to visit with punishment, avenge, punish," is also used as a significant name of Babylon: the land that visits with punishment is to be punished. Many expositors take &#1495;&#1512;&#1489; as a denominative from &#1495;&#1512;&#1489;, "sword," in the sense of strangling, murdering; so also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-27.htm">Jeremiah 50:27</a>. But this assumption is far from correct; nor is there any need for making it, because the meaning of destroying is easily obtained from that of being laid waste, or destroying oneself by transferring the word from things to men. &#1492;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, "to proscribe, put under the ban," and in effect "to exterminate;" see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-9.htm">Jeremiah 25:9</a>. On "after them," cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-37.htm">Jeremiah 49:37</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-2.htm">Jeremiah 48:2</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-9.htm">Jeremiah 48:9</a>,<a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-15.htm">Jeremiah 48:15</a>, etc.</body></html>
