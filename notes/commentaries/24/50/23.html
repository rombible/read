Here it describes the right of might as seen in the despotism of Babylon. The name of Charles Martel and, according to one etymology, that of Judas Maccabæus, present interesting parallelisms. And now the hammer itself, which had been as an instrument in the hand of Jehovah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-20.htm" title="You are my battle ax and weapons of war: for with you will I break in pieces the nations, and with you will I destroy kingdoms;">Jeremiah 51:20</a>), is to be, in its turn, crushed by a power mightier than its own.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/50.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>50:21-32 The forces are mustered and empowered to destroy Babylon.

These are the words either of the prophet, or rather of the people of other nations, wondering how this destruction came about, and rejoicing at it; <p>how is Babylon become a desolation among the nations! this explains who and what is meant by the hammer of the earth, and by its being cut asunder and broken; even the utter destruction of the city and kingdom of Babylon. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/50.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">How is the <span class="cverse3">{u}</span> hammer of the whole earth cut asunder and broken! how is Babylon become a desolation among the nations!</span><p>(u) Nebuchadnezzar, who had smitten down all the princes and people of the world.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/50.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">23</span>. <span class="ital">the hammer</span>] For the figure cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-29.htm" title="Is not my word like as a fire? said the LORD; and like a hammer that breaks the rock in pieces?">Jeremiah 23:29</a>, and for its application to Babylon <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/51-20.htm" title="You are my battle ax and weapons of war: for with you will I break in pieces the nations, and with you will I destroy kingdoms;...">Jeremiah 51:20-23</a>. Cp. for the title, as given in later days, Charles <span class="ital">Martel</span> (hammer), who was grandfather of Charles the Great, and conquered the Saracens in a decisive battle at Tours in 732 a.d., and Edward I of England, on whose tomb at Westminster Abbey are inscribed the words “Scotorum <span class="ital">Malleus</span>.”<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/50.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The hammer of the whole earth.</span> So in Isaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-5.htm">Isaiah 14:5</a>), "Jehovah hath broken the staff of the wicked, the rod of the rulers; which smote peoples in passion with an unceasing stroke." In the next chapter a similar title is conferred upon Israel, with the right to retaliate upon Babylon all the evil which Babylon had done to Zion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-20.htm">Jeremiah 51:20-24</a>). Compare the epithet <span class="accented">Martel</span>, "The Hammer," given to Charles, Duke of the Franks, on account of his great victory over the Saraoens at Tours; it is tempting to add "Makkabi," the epithet of Judas (Maccabaeus), but the <span class="accented">k</span> is not the same letter as that in <span class="accented">maqqab</span>, hammer. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/50.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>This judgment comes on Babylon because of her oppression and scattering of the people of Israel, whom the Lord will now feed in peace again on their native soil. Israel is like &#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1508;&#1494;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492;, a sheep which, having been scared away out of its stall or fold, is hunted into the wide world; cf. &#1508;&#1468;&#1494;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; &#1489;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-2.htm">Joel 3:2</a>. Although &#1508;&#1468;&#1494;&#1512;, "to scatter," implies the conception of a flock, yet we cannot take &#1513;&#1474;&#1492; as a collective (Graf), since it is nomen unitatis. The point in the comparison lies on the fact that Israel has been hunted, like a solitary sheep, up and down among the beasts of the earth; and pizeer is more exactly specified by the following clause, "lions have chased after it." The object of &#1492;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468; is easily derived from the context, so that we do not need to follow Hitzig in changing &#1492;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468; &#1492;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503; into &#1492;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492; &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503;. These kings are, the king of Assyria first, and the king of Babylon last. The former has dispersed the ten tribes among the heathen; the latter, by destroying the kingdom of Judah, and carrying away its inhabitants, has shattered the theocracy. The verbs apply to the figure of the lion, and the suffixes refer to Israel. &#1488;&#1499;&#1500; is used of the devouring of the flesh; &#1506;&#1510;&#1468;&#1501; is a denominative from &#1506;&#1510;&#1501;, and means the same as &#1490;&#1468;&#1512;&#1501;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/24-8.htm">Numbers 24:8</a>, to break bones in pieces, not merely gnaw them. So long as the flesh only is eaten, the skeleton of bones remains; if these also be broken, the animal is quite destroyed.</body></html>
