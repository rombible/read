As the bird by the snare of the fowler, so shall Babylon be laid hold of by Jahveh, because it has striven against Him. The Lord lays the snare for it, that it may be caught. &#1497;&#1511;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;, "to lay snares;" cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/141-9.htm">Psalm 141:9</a>, where &#1508;&#1468;&#1495; is also found. &#1493;&#1500;&#1488; , "and thou didst not perceive," i.e., didst not mark it: this is a paraphrase of the idea "unexpectedly," suddenly; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-8.htm">Jeremiah 51:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/47-11.htm">Isaiah 47:11</a>. This has been literally fulfilled on Babylon. According to Herodotus (i. 191), Cyrus took Babylon by diverting the Euphrates into a trench he had dug. By this stratagem the Persians threw themselves so unexpectedly on the Babylonians (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3b9; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#788; &#x3a0;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;), that when the outmost portions of the city had been already seized, those who lived in the middle had not observed at all that they were captured (&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#787; &#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#788;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;). Similarly, when the city was taken under Darius Hystaspes, they were surprised that Zopyrus traitorously opened the gates to the besiegers (Herodotus, iii. 158). Babylon has contended against Jahveh, because, in its pride, it refused to let the people of God depart; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-29.htm">Jeremiah 50:29</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-33.htm">Jeremiah 50:33</a>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-25.htm">Jeremiah 50:25</a> the sudden devastation of Babylon is accounted for. Jahveh opens His armoury, and brings out the instruments of His wrath, in order to execute His work on the land of the Chaldeans. &#1488;&#1493;&#1510;&#1512;, "magazine, treasure-chamber," is here applied to an armoury. The "instruments of His wrath" are, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-5.htm">Isaiah 13:5</a>, the nations which execute the judgment of god-here, the instruments of war and weapons with which Jahveh Himself marches into battle against Babylon. On '&#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1499;&#1492; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-10.htm">Jeremiah 48:10</a>. The business which the Lord has there regards the chastisement of Babylon for its insolence. For the transaction of this business He summons His servants, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-26.htm">Jeremiah 50:26</a>. &#1489;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1470;&#1500;&#1492;&#1468;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-22.htm">Jeremiah 46:22</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-9.htm">Jeremiah 49:9</a>, is substantially the same as &#1489;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-14.htm">Jeremiah 49:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-8.htm">Jeremiah 48:8</a>. &#1502;&#1511;&#1468;&#1509;, "from the end," or from the last hitherwards, the same as &#1502;&#1511;&#1468;&#1510;&#1492;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-31.htm">Jeremiah 51:31</a>, i.e., all together on to the last; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-4.htm">Genesis 19:4</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/47-2.htm">Genesis 47:2</a>, etc. "Open her (Babylon's) barns" or granaries; "heap it up (viz., what was in the granaries) like heaps" of grain or sheaves, "and devote it to destruction," i.e., consume it with fire, because things on which the curse was imposed must be burnt; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/11-12.htm">Joshua 11:12</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/11-13.htm">Joshua 11:13</a>. All the property found in Babylon is to be collected in heaps, and then burnt with the city. The use of the image is occasioned by the granaries. &#1502;&#1488;&#1489;&#1505;&#1497;&#1492; is &#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;., from &#1488;&#1489;&#1505;, to give fodder to cattle, - properly a stall for fodder, then a barn, granary. &#1506;&#1512;&#1502;&#1492; is a heap of grain (Sol 7:3), sheaves (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/3-7.htm">Ruth 3:7</a>), also of rubbish (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-34.htm">Nehemiah 3:34</a>). As <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-26.htm">Jeremiah 50:26</a> declares what is to be done with goods and chattels, so does <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-27.htm">Jeremiah 50:27</a> state what is to be done with the population. The figure employed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-26.htm">Jeremiah 50:26</a> is followed by the representation of the people as oxen destined for slaughter; in this Jeremiah had in his mind the prophecy found in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/34.htm">Isaiah 34</a>, in which the judgment to come on Edom is depicted as a slaughter of lambs, rams, and he-goats: the people of Edom are thus compared to cattle that may be offered in sacrifice. This figure also forms the basis of the expression &#1497;&#1512;&#1491; &#1500;&#1496;&#1468;&#1489;&#1495; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-15.htm">Jeremiah 48:15</a>, where this style of speaking is used with regard to the youths or the young troops; cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-40.htm">Jeremiah 51:40</a>. The &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, accordingly, designate not merely the chief among the people, or the men of rank, but represent the whole human population. In the last clause ("for their day is come," etc.), there is a transition in the discourse from the figure to the real subject itself. The suffix in &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; does not refer to the oxen, but to the men over whose murder there is an exclamation of woe. In like manner, "their day" means the day of judgment for men, viz., the time of their visitation with punishment; see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-21.htm">Jeremiah 46:21</a>. Fugitives and escaped ones will bring to Zion, and proclaim the news of the execution of this fearful judgment, that the Lord has fulfilled the vengeance of His temple, i.e., avenged on Babylon the burning of His temple by the Chaldeans. The fugitives and escaped ones are the Israelites, who were summoned to flee from Babylon, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-3.htm">Jeremiah 50:3</a>. On "the vengeance of Jahveh," cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-15.htm">Jeremiah 50:15</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-11.htm">Jeremiah 51:11</a>. </body></html>
