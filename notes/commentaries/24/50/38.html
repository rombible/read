In the original text the form of the two words must have been identical, as the vowel-points were of later introduction. The editors of the present text were probably guided by the thought that the context in this case determined the meaning of the word as meaning “drought,” and not a “sword.” So in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-22.htm" title="The LORD shall smite you with a consumption, and with a fever, and with an inflammation, and with an extreme burning, and with the sword, and with blasting, and with mildew; and they shall pursue you until you perish.">Deuteronomy 28:22</a> the text of the Authorised version gives “sword,” and the margin “drought.” There is, however, a certain loss of rhetorical emphasis in the change of the word with which the three previous verses had begun. The “waters” include the canals of Babylon as well as the Euphrates.<p><span class= "bld">They are mad upon their idols.</span>—The word for “idols” means literally “terrors,” or “objects of terror,” as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/88-16.htm" title="Your fierce wrath goes over me; your terrors have cut me off.">Psalm 88:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-25.htm" title="It is drawn, and comes out of the body; yes, the glittering sword comes out of his gall: terrors are on him.">Job 20:25</a>, and this is the only place in which it is used of the objects of worship. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-5.htm" title="And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emins in Shaveh Kiriathaim,">Genesis 14:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/2-10.htm" title="The Emims dwelled therein in times past, a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims;">Deuteronomy 2:10-11</a> it appears as the name of the Emim, probably as meaning “the terrible, <span class= "ital">or </span>gigantic ones.” Here it seems used for the colossal figures—winged bulls, human-headed lions, and the like—which were the objects of Babylonian worship. (See note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-16.htm" title="Your terribleness has deceived you, and the pride of your heart, O you that dwell in the clefts of the rock, that hold the height of the hill: though you should make your nest as high as the eagle, I will bring you down from there, said the LORD.">Jeremiah 49:16</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/jeremiah/50.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/50-38.htm" title="A drought is on her waters; and they shall be dried up: for it is the land of graven images, and they are mad on their idols....">Jeremiah 50:38-40</a></span>. <span class="ital">A drought is upon all her waters </span>— Our translators, after the example of the Vulgate and others, have rendered <span class="greekheb">חרב</span>, <span class="ital">a drought, </span>here, whereas they have translated it <span class="ital">a sword </span>in the preceding verses, as supposing, it seems, that <span class="ital">a sword </span>has nothing to do with <span class="ital">waters. </span>But they might very properly have rendered it <span class="ital">a sword </span>here also: for this term is used metaphorically, to denote either the instrument of divine vengeance generally, or the operations and effects of war in particular; in either of which senses it may be applied to waters as well as to treasures. And the allusion here is evidently to the stratagem of Cyrus, who drained off the waters of the Euphrates, which ran through the city of Babylon, by means of which his troops, by night, marched along the bed of the river into the heart of the city, and surprised it. <span class="ital">For it is the land of graven images, </span>&c. — This vengeance comes upon them, because they have been the great encouragers and supporters of idolatry. It may be remarked, that the executioners of the divine judgments were the Persians, who, in opposition to the Sabians, (whose notions the Chaldeans embraced,) followed the ancient discipline of the magi, or wise men among them, and had neither altars nor images; as is attested by Strabo and Herodotus: see <span class="ital">Prideaux’s Connections, </span>p. 177, and Lowth. <span class="ital">And they are mad upon their idols </span>—<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>See note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-5.htm" title="Enflaming yourselves with idols under every green tree, slaying the children in the valleys under the clefts of the rocks?">Isaiah 57:5</a>.

This may be applied to believers, who complain of the dominion of sin and corruption, and of their own weakness and manifold infirmities. Their Redeemer is able to keep what they commit to him; and sin shall not have dominion over them. He will give them that rest which remains for the people of God. Also here is Babylon's sin, and their punishment. The sins are, idolatry and persecution. He that will not save his people in their sins, never will countenance the wickedness of his open enemies. The judgments of God for these sins will lay them waste. In the judgments denounced against prosperous Babylon, and the mercies promised to afflicted Israel, we learn to choose to suffer affliction with the people of God, rather than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/50.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A drought - Rather, "a sword," i. e., military skill and forethought.<p>They are mad upon their idols - Omit their.

However, all the pointed manuscripts read, "A drought," as English Version. Cyrus turned off the waters of the Euphrates into a new channel and so marched through the dried-up bed into the city (Jer 51:32). Babylonia once was famed for its corn, which often yielded from one to two hundredfold [Herodotus]. This was due to its network of water-courses from the Euphrates for irrigation, traces of which [Layard] are seen still on all sides, but dry and barren (Isa 44:27).<p>their idols&#8212;literally, "terrors."

Either on the waters of the land of Chaldea in general, from whence should follow barrenness, and so a want of the necessaries of life; hence Kimchi interprets it of a consumption of riches, and all good things; or on the waters of Babylon, the river Euphrates, which ran through it; the channel of which was diverted by Cyrus, and drained and made so dry, that he marched his army up it into the city. Some say Babylon was taken three times, by this stratagem of turning the river Euphrates another way; first by Semiramis; and after Cyrus by Alexander: this may well be applied to the drying up of the river Euphrates, upon the pouring out of the sixth vial, and to the destruction of the antichristian states, signified by the many waters on which the great whore of Babylon or Rome sitteth, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/16-12.htm">Revelation 16:12</a>; <p>for it is the land of graven images; much given to idolatry; had idols of gold, silver, brass, iron, wood, and stone, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/5-2.htm">Daniel 5:2</a>; <p>and they are mad upon their idols; greatly affected, and much devoted to them; superstitiously mad upon them: or, "they gloried in them"; as the Targum, Vulgate Latin version, and others (p); they praised and extolled them as true deities; as Belshazzar and his nobles did the very night Babylon was taken, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/5-4.htm">Daniel 5:4</a>; and this their idolatry was one cause of their ruin. The word (q) for "idols" signifies "terrors", or terrible things; because their worshippers stood in fear of them, as Kimchi observes. <p>(p) "gloriantur", Vulg. Lat.

"O arrogance, pride!" is directly addressed to Babylon: in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-32.htm">Jeremiah 50:32</a> also there is a like designation of Babylon as the personification of pride. On the words "for thy day is come," cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-27.htm">Jeremiah 50:27</a>.

The former, indeed, is the reading rendered by the lxx in this passage; but they have acted quite arbitrarily in this, since Jeremiah, for the most part, varies individual words when he repeats a thought.
