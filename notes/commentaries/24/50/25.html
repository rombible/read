Alluding to the manner of kings, who have some particular edifice built for an armoury; see Sol 4:4; wherein are provided and laid up all sorts of armour, small and great, which are fetched out from thence, in time of need. This armoury is to be understood of Media and Persia, and other parts, from whence a mighty army, well accoutred, was brought by the powerful providence of God; and indeed the whole world is his armoury, from whence he can raise up instruments to do his will at pleasure; or, "his treasury" (y); so the Targum; and some think this is said with reference to the treasure of the Lord's house the king of Babylon had seized upon, and now by way of retaliation the Lord would open his treasury to his ruin: <p>and hath brought forth the weapons of his indignation; as a king, when he goes to war, opens his armoury, and takes out armour of every kind, both offensive and defensive, swords, spears, shields, &amp;c. so the Lord would now bring the Medes and Persians, well armed, to be the instruments of his wrath and vengeance on Babylon: or, "the vessels of his indignation" (z); having some view to the vessels of the sanctuary, as some think, the king of Babylon had taken away and profaned; these may well be applied to the vials of wrath poured out on the antichristian states by the angels, called forth out of the temple, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/15-1.htm">Revelation 15:1</a>; <p>for this is the work of the Lord God of hosts in the land of the Chaldeans; which he decreed and ordered to be done; and which, without his power and providence, could never have been done: compare with this <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/18-8.htm">Revelation 18:8</a>. <p>(y) "thesaurum suum", Vulg.

A truly grand figure. The north country (the "hidden" part of the earth, as it was called in Hebrew) is regarded by the prophet as a storehouse of young and "inexhaustible" nations, from which Jehovah can at any time "bring forth weapons of his indignation." The latter phrase, occurs again in the parallel prophecy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-5.htm">Isaiah 13:5</a>), where it is evidently applied to the army of Medo-Persian invaders. <span class="cmt_word">For this is the work,</span> etc.; rather, <span class="accented">For the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, hath a work</span>. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/50.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Assyrian has already received his punishment for that-the Assyrian kingdom has been destroyed; Babylon will meet with the same punishment, and then (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-19.htm">Jeremiah 50:19</a>) Israel will be led back to his pasture-ground. &#1504;&#1493;&#1492;, pasture-ground, grass-plot, where sheep feed, is the land of Israel. Israel, led back thither, will feed on Carmel and Bashan, the most fertile tracts of the country, and the mountains of Ephraim and Gilead, which also furnish fodder in abundance for sheep. As to Gilead, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-1.htm">Numbers 32:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/7-14.htm">Micah 7:14</a>; and in regard to the mountains of Ephraim, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-13.htm">Exodus 34:13</a>., where the feeding on the mountains of Israel and in the valleys is depicted as fat pasture. The mountains of Israel here signify the northern portion of the land generally, including the large and fertile plain of Jezreel, and the different valleys between the several ranges of mountains, which here and there show traces of luxuriant vegetation even yet; cf. Robinson's Physical Geography, p. 120. Then also the guilt of the sins of Israel and Judah shall be blotted out, because the Lord grants pardon to the remnant of His people. This promise points to the time of the New Covenant; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-34.htm">Jeremiah 31:34</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-8.htm">Jeremiah 33:8</a>. The deliverance of Israel from Babylon coincides with the view given of the regeneration of the people by the Messiah, just as we find throughout the second portion of Isaiah.
