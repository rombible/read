The cause of this destruction is the wrath of the Lord. Babylon shall be wholly desolated; for she hath sinned against the Lord. Sin makes men a mark for the arrows of God's judgments. The mercy promised to the Israel of God, shall not only accompany, but arise from the destruction of Babylon. These sheep shall be gathered from the deserts, and put again into good pasture.

As soldiers do when they make an assault upon a place, to encourage one another, and dismay the besieged; just as the Israelites did when they surrounded Jericho: <p>she hath given her hand; submitted to the conqueror, and sued for mercy. The Targum is, <p>"she is delivered into her hand;'' <p>the hand of the Persians, by two princes of Babylon, who went off to Cyrus, and showed him how to take the city; or rather it was delivered by Zopyrus into the hands of Darius: <p>her foundations are fallen, her walls are thrown down; not at the taking of it by Cyrus, but afterwards by Darius; for this respects the conclusion of its destruction, which was progressive and gradual: <p>for it is the vengeance of the Lord: which he decreed, threatened, and took, and that on account of his people, who had been ill treated here; so the Targum, <p>"for it is the vengeance of the people of the Lord:'' <p>and her enemies are called upon to <p>take vengeance upon her; as she hath done, do unto her; that is, to execute the Lord's vengeance, of which the Persians were the instruments; and who were to go according to the law of retaliation, which is a just one; to do to Babylon as she had done to Jerusalem, and other places, she had utterly destroyed.

In the last clause, the multitude of great nations is taken together, as if they formed one enemy: "his arrows are like the arrows of a wisely dealing (i.e., skilful) warrior."<p>(Note: Instead of &#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;, J. H. Michaelis, in his Biblia Halens., has accepted the reading &#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500; on the authority of three Erfurt codices and three old editions (a Veneta of 1618; Buxtorf's Rabbinic Bible, printed at Basle, 1720; and the London Polyglott). J. D. Michaelis, Rosenmller, Maurer, and Umbreit have decided for this reading, and point to the rendering of the Vulgate, interfectoris, and of the Targum, &#1502;&#1514;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;, orbans. On the other hand, the lxx and Syriac have read and rendered &#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;; and this reading is not merely presented by nonnulli libri, as Maurer states, but by twelve codices of de Rossi, and all the more ancient editions of the Bible, of which de Rossi in his variae lectiones mentions forty-one. The critical witnesses are thus overwhelming for &#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;; and against &#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500; there lies the further consideration, that &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1500; has the meaning orbare, to render childless, only in the Piel, but in the Hiphil means abortare, to cause or have miscarriages, as is shown by &#1512;&#1495;&#1501; &#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-14.htm">Hosea 9:14</a>.)<p>The words &#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489; do not permit of being referred, on the strength of <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-22.htm">2 Samuel 1:22</a>, to one particular arrow which does not come back empty; for the verb &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;, though perhaps suitable enough for the sword, which is drawn back when it has executed the blow, is inappropriate for the arrow, which does not return. The subject to &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489; is &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512; si , the hero, who does not turn or return without having accomplished his object; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>.
