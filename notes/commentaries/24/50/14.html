The cause of this destruction is the wrath of the Lord. Babylon shall be wholly desolated; for she hath sinned against the Lord. Sin makes men a mark for the arrows of God's judgments. The mercy promised to the Israel of God, shall not only accompany, but arise from the destruction of Babylon. These sheep shall be gathered from the deserts, and put again into good pasture. All who return to God and their duty, shall find satisfaction of soul in so doing.

This is directed to the Medes and Persians, to dispose of their army in proper places round about the city of Babylon, to besiege it; and to order their instruments of war, fit for that purpose, a convenient manner; since they might be sure of victory, the Lord being wroth with it, and having so severely threatened its ruin: <p>all ye that bend the bow, shoot at her, spare no arrows; the Elamites, or Persians, as before observed, were well skilled in archery; and, as Xenophon (q) reports, Cyrus had in his army, when he came to Babylon, a great number of archers and slingers; and the archers are called upon to draw the bow, who were expert at it, and not spare their arrows, since they would everyone do execution, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-9.htm">Jeremiah 50:9</a>; and the slingers to "cast their stones at her" (r), for so may be rendered; and thus it is interpreted, by Jarchi and by Kimchi, of casting either arrows or stones: <p>for she hath sinned against the Lord; which brought the wrath of God upon her; and chiefly the ill treatment of his people was the sin against him he resented. <p>(q) Cyropaedia, l. 9. c. 1. &amp; l. 7. c. 1.((r)  "jacite contra eam", Pagninus, De Dieu; "jacite ad eam", Montanus. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/50.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{o}</span> Put yourselves in array against Babylon on every side: all ye that bend the bow, shoot at her, spare no arrows: for she hath <span class="cverse3">{p}</span> sinned against the LORD.</span><p>(o) He speaks to the enemies the Medes and Persians.<p>(p) Though the Lord called the Babylonians his servants and their work his work in punishing his people, yet because they did it not to glorify God, but for their own malice and to profit themselves, it is here called sin.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/50.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">14</span>.

The summons to flee out of Babylon is a reminiscence of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-20.htm">Isaiah 38:20</a>. The Kethib &#1497;&#1510;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; may be vindicated, because the direct address pretty often makes a sudden transition into the language of the third person. They are to depart from the land of the Chaldeans. No more will then be necessary than to change &#1493;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468; into &#1493;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468;. The simile, "like he-goats before the flock," does not mean that Israel is to press forward that he may save himself before any one else (Graf), but that Israel is to go before all, as an example and leader in the flight (Ngelsbach).</body></html>
