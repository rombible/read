The connection of the two strophes with one another is, however, allowed by these commentators; while Eichh. and Dahler hold <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-14.htm">Jeremiah 12:14-17</a> to be a distinct oracle, belonging to the time of Zedekiah, or to the seventh or eighth year of Jehoiakim. These views are bound up with an incorrect conception of the contents of the passage-to which in the first place we must accordingly direct our attention.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-7.htm">Jeremiah 12:7</a><p>"I have forsaken mine house, cast out mine heritage, given the beloved of my soul into the hand of its enemies. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-8.htm">Jeremiah 12:8</a>. Mine heritage is become unto me as a lion in the forest, it hath lifted up its voice against me; therefore have I hated it. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-9.htm">Jeremiah 12:9</a>. Is mine heritage to me a speckled vulture, that vultures are round about it? Come, gather all the beasts of the field, bring them to devour! <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-10.htm">Jeremiah 12:10</a>. Many shepherds have destroyed my vineyard, have trodden down my ground, have made the plot of my pleasure a desolate wilderness. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-11.htm">Jeremiah 12:11</a>. They have made it a desolation; it mourneth around me desolate; desolated is the whole land, because none laid it to heart. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-12.htm">Jeremiah 12:12</a>. On all the bare-peaked heights in the wilderness are spoilers come; for a sword of Jahveh's devours from one end of the land unto the other: no peace to all flesh. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-13.htm">Jeremiah 12:13</a>. They have sown wheat and reaped thorns; they have worn themselves weary and accomplished nothing. So then ye shall be put to shame for your produce, because of the hot anger of Jahve."<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-14.htm">Jeremiah 12:14</a>. "Thus saith Jahveh against all mine evil neighbours, that touch the heritage which I have given unto my people Israel: Behold, I pluck them out of their land, and the house of Judah will I pluck out of their midst. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-15.htm">Jeremiah 12:15</a>. But after I have plucked them out, I will pity them again, and bring them back, each to his heritage, and each into his land. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-16.htm">Jeremiah 12:16</a>. And it shall be, if they will learn the ways of my people, to swear by my name: As Jahveh liveth, as they have taught my people to swear by Baal, then they shall be built in the midst of my people. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-17.htm">Jeremiah 12:17</a>. But if they hearken not, I will pluck up such a nation, utterly destroying it, saith Jahve."<p>Hitz. and Graf, in opposition to other commentators, will have the strophe, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-7.htm">Jeremiah 12:7-13</a>, to be taken not as prophecy, but as a lament on the devastation which Judah, after Jehoiakim's defection from Nebuchadnezzar in the eighth year of his reign, had suffered through the war of spoliation undertaken against insurgent Judah by those neighbouring nations that had maintained their allegiance to Chaldean supremacy, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-2.htm">2 Kings 24:2</a>. In support of this, Gr. appeals to the use throughout of unconnected perfects, and to the prophecy, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-14.htm">Jeremiah 12:14</a>., joined with this description; which, he says, shows that it is something complete, existing, which is described, a state of affairs on which the prophecy is based. For although the prophet, viewing the future with the eyes of a seer as a thing present, often describes it as if it had already taken place, yet, he says, the context easily enables us in such a case to recognise the description as prophetic, which, acc. to Graf, is not the case here. This argument is void of all force. To show that the use of unconnected perfects proves nothing, it is sufficient to note that such perfects are used in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-6.htm">Jeremiah 12:6</a>, where Hitz. and Gr. take &#1489;&#1468;&#1490;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468; and &#1511;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; as prophetic. So with the perfects in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-7.htm">Jeremiah 12:7</a>. The context demands this. For though no particle attaches <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-7.htm">Jeremiah 12:7</a> to what precedes, yet, as Graf himself alleges against Hitz., it is shown by the lack of any heading that the fragment (<a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-7.htm">Jeremiah 12:7-13</a>) is "not a special, originally independent oracle;" and just as clearly, that it can by no means be (as Gr. supposes) an appendix, stuck on to the preceding in a purely external and accidental fashion. These assumptions are disproved by the contents of the fragment, which are simply an expansion of the threat of expulsion from their inheritance conveyed to the people already in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-14.htm">Jeremiah 11:14-17</a>; an expansion which not merely points back to <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-14.htm">Jeremiah 11:14-17</a>, but which most aptly attaches itself to the reproof given to the prophet for his complaint that judgment on the ungodly was delayed (<a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-1.htm">Jeremiah 12:1-6</a>); since it discloses to the prophet God's designs in regard to His people, and teaches that the judgment, though it may be delayed, will not be withheld.<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-7.htm">Jeremiah 12:7-12</a><p>contain sayings of God, not of the prophet, who had left his house in Anathoth, as Zwingli and Bugenhagen thought. The perfects are prophetic, i.e., intimate the divine decree already determined on, whose accomplishment is irrevocably fixed, and will certainly by and by take place. "My house" is neither the temple nor the land inhabited by Israel, in support whereof appeal is unjustly made to passages like <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/8-1.htm">Hosea 8:1-14</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/1-1.htm">Hosea 1:1-11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-15.htm">Hosea 9:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-12.htm">Ezekiel 8:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/9-9.htm">Ezekiel 9:9</a>; but, as is clearly shown by the parallel "mine heritage," taken in connection with what is said of the heritage in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-8.htm">Jeremiah 12:8</a>, and by "the beloved of my soul," <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-7.htm">Jeremiah 12:7</a>, means the people of Israel, or Judah as the existing representative of the people of God (house  equals  family); see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/8-1.htm">Hosea 8:1</a>. &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1514;&#1497;  equals  &#1506;&#1501; &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1492;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-20.htm">Deuteronomy 4:20</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/47-6.htm">Isaiah 47:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-25.htm">Isaiah 19:25</a>. &#1497;&#1491;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;, object of my soul's love, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-15.htm">Jeremiah 11:15</a>. This appellation, too, cannot apply to the land, but to the people of Israel - <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-8.htm">Jeremiah 12:8</a> contains the reason why Jahveh gives up His people for a prey. It has behaved to God like a lion, i.e., has opposed Him fiercely like a furious beast. Therefore He must withdraw His love. To give with the voice  equals  to lift up the voice, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/46-7.htm">Psalm 46:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-34.htm">Psalm 68:34</a>. "Hate" is a stronger expression for the withdrawal of love, shown by delivering Israel into the hand of its enemies, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/1-3.htm">Malachi 1:3</a>. There is no reason for taking  &#1513;&#1474;&#1504;&#1488;&#1514;&#1497; as inchoative (Hitz., I learned to hate it). The "hating" is explained fully in the following verses. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-9.htm">Jeremiah 12:9</a> the meaning of &#1492;&#1506;&#1497;&#1496; &#1510;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506; is disputed. In all other places where it occurs &#1506;&#1497;&#1496; means a bird of prey, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/46-11.htm">Isaiah 46:11</a>, or collective, birds of prey, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-11.htm">Genesis 15:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/18-6.htm">Isaiah 18:6</a>. &#1510;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;, in the Rabbinical Heb. the hyaena, like the Arabic s[abu'un or s[ab'un. So the lxx have rendered it; and so, too, many recent comm., e.g., Gesen. in thes. But with this the asyndeton by way of connection with &#1506;&#1497;&#1496; does not well consist: is a bird of prey, a hyaena, mine heritage? On this ground Boch. (Hieroz. ii. p. 176, ed. Ros.) sought to make good the claim of &#1506;&#1497;&#1496; to mean "beast of prey," but without proving his case. Nor is there in biblical Heb. any sure case for &#1510;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506; in the meaning of hyaena; and the Rabbinical usage would appear to be founded on this interpretation of the word in the passage before us. &#1510;&#1489;&#1506;, Arab. s[aba'a, means dip, hence dye; and so &#1510;&#1489;&#1506;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/5-30.htm">Judges 5:30</a>, is dyed materials, in plur. parti-coloured clothes. To this meaning Jerome, Syr., and Targ. have adhered in the present case; Jerome gives avis discolor, whence Luther's der sprincklight Vogel; Chr. B. Mich., avis colorata. So, and rightly, Hitz., Ew., Graf, Ng. The prophet alludes to the well-known fact of natural history, that "whenever a strange-looking bird is seen amongst the others, whether it be an owl of the night amidst the birds of day, or a bird of gay, variegated plumage amidst those of duskier hue, the others pursue the unfamiliar intruder with loud cries and unite in attacking it." Hitz., with reference to Tacit. Ann. vi. 28, Sueton. Caes. 81, and Plin. Hist. N. x. 19. The question is the expression of amazement, and is assertory. &#1500;&#1497; is dat. ethic., intimating sympathetic participation (Ng.), and not to be changed, with Gr., into &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;. The next clause is also a question: are birds of prey round about it (mine heritage), sc. to plunder it? This, too, is meant to convey affirmation. With it is connected the summons to the beasts of prey to gather round Judah to devour it. The words here come from <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/56-9.htm">Isaiah 56:9</a>. The beasts are emblem for enemies. &#1492;&#1514;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468; is not first mode or perfect (Hitz.), but imperat., contracted from &#1492;&#1488;&#1514;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-14.htm">Isaiah 21:14</a>. The same thought is, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-10.htm">Jeremiah 12:10</a>, carried on under a figure that is more directly expressive of the matter in hand. The perfects in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-10.htm">Jeremiah 12:10-12</a> are once more prophetic. The shepherds who (along with their flocks, of course) destroy the vineyard of the Lord are the kings of the heathen, Nebuchadnezzar and the kings subject to him, with their warriors. The "destroying" is expanded in a manner consistent with the figure; and here we must not fail to note the cumulation of the words and the climax thus produced. They tread down the plot of ground, turn the precious plot into a howling wilderness. With "plot of my pleasure" cf. '&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; &#1495;&#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1492;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-19.htm">Jeremiah 3:19</a>.<p>In <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-11.htm">Jeremiah 12:11</a> the emblematical shepherds are brought forward in the more direct form of enemy. &#1513;&#1474;&#1502;&#1492;&#1468;, he (the enemy, "they" impersonal) has changed it (the plot of ground) into desolation. It mourneth &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;, round about me, desolated. Spoilers are come on all the bare-topped hills of the desert. &#1502;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; is the name for such parts of the country as were suited only for rearing and pasturing cattle, like the so-called wilderness of Judah to the west of the Dead Sea. A sword of the Lord's (i.e., the war sent by Jahveh, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-29.htm">Jeremiah 25:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-25.htm">Jeremiah 6:25</a>) devours the whole land from end to end; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-33.htm">Jeremiah 25:33</a>. "All flesh" is limited by the context to all flesh in the land of Judah. &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512; in the sense of <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/6-12.htm">Genesis 6:12</a>, sinful mankind; here: the whole sinful population of Judah. For them there is no &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1501;, welfare or peace.</body></html>
