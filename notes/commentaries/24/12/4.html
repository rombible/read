A slightly different reading, however, adopted by the LXX. and by some modern scholars, would give for the last clause, “He (God) seeth not our <span class= "ital">ways,” i.e., </span>will leave us unpunished. The opening words point to a time of distress, probably of drought and famine. But out of this wretchedness, the men who were Jeremiah’s enemies—the forestallers, and monopolists, and usurers of the time—continued to enrich themselves, and scornfully defied all his warnings.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/jeremiah/12.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-4.htm" title="How long shall the land mourn, and the herbs of every field wither, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein? the beasts are consumed, and the birds; because they said, He shall not see our last end.">Jeremiah 12:4</a></span>. <span class="ital">How long shall the land mourn? </span>— As it doth under thy judgments inflicted upon it; <span class="ital">for the wickedness of them that dwell therein</span> — Lord, shall they themselves prosper, who ruin all about them? The wickedness of the people is here represented as having brought a great calamity upon the land, under which all living creatures, even the beasts of the earth, and the fowls of heaven, as well as the human race, were now suffering grievously. This calamity was a long drought, or want of rain, which happened, it seems, in the latter end of Josiah’s, and the beginning of Jehoiakim’s reign. It is mentioned <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-3.htm" title="Therefore the showers have been withheld, and there has been no latter rain; and you had a whore's forehead, you refused to be ashamed.">Jeremiah 3:3</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-13.htm" title="I will surely consume them, said the LORD: there shall be no grapes on the vine, nor figs on the fig tree, and the leaf shall fade; and the things that I have given them shall pass away from them.">Jeremiah 8:13</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-10.htm" title="For the mountains will I take up a weeping and wailing, and for the habitations of the wilderness a lamentation, because they are burned up, so that none can pass through them; neither can men hear the voice of the cattle; both the fowl of the heavens and the beast are fled; they are gone.">Jeremiah 9:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-12.htm" title="Who is the wise man, that may understand this? and who is he to whom the mouth of the LORD has spoken, that he may declare it, for what the land perishes and is burned up like a wilderness, that none passes through?">Jeremiah 9:12</a>; and more fully afterward, chap. 14. Some of its effects are here noticed; namely, that <span class="ital">the herbs of every field </span>were <span class="ital">withered, </span>and <span class="ital">the beasts and birds consumed. </span>If they would have been brought to repentance by this lesser judgment, the greater would have been prevented. <span class="ital">Because they </span>— The wicked men; <span class="ital">said, He shall not see our last end </span>— Namely, Jeremiah, whom these abandoned Jews threatened to kill, as if they were not willing he should see the fulfilling of his prophecies concerning the calamities to come on Judea. Not that they believed what he predicted would really come to pass, but they spake thus in a sarcastical manner, as much as to say, Be it so, that the calamities which thou denouncest against us shall come upon us, yet we will take care that thou shalt not have the pleasure of seeing them fulfilled upon us.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/12.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>12:1-6 When we are most in the dark concerning God's dispensations, we must keep up right thoughts of God, believing that he never did the least wrong to any of his creatures. When we find it hard to understand any of his dealings with us, or others, we must look to general truths as our first principles, and abide by them: the Lord is righteous. The God with whom we have to do, knows how our hearts are toward him. He knows both the guile of the hypocrite and the sincerity of the upright. Divine judgments would pull the wicked out of their pasture as sheep for the slaughter. This fruitful land was turned into barrenness for the wickedness of those that dwelt therein. The Lord reproved the prophet. The opposition of the men of Anathoth was not so formidable as what he must expect from the rulers of Judah. Our grief that there should be so much evil is often mixed with peevishness on account of the trials it occasions us. And in this our favoured day, and under our trifling difficulties, let us consider how we should behave, if called to sufferings like those of saints in former ages.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Hebrew divides this verse differently. "How long shall the land mourn, and the herb of the whole field wither? Because of the wickedness of them that dwell therein cattle and fowl have ceased to be: for he will not see, say they, our latter end." The people mock the prophet, saying, In spite of all his threatenings we shall outlive him.<p>Jeremiah complained that at a time of great general misery powerful men throve upon the ruin of others: even the innocent cattle and fowl suffered with the rest. To him it seemed that all this might have been cured by some signal display of divine justice. If God, instead of dealing with men by general and slow-working laws, would tear (out some of the worst offenders from among the rest, the land might yet be saved. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. land mourn&#8212;personification (Jer 14:2; 23:10).<p>for the wickedness&#8212;(Ps 107:34).<p>beasts&#8212;(Ho 4:3).<p>He shall not see our last end&#8212;Jehovah knows not what is about to happen to us (Jer 5:12) [Rosenmuller]. So the Septuagint. (Ps 10:11; Eze 8:12; 9:9). Rather, "The prophet (Jeremiah, to whom the whole context refers) shall not see our last end." We need not trouble ourselves about his boding predictions. We shall not be destroyed as he says (Jer 5:12, 13).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The prophet seems to give a reason of his former passion and prayer against those wicked men he before reflected on, because they were the cause of the nation’s ruin, which is also asserted by the psalmist, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-34.htm" title="A fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein.">Psalm 107:34</a></span>.

Nay, the effects of their wicked courses reached to the very beasts and birds, because they were so presumptuous as to conclude that they should do well enough, neither the prophet nor any other should see their last end. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/12.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>How long shall the land mourn,.... The land of Judea, being desolate, and bringing forth no fruit, through the long drought that had been upon it: <p>and the herbs of every field wither; for want of rain to come upon it: <p>for the wickedness of them that dwell therein? this opens the cause, the reason of this dearth; it was the wickedness of the inhabitants of it: as the whole earth was originally cursed for the sins of men, so particular countries have had the marks of God's displeasure upon them, because of the sins of those that dwell in them. This clause, according to the accents, belongs to what follows, and may be read in connection with the next clause; either thus, "the herbs" of every field wither, I say, "because of the wickedness of the inhabitants of it, which consumes the beasts and the birds" (x); that is, which wickedness is the cause not only of the withering of the grass and herbs, but of the consumption of birds and beasts: or else, by repeating the interrogation in the preceding clause, <p>how long shall the earth mourn, &amp;c.; <p>how long, for the malice of them that dwell in it, are the beasts and the birds consumed (y)? the one having no grass to eat; and the other no fruit to pick, or seeds to live upon; the barrenness being so very great and general. <p>Because they said; the Jews, the inhabitants of the land, the wicked part of them, and which was the greater: <p>he shall not see our last end; either the Prophet Jeremiah, who had foretold it; but they did not believe him, that such would be their end, and that he should live to see it; or such was their atheism and infidelity, that they said God himself should not see it; and so the Septuagint and Arabic versions read, "God shall not see". <p>(x) So Gussetius, Ebr.

The verse is decided rather differently by the Hebrew accents. The question should end at <span class="cmt_word">wither</span>, and the following words run on. <span class="cmt_word">Every field</span> should be <span class="accented">the whole field</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> open country). The connection has caused some difficulty. But drought is constantly described as a judgment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-3.htm">Jeremiah 3:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-24.htm">Jeremiah 5:24, 25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-2.htm">Jeremiah 14:2-7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-10.htm">Jeremiah 23:10</a>), and it is a prophetic doctrine that the lower animals suffer for the fault of man. <span class="cmt_word">Because they said</span>; rather, <span class="accented">because they say</span>. The speakers are the ungodly. The subject of the following verb is uncertain. Some think it is God; but when God is said to "see" (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> take notice of) anything, it is always something actually existing. The subject must, therefore, be the prophet, of whom the ungodly scoffingly declare, <span class="cmt_word">He shall not see our last end,</span> because his predictions are mere delusions. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/11.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Therefore Jeremiah calls upon the Lord, as the righteous judge and omniscient searcher of hearts, to punish his enemies. This verse is repeated almost verbally in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-12.htm">Jeremiah 20:12</a>, and in substance in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-10.htm">Jeremiah 17:10</a>. Who trieth reins and heart, and therefore knows that Jeremiah has done no evil. &#1488;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; is future as expressing certainty that God will interfere to punish; for to Him he has wholly committed his cause. &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497;, Pi. of &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492;, is taken by Hitz., Ew., etc. in the sense of &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1500;: on Thee have I rolled over my cause; in support of this they adduce <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-9.htm">Psalm 22:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-5.htm">Psalm 37:5</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-3.htm">Proverbs 16:3</a>, as parallel passages. It is true that this interpretation can be vindicated grammatically, for &#1490;&#1500;&#1500; might have assumed the form of &#1490;&#1500;&#1492; (Ew. 121, a). But the passages quoted are not at all decisive, since Jeremiah very frequently gives a new sense to quotations by making slight alterations on them; and in the passage cited we read &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1500; &#1488;&#1514; &#1512;&#1497;&#1489;. We therefore adhere, with Grot. and Ros., to the usual meaning of &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492;; understanding that in making known there is included the idea of entrusting, a force suggested by the construction with &#1488;&#1500; instead of &#1500;. &#1512;&#1497;&#1489;, controversy, cause. - The prophet declares God's vengeance to the instigators of the plots against his life, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-21.htm">Jeremiah 11:21-23</a>. The introductory formula in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-21.htm">Jeremiah 11:21</a> is repeated in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-22.htm">Jeremiah 11:22</a>, on account of the long intervening parenthesis. "That thou diest not" is introduced by the &#1493; of consecution. The punishment is to fall upon the entire population of Anathoth; on the young men of military age (&#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;), a violent death in war; on the children, death by famine consequent on the siege. Even though all had not had a share in the complot, yet were they at heart just as much alienated from God and ill-disposed towards His word. "Year of their visitation" is still dependent on "bring." This construction is simpler than taking &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1514; for accus. adverb., both here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-12.htm">Jeremiah 23:12</a>. </body></html>
