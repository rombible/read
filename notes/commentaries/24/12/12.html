It is a proverbial expression, signifying men’s loss of time and labour; or rather, their receiving only vexation and injury as the fruit of those efforts from which they expected great advantage.

Many professing churches become like speckled birds, presenting a mixture of religion and the world, with its vain fashions, pursuits, and pollutions. God's people are as men wondered at, as a speckled bird; but this people had by their own folly made themselves so; and the beasts and birds are called to prey upon them. The whole land would be made desolate. But until the judgments were actually inflicted, none of the people would lay the warning to heart. When God's hand is lifted up, and men will not see, they shall be made to feel. Silver and gold shall not profit in the day of the Lord's anger. And the efforts of sinners to escape misery, without repentance and works answerable thereto, will end in confusion.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Through - in.

Hardly with a reference to their pollution by idolatry; the mention of "the wilderness" (or pasture-country) suggests that it is merely a feature in the impoverishment of the country (a contrast to <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-9.htm">Isaiah 49:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The sword of the Lord shall devour</span>; rather, the Lord hath a <span class="accented">sword which devoureth</span>.

Both parts of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-5.htm">Jeremiah 12:5</a> are of the nature of proverbs. If even the race with footmen made him weary, how will he be able to compete with horses? &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1512;&#1492; here and <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-15.htm">Jeremiah 22:15</a>, a Tiph., Aramaic form for Hiph., arising by the hardening of the &#1492; into &#1514;-cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/11-3.htm">Hosea 11:3</a>, and Ew. 122, a - rival, vie with. The proverb exhibits the contrast between tasks of smaller and greater difficulty, applied to the prophet's relation to his enemies. What Jeremiah had to suffer from his countrymen at Anathoth was but a trifle compared with the malign assaults that yet awaited him in the discharge of his office. The second comparison conveys the same thought, but with a clearer intimation of the dangers the prophet will undergo. If thou puttest thy trust in a peaceful land, there alone countest on living in peace and safety, how wilt thou bear thyself in the glory of Jordan? The latter phrase does not mean the swelling of Jordan, its high flood, so as that we should with Umbr. and Ew., have here to think of the danger arising from a great and sudden inundation. It is the strip of land along the bank of the Jordan, thickly overgrown with shrubs, trees, and tall reeds, the lower valley, flooded when the river was swollen, where lions had their haunt, as in the reedy thickets of the Euphrates. Cf. v. Schubert, Resie, iii. S. 82; Robins. Bibl. Researches in Palestine, i. 535, and Phys. Geogr. of the Holy Land, p. 147. The "pride of the Jordan" is therefore mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-19.htm">Jeremiah 49:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-44.htm">Jeremiah 50:44</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/11-3.htm">Zechariah 11:3</a>, as the haunt of lions, and comes before us here as a region where men's lives were in danger. The point of the comparison is accordingly this: Thy case up till this time is, in spite of the onsets thou hast borne, to be compared to a sojourn in a peaceful land; but thou shalt come into much sorer case, where thou shalt never for a moment be sure of thy life. To illustrate this, he is told in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-6.htm">Jeremiah 12:6</a> that his nearest of kin, and those dwelling under the same roof, will behave unfaithfully towards him. They will cry behind him &#1502;&#1500;&#1488;, plena voce (Jerome; cf. &#1511;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; &#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-5.htm">Jeremiah 4:5</a>). They will cry after him, "as one cries when pursuing a thief or murderer" (Gr.). Perfectly apposite is therefore Luther's translation: They set up a hue and cry after thee. These words are not meant to be literally taken, but convey the thought, that even his nearest friends will persecute him as a malefactor. It is therefore a perverse design that seeks to find the distinction between the inhabitants of Anathoth and the brethren and housemates, in a contrast between the priests and the blood-relations. Although Anathoth was a city of the priests, the men of Anathoth need not have been all priests, since these cities were not exclusively occupied by priests. - In this reproof of the prophet there lies not merely the truth that much sorer suffering yet awaits him, but the truth besides, that the people's faithlessness and wickedness towards God and men will yet grow greater, ere the judgment of destruction fall upon Judah; for the divine long-suffering is not yet exhausted, nor has ungodliness yet fairly reached its highest point, so that the final destruction must straightway be carried out. But judgment will not tarry long. This thought is carried on in what follows. </body></html>
