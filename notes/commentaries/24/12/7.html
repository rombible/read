Possibly we have, in this chapter, what in the writings of a poet would be called fragmentary pieces, written at intervals, and representing different phases of thought, and afterwards arranged without the devices of headings and titles and spaces with which modern bookmaking has made us familiar. So far as a sequence of thought is traceable, it is this, “Thou complainest of thine own sufferings, but there are worse things yet in store for thee; and what after all are thine, as compared with those that I, Jehovah, have brought upon mine heritage, dear as it is to me?”<p><span class= "bld">I have left.</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">I have cast away.</span><p><span class= "bld">Into the hand.</span>—Literally, <span class= "ital">the palm, </span>as given over utterly, unable to resist, and not needing the “grasp<span class= "ital">” </span>of the whole hand.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/jeremiah/12.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-7.htm" title="I have forsaken my house, I have left my heritage; I have given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies.">Jeremiah 12:7</a></span>. <span class="ital">I have forsaken my house </span>— My temple, where I had placed my name.

Many professing churches become like speckled birds, presenting a mixture of religion and the world, with its vain fashions, pursuits, and pollutions. God's people are as men wondered at, as a speckled bird; but this people had by their own folly made themselves so; and the beasts and birds are called to prey upon them. The whole land would be made desolate. But until the judgments were actually inflicted, none of the people would lay the warning to heart. When God's hand is lifted up, and men will not see, they shall be made to feel. Silver and gold shall not profit in the day of the Lord's anger. And the efforts of sinners to escape misery, without repentance and works answerable thereto, will end in confusion.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Yahweh shows that the downfall of the nation was occasioned by no want of love on His part, but by the nation's conduct.<p>Left - More correctly, cast away.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7.

It may safely be dated late in Jehoiakim’s reign, as relating to the attack upon Judah on the part of Chaldaeans, Syrians, Moabites, and Ammonites (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-1.htm" title="In his days Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up, and Jehoiakim became his servant three years: then he turned and rebelled against him.">2 Kings 24:1</a> f.), under the figure of birds of prey attacking one whose plumage attracts their attention as unusual.

He considers “the evil neighbours” of <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-14.htm" title="Thus said the LORD against all my evil neighbors, that touch the inheritance which I have caused my people Israel to inherit; Behold, I will pluck them out of their land, and pluck out the house of Judah from among them.">Jeremiah 12:14</a></span> to mean the persons of various nationalities who were living in the land in the time of John Hyrcanus and his son. He compares <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-16.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left of all the nations which came against Jerusalem shall even go up from year to year to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, and to keep the feast of tabernacles.">Zechariah 14:16</a> ff.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-16.htm" title="In that day shall Egypt be like to women: and it shall be afraid and fear because of the shaking of the hand of the LORD of hosts, which he shakes over it.">Isaiah 19:16</a> ff. as having a similar reference. But, as Pe. says, we do not in those passages, as here, read of exile followed by restoration, nor would a writer of the 2nd cent. b.c. have put into the mouth of Jeremiah a prediction which in fact was not realised.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The section may be subdivided thus.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(i) <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/12-7.htm" title="I have forsaken my house, I have left my heritage; I have given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies....">Jeremiah 12:7-13</a></span>. Jehovah’s heritage has turned as a savage beast against Him. Therefore He has given her over to be the prey of neighbouring nations. She is like a speckled bird attacked by her own kind.

The key to it is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-1.htm">2 Kings 24:1, 2</a>, where it is related that, after Jehoiakim's rebellion against Nebuchadnezzar, "Jehovah sent against him bands of the Chaldees, and bands of the Syrians, and bands of the Moabites, and bands of the children of Ammon, and sent them against Judah to destroy it." The prophecy falls into two strophes or sections, Vers. 7-13 and Vers. 14-17. In the first we have a complaint of the desolation produced by the guerilla warfare; in the second, a prediction of the captivity of the hostile peoples, not, however, without a prospect of their return home and conversion to Jehovah. It is evident enough that this passage stands in no connection with what precedes. The whole tone is that of a description of present scenes and not of the future. Sometimes, no doubt, a prophet, in the confidence of faith, represents the future as though it were already past; but there is always something in the context to determine the reference and prevent ambiguity. Here, however, there is nothing to indicate that the description relates to the future; and it is followed by a prediction which presupposes that the preceding passage refers to the literal past. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I have forsaken mine house</span>. The "house" is here not the temple, but the people of Israel, as the parallel clause shows (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/8-1.htm">Hosea 8:1</a>, and setup. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-6.htm">Hebrews 3:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-15.htm">1 Timothy 3:15</a>). Jehovah, not the prophet, is evidently the speaker. <span class="cmt_word">I have left</span>; rather, <span class="accented">I have east away</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Into the hand of her enemies.</span> The Hebrew is more expressive: "Into the palm of the hand." Bonomi ('Nineveh and her Palaces,' p. 191) has an engraving from the monuments of guests at a banquet, holding their drinking-vessels in the deeply hollowed palm of their hand. So here the people of Israel, in her weak, fainting state, needs only to be held in the quiet pressure of the palm of the hand. The remark and the illustration are due to Dr. Payne Smith. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/12.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"Righteous art Thou, Jahveh, if I contend with Thee; yet will I plead with Thee in words.

For even thy brethren and they father's house, even they are faithless towards thee, yea, they call after thee with full voice. Believe them not, though they speak friendly to thee."<p>The prophet's complaint begins by acknowledging: Thou art righteous, Lord, if I would dispute with Thee, i.e., would accuse Thee of injustice. I could convict Thee of no wrong; Thou wouldst appear righteous and prove Thyself in the right. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-6.htm">Psalm 51:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-2.htm">Job 9:2</a>. With &#1488;&#1498; comes in a limitation: only he will speak pleas of right, maintain a suit with Jahveh, will set before Him something that seems incompatible with God's justice, namely the question: Why the way of the wicked prospers, why they that act faithlessly are in ease and comfort? On this cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-7.htm">Job 21:7</a>., where Job sets forth at length the contradiction between the prosperity of the wicked and the justice of God's providence. The way of the wicked is the course of their life, their conduct. God has planted them, i.e., has placed them in their circumstances of life; like a tree they have struck root into the ground; they go on, i.e., grow, and bear fruit, i.e., their undertakings succeed, although they have God in their mouth only, not in their heart.</body></html>
