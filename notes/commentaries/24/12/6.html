The language of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-5.htm" title="And they will deceive every one his neighbor, and will not speak the truth: they have taught their tongue to speak lies, and weary themselves to commit iniquity.">Jeremiah 9:5</a> favours the more literal rendering. In any case, it is interesting to note that the proverb which our Lord more than once quotes, “A prophet is not without honour save in his own country and in his own house” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-57.htm" title="And they were offended in him. But Jesus said to them, A prophet is not without honor, save in his own country, and in his own house.">Matthew 13:57</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-24.htm" title="And he said, Truly I say to you, No prophet is accepted in his own country.">Luke 4:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-44.htm" title="For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet has no honor in his own country.">John 4:44</a>), probably had its origin in the sad experience of Jeremiah.<p><span class= "bld">They have called a multitude after thee.</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">have shouted a full shout </span>(in our English phrase, “have raised a hue and cry”) <span class= "ital">after thee.</span><p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/12.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>12:1-6 When we are most in the dark concerning God's dispensations, we must keep up right thoughts of God, believing that he never did the least wrong to any of his creatures. When we find it hard to understand any of his dealings with us, or others, we must look to general truths as our first principles, and abide by them: the Lord is righteous. The God with whom we have to do, knows how our hearts are toward him. He knows both the guile of the hypocrite and the sincerity of the upright. Divine judgments would pull the wicked out of their pasture as sheep for the slaughter. This fruitful land was turned into barrenness for the wickedness of those that dwelt therein. The Lord reproved the prophet. The opposition of the men of Anathoth was not so formidable as what he must expect from the rulers of Judah. Our grief that there should be so much evil is often mixed with peevishness on account of the trials it occasions us. And in this our favoured day, and under our trifling difficulties, let us consider how we should behave, if called to sufferings like those of saints in former ages.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Called a multitude - Rather, "called aloud."

This verse is repeated almost verbally in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-12.htm">Jeremiah 20:12</a>, and in substance in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-10.htm">Jeremiah 17:10</a>. Who trieth reins and heart, and therefore knows that Jeremiah has done no evil. &#1488;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; is future as expressing certainty that God will interfere to punish; for to Him he has wholly committed his cause. &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497;, Pi. of &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492;, is taken by Hitz., Ew., etc. in the sense of &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1500;: on Thee have I rolled over my cause; in support of this they adduce <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-9.htm">Psalm 22:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-5.htm">Psalm 37:5</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-3.htm">Proverbs 16:3</a>, as parallel passages. It is true that this interpretation can be vindicated grammatically, for &#1490;&#1500;&#1500; might have assumed the form of &#1490;&#1500;&#1492; (Ew. 121, a). But the passages quoted are not at all decisive, since Jeremiah very frequently gives a new sense to quotations by making slight alterations on them; and in the passage cited we read &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1500; &#1488;&#1514; &#1512;&#1497;&#1489;. We therefore adhere, with Grot. and Ros., to the usual meaning of &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492;; understanding that in making known there is included the idea of entrusting, a force suggested by the construction with &#1488;&#1500; instead of &#1500;. &#1512;&#1497;&#1489;, controversy, cause. - The prophet declares God's vengeance to the instigators of the plots against his life, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-21.htm">Jeremiah 11:21-23</a>. The introductory formula in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-21.htm">Jeremiah 11:21</a> is repeated in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-22.htm">Jeremiah 11:22</a>, on account of the long intervening parenthesis. "That thou diest not" is introduced by the &#1493; of consecution. The punishment is to fall upon the entire population of Anathoth; on the young men of military age (&#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;), a violent death in war; on the children, death by famine consequent on the siege. Even though all had not had a share in the complot, yet were they at heart just as much alienated from God and ill-disposed towards His word. "Year of their visitation" is still dependent on "bring." This construction is simpler than taking &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1514; for accus. adverb., both here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-12.htm">Jeremiah 23:12</a>. </body></html>
