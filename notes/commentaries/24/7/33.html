Here, again, we have an almost literal quotation from Deut. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-26.htm" title="And your carcass shall be meat to all fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the earth, and no man shall fray them away.">Deuteronomy 28:26</a>).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:29-34 In token both of sorrow and of slavery, Jerusalem must be degraded, and separated from God, as she had been separated to him. The heart is the place in which God has chosen to put his name; but if sin has the innermost and uppermost place there, we pollute the temple of the Lord. The destruction of Jerusalem appears here very terrible. The slain shall be many; they having made it the place of their sin. Evil pursues sinners, even after death. Those who will not, by the grace of God, be cured of vain mirth, shall, by the justice of God, be deprived of all mirth. How many ruin their health and property without complaining, when engaged in Satan's service! May we learn to relish holy joys, and to sit loose to all others though lawful.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The valley of slaughter - Where they killed their helpless children, there shall they be slaughtered helplessly by their enemies.<p>Till there be no place - Rather, for want of room elsewhere. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>33. fray&#8212;scare or frighten (De 28:26).

The sense is, either that there should be such a vast consumption of men, that there would be none left to do this, and so the fowls and beasts might prey upon the carcasses without any disturbance; or else that those that were left would be so devoid of humanity, as not to do this office for the dead. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/7.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And the carcases of this people shall be meat for the fowls of the heaven, and for the beasts of the earth; and none shall fray them away.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/7.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">33</span>. <span class="ital">fray</span>] <span class="ital">frighten</span>.
