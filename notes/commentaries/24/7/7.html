None can claim an interest in free salvation, who allow themselves in the practice of known sin, or live in the neglect of known duty. They thought that the temple they profaned would be their protection. But all who continue in sin because grace has abounded, or that grace may abound, make Christ the minister of sin; and the cross of Christ, rightly understood, forms the most effectual remedy to such poisonous sentiments. The Son of God gave himself for our transgressions, to show the excellence of the Divine law, and the evil of sin. Never let us think we may do wickedness without suffering for it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Why then do not the Jews still possess a land thus eternally given them? Because God never bestows anything unconditionally. The land was bestowed upon them by virtue of a covenant <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-7.htm">Genesis 17:7</a>; the Jews had broken the conditions of this covenant <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-5.htm">Jeremiah 7:5-6</a>, and the gift reverted to the original donor. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7.

This clause may either be connected with the word "dwell", or with the word give; and the sense is, either that they should dwell in it for ever and ever; or it was given to their fathers for ever and ever. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/7.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Then <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> will I cause you to dwell in this place, in the land that I gave to your fathers, for ever and ever.</span><p>(b) God shows on what condition he made his promise to this temple that they would be a holy people to him, as he would be a faithful God to them.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> -<span class="cmt_word">Forever and ever</span>. It is doubtful, both here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-5.htm">Jeremiah 25:5</a>, whether these words should be joined to "gave" or "cause you to dwell." Still, the latter connection is both in itself the more probable one, and that suggested first of all by the accentuation (this, however, is not here decisive). It was not the extent of the original premise, but that of the enjoyment of the gift, which was in question.

"The word that came to Jeremiah from Jahveh, saying, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-2.htm">Jeremiah 7:2</a>. Stand in the gate of the house of Jahveh, and proclaim there this word, and say, Hear the word of Jahveh, all ye of Judah, that enter these gates to worship before Jahveh: <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-3.htm">Jeremiah 7:3</a>. Thus hath spoken Jahveh of hosts, the God of Israel, Make your ways and your doings good, and I will cause you to dwell in this place. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-4.htm">Jeremiah 7:4</a>. Trust ye not in lying words, when they say, The temple of Jahveh, the temple of Jahveh, the temple of Jahveh, is this. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-5.htm">Jeremiah 7:5</a>. But if ye thoroughly make your ways good, and your doings; if ye thoroughly execute right amongst one another; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-6.htm">Jeremiah 7:6</a>. Oppress not stranger, fatherless, and widow, and shed not innocent blood in this place, neither follow after other gods to your hurt; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-7.htm">Jeremiah 7:7</a>. Then I cause you to dwell in this place, in the land which I have given unto your fathers, from eternity unto eternity. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-8.htm">Jeremiah 7:8</a>. Behold, ye trust in lying words, though they profit not. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-9.htm">Jeremiah 7:9</a>. How? to steal, to murder, and commit adultery, and swear falsely, and offer odours to Baal, and to walk after other gods whom ye know not? <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-10.htm">Jeremiah 7:10</a>. And then ye come and stand before my face in this house, upon which my name is named, and think, We are saved to do all these abominations. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-11.htm">Jeremiah 7:11</a>. Is then this house become a den or murderers, over which my name is named, in your eyes? I too, behold, have seen it, saith Jahveh. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-12.htm">Jeremiah 7:12</a>. For go ye now to may place which was at Shiloh, where I formerly caused my name to dwell, and see what I have done unto it for the wickedness of my people Israel. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-13.htm">Jeremiah 7:13</a>. And now, because ye do all these deeds, saith Jahve, and I have spoken to you, speaking from early morning on, and ye have not heard; and I have called you, and ye have not answered; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-14.htm">Jeremiah 7:14</a>.
