It must be a thorough amendment, a universal, continued, persevering reformation; not partial, but entire; not hypocritical, but sincere; not wavering, but constant. They must <span class="ital">make the tree good, </span>and so <span class="ital">make the fruit good; </span>must amend their hearts and thoughts, and so amend their ways and doings. In particular, 1st, They must be honest and just in all their dealings. They who had power in their hands must <span class="ital">thoroughly execute judgment </span>between a man and his neighbour, without partiality. They must not, either in judgment, or in matters of contract, <span class="ital">oppress the stranger, the fatherless, </span>or <span class="ital">the widow — </span>Nor countenance or protect those that did oppress them, nor refuse to do them right when they sought for it. They must <span class="ital">not shed innocent blood </span>— And with it defile the temple, the city, and the land wherein they dwelt. 2d, They must keep close to the worship of the true God only, neither walking after other gods, nor hearkening to those that would draw them into communion with idolaters. <span class="ital">Then will I cause you to dwell in this place, </span>&c. — Upon this condition I will establish and fix you in this land <span class="ital">for ever and ever </span>— That is, from age to age, and you shall possess it, as your fathers did before you, from the days of Joshua until now.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:1-16 No observances, professions, or supposed revelations, will profit, if men do not amend their ways and their doings. None can claim an interest in free salvation, who allow themselves in the practice of known sin, or live in the neglect of known duty. They thought that the temple they profaned would be their protection. But all who continue in sin because grace has abounded, or that grace may abound, make Christ the minister of sin; and the cross of Christ, rightly understood, forms the most effectual remedy to such poisonous sentiments. The Son of God gave himself for our transgressions, to show the excellence of the Divine law, and the evil of sin. Never let us think we may do wickedness without suffering for it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A summary of the conditions indispensable on man's part, before he can plead the terms of the covenant in his favor.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5.

The trial is viewed under the figure of a long-continued but resultless process of smelting. &#1504;&#1495;&#1512;, Niph. from &#1495;&#1512;&#1512;, to be burnt, scorched, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/15-4.htm">Ezekiel 15:4</a>. &#1502;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501; is to be broken up, as in the Keri, into two words: &#1502;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; and &#1514;&#1468;&#1501; (from &#1514;&#1502;&#1501;). For there does not occur any feminine form &#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1492; from &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;, nor any plural &#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1514; (even &#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1492; forms the plur. &#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501;), so as to admit of our reading &#1502;&#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1514;&#1501; or &#1502;&#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1514;&#1501;. Nor would the plur., if there were one, be suitable; Ew.'s assertion that &#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1493;&#1514; means flames of fire is devoid of all proof. We connect &#1502;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; with what precedes: Burnt are the bellows with fire, at an end is the lead. Others attach "by the fire" to what follows: By the fire is the lead consumed. The thought is in either case the same, only &#1514;&#1468;&#1501; is not the proper word for: to be consumed. Sense: the smelting has been carried on so perseveringly, that the bellows have been scorched by the heat of the fire, and the lead added in order to get the ore into fusion is used up; but they have gone on smelting quite in vain. &#1510;&#1512;&#1507; with indefinite subject, and the infin. absol. added to indicate the long duration of the experiment. In the last clause of the verse the result is mentioned in words without a figure: The wicked have not been separated out (prop., torn asunder from the mass). </body></html>
