The word in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-33.htm" title="For Tophet is ordained of old; yes, for the king it is prepared; he has made it deep and large: the pile thereof is fire and much wood; the breath of the LORD, like a stream of brimstone, does kindle it.">Isaiah 30:33</a>, though not identical in form (<span class= "ital">Tophteh, </span>not <span class= "ital">Tophet</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>had probably the same meaning. Other etymologies give as the meaning of the word “a garden,” “a place of burning,” or “a place of drums,” <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>a music grove, and so connect it more closely with the Molech ritual. Possibly the last was the original meaning of the name, for which, as said above, the prophets used the term of opprobrium.<p><span class= "bld">The son of Hinnom.</span>—Possibly the first recorded owner, or a local hero. The name is perpetuated in later Jewish language in Ge-henna = Ge-Hinnom = the vale of Hinnom.

The destruction of Jerusalem appears here very terrible. The slain shall be many; they having made it the place of their sin. Evil pursues sinners, even after death. Those who will not, by the grace of God, be cured of vain mirth, shall, by the justice of God, be deprived of all mirth.

Where was the idol Moloch; and which place had its name, as Jarchi thinks, from the beating of drums, that the parents of the children that were burnt might not hear the cry of them: which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom; a valley near Jerusalem, and lay to the south of it, <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/15-8.htm">Joshua 15:8</a>, <p>to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire: which was done, as Jarchi says, by putting them into the arms of the brasen image Moloch, heated hot. The account he gives of Tophet is this, <p>"Tophet is Moloch, which was made of brass; and they heated him from his lower parts; and his hands being stretched out, and made hot, they put the child between his hands, and it was burnt; when it vehemently cried out; but the priests beat a drum, that the father might not hear the voice of his son, and his heart might not be moved:'' <p>but in this he is mistaken; for "Tophet" was not the name of an idol, but of a place, as is clear from this and the following verse. There is some agreement between this account of Jarchi, and that which Diodorus Siculus (z) gives of Saturn, to whom children were sacrificed by the Carthaginians; who had, he says, a brasen image of Saturn, which stretched out his hands, inclining to the earth; so that a child put upon them rolled down, and fell into a chasm full of fire: <p>which I commanded them not: not in my law, as the Targum; nor by any of the prophets, as Jarchi paraphrases it; he commanded them, as Kimchi observes, to burn their beasts, but not their sons and daughters. The instance of Abraham offering up Isaac will not justify it. The case of Jephthah's daughter, if sacrificed, was not by divine command. The giving of seed to Moloch, and letting any pass through the fire to him, is expressly forbidden, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-21.htm">Leviticus 18:21</a>, <p>neither came it into my heart; it was not so much as thought of by him, still less desired, and much less commanded by him. Jarchi's note is, <p>"though I spoke to Abraham to slay his son, it did not enter into my heart that he should slay him, but to make known his righteousness.'' <p>(z) Bibliothec.

So LXX and Targ.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Topheth</span>] This probably is not the original vocalisation (LXX <span class="greekheb">Ταφέθ</span>), though the latter cannot be determined with certainty. As Bosheth was a frequent substitute for Baal (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-24.htm" title="For shame has devoured the labor of our fathers from our youth; their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters.">Jeremiah 3:24</a>), and as the vowels of the former word were for a similar reason given to the consonants MLK (<span class="ital">Melech</span>, king), in order that offerings which the more enlightened felt it shameful to connect with Israel’s Divine King (<span class="ital">Melech</span>) might be represented as really made to a heathen god (M<span class="ital">o</span>l<span class="ital">e</span>ch); so here the original form of the word Topheth is thought to have been disguised for the same purpose of discredit. The etymology of the word is doubtful. Perhaps it comes from a root appearing in Aramaic in the sense of <span class="ital">fire-place</span>. So Rob. Sm. <span class="ital">Rel. of the Semites</span>, p. 377 (1894), who points out that when the term “first appears in Hebrew, the chief foreign influence was that of Damascus” (2 Kings 16). A great pit constituted the “fire-place,” where the victims were consumed. See C. B. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-33.htm" title="For Tophet is ordained of old; yes, for the king it is prepared; he has made it deep and large: the pile thereof is fire and much wood; the breath of the LORD, like a stream of brimstone, does kindle it.">Isaiah 30:33</a>, where the word is from the same root, though in a slightly different form. As to the position of Topheth see next note. It was defiled by Josiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-10.htm" title="And he defiled Topheth, which is in the valley of the children of Hinnom, that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Molech.">2 Kings 23:10</a>) as the scene of idolatrous and cruel rites.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">valley of the son of Hinnom</span>] The majority of scholars identify it with the <span class="ital">Wady er-Rubâbeh</span>, running W. and S. of Jerusalem, rather than with the Tyropoeon or the Kidron valleys. The derivation and meaning of Hinnom are unknown. Possibly it was the name of a former owner. See further on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-23.htm" title="How can you say, I am not polluted, I have not gone after Baalim? see your way in the valley, know what you have done: you are a swift dromedary traversing her ways;">Jeremiah 2:23</a>. As to the position of Topheth in connexion with it, all that we can say with tolerable certainty is that it was near the junction of the three valleys which encompass Jerusalem, and below Siloam. See HDB. <span class="ital">Hinnom, Valley of</span>, and <span class="ital">Topheth</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">to burn, etc</span>.] The law laid down that firstborn alike of men and of cattle were dedicated to Jehovah. The firstborn of men and of unclean animals were to be redeemed, those of clean animals to be offered in sacrifice (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-2.htm" title="Sanctify to me all the firstborn, whatever opens the womb among the children of Israel, both of man and of beast: it is mine.">Exodus 13:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-12.htm" title="That you shall set apart to the LORD all that opens the matrix, and every firstling that comes of a beast which you have; the males shall be the LORD's.">Exodus 13:12</a> f., <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-29.htm" title="O earth, earth, earth, hear the word of the LORD.">Jeremiah 22:29</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-19.htm" title="The princes of Judah, and the princes of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, and the priests, and all the people of the land, which passed between the parts of the calf;">Jeremiah 34:19</a> f.; cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/3-46.htm" title="And for those that are to be redeemed of the two hundred and three score and thirteen of the firstborn of the children of Israel, which are more than the Levites;">Numbers 3:46</a> f., <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-15.htm" title="Because my people has forgotten me, they have burned incense to vanity, and they have caused them to stumble in their ways from the ancient paths, to walk in paths, in a way not cast up;">Jeremiah 18:15</a> f.). The fact that neighbouring nations, Arabs, Phoenicians, Moabites, actually sacrificed their firstborn, together with a misinterpretation of the above passages, may have led to a belief that Jehovah meant that this should be done, and possibly Jeremiah in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-8.htm" title="How do you say, We are wise, and the law of the LORD is with us? See, certainly in vain made he it; the pen of the scribes is in vain.">Jeremiah 8:8</a> refers to a <span class="ital">written</span> perversion of the law in this direction. See note there. According to Ezek. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-25.htm" title="Why I gave them also statutes that were not good, and judgments whereby they should not live;">Ezekiel 20:25</a>) the people were left by God in this belief as a judicial punishment.

Ezekiel there traces the custom to wilderness days. As human sacrifices came under the category of the burnt offering, and as animals were slain before they were consumed, we may presume that the same was done in these cases.
