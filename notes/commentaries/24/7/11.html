Those who now flocked to the courts of the Temple, including even priests and prophets, were as such robbers, finding shelter there, and soothing their consciences by their worship, as the brigands of Italy do by their devotions at the shrine of some favourite Madonna. It had for them no higher sanctity than “a den of robbers.” The word for “robber” implies the more violent form of lawless plunder. The words are memorable, as having re-appeared in our Lord’s rebuke of the money-changers and traffickers in the Temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-13.htm" title="And said to them, It is written, My house shall be called the house of prayer; but you have made it a den of thieves.">Matthew 21:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/11-17.htm" title="And he taught, saying to them, Is it not written, My house shall be called of all nations the house of prayer? but you have made it a den of thieves.">Mark 11:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-46.htm" title="Saying to them, It is written, My house is the house of prayer: but you have made it a den of thieves.">Luke 19:46</a>); and, taken together with the reference at the last Supper to the New Covenant of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-31.htm" title="Behold, the days come, said the LORD, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah:">Jeremiah 31:31</a>, suggest the thought that our Lord was leading His disciples to see in the prophet’s work a foreshadowing of His own relation to the evils of His time, and more than a foreshadowing of the great remedy which He was to work out for them.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:1-16 No observances, professions, or supposed revelations, will profit, if men do not amend their ways and their doings. None can claim an interest in free salvation, who allow themselves in the practice of known sin, or live in the neglect of known duty. They thought that the temple they profaned would be their protection. But all who continue in sin because grace has abounded, or that grace may abound, make Christ the minister of sin; and the cross of Christ, rightly understood, forms the most effectual remedy to such poisonous sentiments. The Son of God gave himself for our transgressions, to show the excellence of the Divine law, and the evil of sin. Never let us think we may do wickedness without suffering for it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Robbers - literally, tearers, those who rob with violence.

This condition is a life morally good, that shall show itself in doing justice, in putting away all unrighteousness, and in giving up idolatry. With &#1488;&#1501; begins a list of the things that belong to the making of one's ways and doings good. The adjunct to &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;, right, "between the man and his neighbour," shows that the justice meant is that they should help one man to his rights against another. The law attached penalties to the oppression of those who needed protection - strangers, orphans, widows; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-21.htm">Exodus 22:21</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-17.htm">Deuteronomy 24:17</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-19.htm">Jeremiah 27:19</a>; and the prophets often denounce the same; cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-17.htm">Isaiah 1:17</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-23.htm">Isaiah 1:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-2.htm">Isaiah 10:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-7.htm">Ezekiel 22:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/7-10.htm">Zechariah 7:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-5.htm">Malachi 3:5</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/94-6.htm">Psalm 94:6</a>, etc.  for '&#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1514; is noteworthy, but is not a simple equivalent for it. Like &#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#787; &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#769;, &#1499;&#787;&#1489; implies a deeper interest on the part of the speaker, and the sense here is: and ye be really determined not to shed innocent blood (cf. Ew. 320, b). Hitz.'s explanation, that &#1488;&#1500; is equal to &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1500;&#1488; or &#1488;&#1501; &#1500;&#1488;, and that it her resumes again the now remote &#1488;&#1501;, is overturned by the consideration that &#1488;&#1500; is not at the beginning of the clause; and there is not the slightest probability in Graf's view, that the &#1488;&#1500; must have come into the text through the copyist, who had in his mind the similar clause in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-3.htm">Jeremiah 22:3</a>. Shedding innocent blood refers in part to judicial murders (condemnation of innocent persons), in part to violent attacks made by the kings on prophets and godly men, such as we hear of in Manasseh's case, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-16.htm">2 Kings 21:16</a>. In this place (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-7.htm">Jeremiah 7:7</a>), i.e., first and foremost Jerusalem, the metropolis, where moral corruption had its chief seat; in a wider sense, however, it means the whole kingdom of Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-3.htm">Jeremiah 7:3</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-7.htm">Jeremiah 7:7</a>). "To your hurt" belongs to all the above-mentioned transgressions of the law; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-7.htm">Jeremiah 25:7</a>. "In the land," etc., explains "this place." "From eternity to eternity" is a rhetorically heightened expression for the promise given to the patriarchs, that God would give the land of Canaan to their posterity for an everlasting possession, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-8.htm">Genesis 17:8</a>; although here it belongs not to the relative clause, "that I gave," but to the principal clause, "cause you to dwell," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-13.htm">Exodus 32:13</a>.</body></html>
