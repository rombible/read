Let us be as diligent ourselves, and as careful to teach our children the truths of God, as many are to teach the mysteries of iniquity.

No: he cannot be provoked to anger as men are; anger does not fall upon him as it does on men; there is no such affection in God as there is in men; his Spirit cannot be irritated and provoked in the manner that the spirits of men may be; and though sin, and particularly idolatry, is disagreeable to him, contrary to his nature, and repugnant to his will; yet the damage arising from it is more to men themselves than to him; and though he sometimes does things which are like to what are done by men when they are angry, yet in reality there is no such perturbation in God as there is in men: <p>do they not provoke themselves to the confusion of their own faces? the greatest hurt that is done is done to themselves; they are the sufferers in the end; they bring ruin and destruction upon themselves; and therefore have great reason to be angry with themselves, since what they do issues in their own shame and confusion.

This threat is introduced by a grounding &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, for. This for refers to the central idea of the last verse, that they must not build their expectations on the temple, hold it to be a pledge for their safety. For since the Lord has seen how they have profaned and still profane it, He will destroy it, as the sanctuary at Shiloh was destroyed. The rhetorical mode of utterance, Go to the place, etc., contributes to strengthen the threatening. They were to behold with their own eyes the fate of the sanctuary at Shiloh, that so they might understand that the sacredness of a place does not save it from overthrow, if men have desecrated it by their wickedness. We have no historical notice of the event to which Jeremiah refers. At Shiloh, now Seiln (in ruins) the Mosaic tabernacle was erected after the conquest of Canaan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-1.htm">Joshua 18:1</a>), and there it was still standing in the time of the high priest Eli, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-1.htm">1 Samuel 1:1-3</a>; but the ark, which had fallen into the hands of the Philistines at the time of their victory (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4.htm">1 Samuel 4</a>), was not brought back to the tabernacle when it was restored again to the Israelites. In the reign of Saul we find the tabernacle at Nob (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/21-2.htm">1 Samuel 21:2</a>.). The words of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-12.htm">Jeremiah 7:12</a> intimate, that at that time "the place of God at Shiloh" was lying in ruins. As Hitz. justly remarks, the destruction of it is not to be understood of its gradual decay after the removal of the ark (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-11.htm">1 Samuel 4:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-1.htm">1 Samuel 7:1</a>.); the words imply a devastation or destruction, not of the place of God at Shiloh only, but of the place Shiloh itself. This is clearly seen from <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-14.htm">Jeremiah 7:14</a> : I will do unto this house (the temple), and the place which I gave to your fathers, as I have done unto Shiloh. This destruction did not take place when the Assyrians overthrew the kingdom of the ten tribes, but much earlier. It may, indeed, be gathered from <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/18-20.htm">Judges 18:20</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-31.htm">Judges 18:31</a> (see the comment. on this passage), that it was as early as the time of Saul, during a Syrian invasion. By the destruction of the place of God at Shiloh, we need not understand that the tabernacle itself, with its altar and other sacred furniture (except the ark), was swept away. Such a view is contradicted by the statement in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-29.htm">1 Chronicles 21:29</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-3.htm">2 Chronicles 1:3</a>, according to which the tabernacle built by Moses in the wilderness was still standing at Gibeon in David's time, and in the beginning of Solomon's reign; cf. with <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-5.htm">2 Chronicles 1:5</a>, when the brazen altar of burnt-offering is expressly mentioned as that which was made by Bezaleel. Hence it is clear that the Mosaic tabernacle, with its altar of burnt-offering, had been preserved, and consequently that it must have been moved first from Shiloh to Nob, and then, when Saul sacked this town (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22.htm">1 Samuel 22</a>), to Gibeon. The destruction of the place of God in Shiloh must accordingly have consisted in this, that not only was the tabernacle with the altar carried off from thence, but the buildings necessary in connection with the maintenance of the public worship which surrounded it were swept away when the city was plundered, so that of the place of the sanctuary nothing was left remaining. It is clear that about the tabernacle there were various buildings which, along with the tabernacle and its altars, constituted "the house of God at Shiloh;" for in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3.htm">1 Samuel 3</a> we are told that Samuel slept in the temple of Jahveh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-3.htm">1 Samuel 3:3</a>), and that in the morning he opened the doors of the house of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-15.htm">1 Samuel 3:15</a>). Hence we may gather, that round about the court of the tabernacle there were buildings erected, which were used partly as a dwelling-place for the officiating priests and Levites, and partly for storing up the heave-offerings, and for preparing the thank-offerings at the sacrificial meals (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-11.htm">1 Samuel 2:11-21</a>). This whole system of buildings surrounding the tabernacle, with its court and altar of burnt-offering, was called the "house of God;" from which name Graf erroneously inferred that there was at Shiloh a temple like the one in Jerusalem. The wickedness of my people, is the Israelites' fall into idolatry in Eli's time, because of which the Lord gave up Israel into the power of the Philistines and other enemies (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-1.htm">Judges 13:1</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-3.htm">1 Samuel 7:3</a>). "These deeds" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-13.htm">Jeremiah 7:13</a>) are the sins named in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-9.htm">Jeremiah 7:9</a>. &#1493;&#1488;&#1491;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; is a continuation of the infinitive sentence, and is still dependent on &#1497;&#1506;&#1503;. Speaking from early morn, i.e., speaking earnestly and unremittingly; cf. Gesen. 131, 3, b. I have called you, i.e., to repent, and ye have not answered, i.e., have not repented and turned to me.</body></html>
