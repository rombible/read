Probably the general thought was that the whole history of Israel had been one of progressive deterioration, reaching its climax in the generation in which Jeremiah lived. His words find a striking parallel in the complaint of the Roman historian (Livy, <span class= "ital">Præf</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>or of the poet :—<p>“Æta<span class= "ital">s </span>parentum, pejor avis, tulit<p>Nos nequiores.”—Hor., <span class= "ital">Od. iii.</span> 6.<p>“Our fathers’ age, more stained with crime<p>Than were their sires in older time,<p>Has brought us forth a later race<p>Yet more iniquitous and base.”<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:21-28 God shows that obedience was required of them.

God was displeased with disobedience. We understand the gospel as little as the Jews understood the law, if we think that even the sacrifice of Christ lessens our obligation to obey.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Imagination - Better, as in the margin.<p>And went backward - literally, as in the margin; i. e., they turned their back upon Me to follow their own devices. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>26. hardened &#8230; neck&#8212;(De 31:27; Isa 48:4; Ac 7:51).<p>worse than their fathers&#8212;(Jer 16:12).
