Not man only, but the creatures that seemed least open to man’s attack, were fled. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-6.htm" title="Neither said they, Where is the LORD that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, that led us through the wilderness, through a land of deserts and of pits, through a land of drought, and of the shadow of death, through a land that no man passed through, and where no man dwelled?">Jeremiah 2:6</a>.) The same thought re-appears in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-10.htm" title="For the mountains will I take up a weeping and wailing, and for the habitations of the wilderness a lamentation, because they are burned up, so that none can pass through them; neither can men hear the voice of the cattle; both the fowl of the heavens and the beast are fled; they are gone.">Jeremiah 9:10</a>.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:19-31 The prophet had no pleasure in delivering messages of wrath. He is shown in a vision the whole land in confusion. Compared with what it was, every thing is out of order; but the ruin of the Jewish nation would not be final. Every end of our comforts is not a full end. Though the Lord may correct his people very severely, yet he will not cast them off. Ornaments and false colouring would be of no avail. No outward privileges or profession, no contrivances would prevent destruction. How wretched the state of those who are like foolish children in the concerns of their souls! Whatever we are ignorant of, may the Lord make of good understanding in the ways of godliness. As sin will find out the sinner, so sorrow will, sooner or later, find out the secure.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Moved lightly - "Reeled to and fro," from the violence of the earthquake.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>25. no man &#8230; birds&#8212;No vestige of the human, or of the feathered creation, is to be seen (Eze 38:20; Zep 1:3).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">There was no man; </span> quite depopulated and laid waste, all either slain, or carried captive, or fled; for after the flight of men, women, and children into Egypt, upon the death of Gedaliah, scarce a Jew was left in Judea. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">All the birds of the heavens were fled; </span> such birds as are used to inhabited places, that live, feed, and build among men; (others indeed, both birds and beasts, would continue, which implies but the greater desolation and waste of the land, as is threatened against Babylon, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/13-19.htm" title="And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldees' excellency, shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah....">Isaiah 13:19-22</a></span>) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">fled, </span> either to seek provisions, here being no food left for them, or frighted with the hideous noises and clatterings that do attend armies; as we have read, that such hath been the concussion of the air by the loud clamours and noises of armies, that birds have fallen down to the earth, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-10.htm" title="For the mountains will I take up a weeping and wailing, and for the habitations of the wilderness a lamentation, because they are burned up, so that none can pass through them; neither can men hear the voice of the cattle; both the fowl of the heavens and the beast are fled; they are gone.">Jeremiah 9:10</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-2.htm" title="I will utterly consume all things from off the land, said the LORD.">Zephaniah 1:2</a>,3</span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And I beheld, and, lo, there was no man,....

I look, and, lo, Carmel is the wilderness, and all the cities thereof are destroyed before Jahveh, before the heath of His anger."<p>To express the misery which the approaching siege of Jerusalem and the cities of Judah is about to bring, the prophet breaks forth into lamentation, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-19.htm">Jeremiah 4:19-21</a>. It is a much debated question, whether the prophet is the speaker, as the Chald. has taken it, i.e., whether Jeremiah is uttering his own (subjective) feelings, or whether the people is brought before us speaking, as Grot., Schnur., Hitz., Ew. believe. The answer is this: the prophet certainly is expressing his personal feelings regarding the nearing catastrophe, but in doing so he lends words to the grief which all the godly will feel. The lament of <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-20.htm">Jeremiah 4:20</a>, suddenly are my tents spoiled, is unquestionably the lament not of the prophet as an individual, but of the congregation, i.e., of the godly among the people, not of the mass of the blinded people. The violence of the grief finds vent in abrupt ejaculations of distress. "My bowels, my bowels!" is the cry of sore pain, for with the Hebrews the bowels are the seat of the deepest feelings. The Chet. &#1488;&#1493;&#1495;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492; is a monstrosity, certainly a copyist's error for &#1488;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492;, as it is in many MSS and edd., from &#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;: I am driven to writhe in agony. The Keri  &#1488;&#1493;&#1495;&#1497;&#1500;&#1492;, I will wait (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/7-7.htm">Micah 7:7</a>), yields no good sense, and is probably suggested merely by the cohortative form, a cohortative being regarded as out of place in the case of &#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;. But that form may express also the effort to incite one's own volition, and so would here be rendered in English by: I am bound to suffer pain, or must suffer; cf. Ew. 228, a. -  &#1511;&#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514; , prop. the walls of my heart, which quiver as the heart throbs in anguish. &#1492;&#1493;&#1502;&#1492;&#1470;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497; is not to be joined with the last two words as if it were part of the same clause; in that case we should expect &#1492;&#1493;&#1502;&#1492;. But these words too are an ejaculation. The subject of &#1492;&#1493;&#1502;&#1492; is the following &#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-36.htm">Jeremiah 48:36</a>. In defiance of usage, Hitz. connects &#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497; with &#1500;&#1488; : my heart can I not put to silence. But this verb in Hiph. means always: be silent, never: put to silence. Not even in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/11-3.htm">Job 11:3</a> can it have the latter meaning; where we have the same verb construed with acc. rei, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/41-4.htm">Job 41:4</a>, and where we must translate: at thy harangues shall the people be silent. The heart cannot be silent, because the soul hears the peal of the war-trumpet. &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; is 2nd pers. fem., as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-20.htm">Jeremiah 2:20</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-33.htm">Jeremiah 2:33</a>, and freq., the soul being addressed, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16-2.htm">Psalm 16:2</a> (in &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;), <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/42-6.htm">Psalm 42:6</a>, 12. This apostrophe is in keeping with the agitated tone of the whole verse.</body></html>
