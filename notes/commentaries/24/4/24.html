He is shown in a vision the whole land in confusion. Compared with what it was, every thing is out of order; but the ruin of the Jewish nation would not be final. Every end of our comforts is not a full end. Though the Lord may correct his people very severely, yet he will not cast them off. Ornaments and false colouring would be of no avail. No outward privileges or profession, no contrivances would prevent destruction. How wretched the state of those who are like foolish children in the concerns of their souls! Whatever we are ignorant of, may the Lord make of good understanding in the ways of godliness.

That of which the herald gives warning is not given till the next clause. &#1488;&#1493;&#1503;, mischief, i.e., calamity. &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1506; is still dependent on &#1511;&#1493;&#1500;. "From Dan," i.e., the northern boundary of Palestine; see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-1.htm">Judges 20:1</a>. "From Mount Ephraim," i.e., the northern boundary of the kingdom of Judah, not far distant from Jerusalem. The alarm and the calamity draw ever nearer. "The messenger comes from each successive place towards which the foe approaches" (Hitz.). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-16.htm">Jeremiah 4:16</a> the substance of the warning message is given, but in so animated a manner, that a charge is given to make the matter known to the peoples and in Jerusalem. Tell to the peoples, behold, cause to be heard. The &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; in the first clause points forward, calling attention to the message in the second clause. A similar charge is given in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-5.htm">Jeremiah 4:5</a>, only "to the peoples" seems strange here. "The meaning would be simple if we could take 'the peoples' to be the Israelites," says Graf. But since &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501; in this connection can mean only the other nations, the question obtrudes itself: to what end the approach of the besiegers of Jerusalem should be proclaimed to the heathen peoples. Jerome remarks on this: Vult omnes in circuitu nationes Dei nosse sententiam, et flagelat Jerusalem cunctos recipere disciplinam. In like manner, Chr. B. Mich., following Schmid: Gentibus, ut his quoque innotescat severitatis divinae in Judaeos exemplum. Hitz. and Gr. object, that in what follows there is no word of the taking and destruction of Jerusalem, but only of the siege; that this could form no such exemplum, and that for this the issue must be awaited. But this objection counts for little. After the description given of the enemies (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-13.htm">Jeremiah 4:13</a>), there can be no doubt as to the issue of the siege, that is, as to the taking of Jerusalem. But if this be so, then the warning of the heathen as to the coming catastrophe, by holding the case of Jerusalem before them, is not so far-fetched a thought as that it should be set aside by Hitz.'s remark: "So friendly an anxiety on behalf of the heathen is utterly unnatural to a Jew, especially seeing that the prophet is doubly absorbed by anxiety for his own people." Jeremiah was not the narrow-minded Jew Hitz. takes him for. Besides, there is no absolute necessity for holding "Tell to the peoples" to be a warning of a similar fate addressed to the heathen. The charge is but a rhetorical form, conveying the idea that there is no doubt about the matter to be published, and that it concerned not Jerusalem alone, but the nations too. This objection settled, there is no call to seek other interpretations, especially as all such are less easily justified. By changing the imper. &#1492;&#1494;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; and &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468; into perfects, Ew. obtains the translation: "they say already to the peoples, behold, they come, already they proclaim in Jerusalem," etc.; but Hitz. and Graf have shown the change to be indefensible. Yet more unsatisfactory is the translation, "declare of the heathen," which Hitz. and Graf have adopted, following the lxx, Kimchi, Vat., and others. This destroys the parallelism, it is out of keeping with the &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;, and demands the addition (with the lxx) of &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; thereto to complete the sense. Graf and Hitz. have not been able to agree upon the sense of the second member of the verse. If we make &#1500;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501;de gentibus, then '&#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; ought to be: proclaim upon (i.e., concerning) Jerusalem. Hitz., however, translates, in accordance with the use of &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1506; in vv. 5 and 15: Cry it aloud in Jerusalem (prop. over Jerusalem, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/49-12.htm">Psalm 49:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/8-1.htm">Hosea 8:1</a>); but this, though clearly correct, does not correspond to the first part of the verse, according to Hitz.'s translation of it. Graf, on the other hand, gives: Call them (the peoples) out against Jerusalem - a translation which, besides completely destroying the parallelism of the two clauses, violently separates from the proclamation the thing proclaimed: Besiegers come, etc. Nor can &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468; be taken in the sense: call together, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-29.htm">Jeremiah 50:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-27.htm">Jeremiah 51:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-22.htm">1 Kings 15:22</a>; for in that case the object could not be omitted, those who are to be called together would need to be mentioned; and it is too much to assume &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501; from the &#1500;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501; for an object. The warning cry to Jerusalem runs: &#1504;&#1510;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, besiegers, (acc. to <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-8.htm">Isaiah 1:8</a>) come from the far country (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-15.htm">Jeremiah 5:15</a>), and give their voice (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-15.htm">1 Kings 2:15</a>); i.e., let the tumult of a besieging army echo throughout the cities of Judah. These besiegers will be like field-keepers round about Jerusalem (&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492; refers back to Jerus.), like field-keepers they will pitch their tents round the city (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-15.htm">1 Kings 1:15</a>) to blockade it. For against me (Jahveh) was she refractory (&#1502;&#1512;&#1492; c. acc. pers., elsewhere with &#1489;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/14-1.htm">Hosea 14:1</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/5-11.htm">Psalm 5:11</a>, or with &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/20-24.htm">Numbers 20:24</a>, and often). This is expanded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-18.htm">Jeremiah 4:18</a>. Thy way, i.e., they behaviour and thy doings, have wrought thee this (calamity). This is thy wickedness, i.e., the effect or fruit of thy wickedness, yea, it is bitter, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-19.htm">Jeremiah 2:19</a>; yea, it reacheth unto thine heart, i.e., inflicts deadly wounds on thee.</body></html>
