Otherwise the removal of judgments, either those inflicted or threatened to be inflicted, is promised upon repentance, to which God frequently exhorted these Jews by his prophets. <span class="ital">The whole city shall flee </span>— The inhabitants of all ranks and qualities shall seek to escape the fury of the Chaldean army, chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-4.htm" title="And it came to pass, that when Zedekiah the king of Judah saw them, and all the men of war, then they fled, and went forth out of the city by night, by the way of the king's garden, by the gate between the two walls: and he went out the way of the plain.">Jeremiah 39:4</a>. <span class="ital">They shall go into thickets </span>— Either upon the report of the coming of their enemies, the prophet hereby, as it were, deriding their confidence, or rather at the approach of their vast armies: for they were closely besieged before they fled, as appears <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-4.htm" title="And the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled by night by the way of the gate between two walls, which is by the king's garden: (now the Chaldees were against the city round about:) and the king went the way toward the plain.">2 Kings 25:4</a>.

The Hebrew is, <span class="greekheb">באו בעבים</span>, <span class="ital">they shall go into the clouds; </span>meaning, probably, dark places on the tops of hills, reaching, as it were, to the clouds, or among the cloudy shades of trees and groves that usually grew there. The LXX. render it, <span class="greekheb">εισεδυσαν εις τα σπηλαια</span>, <span class="ital">they entered into the caves; </span>adding, <span class="greekheb">και εις τα αλση εκρυβησαν</span>, <span class="ital">they were hid in the groves.

He is shown in a vision the whole land in confusion. Compared with what it was, every thing is out of order; but the ruin of the Jewish nation would not be final. Every end of our comforts is not a full end. Though the Lord may correct his people very severely, yet he will not cast them off. Ornaments and false colouring would be of no avail. No outward privileges or profession, no contrivances would prevent destruction. How wretched the state of those who are like foolish children in the concerns of their souls! Whatever we are ignorant of, may the Lord make of good understanding in the ways of godliness. As sin will find out the sinner, so sorrow will, sooner or later, find out the secure.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For ... - Because of this doom upon Judah.<p>I have purposed it - The Septuagint arrangement restores the parallelism:<p>For I have spoken, and will not repent,<p>I have purposed, and will not turn back from it. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>28.

That is, for the full end that will be made hereafter, though not now; the earth may be said to mourn when the inhabitants of it do; or when it is destroyed, and is become desolate, as the Targum, Jarchi, and Kimchi, explain it; when it is uncultivated and uninhabited: <p>and the heavens above be black; with thick clouds, and storms, and tempests; in allusion to mourners, that are clothed with black: these figures, of the earth's mourning, and the heavens being clothed in black, denote the horribleness of that dispensation, when there would be an utter destruction of the Jewish nation, church, and polity, of which Daniel prophesies, <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/9-27.htm">Daniel 9:27</a>, <p>because I have spoken it; in my word, as the Targum; in the Scriptures of the Old Testament, by Moses and the prophets: <p>I have purposed it; or I have thought of it, in my counsel, as the Targum; it was a thing deliberately devised and determined, and therefore can never be frustrated, or made void: <p>and will not repent; of what was purposed and predicted: <p>neither will I turn back from it; revoke, or retract it; it shall surely come to pass: the Jews, upon their return from the Babylonish captivity, and afterwards, might flatter themselves that a full end would not be made of them, because it was not then done; and therefore these several strong expressions are used, to confirm and assure them of it; for the word of God cannot fail, his counsel shall stand; he is not a man, that he should lie or repent; he will do all his pleasure. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For this shall the earth mourn, and the heavens above be black; because I have spoken it, I have purposed it, and will not repent, neither will I turn back from it.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/4.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">28</span>. <span class="ital">be black</span>] be in mourning from sympathy.

Ew. translates loosely: wound upon wound meet one another. For the word does not mean wound, but the fracture of a limb; and it seems inadmissible to follow the Chald. and Syr. in taking &#1504;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488; here in the sense of &#1504;&#1511;&#1512;&#1492; , since the sig. "meet" does not suit &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1512;. The thought is this: tidings are brought of one catastrophe after another, for the devastation extends itself over the whole land and comes suddenly upon the tents, i.e., dwellings of those who are lamenting. Covers, curtains of the tent, is used as synonymous with tents; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-20.htm">Jeremiah 10:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-2.htm">Isaiah 54:2</a>. How long shall I see the standard, etc.! is the cry of despair, seeing no prospect of the end to the horrors of the war. The standard and the sound of the trumpet are, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-5.htm">Jeremiah 4:5</a>, the alarm-signals on the approach of the enemy.<p>There is no prospect of an end to the horrors, for (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-22.htm">Jeremiah 4:22</a>) the people is so foolish that it understands only how to do the evil, but not the good; cf. for this <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-21.htm">Jeremiah 5:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-3.htm">Isaiah 1:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/7-3.htm">Micah 7:3</a>. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-21.htm">Jeremiah 4:21</a> gives God's answer to the woful query, how long the ravaging of the land by war is to last. The answer is: as long as the people persists in the folly of its rebellion against God, so long will chastising judgments continue. To bring this answer of God home to the people's heart, the prophet, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-23.htm">Jeremiah 4:23-26</a>, tells what he has seen in the spirit. He has seen (&#1512;&#1488;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497;, perf. proph.) bursting over Judah a visitation which convulses the whole world. The earth seemed waste and void as at the beginning of creation, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a>, before the separation of the elements and before the creation of organic and living beings. In heaven no light was to be seen, earth and heaven seemed to have been thrown back into a condition of chaos. The mountains and hills, these firm foundations of the earth, quivered and swayed (&#1492;&#1514;&#1511;&#1500;&#1511;&#1500;, be put into a light motion, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/1-5.htm">Nahum 1:5</a>); men had fled and hidden themselves from the wrath of God (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-19.htm">Isaiah 2:19</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-21.htm">Isaiah 2:21</a>), and all the birds had flown out of sight in terror at the dreadful tokens of the beginning catastrophe (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-9.htm">Genesis 9:9</a>). The fruitful field was the wilderness - not a wilderness, but "changed into the wilderness with all its attributes" (Hitz.). &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1502;&#1500; is not appell. as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-7.htm">Jeremiah 2:7</a>, but nom. prop. of the lower slopes of Carmel, famed for their fruitfulness; these being taken as representatives of all the fruitful districts of the land. The cities of the Carmel, or of the fruitful-field, are manifestly not to be identified with the store cities of <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-19.htm">1 Kings 9:19</a>, as Hitz. supposes, but the cities in the most fertile districts of the country, which, by reason of their situation, were in a prosperous condition, but now are destroyed. "Before the heat of His anger," which is kindled against the foolish and godless race; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/1-6.htm">Nahum 1:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-13.htm">Isaiah 13:13</a>.</body></html>
