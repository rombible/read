Some attention was paid in Jerusalem to outward reformation; but it was necessary that their hearts should be washed, in the exercise of true repentance and faith, from the love and pollution of sin. When lesser calamities do not rouse sinners and reform nations, sentence will be given against them. The Lord's voice declares that misery is approaching, especially against wicked professors of the gospel; when it overtakes them, it will be plainly seen that the fruit of wickedness is bitter, and the end is fatal.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Jeremiah compares the tents of the besiegers on guard round Jerusalem to the booths erected by shepherds or farmers for the protection of their flocks or produce. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17. keepers of a field&#8212;metaphor from those who watch a field, to frighten away the wild beasts.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> They will strictly besiege her, as keepers of a field will be careful who go in and who go out, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-2.htm" title="Behold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of trembling to all the people round about, when they shall be in the siege both against Judah and against Jerusalem.">Zechariah 12:2</a></span>; they will watch that none go in to relieve them, and also that none get out to escape: see <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-1.htm" title="In the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa Baasha king of Israel came up against Judah, and built Ramah, to the intent that he might let none go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.">2 Chronicles 16:1</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Because she hath been rebellious:</span> God doth not threaten his judgments only, but he labours to convince them that there is a sufficient reason for it, both here and in the next verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>As keepers of a field, are they against her round about,....

Thy way and thy doings have wrought thee this. This is thy wickedness; yea, it is bitter, yea, it reaCheth unto thine heart."<p>A more minute account of the impending judgment is introduced by the phrase: at that time. It shall be said to this people; in other words, it shall be said of this people; substantially, that shall fall upon it which is expressed by the figure following, a hot wind blowing from the naked hills of the wilderness. &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; is stat. constr., and &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1497;&#1501; dna  its genitive, after which latter the adjective &#1510;&#1495; should be placed; but it is interpolated between the nomen regens and the n. rectum by reason of its smallness, and partly, too, that it may not be too far separated from its nomen, while &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1491;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; belongs to &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1497;&#1501;. The wind blowing from the bleak hills in the wilderness, is the very severe east wind of Palestine. It blows in incessant gusts, and cannot be used for winnowing or cleansing the grain, since it would blow away chaff and seed together; cf. Wetzst. in Del., Job, S. 320. &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498; is universally taken adverbially: is on the way, i.e., comes, moves in the direction of the daughter of Zion. The daughter of Zion is a personification of the inhabitants of Zion or Jerusalem. This hot blast is a figure for the destruction which is drawing near Jerusalem. It is not a chastisement to purify the people, but a judgment which will sweep away the whole people, carry away both wheat and chaff - a most effective figure for the approaching catastrophe of the destruction of Jerusalem, and the carrying away captive of its inhabitants. Hitz. and Graf have, however, taken &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498; as subject of the clause: the path, i.e., the behaviour of my people, is a keen wind of the bare hills in the wilderness. Thus the conduct of the people would be compared with that wind as unprofitable, inasmuch as it was altogether windy, empty, and further as being a hurtful storm. But the comparison of the people's behaviour with a parched violent wind is a wholly unnatural one, for the justification of which it is not sufficient to point to <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/8-7.htm">Hosea 8:7</a> : sow wind and reap storm. Besides, upon this construction of the illustration, the description: not to winnow and not to cleanse, is not only unmeaning, but wholly unsuitable. Who is to be winnowed and cleansed by the windy ways of the people? Jahveh?! <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-14.htm">Jeremiah 4:14</a> is indeed so managed by Hitz. and Graf that the tempestuous wind blows against God, "is directed against Jahveh like a blast of defiance and hostility." But this argument is sufficient to overthrow that unnatural view of the figure, which, besides, obtains no support from <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-12.htm">Jeremiah 4:12</a>. &#1502;&#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; cannot refer to &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1470;&#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;: a full wind from these, i.e., the sons of my people; and &#1497;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488;  &#1500;&#1497;, in spite of the passages, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-23.htm">Jeremiah 22:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-26.htm">Jeremiah 50:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-48.htm">Jeremiah 51:48</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/3-25.htm">Job 3:25</a>, does not mean: comes towards me, or: blows from them on me; for in all these passages &#1500;&#1497; is dativ commodi or incommodi. Here, too, &#1500;&#1497; is dative, used of the originator and efficient cause. The wind comes for me - in plainer English: from me. Properly: it comes to God, i.e., at His signal, to carry out His will. &#1502;&#1500;&#1488; &#1502;&#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; is comparative: fuller than these, namely, the winds useful for winnowing and cleansing. Now will I too utter. The intensifying &#1490;&#1468;&#1501; does not point to a contrast in the immediately preceding clause: because the people blows against God like a strong wind, He too will utter judgment against it. The &#1490;&#1468;&#1501; refers back to the preceding &#1500;&#1497;: the storm comes from me; for now will I on my side hold judgment with them. The contrast implied in &#1490;&#1468;&#1501; lies in the wider context, in the formerly described behaviour of the people, particularly in the sayings of the false prophets mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-10.htm">Jeremiah 4:10</a>, that there will be peace. On &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;&#1497;&#1501;, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-16.htm">Jeremiah 1:16</a>.<p>These judgments are already on the way in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-13.htm">Jeremiah 4:13</a>. "Like clouds it draws near." The subject is not mentioned, but a hostile army is meant, about to execute God's judgments. "Like clouds," i.e., in such thick dark masses; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-16.htm">Ezekiel 38:16</a>. The war-chariots drive with the speed of the tempest; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-28.htm">Isaiah 5:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-15.htm">Isaiah 66:15</a>. The running of the horses resembles the flight of the eagle; cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-8.htm">Habakkuk 1:8</a>, where the same is said of the horsemen of the hostile people. Both passages are founded on <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-49.htm">Deuteronomy 28:49</a>; but Jeremiah, while he had the expression &#1511;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; &#1502;&#1504;&#1468;&#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; &#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;&#1497;&#1493;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-8.htm">Habakkuk 1:8</a>, in his mind, chose &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;; instead of leopards (&#1504;&#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;), in this following the original in Deut.; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-23.htm">2 Samuel 1:23</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-19.htm">Lamentations 4:19</a>.
