When lesser calamities do not rouse sinners and reform nations, sentence will be given against them.

"If thou returnest, Israel, saith Jahveh, returnest to me; and if thou puttest away thine abominations from before my face, and strayest not, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-2.htm">Jeremiah 4:2</a>. and swearest, As Jahveh liveth, in truth, with right, and uprightness; then shall the nations bless themselves in Him, and in Him make their boast." Graf errs in taking these verses as a wish: if thou wouldst but repent...and swear...and if they blessed themselves. His reason is, that the conversion and reconciliation with Jahveh has not yet taken place, and are yet only hoped for; and he cites passages for &#1488;&#1501; with the force of a wish, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/13-3.htm">Genesis 13:3</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/28-13.htm">Genesis 28:13</a>, where, however, &#1504;&#1488; or &#1500;&#1493;&#1468; is joined with it. But if we take all the verbs in the same construction, we get a very cumbrous result; and the reason alleged proceeds upon a prosaic misconception of the dramatic nature of the prophet's mode of presentation from <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-21.htm">Jeremiah 3:21</a> onwards. Just as there the prophet hears in spirit the penitent supplication of the people, so here he hears the Lord's answer to this supplication, by inward vision seeing the future as already present. The early commentators have followed the example of the lxx and Vulg. in construing the two verses differently, and take &#1488;&#1500;&#1497;  and &#1493;&#1500;&#1488; &#1514;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491; as apodoses: if thou returnest, Israel, then return to me; or, if thou, Israel, returnest to me, then shalt thou return, sc. into thy fatherland; and if thou puttest away thine abominations from before mine eyes, then shalt thou no longer wander; and if thou swearest...then will they bless themselves. But by reason of its position after &#1504;&#1488;&#1501; &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; it is impossible to connect &#1488;&#1500;&#1497; with the protasis. It would be more natural to take &#1488;&#1500;&#1497; &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489; as apodosis, the &#1488;&#1500;&#1497; being put first for the sake of emphasis. But if we take it as apodosis at all, the apodosis of the second half of the verse does not rightly correspond to that of the first half. &#1500;&#1488; &#1514;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491; would need to be translated, "then shalt thou no longer wander without fixed habitation," and so would refer to the condition of the people as exiled. but for this &#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491; is not a suitable expression. Besides, it is difficult to justify the introduction of &#1488;&#1501; before &#1493;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1514;&#1468;, since an apodosis has already preceded. For these reasons we are bound to prefer the view of Ew. and Hitz., that <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-1.htm">Jeremiah 4:1</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-2.htm">Jeremiah 4:2</a> contain nothing but protases. The removal of the abominations from before God's face is the utter extirpation of idolatry, the negative moment of the return to the Lord; and the swearing by the life of Jahveh is added as a positive expression of their acknowledgment of the true God. &#1514;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491; is the wandering of the idolatrous people after this and the other false god, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-23.htm">Jeremiah 2:23</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-13.htm">Jeremiah 3:13</a>. "And strayest not" serves to strengthen "puttest away thine abominations." A sincere return to God demanded not only the destruction of images and the suppression of idol-worship, but also the giving up of all wandering after idols, i.e., seeking or longing after other gods. Similarly, swearing by Jahveh is strengthened by the additions: &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1514;, in truth, not deceptively (&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1512;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-2.htm">Jeremiah 5:2</a>), and with right and uprightness, i.e., in a just cause, and with honest intentions. - The promise, "they shall bless themselves," etc., has in it an allusion to the patriarchal promises in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-18.htm">Genesis 18:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-18.htm">Genesis 22:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/26-4.htm">Genesis 26:4</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/28-14.htm">Genesis 28:14</a>, but it is not, as most commentators, following Jerome, suppose, a direct citation of these, and certainly not "a learned quotation from a book" (Ew.), in which case &#1489;&#1468;&#1493; would be referable, as in those promises, to Israel, the seed of Abraham, and would stand for &#1489;&#1468;&#1498;. This is put out of the question by the parallel &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493; &#1497;&#1514;&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;, which never occurs but with the sense of glorying in God the Lord; cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-16.htm">Isaiah 41:16</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-3.htm">Psalm 34:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/64-11.htm">Psalm 64:11</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/105-3.htm">Psalm 105:3</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-22.htm">Jeremiah 9:22</a>. Hence it follows that &#1489;&#1468;&#1493; must be referred, as Calv. refers it, to &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;, just as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-16.htm">Isaiah 65:16</a> : the nations will bless themselves in or with Jahveh, i.e., will desire and appropriate the blessing of Jahveh and glory in the true God. Even under this acceptation, the only one that can be justified from an exegetical point of view, the words stand in manifest relation to the patriarchal blessing. If the heathen peoples bless themselves in the name of Jahveh, then are they become partakers of the salvation that comes from Jahveh; and if this blessing comes to them as a consequence of the true conversion of Israel to the Lord, as a fruit of this, then it has come to them through Israel as the channel, as the patriarchal blessings declare disertis verbis. Jeremiah does not lay stress upon this intermediate agency of Israel, but leaves it to be indirectly understood from the unmistakeable allusion to the older promise. The reason for the application thus given by Jeremiah to the divine promise made to the patriarchs is found in the aim and scope of the present discourse. The appointment of Israel to be the channel of salvation for the nations is an outcome of the calling grace of God, and the fulfilment of this gracious plan on the part of God is an exercise of the same grace - a grace which Israel by its apostasy does not reject, but helps onwards towards its ordained issue. The return of apostate Israel to its God is indeed necessary ere the destined end be attained; it is not, however, the ground of the blessing of the nations, but only one means towards the consummation of the divine plan of redemption, a plan which embraces all mankind. Israel's apostasy delayed this consummation; the conversion of Israel will have for its issue the blessing of the nations. </body></html>
