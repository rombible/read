Blaney, who considers the clause as being principally intended to assure them “that upon their conversion they should be accepted and received again into the bosom of God’s church, from which they had before apostatized,” translates it very literally, thus, “If thou wilt turn again, O Israel, saith Jehovah, unto me shalt thou return.” <span class="ital">And if thou wilt put away thine abominations </span>— Thine evil practices, and especially thine idolatries, as the word <span class="greekheb">שׁקצים</span>commonly signifies: <span class="ital">out of my sight </span>— Hebrew, <span class="greekheb">מפני</span>, <span class="ital">from before me: </span>though God’s eye be everywhere, and therefore, as is implied, idols are nowhere to be admitted, either in public or private, yet the expression particularly relates to the place of his more immediate presence, as their land and the place of his solemn worship. <span class="ital">Then shalt thou not remove </span>— Thou shalt be restored to thine ancient inheritance, and shalt be established in the peaceable possession of it. As if he had said, <span class="ital">If thou wilt remove thy idols, thou shalt not be removed. </span>The Hebrew, <span class="greekheb">ולא הנוב</span>, may be properly rendered, <span class="ital">Then thou shalt not wander, </span>that is, be an unsettled, fugitive, and vagabond people. “In the former part,” says Houbigant, “the conversion of their morals is spoken of; in the latter, the stability of their republic.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:1,2 The first two verses should be read with the last chapter.

The clause, "and not wander," seems too short; the Septuagint had a choicer reading, "and put away, etc., from his [thy] mouth, and not wander from before me." It is the close of the prophecy which we have here. The prophet subjoins a promise which he has heard from Jehovah. True, it does not appeal to Israel's self-love (as <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-18.htm">Isaiah 48:18, 19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/81-13.htm">Psalm 81:13-16</a>), but to a nobler feeling of responsibility for the world's welfare. Israel has been entrusted with a mission, and on the due performance of this mission hangs the weal or woe of humanity. Hence Jehovah's longing for Israel's repentance. If Israel will but "return," and obey God's commandments, all nations will be attracted to the true religion. The form of expression used for the latter statement is borrowed probably from <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-18.htm">Genesis 22:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/26-4.htm">Genesis 26:4</a> (it is less closely parallel with <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-18.htm">Genesis 18:18</a>). To "bless <span class="accented">by"</span> any one is to use his name in the benediction formula. Seeing Israel so blessed through his allegiance to Jehovah, all nations shall wish themselves a similar blessing (the reverse of the process in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-22.htm">Jeremiah 29:22</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-16.htm">Isaiah 65:16</a>).
