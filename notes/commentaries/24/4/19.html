And “the calamities described are presented to the mind in such lively colours, the images are so crowded, and arranged with so much art, and the breaks and apostrophes are so animated, that we seem to be involved in the same scene of misery with the prophet.” — Bishop Lowth’s 9th and 17th Prelec. <span class="ital">I cannot hold my peace </span>— I am so troubled I cannot forbear my complaints. <span class="ital">Because thou hast heard, O my soul, </span>&c. — I have heard in the spirit of prophecy; the calamity will as certainly come as if I now heard the trumpet sounding. <span class="ital">Destruction upon destruction </span>— Dr. Waterland reads, <span class="ital">Breach upon breach, </span>or, <span class="ital">destruction dashes upon destruction; </span>one sad calamity, like Job’s messengers, treading upon the heels of another. First, good Josiah is slain in battle; within three months after, his son and successor, Jehoahaz, is deposed by the king of Egypt; within two or three years after, Nebuchadnezzar besieged Jerusalem and took it, and from thence forward was continually making descents on the land of Judah with his armies, during the reigns of Jehoiakim, Jeconiah, and Zedekiah, till, about nineteen years after, he completed their ruin by the destruction of Jerusalem. <span class="ital">For the whole land is spoiled </span>— This is more particularly described <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/4-23.htm" title="I beheld the earth, and, see, it was without form, and void; and the heavens, and they had no light....">Jeremiah 4:23-26</a>. <span class="ital">Suddenly are my tents spoiled </span>— The enemy makes no more of overthrowing my stately cities than if he were overturning tents made of curtains.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:19-31 The prophet had no pleasure in delivering messages of wrath.

Every end of our comforts is not a full end. Though the Lord may correct his people very severely, yet he will not cast them off. Ornaments and false colouring would be of no avail. No outward privileges or profession, no contrivances would prevent destruction. How wretched the state of those who are like foolish children in the concerns of their souls!

These are either the words of the people, unto whose heart the calamity reached, as in the preceding verse; or rather of the prophet, who either, from a sympathizing heart, expresses himself in this manner; or puts on an appearance of mourning and distress, in order to awaken his people to a sense of their condition. The repetition of the word is after the manner of persons in pain and uneasiness, as, "my head, my head", <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-19.htm">2 Kings 4:19</a>, <p>I am pained at my very heart; as a woman in labour. In the Hebrew text it is, "as the walls of my heart" (e); meaning either his bowels, as before; or the "praecordia", the parts about the heart, which are as walls unto it; his grief had reached these walls, and was penetrating through them to his heart, and there was danger of breaking that: <p>my heart makes a noise in me; palpitates, beats and throbs, being filled with fears and dread, with sorrow and concern, at what was coming on; it represents an aching heart, all in disorder and confusion: <p>I cannot hold my peace; or be silent; must speak, and vent grief: <p>because thou hast heard, O my soul, the sound of the trumpet, the alarm of war; Kimchi observes, he does not say "my ears", but "my soul"; for as yet he had not heard with his ears the sound of the trumpet; for the enemy was not yet come, but his soul heard by prophecy: here is a Keri and a Cetib, a reading and a writing; it is written  "I have heard"; it is read  "thou hast heard", which is followed by the Targum: the sense is the same, it is the hearing of the soul. The prophet, by these expressions, represents the destruction as very near, very certain, and very distressing. The trumpet was sounded on different accounts, as Isidore (f) observes; sometimes to begin a battle; sometimes to pursue those that fled; and sometimes for a retreat. <p>(e)  "parietes cordis mei", Pagninus, Montanus, Cocceius.

It is doubted whether the speaker in vers. 19-21 is the prophet or the whole nation. Ver. 19 reminds us of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/15-5.htm">Isaiah 15:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-11.htm">Isaiah 16:11</a> and Isaiah 21:3, 4, and would be quite in harmony with the elegiac tone of our prophet elsewhere; the Targum too already regards the passage as an exclamation of the prophet. On the other hand, the phrase "my tents" (ver. 20) certainly implies that the people, or the pious section of the people, is the speaker. Both views may perhaps be united. The prophet may be the speaker in ver. 19, but simply (as is the case with so many of the psalmists) as the representative of his fellow-believers, whom in ver. 20 he brings on the stage more directly. Ver. 19 is best rendered as a series of exclamations - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"My bowels! my bowels! I must writhe in pain!<br />The walls of my heart! My heart moaneth unto me!<br />I cannot hold my peace!<br />For thou hast heard, O my soul, the sound of the trumpet,<br />The alarm of war!"</span> Observe, the "soul" hears; the "heart" is pained. So generally the one is more active, the other more passive. The Hebrew margin gives, for "I must writhe," "I must wait" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/7-7.htm">Micah 7:7</a>); but this rendering does not suit the context. <span class="cmt_word">The walls of my heart</span>.

Thy way and thy doings have wrought thee this. This is thy wickedness; yea, it is bitter, yea, it reaCheth unto thine heart."<p>A more minute account of the impending judgment is introduced by the phrase: at that time. It shall be said to this people; in other words, it shall be said of this people; substantially, that shall fall upon it which is expressed by the figure following, a hot wind blowing from the naked hills of the wilderness. &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; is stat. constr., and &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1497;&#1501; dna  its genitive, after which latter the adjective &#1510;&#1495; should be placed; but it is interpolated between the nomen regens and the n. rectum by reason of its smallness, and partly, too, that it may not be too far separated from its nomen, while &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1491;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; belongs to &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1497;&#1501;. The wind blowing from the bleak hills in the wilderness, is the very severe east wind of Palestine. It blows in incessant gusts, and cannot be used for winnowing or cleansing the grain, since it would blow away chaff and seed together; cf. Wetzst. in Del., Job, S. 320. &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498; is universally taken adverbially: is on the way, i.e., comes, moves in the direction of the daughter of Zion. The daughter of Zion is a personification of the inhabitants of Zion or Jerusalem. This hot blast is a figure for the destruction which is drawing near Jerusalem. It is not a chastisement to purify the people, but a judgment which will sweep away the whole people, carry away both wheat and chaff - a most effective figure for the approaching catastrophe of the destruction of Jerusalem, and the carrying away captive of its inhabitants. Hitz. and Graf have, however, taken &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498; as subject of the clause: the path, i.e., the behaviour of my people, is a keen wind of the bare hills in the wilderness. Thus the conduct of the people would be compared with that wind as unprofitable, inasmuch as it was altogether windy, empty, and further as being a hurtful storm. But the comparison of the people's behaviour with a parched violent wind is a wholly unnatural one, for the justification of which it is not sufficient to point to <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/8-7.htm">Hosea 8:7</a> : sow wind and reap storm. Besides, upon this construction of the illustration, the description: not to winnow and not to cleanse, is not only unmeaning, but wholly unsuitable. Who is to be winnowed and cleansed by the windy ways of the people? Jahveh?! <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-14.htm">Jeremiah 4:14</a> is indeed so managed by Hitz. and Graf that the tempestuous wind blows against God, "is directed against Jahveh like a blast of defiance and hostility." But this argument is sufficient to overthrow that unnatural view of the figure, which, besides, obtains no support from <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-12.htm">Jeremiah 4:12</a>. &#1502;&#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; cannot refer to &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1470;&#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;: a full wind from these, i.e., the sons of my people; and &#1497;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488;  &#1500;&#1497;, in spite of the passages, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-23.htm">Jeremiah 22:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-26.htm">Jeremiah 50:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-48.htm">Jeremiah 51:48</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/3-25.htm">Job 3:25</a>, does not mean: comes towards me, or: blows from them on me; for in all these passages &#1500;&#1497; is dativ commodi or incommodi. Here, too, &#1500;&#1497; is dative, used of the originator and efficient cause. The wind comes for me - in plainer English: from me. Properly: it comes to God, i.e., at His signal, to carry out His will. &#1502;&#1500;&#1488; &#1502;&#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; is comparative: fuller than these, namely, the winds useful for winnowing and cleansing. Now will I too utter. The intensifying &#1490;&#1468;&#1501; does not point to a contrast in the immediately preceding clause: because the people blows against God like a strong wind, He too will utter judgment against it. The &#1490;&#1468;&#1501; refers back to the preceding &#1500;&#1497;: the storm comes from me; for now will I on my side hold judgment with them. The contrast implied in &#1490;&#1468;&#1501; lies in the wider context, in the formerly described behaviour of the people, particularly in the sayings of the false prophets mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-10.htm">Jeremiah 4:10</a>, that there will be peace. On &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;&#1497;&#1501;, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-16.htm">Jeremiah 1:16</a>.<p>These judgments are already on the way in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-13.htm">Jeremiah 4:13</a>. "Like clouds it draws near." The subject is not mentioned, but a hostile army is meant, about to execute God's judgments. "Like clouds," i.e., in such thick dark masses; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-16.htm">Ezekiel 38:16</a>. The war-chariots drive with the speed of the tempest; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-28.htm">Isaiah 5:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-15.htm">Isaiah 66:15</a>. The running of the horses resembles the flight of the eagle; cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-8.htm">Habakkuk 1:8</a>, where the same is said of the horsemen of the hostile people.
