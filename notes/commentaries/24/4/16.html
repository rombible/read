The prophet was afflicted to see the people lulled into security by false prophets. The approach of the enemy is described. Some attention was paid in Jerusalem to outward reformation; but it was necessary that their hearts should be washed, in the exercise of true repentance and faith, from the love and pollution of sin. When lesser calamities do not rouse sinners and reform nations, sentence will be given against them. The Lord's voice declares that misery is approaching, especially against wicked professors of the gospel; when it overtakes them, it will be plainly seen that the fruit of wickedness is bitter, and the end is fatal.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Proclaim ye to the pagan, "Behold!"

This, according to Kimchi, is the sum and substance of the voice from Dan. It seems to be a summons to the nations to gather together to join the king of Babylon in his enterprise against Jerusalem; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-2.htm">2 Kings 24:2</a>, <p>publish against Jerusalem; what follows: <p>that watchers come from afar country; from Babylon, which is said to be a far country, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/39-3.htm">Isaiah 39:3</a>, these are the soldiers of the king of Babylon; they are called Notzerim; which word agrees with the latter part of Nebuchadnezzar's name; to which some (b) think there is some reference, showing that his army is meant. It should be rendered "besiegers", as it is by some (c); for these were not Nebuchadnezzar's bodyguard, but his whole army, who were come up to besiege Jerusalem; and they are compared to watchers and keepers of a field in the next verse, where another word is used. The Targum is, <p>"the army of a rapacious people, like the grape gatherers, come from a far country:'' <p>and give out their voice against the cities of Judah; threaten the ruin of them; blow the trumpet, the alarm of war; give the orders to besiege; and, being sure of victory, triumph before the attack is made. <p>(b) R.

This verse is to be taken as a sign addressed to God by Jeremiah when he heard the announcement of the judgment about to fall on Judah, contained in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-5.htm">Jeremiah 4:5-9</a>. The Chald. has well paraphrased &#1493;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; thus: et dixi: suscipe deprecationem meam, Jahveh, Deus. but Hensler and Ew. wish to have &#1493;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; changed to &#1493;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;, "so that they say," quite unnecessarily, and indeed unsuitably, since &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1488;&#1514;, thou hast deceived, is out of place either in the mouth of the people or of the lying prophets. That the word quoted, "Peace shall be to you," is the saying of the false prophets, may be gathered from the context, and this is directly supported by <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-13.htm">Jeremiah 14:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-17.htm">Jeremiah 23:17</a>. The deception of the people by such discourse from the false prophets is referred back to God: "Lord, Thou hast deceived," inasmuch as God not only permits these lying spirits to appear and work, but has ordained them and brought them forth for the hardening of the people's heart; as He once caused the spirit of prophecy to inspire as a lying spirit the prophets of Ahab, so that by promises of victory they prevailed upon him to march to that war in which, as a punishment for his godlessness, he was to perish; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-20.htm">1 Kings 22:20-23</a>. Umbr. takes the words less correctly as spoken in the name of the people, to whom the unexpected turn affairs had now taken seemed a deception on the part of God; and this, although it was by itself it had been deceived, through its revolt from God. For it is not the people's opinion that Jeremiah expresses, but a truth concerning which his wish is that the people may learn to recognise it, and so come to reflect and repent before it be too late.

As to the fact, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-18.htm">Jeremiah 5:18</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-2.htm">Psalm 69:2</a>.</body></html>
