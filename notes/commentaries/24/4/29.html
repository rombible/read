He is shown in a vision the whole land in confusion. Compared with what it was, every thing is out of order; but the ruin of the Jewish nation would not be final. Every end of our comforts is not a full end. Though the Lord may correct his people very severely, yet he will not cast them off. Ornaments and false colouring would be of no avail. No outward privileges or profession, no contrivances would prevent destruction. How wretched the state of those who are like foolish children in the concerns of their souls! Whatever we are ignorant of, may the Lord make of good understanding in the ways of godliness.

The former is in Hebrew properly <span class="ital">dark clouds</span>, though the root in Aramaic would yield the sense “thickets.” So “rocks” seems a “loanword” from Aramaic and occurs but once elsewhere (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-6.htm" title="To dwell in the cliffs of the valleys, in caves of the earth, and in the rocks.">Job 30:6</a>). For the first word LXX have a double rendering, <span class="ital">caves</span> and <span class="ital">woods</span>. For the former sense they seem to have connected the word with an Arabic root, <span class="ital">to conceal</span>. Rocks, and the caves which they contained, were often used as places of refuge in the course of Jewish history. See ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-16.htm" title="Behold, I will send for many fishers, said the LORD, and they shall fish them; and after will I send for many hunters, and they shall hunt them from every mountain, and from every hill, and out of the holes of the rocks.">Jeremiah 16:16</a>; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-2.htm" title="And the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel: and because of the Midianites the children of Israel made them the dens which are in the mountains, and caves, and strong holds.">Jdg 6:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-6.htm" title="When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait, (for the people were distressed,) then the people did hide themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in high places, and in pits.">1 Samuel 13:6</a>; cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-19.htm" title="And they shall go into the holes of the rocks, and into the caves of the earth, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of his majesty, when he rises to shake terribly the earth.">Isaiah 2:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-21.htm" title="To go into the clefts of the rocks, and into the tops of the ragged rocks, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of his majesty, when he rises to shake terribly the earth.">Isaiah 2:21</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">29–31</span>.

The reading of which this is a version can hardly be the right one; for "the whole city" can only be Jerusalem, and in ver. 6 the people outside are bidden to take refuge in the capital. Hence Ewald, Hitzig, and Payne Smith (after Septuagint, Targum) would slightly amend the word rendered "city," so as to translate "the whole land" (of Judah). <span class="cmt_word">Shall flee</span>; <span class="accented">literally</span>, <span class="accented">fleeth</span>. So afterwards render, "have gone.... is forsaken," "dwelleth." It is a vivid dramatic representation of the effects of the invasion. <span class="cmt_word">Bowmen</span>. It is singular that Herodotus should say nothing about the use of the bow by the Chaldeans. But the monuments give ample evidence that they were a people of archers.

Ew. translates loosely: wound upon wound meet one another. For the word does not mean wound, but the fracture of a limb; and it seems inadmissible to follow the Chald. and Syr. in taking &#1504;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488; here in the sense of &#1504;&#1511;&#1512;&#1492; , since the sig. "meet" does not suit &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1512;. The thought is this: tidings are brought of one catastrophe after another, for the devastation extends itself over the whole land and comes suddenly upon the tents, i.e., dwellings of those who are lamenting. Covers, curtains of the tent, is used as synonymous with tents; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-20.htm">Jeremiah 10:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-2.htm">Isaiah 54:2</a>. How long shall I see the standard, etc.! is the cry of despair, seeing no prospect of the end to the horrors of the war. The standard and the sound of the trumpet are, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-5.htm">Jeremiah 4:5</a>, the alarm-signals on the approach of the enemy.<p>There is no prospect of an end to the horrors, for (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-22.htm">Jeremiah 4:22</a>) the people is so foolish that it understands only how to do the evil, but not the good; cf. for this <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-21.htm">Jeremiah 5:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-3.htm">Isaiah 1:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/7-3.htm">Micah 7:3</a>. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-21.htm">Jeremiah 4:21</a> gives God's answer to the woful query, how long the ravaging of the land by war is to last. The answer is: as long as the people persists in the folly of its rebellion against God, so long will chastising judgments continue. To bring this answer of God home to the people's heart, the prophet, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-23.htm">Jeremiah 4:23-26</a>, tells what he has seen in the spirit. He has seen (&#1512;&#1488;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497;, perf. proph.) bursting over Judah a visitation which convulses the whole world. The earth seemed waste and void as at the beginning of creation, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a>, before the separation of the elements and before the creation of organic and living beings. In heaven no light was to be seen, earth and heaven seemed to have been thrown back into a condition of chaos. The mountains and hills, these firm foundations of the earth, quivered and swayed (&#1492;&#1514;&#1511;&#1500;&#1511;&#1500;, be put into a light motion, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/1-5.htm">Nahum 1:5</a>); men had fled and hidden themselves from the wrath of God (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-19.htm">Isaiah 2:19</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-21.htm">Isaiah 2:21</a>), and all the birds had flown out of sight in terror at the dreadful tokens of the beginning catastrophe (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-9.htm">Genesis 9:9</a>). The fruitful field was the wilderness - not a wilderness, but "changed into the wilderness with all its attributes" (Hitz.). &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1502;&#1500; is not appell. as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-7.htm">Jeremiah 2:7</a>, but nom. prop. of the lower slopes of Carmel, famed for their fruitfulness; these being taken as representatives of all the fruitful districts of the land. The cities of the Carmel, or of the fruitful-field, are manifestly not to be identified with the store cities of <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-19.htm">1 Kings 9:19</a>, as Hitz. supposes, but the cities in the most fertile districts of the country, which, by reason of their situation, were in a prosperous condition, but now are destroyed. "Before the heat of His anger," which is kindled against the foolish and godless race; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/1-6.htm">Nahum 1:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-13.htm">Isaiah 13:13</a>.</body></html>
