He is shown in a vision the whole land in confusion. Compared with what it was, every thing is out of order; but the ruin of the Jewish nation would not be final. Every end of our comforts is not a full end. Though the Lord may correct his people very severely, yet he will not cast them off. Ornaments and false colouring would be of no avail. No outward privileges or profession, no contrivances would prevent destruction. How wretched the state of those who are like foolish children in the concerns of their souls! Whatever we are ignorant of, may the Lord make of good understanding in the ways of godliness.

What follows is an explanation and confirmation of the above vision the prophet had: <p>the whole land shall be desolate; as he had seen; it should not be manured, ploughed, and sown, or bring forth fruit; and should be without inhabitants, at least have very few: <p>yet I will not make a full end; there should be some inhabitants, who, with those that should hereafter return from captivity, would repeople it, rebuild the temple, and restore it to its pristine form and order, both as to things natural, civil, and ecclesiastical; but though a full end of them, as a church and people, was not to be made now by the Chaldeans, yet it would be; as it has been done by the Romans, in the times of Vespasian and Hadrian. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For thus hath the LORD said, The whole land shall be desolate; yet will I <span class="cverse3">{u}</span> not make a full end.</span><p>(u) But for his mercies sake, he will reserve himself a residue to be his Church, and to praise him in earth, Jer 5:18.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/4.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">27</span>. <span class="ital">yet will I not make a full end</span>] This clause is probably added by a later hand (so perhaps in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-10.htm" title="Go you up on her walls, and destroy; but make not a full end: take away her battlements; for they are not the LORD's.">Jeremiah 5:10</a>), for not only does it interrupt the metre in the original, but it also breaks the connexion between the pronouncements of <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/4-27.htm" title="For thus has the LORD said, The whole land shall be desolate; yet will I not make a full end....">Jeremiah 4:27-28</a></span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - The vision breaks off, and the prophet emphasizes its truthfulness by the announcement of the Divine decree. "Desolation, and yet not a full end," is its burden. This is the same doctrine of the" remnant" which formed so important a part of the prophetic message of Isaiah and his contemporaries. However severe the punishment of Judah may be, there will be a "remnant" which shall escape, and become the seed of a holier nation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/9-8.htm">Amos 9:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/4-2.htm">Isaiah 4:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-13.htm">Isaiah 6:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-20.htm">Isaiah 10:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-11.htm">Isaiah 11:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/6-1.htm">Hosea 6:1, 2</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>One destruction after another is heralded (on &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1512;, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-6.htm">Jeremiah 4:6</a>). Ew. translates loosely: wound upon wound meet one another. For the word does not mean wound, but the fracture of a limb; and it seems inadmissible to follow the Chald. and Syr. in taking &#1504;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488; here in the sense of &#1504;&#1511;&#1512;&#1492; , since the sig. "meet" does not suit &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1512;. The thought is this: tidings are brought of one catastrophe after another, for the devastation extends itself over the whole land and comes suddenly upon the tents, i.e., dwellings of those who are lamenting. Covers, curtains of the tent, is used as synonymous with tents; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-20.htm">Jeremiah 10:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-2.htm">Isaiah 54:2</a>. How long shall I see the standard, etc.! is the cry of despair, seeing no prospect of the end to the horrors of the war. The standard and the sound of the trumpet are, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-5.htm">Jeremiah 4:5</a>, the alarm-signals on the approach of the enemy.<p>There is no prospect of an end to the horrors, for (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-22.htm">Jeremiah 4:22</a>) the people is so foolish that it understands only how to do the evil, but not the good; cf. for this <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-21.htm">Jeremiah 5:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-3.htm">Isaiah 1:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/7-3.htm">Micah 7:3</a>. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-21.htm">Jeremiah 4:21</a> gives God's answer to the woful query, how long the ravaging of the land by war is to last. The answer is: as long as the people persists in the folly of its rebellion against God, so long will chastising judgments continue. To bring this answer of God home to the people's heart, the prophet, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-23.htm">Jeremiah 4:23-26</a>, tells what he has seen in the spirit. He has seen (&#1512;&#1488;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497;, perf. proph.) bursting over Judah a visitation which convulses the whole world. The earth seemed waste and void as at the beginning of creation, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a>, before the separation of the elements and before the creation of organic and living beings. In heaven no light was to be seen, earth and heaven seemed to have been thrown back into a condition of chaos. The mountains and hills, these firm foundations of the earth, quivered and swayed (&#1492;&#1514;&#1511;&#1500;&#1511;&#1500;, be put into a light motion, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/1-5.htm">Nahum 1:5</a>); men had fled and hidden themselves from the wrath of God (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-19.htm">Isaiah 2:19</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-21.htm">Isaiah 2:21</a>), and all the birds had flown out of sight in terror at the dreadful tokens of the beginning catastrophe (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-9.htm">Genesis 9:9</a>). The fruitful field was the wilderness - not a wilderness, but "changed into the wilderness with all its attributes" (Hitz.). &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1502;&#1500; is not appell. as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-7.htm">Jeremiah 2:7</a>, but nom. prop. of the lower slopes of Carmel, famed for their fruitfulness; these being taken as representatives of all the fruitful districts of the land. The cities of the Carmel, or of the fruitful-field, are manifestly not to be identified with the store cities of <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-19.htm">1 Kings 9:19</a>, as Hitz. supposes, but the cities in the most fertile districts of the country, which, by reason of their situation, were in a prosperous condition, but now are destroyed. "Before the heat of His anger," which is kindled against the foolish and godless race; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/1-6.htm">Nahum 1:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-13.htm">Isaiah 13:13</a>.</body></html>
