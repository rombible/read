The prophet was afflicted to see the people lulled into security by false prophets. The approach of the enemy is described. Some attention was paid in Jerusalem to outward reformation; but it was necessary that their hearts should be washed, in the exercise of true repentance and faith, from the love and pollution of sin. When lesser calamities do not rouse sinners and reform nations, sentence will be given against them. The Lord's voice declares that misery is approaching, especially against wicked professors of the gospel; when it overtakes them, it will be plainly seen that the fruit of wickedness is bitter, and the end is fatal.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Is not turned ... - As long as their sins are unrepented of, so long must their punishment continue. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. heart&#8212;The wisdom of the most leading men will be utterly at a loss to devise means of relief.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The heart of the king shall perish; </span> the king, viz. of Judah, and the great men, that should have encouraged the people in such a calamitous day, and been their great support, shall not only be afraid, but their own hearts shall melt within them, they shall be even at their wits’ end; see <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/5-1.htm" title="And it came to pass, when all the kings of the Amorites, which were on the side of Jordan westward, and all the kings of the Canaanites, which were by the sea, heard that the LORD had dried up the waters of Jordan from before the children of Israel, until we were passed over, that their heart melted, neither was there spirit in them any more, because of the children of Israel.">Joshua 5:1</a></span>; they shall have no heart at all to do any thing; they shall not be able to help their people, either by their counsel or arms; their courage will utterly fail, and their counsel perish.

The same verb in Ethiopic means "to be mad." The "heart" in Old Testament language is the center of the intellectual as well as of the moral life (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-11.htm">Hosea 4:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-24.htm">Job 12:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-28.htm">Proverbs 15:28</a>).

Already the prophet sees in spirit the judgment bursting in upon Judah from the north, to the dismay of all who were accounting themselves secure (<a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-5.htm">Jeremiah 4:5-10</a>). Like a hot tempest-blast it rushes on, because of the wickedness of Jerusalem (<a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-11.htm">Jeremiah 4:11-18</a>), bringing desolation and ruin on the besotted people, devastating the whole land, and not to be turned aside by any meretricious devices (<a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-19.htm">Jeremiah 4:19-31</a>).<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-3.htm">Jeremiah 4:3-4</a><p>"For thus hath Jahveh spoken to the men of Judah and to Jerusalem: Break up for yourselves new ground, and sow not among thorns. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-4.htm">Jeremiah 4:4</a>. Circumcise yourselves to Jahveh, and take away the foreskins of your heart, men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem, lest my fury break forth like fire and burn unquenchably, because of the evil of your doings." The exhortation to a reformation of life is attached by &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, as being the ground of it, to the preceding exhortation to return. The &#1488;&#1501; &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-1.htm">Jeremiah 4:1</a>, contained the indirect call to repent. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-1.htm">Jeremiah 4:1</a> this was addressed to Israel. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-3.htm">Jeremiah 4:3</a> the call comes to Judah, which the prophet had already in his eye in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3.htm">Jeremiah 3</a>; cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-7.htm">Jeremiah 3:7-8</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-10.htm">Jeremiah 3:10-11</a>. The transition from Israel to Judah in the phrase: for thus saith Jahveh, is explained by the introduction of a connecting thought, which can without difficulty be supplied from the last clause of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-2.htm">Jeremiah 4:2</a>; the promise that the nations bless themselves in Jahveh will come to be fulfilled. The thought to be supplied is: this conversion is indispensable for Judah also, for Judah too must begin a new life. Without conversion there is no salvation. The evil of their doings brings nought but heavy judgments with it. &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, as often, in collective sense, since the plural of this word was little in use, see in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/9-6.htm">Joshua 9:6</a>. &#1504;&#1497;&#1512; &#1500;&#1493; &#1504;&#1497;&#1512;, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/10-12.htm">Hosea 10:12</a>, plough up new land, to bring new untilled soil under cultivation - a figure for the reformation of life; as much as to say, to prepare new ground for living on, to begin a new life. Sow not among thorns. The seed-corns are the good resolutions which, when they have sunk into the soil of the mind, should spring up into deeds (Hitz.). The thorns which choke the good seed as it grows (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-7.htm">Matthew 13:7</a>) are not mala vestra studia (Ros.), but the evil inclinations of the unrenewed heart, which thrive luxuriantly like thorns. "Circumcise you to the Lord" is explained by the next clause: remove the foreskins of your heart. The stress lies in &#1500;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;; in this is implied that the circumcision should not be in the flesh merely. In the flesh all Jews were circumcised. If they then are called to circumcise themselves to the Lord, this must be meant spiritually, of the putting away of the spiritual impurity of the heart, i.e., of all that hinders the sanctifying of the heart; see in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-16.htm">Deuteronomy 10:16</a>. The plur. &#1506;&#1512;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514; is explained by the figurative use of the word, and the reading &#1506;&#1512;&#1500;&#1514;, presented by some codd., is a correction from <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-16.htm">Deuteronomy 10:16</a>. The foreskins are the evil lusts and longings of the heart. Lest my fury break forth like fire; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-20.htm">Jeremiah 7:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-6.htm">Amos 5:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-47.htm">Psalm 89:47</a>. '&#1502;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1512;&#1506; &#1502; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-20.htm">Deuteronomy 28:20</a>. This judgment of wrath the prophet already in spirit sees breaking on Judah.</body></html>
