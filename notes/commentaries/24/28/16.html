In part, perhaps, the threat may have tended to work out its own fulfilment through the gnawing consciousness of shame and confusion in the detection of the false prophet’s assumptions. He knew that the Lord had not sent him. Seven months passed, and then the stroke fell. It is one of the instances of the prophet’s work, as “rooting out” and “pulling down” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-10.htm" title="See, I have this day set you over the nations and over the kingdoms, to root out, and to pull down, and to destroy, and to throw down, to build, and to plant.">Jeremiah 1:10</a>), and has its parallels in the punishment of Ananias, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/5-4.htm" title="Whiles it remained, was it not your own? and after it was sold, was it not in your own power? why have you conceived this thing in your heart? you have not lied to men, but to God.">Acts 5:4-5</a>, and of Elymas, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-11.htm" title="And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is on you, and you shall be blind, not seeing the sun for a season.

Those have much to answer for, who tell sinners that they shall have peace, though they harden their hearts in contempt of God's word. The servant of God must be gentle to all men. He must give up even his right, and leave the Lord to plead his cause.

To "speak turning aside (or, 'rebellion')" is a phrase of Deuteronomy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/13-6.htm">Deuteronomy 13:6</a>), where it is used, as here, of opposition, not to Jehovah, but to revealed truth. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/28.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Had Hananiah been sent by the Lord, he might have been satisfied with Jeremiah's opinion, and have contentedly awaited the issue. But instead of this, he seeks by means of violence to secure credence for his prophesying. He takes the yoke from off the neck of the prophet, and breaks it in pieces, as he repeats before the people his former prediction: "Thus hath Jahveh said: Even so will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from the neck of all nations within two years." - Thereupon Jeremiah went his way without answering a word, calmly entrusting to the Lord the vindication of the truth of His own word. </body></html>
