But they may read their sin in their punishment. If men will inquire wherefore the Lord doeth hard things unto them, let them think of their sins. The restless waves obeyed the Divine decree, that they should not pass the sandy shores, which were as much a restraint as lofty mountains; but they burst all restraints of God's law, and were wholly gone into wickedness. Neither did they consider their interest. While the Lord, year after year, reserves to us the appointed weeks of harvest, men live on his bounty; yet they transgress against him. Sin deprives us of God's blessings; it makes the heaven as brass, and the earth as iron. Certainly the things of this world are not the best things; and we are not to think, that, because evil men prosper, God allows their practices. Though sentence against evil works is not executed speedily, it will be executed. Shall I not visit for these things? This speaks the certainty and the necessity of God's judgments. Let those who walk in bad ways consider that an end will come, and there will be bitterness in the latter end.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Against the God<p>(1) of Creation <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-22.htm">Jeremiah 5:22</a>, and<p>(2) of Providence <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-24.htm">Jeremiah 5:24</a>,<p>They sin, not merely by apostasy, but by a general immorality extending to all classes <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-25.htm">Jeremiah 5:25-28</a>.

That a mighty nation should come and destroy them, and they should be servants in a strange land; or rather the words seem to be an order to declare war against the Jews, and even in their own land; and do not seem to be addressed to the prophet, but to others, seeing the words are in the plural number; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-5.htm">Jeremiah 4:5</a>, <p>and publish it in Judah: the house of Jacob and Judah are the same, namely, the two tribes of Benjamin and Judah; for, as for the ten tribes, as observed on <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-15.htm">Jeremiah 5:15</a>, they had been carried captive before this time: <p>saying: as follows: <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Declare this in the house of Jacob, and publish it in Judah, saying,</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/5.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">20–22</span>. These <span class="ital">vv</span>. are in whole or in part rejected as a later addition by Stade, Du., Co., Gi., because (i) “declare” and “publish” are in the plural, which is unusual (but see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-16.htm" title="Make you mention to the nations; behold, publish against Jerusalem, that watchers come from a far country, and give out their voice against the cities of Judah.">Jeremiah 4:16</a>); (ii) the illustration of Jehovah’s greatness by the phenomena of nature belongs to the later period, cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/38-8.htm" title="Or who shut up the sea with doors, when it broke forth, as if it had issued out of the womb?...">Job 38:8-11</a> (but see <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/4-13.htm" title="For, see, he that forms the mountains, and creates the wind, and declares to man what is his thought, that makes the morning darkness, and treads on the high places of the earth, The LORD, The God of hosts, is his name.">Amos 4:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-8.htm" title="Seek him that makes the seven stars and Orion, and turns the shadow of death into the morning, and makes the day dark with night: that calls for the waters of the sea, and pours them out on the face of the earth: The LORD is his name:">Amos 5:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/9-6.htm" title="It is he that builds his stories in the heaven, and has founded his troop in the earth; he that calls for the waters of the sea, and pours them out on the face of the earth: The LORD is his name.">Amos 9:6</a>); (iii) they resemble the suspicious passages <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-35.htm" title="Thus said the LORD, which gives the sun for a light by day, and the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night, which divides the sea when the waves thereof roar; The LORD of hosts is his name:">Jeremiah 31:35</a> ff., <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-17.htm" title="Ah Lord GOD! behold, you have made the heaven and the earth by your great power and stretched out arm, and there is nothing too hard for you:">Jeremiah 32:17</a> ff.; (iv) there is a needless embellishment of style. These reasons, however, seem insufficient to warrant the rejection of the whole. Moreover (unless we accept Du.’s view, see note on <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-18.htm" title="Nevertheless in those days, said the LORD, I will not make a full end with you.">Jeremiah 5:18</a></span>), to omit them, and thus join <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-23.htm" title="But this people has a revolting and a rebellious heart; they are revolted and gone.">Jeremiah 5:23</a></span> immediately to <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-19.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, when you shall say, Why does the LORD our God all these things to us? then shall you answer them, Like as you have forsaken me, and served strange gods in your land, so shall you serve strangers in a land that is not yours.">Jeremiah 5:19</a></span>, involves injury to the sequence of thought. This is obviated by the retention of the first part of <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-21.htm" title="Hear now this, O foolish people, and without understanding; which have eyes, and see not; which have ears, and hear not:">Jeremiah 5:21</a></span>, and of <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-22.htm" title="Fear you not me? said the LORD: will you not tremble at my presence, which have placed the sand for the bound of the sea by a perpetual decree, that it cannot pass it: and though the waves thereof toss themselves, yet can they not prevail; though they roar, yet can they not pass over it?">Jeremiah 5:22</a></span> to “my presence.” So Co. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-20.htm" title="Declare this in the house of Jacob, and publish it in Judah, saying,">Jeremiah 5:20</a> is in any case probably an addition, as there is no parallel in Jeremiah for this kind of introduction to an utterance.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">20–29</span>.

Because it, despising the threatening of punishment, says: Misfortune shall not light upon us, the Lord will make the word in the mouth of Jeremiah a fire, and the people wood, that the fire may consume it. On this figure, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-31.htm">Isaiah 1:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-17.htm">Isaiah 10:17</a>. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-15.htm">Jeremiah 5:15</a>. explain this, and announce the inroad of a dreadful enemy that is to lay waste the land and consume the people. "A people from far," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-16.htm">Jeremiah 4:16</a>. Judah is called "house of Israel," not so much because it is what remains of Israel, but because, after the captivity of the ten tribes, Judah regarded itself as the only true Israel or people of God. Further description of the hostile people is intended to show its formidable power, and to inspire dread. &#1488;&#1497;&#1514;&#1503;, enduring, firm, strong; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-24.htm">Genesis 49:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/6-2.htm">Micah 6:2</a>. &#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501;, dating from eternity, i.e., very ancient, not of recent origin, but become mighty in immemorial antiquity. A people speaking a language unfamiliar to the Jews, to comprehend whom is impossible, i.e., barbarous; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-49.htm">Deuteronomy 28:49</a>. Further (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-16.htm">Jeremiah 5:16</a>), it is a race of very heroes, fully furnished with deadly weapons. J. D. Mich. took objection to the figure, "its quiver is as an open grave;" but his conjecture &#1513;&#1474;&#1508;&#1514;&#1493; put nothing better in place of it. The link of comparison is this: as an open grave is filled with dead men, so the quiver of this enemy is filled with deadly missiles. </body></html>
