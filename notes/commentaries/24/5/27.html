But they may read their sin in their punishment. If men will inquire wherefore the Lord doeth hard things unto them, let them think of their sins. The restless waves obeyed the Divine decree, that they should not pass the sandy shores, which were as much a restraint as lofty mountains; but they burst all restraints of God's law, and were wholly gone into wickedness. Neither did they consider their interest. While the Lord, year after year, reserves to us the appointed weeks of harvest, men live on his bounty; yet they transgress against him. Sin deprives us of God's blessings; it makes the heaven as brass, and the earth as iron. Certainly the things of this world are not the best things; and we are not to think, that, because evil men prosper, God allows their practices. Though sentence against evil works is not executed speedily, it will be executed. Shall I not visit for these things? This speaks the certainty and the necessity of God's judgments. Let those who walk in bad ways consider that an end will come, and there will be bitterness in the latter end.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Deceit - The wealth gained by deceit and fraud.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>27. full of deceit&#8212;full of treasures got by deceit.<p>rich&#8212;(Ps 73:12, 18-20).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">As a cage is full of birds, so are their houses full of deceit, </span> i.e. they fill up their houses with the goods and wealth of those that they deceive and overreach; ill-gotten goods; a metonymy of the efficient; as the fowler carries his cage along with him, wherein he puts the birds which he catcheth, to keep safe that they get not away, when once they are caught, as also by their appearance and singing to entice others. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Therefore they are become great, and waxen rich; </span> showing how and in what manner they got their riches, <span class="ital">therefore</span>, or <span class="ital">by this means</span>; such as are gotten by a lying tongue, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-6.htm" title="The getting of treasures by a lying tongue is a vanity tossed to and fro of them that seek death.">Proverbs 21:6</a></span>, called the <span class="ital">treasures of wickedness</span>, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/6-10.htm" title="Are there yet the treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked, and the scant measure that is abominable?">Micah 6:10</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/5.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>As a cage is full of birds,.... Jarchi and Kimchi understand it of a place in which fowls, are brought up and fattened, what we call a "pen"; and, so the Targum renders it, a house or place of fattening. The word is rendered a "basket" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-1.htm">Amos 8:1</a> and may here design one in which birds taken in snares, or by hawking, were put. The Septuagint version, and those that follow it, render it, "a snare": which agrees with what goes before. It seems to intend a decoy, in which many birds are put to allure others; and, what with them, and those that are drawn in by them, it becomes very full; and this sense of the comparison is favoured by the rendition or application, which follows: <p>so are their houses full of deceit; of mammon, gathered by deceit, as Kimchi interprets it; ungodly mammon; riches got in a fraudulent way, by cozening and cheating, tricking and overreaching: <p>therefore they are become great; in worldly things, and in the esteem of men, and in their own opinion, though of no account with God: <p>and waxen rich; not with the true riches, the riches of grace, the unsearchable riches of Christ, his durable riches and righteousness; nor indeed with the riches of the world, honestly and lawfully gotten; but with unrighteous mammon. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">As a cage is full of birds, so are their houses full of deceit: therefore they are become great, and waxen rich.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/5.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">27</span>. <span class="ital">cage</span>] The Hebrew word occurs elsewhere only in Amos (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-1.htm" title="At that time, said the LORD, they shall bring out the bones of the kings of Judah, and the bones of his princes, and the bones of the priests, and the bones of the prophets, and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, out of their graves:">Jeremiah 8:1</a>), “a <span class="ital">basket</span> of summer fruit.” Here, however, Cheyne (<span class="ital">Pulpit Comm., ad loc</span>.), quoting Hitzig, thinks that “the cage was at the same time a trap.” He quotes <a href="http://apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/11-30.htm" title="Like as a partridge taken and kept in a cage, so is the heart of the proud; and like as a spy, watcheth he for thy fall:">Sir 11:30</a> (see note in C.B.), “As a decoy partridge in a cage,” where the Greek word used is that with which LXX render “baskets” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-9.htm" title="Thus said the LORD of hosts, They shall thoroughly glean the remnant of Israel as a vine: turn back your hand as a grape gatherer into the baskets.">Jeremiah 6:9</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">deceit</span>] riches won by craft, as birds by the fowler.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A cage</span>. The Hebrew word <span class="accented">klub</span> is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-1.htm">Amos 8:1</a> for a basket such as was used for fruit; it seems to be the parent of the Greek word <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3b2;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, used in the 'Anthology' for a bird-cage. The root means to plait or braid; hence some sort of basket-work seems to be meant. Connecting this with the preceding verse, Hitzig seems right in inferring that the "cage" was at the same time a trap (comp. Ecclus. 11:30, "Like as a partridge taken <span class="accented">in a cage</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1ff3;</span>, a peculiar kind of basket], so is the heart of the proud"). Canon Tristram suggests that there is an allusion to decoy-birds, which are still much employed in Syria, and are carefully trained for their office ('Natural History of the Bible,' p. 163), But this seems to go beyond the text. <span class="cmt_word">Deceit</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the goods obtained by deceit. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The reproof of sins is introduced by an apostrophe to the hardened race. The exhortation, "Publish this," is addressed to all the prophet's hearers who have the welfare of the people at heart. "This," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-20.htm">Jeremiah 5:20</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-21.htm">Jeremiah 5:21</a>, refers to the chiding statement from <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-23.htm">Jeremiah 5:23</a> onwards, that the people fears not God. The form of address, people foolish and without understanding (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-22.htm">Jeremiah 4:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/7-11.htm">Hosea 7:11</a>), is made cutting, in order, if possible, to bring the people yet to their senses. The following clauses, "they have eyes," etc., depict spiritual blindness and deafness, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-22.htm">Ezekiel 12:22</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-3.htm">Deuteronomy 29:3</a>. Blindness is shown in that they see not the government of God's almighty power in nature; deafness, in that they hear not the voice of God in His word. They have no fear even of the God whose power has in the sand set an impassable barrier for the mighty waves of the sea. "Me" is put first for emphasis. The waves beat against their appointed barrier, but are not able, sc. to pass it.</body></html>
