But they may read their sin in their punishment. If men will inquire wherefore the Lord doeth hard things unto them, let them think of their sins. The restless waves obeyed the Divine decree, that they should not pass the sandy shores, which were as much a restraint as lofty mountains; but they burst all restraints of God's law, and were wholly gone into wickedness. Neither did they consider their interest. While the Lord, year after year, reserves to us the appointed weeks of harvest, men live on his bounty; yet they transgress against him. Sin deprives us of God's blessings; it makes the heaven as brass, and the earth as iron. Certainly the things of this world are not the best things; and we are not to think, that, because evil men prosper, God allows their practices. Though sentence against evil works is not executed speedily, it will be executed. Shall I not visit for these things? This speaks the certainty and the necessity of God's judgments. Let those who walk in bad ways consider that an end will come, and there will be bitterness in the latter end.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Fatness is admired in the East as a sign of wealth.<p>They shine - This word is used of the sleekness of the skin, soft and smooth as ivory.<p>They overpass the deeds of the wicked - literally, "They have overpassed words of wickedness," i. e., they go to excess in wickedness.<p>Yet they prosper - Or, that they (the orphans) may prosper, enjoy their rights.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>29.

"Stubborn and rebellious," joined as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-18.htm">Deuteronomy 21:18</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-20.htm">Deuteronomy 21:20</a>. Hence the following &#1505;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; is not to be taken from &#1505;&#1512;&#1512;: they defy (Hitz.), but from &#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;: they turn away and go off, and consider not that they owe their daily bread to the Lord. Neither does God's power move the obdurate people to the fear of Him, nor do the proofs of His love make any impression. They do not consider that God gives them the rain which lends the land its fruitfulness, so that at the fixed time they may gather in the harvest. The &#1493; cop. before &#1497;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492; is rejected by the Masoretes in the Keri as out of place, since &#1490;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501; is not any special rain, co-ordinate to the early and late rain (Hitz.), or because they had <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-14.htm">Deuteronomy 11:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-23.htm">Joel 2:23</a> before them. But in this they failed to notice that the &#1493; before &#1497;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492; and that before &#1502;&#1500;&#1511;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473; are correlative, having the force of et - et. &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1506;&#1514; is stat. constr. from &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1506;&#1514;, weeks, and to it &#1495;&#1511;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; is co-ordinated in place of an adjective, so that &#1511;&#1510;&#1497;&#1512; is dependent on two co-ordinate stat. constr., as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-9.htm">Jeremiah 46:9</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-11.htm">Jeremiah 46:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-6.htm">Zephaniah 2:6</a>. But the sense is not, the weeks, the statutes, of the harvest, i.e., the fixed and regulated phenomena which regulate the harvest (Graf), but, appointed weeks of harvest. The seven weeks between the second day of the passover and the feast of harvest, or of weeks, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-16.htm">Exodus 23:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-22.htm">Exodus 34:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-9.htm">Deuteronomy 16:9</a>., are what is here meant. We must reject the rendering, "oath as to the harvest-time" (L. de Dieu, J. D. Mich., and Ew.), since Scripture knows nothing of oaths taken by God as to the time of harvest; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/8-22.htm">Genesis 8:22</a> there is no word of an oath.</body></html>
