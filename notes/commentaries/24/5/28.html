But they may read their sin in their punishment. If men will inquire wherefore the Lord doeth hard things unto them, let them think of their sins. The restless waves obeyed the Divine decree, that they should not pass the sandy shores, which were as much a restraint as lofty mountains; but they burst all restraints of God's law, and were wholly gone into wickedness. Neither did they consider their interest. While the Lord, year after year, reserves to us the appointed weeks of harvest, men live on his bounty; yet they transgress against him. Sin deprives us of God's blessings; it makes the heaven as brass, and the earth as iron. Certainly the things of this world are not the best things; and we are not to think, that, because evil men prosper, God allows their practices. Though sentence against evil works is not executed speedily, it will be executed. Shall I not visit for these things? This speaks the certainty and the necessity of God's judgments. Let those who walk in bad ways consider that an end will come, and there will be bitterness in the latter end.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Fatness is admired in the East as a sign of wealth.<p>They shine - This word is used of the sleekness of the skin, soft and smooth as ivory.<p>They overpass the deeds of the wicked - literally, "They have overpassed words of wickedness," i. e., they go to excess in wickedness.<p>Yet they prosper - Or, that they (the orphans) may prosper, enjoy their rights.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>28. shine&#8212;the effect of fatness on the skin (De 32:15).

The Targum is, <p>"they transgress the words of the law;'' <p>and the Vulgate Latin version comes pretty near it, "they have passed over my words very badly"; as if they referred to the words of the law and the prophets: <p>they judge not the cause, the cause of the fatherless; this shows that it was not the common people only that were become so wicked, but the judges and civil magistrates; and who were so far from doing justice between man and man, in all civil cases that came before them, that they would not even exercise right judgment in the case of the fatherless; who not only require justice to be done them, but mercy and pity to be shown them: <p>yet they prosper; in the world, and increase in riches; have health of body and prosperity in their families; nor are they in trouble, as other men: this sometimes has been trying to good men to observe; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-3.htm">Psalm 73:3</a> and particularly to the Prophet Jeremiah, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-1.htm">Jeremiah 12:1</a>, or, "that they may prosper" (g); as Jarchi interprets it; and to the same sense is the Targum, <p>"if they had judged the judgment of the fatherless they would have prospered;'' <p>but the former sense is best; and which Kimchi gives into, and agrees with what goes before, concerning the riches and prosperous estate of those men: <p>and the right of the needy do they not judge: because they are poor, and can not fee them, they will not undertake their cause; or, if it comes before them, they will not do them justice, being bribed by the rich that oppose them. <p>(f)   "transcendunt verba mali", Schmidt; "transierunt verba mali", Cocceius.

The exhortation, "Publish this," is addressed to all the prophet's hearers who have the welfare of the people at heart. "This," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-20.htm">Jeremiah 5:20</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-21.htm">Jeremiah 5:21</a>, refers to the chiding statement from <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-23.htm">Jeremiah 5:23</a> onwards, that the people fears not God. The form of address, people foolish and without understanding (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-22.htm">Jeremiah 4:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/7-11.htm">Hosea 7:11</a>), is made cutting, in order, if possible, to bring the people yet to their senses. The following clauses, "they have eyes," etc., depict spiritual blindness and deafness, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-22.htm">Ezekiel 12:22</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-3.htm">Deuteronomy 29:3</a>. Blindness is shown in that they see not the government of God's almighty power in nature; deafness, in that they hear not the voice of God in His word. They have no fear even of the God whose power has in the sand set an impassable barrier for the mighty waves of the sea. "Me" is put first for emphasis. The waves beat against their appointed barrier, but are not able, sc. to pass it.</body></html>
