But they may read their sin in their punishment. If men will inquire wherefore the Lord doeth hard things unto them, let them think of their sins. The restless waves obeyed the Divine decree, that they should not pass the sandy shores, which were as much a restraint as lofty mountains; but they burst all restraints of God's law, and were wholly gone into wickedness. Neither did they consider their interest. While the Lord, year after year, reserves to us the appointed weeks of harvest, men live on his bounty; yet they transgress against him. Sin deprives us of God's blessings; it makes the heaven as brass, and the earth as iron. Certainly the things of this world are not the best things; and we are not to think, that, because evil men prosper, God allows their practices. Though sentence against evil works is not executed speedily, it will be executed. Shall I not visit for these things? This speaks the certainty and the necessity of God's judgments. Let those who walk in bad ways consider that an end will come, and there will be bitterness in the latter end.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Rather, he spieth about like the crouching down of fowlers; they have set the fatal snare; "they catch men."<p>Trap - literally, "The destroyer;" it was probably a gin, which strangled the birds caught in it.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>26.

The exhortation, "Publish this," is addressed to all the prophet's hearers who have the welfare of the people at heart. "This," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-20.htm">Jeremiah 5:20</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-21.htm">Jeremiah 5:21</a>, refers to the chiding statement from <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-23.htm">Jeremiah 5:23</a> onwards, that the people fears not God. The form of address, people foolish and without understanding (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-22.htm">Jeremiah 4:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/7-11.htm">Hosea 7:11</a>), is made cutting, in order, if possible, to bring the people yet to their senses. The following clauses, "they have eyes," etc., depict spiritual blindness and deafness, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-22.htm">Ezekiel 12:22</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-3.htm">Deuteronomy 29:3</a>. Blindness is shown in that they see not the government of God's almighty power in nature; deafness, in that they hear not the voice of God in His word. They have no fear even of the God whose power has in the sand set an impassable barrier for the mighty waves of the sea. "Me" is put first for emphasis. The waves beat against their appointed barrier, but are not able, sc. to pass it.</body></html>
