It is, of course, possible that parts of the picture may have been worked up when the prophecies were rewritten under Jehoiakim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-32.htm" title="Then took Jeremiah another roll, and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah; who wrote therein from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire: and there were added besides to them many like words.">Jeremiah 36:32</a>); but, on the other hand, it is equally possible that the prophet may have seen even at the time how hollow and incomplete that reformation was. The form in which he utters his conviction reminds one of the old story of the Greek sage, Diogenes, appearing in the streets of Athens with a lantern, searching for an honest man. In the thought that the pardon of the city depended on its containing some elements of good which might make reformation possible, we find an echo of <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-25.htm" title="That be far from you to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from you: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?">Genesis 18:25</a>; but the picture is of a state more utterly hopeless. There were not ten righteous men found in Sodom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-32.htm" title="And he said, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for ten's sake.">Genesis 18:32</a>); in Jerusalem there was not one.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/jeremiah/5.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-1.htm" title="Run you to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, and see now, and know, and seek in the broad places thereof, if you can find a man, if there be any that executes judgment, that seeks the truth; and I will pardon it.">Jeremiah 5:1</a></span>. <span class="ital">Run ye to and fro, </span>&c. — In this chapter, which seems to be a continuation of the preceding discourse, God justifies the severity of the judgments denounced in the foregoing chapter. The expressions are strong, but not to be taken strictly in the letter, signifying only the extreme degeneracy of the times, and the great want of justice and piety in Jerusalem. <span class="ital">And see now and know, </span>&c. — Search here and there, and in every part of the city. The words, <span class="ital">saith the Lord, </span>should be supplied; for it is plain that the first and second verses are the words of God. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-3.htm" title="O LORD, are not your eyes on the truth? you have stricken them, but they have not grieved; you have consumed them, but they have refused to receive correction: they have made their faces harder than a rock; they have refused to return.">Jeremiah 5:3</a> the prophet speaks, and goes on to <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-7.htm" title="How shall I pardon you for this? your children have forsaken me, and sworn by them that are no gods: when I had fed them to the full, they then committed adultery, and assembled themselves by troops in the harlots' houses.">Jeremiah 5:7</a>, where God speaks again. <span class="ital">And seek in the broad places thereof </span>— The word <span class="greekheb">רחבותיה</span>, thus rendered, means, no doubt, the market-places, and other spacious areas, where citizens used to meet to do business with each other. <span class="ital">If ye can find a man</span> — Namely, a man fearing God, and working righteousness. <span class="ital">If there be any that executeth judgment </span>— That in the magistracy rightly administers justice. <span class="ital">That seeketh the truth </span>— Any one among the commonality that deals faithfully and uprightly. The universal corruption of manners was such, that a man might walk the streets of Jerusalem long enough before he could meet with any one that was truly religious. <span class="ital">And I will pardon it </span>— Namely, the city of Jerusalem. The strong expressions of this verse, if they were taken strictly, would imply that Jerusalem was now worse than Sodom, in the days of Lot: for, in offering pardon to Sodom and Gomorrah, God came no lower than ten, but, according to the literal meaning of these expressions, he promises to pardon Jerusalem if there should be one righteous man found. But it seems evident that, as we have intimated above, they are not to be taken in so strict a sense as if, in so great a city, there was not one good man; for certainly the prophet could not be reckoned among the number of the wicked, and there were besides, Baruch his disciple, and Ebed-melech, and, without doubt, some others that were truly pious. So that the meaning can be no more than that there were very few good men compared with the number of the wicked.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:1-9 None could be found who behaved as upright and godly men. But the Lord saw the true character of the people through all their disguises. The poor were ignorant, and therefore they were wicked. What can be expected but works of darkness, from people that know nothing of God and religion? There are God's poor, who, notwithstanding poverty, know the way of the Lord, walk in it, and do their duty; but these were willingly ignorant, and their ignorance would not be their excuse. The rich were insolent and haughty, and the abuse of God's favours made their sin worse.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The broad places - The open spaces next the gates, and other places of concourse.<p>A man - Or, anyone.<p>That executeth - "That" practiceth.<p>Truth - uprightness, probity (so in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-3.htm">Jeremiah 5:3</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 5<p>Jer 5:1-31.

Let who will search, they will find it even so. It implies the great scarcity of good men, that must be thus searched for.

These are the words of the Lord, not to the prophet only, but to any other, who thought fit to look into the reasons of the Lord's dealing in a way of judgment with the people of the Jews; these he would have go through the whole city of Jerusalem, every street of it, and that backwards and forwards, not once only, but over and over again: <p>and see now, and know, and seek in the broad places thereof; where there is commonly the greatest concourse of people; here he would have them look out diligently, observe and take cognizance of the persons they should meet with in such places: <p>if ye can find a man; that is, as the Targum adds, whose works are good, and as it is afterwards explained; for as yet the city was not desolate, so as that there was no man dwelling in it, as it was foretold it should be, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-25.htm">Jeremiah 4:25</a>. It is reported (o) of Diogenes, the Cynic philosopher, that he lighted up a candle in the daytime, and went through the streets with it; and, being asked the reason of it, said, I seek a man; that is, a man of virtue, honour, and honesty; by which he would be understood, that such were very rare: and so it follows, <p>if there be any that executeth judgment; in the public courts of judicature; or in private, between man and man: <p>that seeketh the truth; of doctrine and worship, that seeks to speak it, and maintain it; who is true to his word, and faithful to his promises; but was not one such to be found? were there not the Prophet Jeremiah, and Baruch, and some others? the answer of Kimchi's father is, that such were not to be found in the streets and broad places, where the direction is to seek, because such were hidden in their own houses for fear of wicked men; others think that the meaning is, that there were none to be found to make up the hedge, or stand in the gap for the land, and to intercede for them, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-30.htm">Ezekiel 22:30</a>, and others are of opinion that the Lord speaks of men in public offices, as judges, priests, and prophets, who were grown so corrupt, as that a good man was not to be found among them: but it seems rather to design the body of the people, and the sense to be, that an upright faithful man was rare to be found; and that, could there be found but a few of that sort, the Lord would spare the city for their sake, as in the case of Sodom, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-32.htm">Genesis 18:32</a> and so it follows, <p>and I will pardon it; the city of Jerusalem, and the inhabitants of it; so the Targum, Septuagint, and Arabic versions render it, "them". <p>(o) Laert.

The word is the same as that rendered “faithfully,” e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/12-15.htm" title="Moreover they reckoned not with the men, into whose hand they delivered the money to be bestowed on workmen: for they dealt faithfully.">2 Kings 12:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-7.htm" title="However, there was no reckoning made with them of the money that was delivered into their hand, because they dealt faithfully.">2 Kings 22:7</a>.

The answer is: as long as the people persists in the folly of its rebellion against God, so long will chastising judgments continue. To bring this answer of God home to the people's heart, the prophet, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-23.htm">Jeremiah 4:23-26</a>, tells what he has seen in the spirit. He has seen (&#1512;&#1488;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497;, perf. proph.) bursting over Judah a visitation which convulses the whole world. The earth seemed waste and void as at the beginning of creation, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a>, before the separation of the elements and before the creation of organic and living beings. In heaven no light was to be seen, earth and heaven seemed to have been thrown back into a condition of chaos. The mountains and hills, these firm foundations of the earth, quivered and swayed (&#1492;&#1514;&#1511;&#1500;&#1511;&#1500;, be put into a light motion, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/1-5.htm">Nahum 1:5</a>); men had fled and hidden themselves from the wrath of God (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-19.htm">Isaiah 2:19</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-21.htm">Isaiah 2:21</a>), and all the birds had flown out of sight in terror at the dreadful tokens of the beginning catastrophe (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-9.htm">Genesis 9:9</a>). The fruitful field was the wilderness - not a wilderness, but "changed into the wilderness with all its attributes" (Hitz.). &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1502;&#1500; is not appell. as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-7.htm">Jeremiah 2:7</a>, but nom. prop. of the lower slopes of Carmel, famed for their fruitfulness; these being taken as representatives of all the fruitful districts of the land.
