As in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/38-8.htm" title="Or who shut up the sea with doors, when it broke forth, as if it had issued out of the womb?">Job 38:8-11</a>, so, probably, here also there is something of the wonder of one to whom, as dwelling in an inland village, the billows breaking on the shore was an unfamiliar sight. Here was the token that even the forces which seem wildest and least restrained are subject to an overruling law. Even the sand which seems so shifting keeps in the surging waters.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/jeremiah/5.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/5-22.htm" title="Fear you not me? said the LORD: will you not tremble at my presence, which have placed the sand for the bound of the sea by a perpetual decree, that it cannot pass it: and though the waves thereof toss themselves, yet can they not prevail; though they roar, yet can they not pass over it?...">Jeremiah 5:22-24</a></span>. <span class="ital">Fear ye not me? saith the Lord — </span>He ascribes their stupidity and foolishness to their want of the fear of God. As if he had said, If you would but call to mind God’s almighty power, and your own weakness, and keep an awe of him upon your minds, you would be more observant of his commands, and be afraid to disobey them. <span class="ital">Which have placed the sand for the bound of the sea </span>— Who need not place rocks or walls to keep it in; but can give an effectual check to it by a little despicable sand. “The keeping of the waters within bounds, so that they cannot overflow the earth, is often mentioned in Scripture as an immediate effect of God’s overruling power and providence. For water being <span class="ital">specifically </span>lighter than earth, by the common laws of gravitation it should rise above it, and overflow it. And then the adjusting the proportion of the tides, that they rise no higher, to the prejudice of the lower grounds, is another remarkable instance of God’s special providence.” — Lowth. <span class="ital">But this people </span>are more ungovernable than the unruly waves of the sea: they have <span class="ital">a revolting and a rebellious heart </span>— They have not only revolted from me and gone back, but they continue obstinate, and will not return. They persist in their evil courses, and are determined so to do: they are <span class="ital">gone </span>quite away, and are irreclaimable. <span class="ital">Neither say they in their heart </span>— They are so careless that they never trouble themselves about any thing of the kind; or are so obdurate that they never lay it to heart, nor consider that it is God, who disposeth of all things according to his own pleasure, both in the great deep and on dry land. <span class="ital">Let us now fear the Lord our God </span>— Or, <span class="ital">worship </span>and <span class="ital">obey </span>him; all acceptable service to God being both performed in his fear, and proceeding from it. <span class="ital">That giveth rain </span>— Without which the earth could produce no fruits. By this the true God is distinguished from all false gods, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-22.htm" title="Are there any among the vanities of the Gentiles that can cause rain? or can the heavens give showers? are not you he, O LORD our God? therefore we will wait on you: for you have made all these things.">Jeremiah 14:22</a>; and in this appears not only his power in appointing and preparing it, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/147-8.htm" title="Who covers the heaven with clouds, who prepares rain for the earth, who makes grass to grow on the mountains.">Psalm 147:8</a>,) and his sovereignty in withholding it, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/4-7.htm" title="And also I have withheld the rain from you, when there were yet three months to the harvest: and I caused it to rain on one city, and caused it not to rain on another city: one piece was rained on, and the piece whereupon it rained not withered.">Amos 4:7</a>,) but his general goodness in bestowing it, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-12.htm" title="The LORD shall open to you his good treasure, the heaven to give the rain to your land in his season, and to bless all the work of your hand: and you shall lend to many nations, and you shall not borrow.">Deuteronomy 28:12</a>,) and his special providence in distributing it according as there is need. As in the former instance God shows how insensible his people were of his power and glorious greatness in taming such an unruly element as the sea; so here he further sets forth their inattention to, and disregard of, his providence and goodness; implying that they were grown so stupid, unfeeling, and obstinate, that they neither stood in awe of him for his greatness, nor feared to offend him for his goodness. “The vicissitudes of seasons, of cold and heat, of drought and moisture, so wisely fitted for the growth of the fruits of the earth, and other uses of human life, are so remarkable a proof of the being and attributes of God and his providence, as to be obvious to the meanest capacity, and on this account they are frequently insisted on by the inspired writers.” — Lowth. Concerning the <span class="ital">former and latter rain, </span>see note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-14.htm" title="That I will give you the rain of your land in his due season, the first rain and the latter rain, that you may gather in your corn, and your wine, and your oil.">Deuteronomy 11:14</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-15.htm" title="In the light of the king's countenance is life; and his favor is as a cloud of the latter rain.">Proverbs 16:15</a>. <span class="ital">He reserveth, &c., the appointed weeks of the harvest — </span>He gives seasonable harvests, according to his appointment. The sum is: the prophet would let them know what a foolish as well as wicked thing it was to set themselves against that God who kept, as he still keeps, the whole order of nature at his disposal, governing and changing it as he sees men behave toward him.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:19-31 Unhumbled hearts are ready to charge God with being unjust in their afflictions. But they may read their sin in their punishment. If men will inquire wherefore the Lord doeth hard things unto them, let them think of their sins. The restless waves obeyed the Divine decree, that they should not pass the sandy shores, which were as much a restraint as lofty mountains; but they burst all restraints of God's law, and were wholly gone into wickedness. Neither did they consider their interest. While the Lord, year after year, reserves to us the appointed weeks of harvest, men live on his bounty; yet they transgress against him. Sin deprives us of God's blessings; it makes the heaven as brass, and the earth as iron. Certainly the things of this world are not the best things; and we are not to think, that, because evil men prosper, God allows their practices. Though sentence against evil works is not executed speedily, it will be executed. Shall I not visit for these things? This speaks the certainty and the necessity of God's judgments. Let those who walk in bad ways consider that an end will come, and there will be bitterness in the latter end.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The sea is the symbol of restless and indomitable energy, chafing against all resistance, and dashing to pieces the works whereby man endeavors to restrain its fury. Yet God has imposed upon it laws which it must obey, and keeps it in its appointed place, not by barriers of iron but by a belt of sand. Modern science has shown that the resisting power of sand is enormous. A wave which would shatter rocks fails powerless upon sand.<p>Can they not prevail - The opposite of "thou couldest" <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-5.htm">Jeremiah 3:5</a>.

Such is your monstrous perversity, that the raging, senseless sea sooner obeys Me, than ye do who profess to be intelligent [Calvin], (Job 26:10; 38:10, 11; Pr 8:29; Re 15:4).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Fear ye not me:</span> either a convincing argument to persuade them to submit unto him; Will ye not submit to me, that can rule the sea? which, as unruly a thing as it is, yet quietly yields to my will: or rather, a very angry challenge and expostulation; Do you think that I, that can tame the boisterous sea, cannot tame you? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Which have placed the sand for the bound of the sea; </span> that stand not in need to make rocks for walls and bounds unto it, but can give a check to it by so small a matter as the sand, that of itself is not only yielding and penetrable, but subject to be blown away with every wind. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">By a perpetual decree; </span> either looking backward, that it never could, or forward, that it never shall. Whether this decree have respect to the creation, or to the deluge, it is not much material; the former of which times it could not have been contained within its bounds, neither in the latter could it have exceeded them, without God’s special order, as no time since. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Though the waves thereof toss themselves; </span> though they swell, rage, roar, and threaten never so much, as if they would swallow up all before them; though they foam against the rocks that stand in their way; yet, when they come to their bounds appointed, shall tamely yield unto the sand, and retire back. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Yet can they not prevail; </span> not get any ground upon or against God’s decree and appointment; either the <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">decree</span> or the <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">sand; </span> which in regard of their form, situation, unruliness, and fluxibility would overflow the whole earth, were it not for the limits and restraints that are laid upon it, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-11.htm" title="And said, Till now shall you come, but no further: and here shall your proud waves be stayed?">Job 38:11</a></span>. By this instance, God may show what he could do with reference to that enraged and raging army that is about to come upon them like a torrent, if his people would repent. Or rather be hereby upbraids the Jews with their unreasonable sottishness, that they are more mad in their rebellions against God, than the raging waters of the sea, that, as boisterous as they are, yet obey his will. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/5.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Fear ye not me? saith the Lord,.... They did not fear the Lord, and this is a reproof to them for the want of it, which is a reproof of their ignorance and folly; for the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>, and where that is there is true wisdom; but, where it is not, there is nothing but ignorance and stupidity: <p>will ye not tremble at my presence? or "face"; his wrath and anger, justly resenting their carriage to him. The Targum is, <p>"from before my Word;'' <p>the essential Word, his Son: or, "will ye not be in pain?" as a woman in travail; as Kimchi observes the word (b) signifies: <p>which have placed the sand for the bound of the sea by a perpetual decree, that it cannot pass it. This is a very wonderful thing in nature, that the earth and sea, being spherical, and making one terraqueous globe, and the waters of the sea being higher than the earth, should be so bounded and restrained, by the power and providence of God, as not to overflow the earth, and that by means of the sand, which is penetrable, flexible, and movable; and yet this is set as a bound, and by the decree of God remains firm and stable, and that for ever, so that the sea cannot bear it down, go through it, or over it: <p>and though the waves thereof toss themselves, yet can they not prevail; though they roar, yet can they not pass over it; even when the sea is the most tumultuous and raging. This is an instance of the mighty power of God, and carries in it an argument and reason why he should be feared; and yet such was the stupidity of this people, that though they saw this with their eyes, the sea and the tossings of it, and the sand set as a bound to it, and an effectual one, and heard the roarings and ragings of the waves of it in vain; yet they feared not the Lord that did all this; and so showed themselves more stupid and disobedient than the sea and its waves, which obeyed their Maker, though destitute of sense and reason; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/26-10.htm">Job 26:10</a>. <p>(b) "Significantissima impimis vox est"  "quae significat ita angi ut parturiens", Schmidt. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Fear ye not me? saith the LORD: will ye not tremble at my presence, which have placed the sand for the bound of the sea by a perpetual decree, that it cannot pass it: and though the waves thereof toss themselves, yet can they not prevail; though they roar, yet can they not pass over it?</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/5.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">22</span>.

Judah is called "house of Israel," not so much because it is what remains of Israel, but because, after the captivity of the ten tribes, Judah regarded itself as the only true Israel or people of God.
