Hath Israel &#8230; no heir?&#8212;namely, to occupy the land of Gad, after it itself has been carried away captive by Shalmaneser. Ammon, like Moab, descended from Lot, lay north of Moab, from which it was separated by the river Arnon, and east of Reuben and Gad (Jos 13:24, 25) on the same side of Jordan. It seized on Gad when Israel was carried captive. Judah was by the right of kindred the heir, not Ammon; but Ammon joined with Nebuchadnezzar against Judah and Jerusalem (2Ki 24:2) and exulted over its fall (Ps 83:4-7, 8; Zep 2:8, 9). It had already, in the days of Jeroboam, in Israel's affliction, tried to "enlarge its border" (2Ki 14:26; Am 1:1, 13).<p>their king&#8212;(Am 1:15); referring to Melchom, their tutelary idol (Zep 1:5); and so the Septuagint reads it here as a proper name (1Ki 11:5, 33; 2Ki 23:13). The Ammonite god is said to do what they do, namely, occupy the Israelite land of Gad. To Jehovah, the theocratic "King" of Israel, the land belonged of right; so that their Molech or Melchom was a usurper-king.<p>his people&#8212;the people of Melchom, "their king."

During the long tract of time that there were wars betwixt the Jews and Ammonites, the laud of Gad and Reuben, which lay beyond Jordan, fell into the hand of the Syrians, Moabites, and Ammonites (whence it is that in the former chapter we read of many cities of Moab, which were, upon the division of Canaan, in the lot of Gad and Reuben). This prophecy cannot be well understood without a previous understanding this. Hence it is that the prophet saith, Hath Israel no sons? God had given that country of Gilead to Manasseh, and Reuben, and Gad, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-40.htm" title="And Moses gave Gilead to Machir the son of Manasseh; and he dwelled therein.">Numbers 32:40</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/joshua/13-29.htm" title="And Moses gave inheritance to the half tribe of Manasseh: and this was the possession of the half tribe of the children of Manasseh by their families....">Joshua 13:29-31</a></span>; and as men’s estates ought to descend to their heirs, so this land should have continued and descended to the posterity of these tribes, but the Ammonites had by force taken away a part, and Melcom possessed it. Melcom is <span class="ital">their king</span>, or the name of their idol to whom they gave the name of king, as other heathens called their idol Baal, that is, lord. And the people of the king of the Ammonites, or of Melcom the idol of the Ammonites, dwelt in the cities belonging to Gad, which was one of the tribes of Israel. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/49.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Concerning the Ammonites, thus saith the Lord,.... Or, "to the Ammonites" (u); or, "against" them (w); it will bear to be rendered either way, and all is true; for what is said by the Lord, as follows, is concerning them, their sins, and their punishment, and is directed to them, and is a threatening against them: <p>hath Israel no sons? hath he no heir? certainly he has, and who ought to possess the land; this is to be understood not of the ten tribes, sometimes called Israel, as distinct from the other two; for these had been long ago carried captive, and left no heirs of their tribes; but of all Israel, including the tribes of Judah and Benjamin; who, though their brethren of the ten tribes were carried captive, and left no children to inherit, yet, being next in blood, were the lawful heirs of their lands and possessions: <p>why then doth their king inherit Gad? that part of the land of Israel which belonged to the tribe of Gad; this, when the ten tribes were carried captive by the king of Assyria, and the Gadites among the rest, was seized on by the Ammonites, with their king at the head of them, lying near unto them; who might also pretend relation, as being the children of Lot, the brother's son of Abraham; or claim it, as having been their own formerly, and so were the lawful heirs of it, as they imagined; when it of right belonged to the children of Judah and Benjamin: or, "why doth Malcam inherit Gad?" (x) the same with Milcom or Molech, the abomination of the Ammonites, the idol they worshipped, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-5.htm">1 Kings 11:5</a>; so Jarchi interprets it. The Ammonites having got possession of the land, set up their idol in it, where temples were built for him, and altars erected, and sacrifices offered to him, so that he might be said to inherit it; and which must be very offensive to, and highly resented by, the God of Israel: <p>and his people dwelt in his cities: the Ammonites dwelt in the cities belonging to the tribe of Gad, as if they were their own; who are called the people of Milcom, or Molech, just as the Moabites are called the people of Chemosh, from the idol they worshipped, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-46.htm">Jeremiah 48:46</a>. <p>(u)  "ad filios Ammon", V.

The figure of the eagle, darting down in flight on its prey, is founded on <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-49.htm">Deuteronomy 28:49</a> (on &#1488;&#1500;- for &#1506;&#1500;, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-22.htm">Jeremiah 49:22</a>). Kerioth, the capital, is taken (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-24.htm">Jeremiah 48:24</a>); so are the other strongholds or fastnesses of the country. The mere fact that &#1511;&#1512;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; has the article does not justify any one in taking it as an appellative, "the cities;" this appears from a comparison of <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/2-2.htm">Amos 2:2</a> with this verse. No plural of &#1511;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492; occurs anywhere. Then the fear of death falls on the heroes of Moab like a woman in labour. &#1502;&#1510;&#1512;&#1492;, partic. Hiphil from &#1510;&#1512;&#1512;, uterum comprimens, is found only here and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-22.htm">Jeremiah 49:22</a>, where the figure is repeated. Moab is annihilated, so that it is no longer a nation (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-2.htm">Jeremiah 48:2</a>), because it has risen up in pride against the God of Israel; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-26.htm">Jeremiah 48:26</a>. He who flees from one danger falls into the other. The play on the words &#1508;&#1468;&#1495;&#1491;, fear, horror, &#1508;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;, pit, and &#1508;&#1468;&#1495;, spring-trap, as well as the mode in which it is carried out, is taken from <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-17.htm">Isaiah 24:17</a>., - a prophecy of the judgment on the world; see a similar idea presented in <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/5-19.htm">Amos 5:19</a>, but somewhat differently expressed. The Kethib &#1492;&#1504;&#1497;&#1505;, perfect Hiphil, "he flees," is less suitable than the Qeri &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1505; (after Isaiah). The last clause, "for I will bring," etc., is quite in Jeremiah's peculiar style; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-23.htm">Jeremiah 4:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-12.htm">Jeremiah 23:12</a>. &#1488;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492; belongs to &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1502;&#1493;&#1488;&#1489;: the noun is anticipated by the pronoun, as frequently occurs; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-14.htm">Jeremiah 9:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/41-3.htm">Jeremiah 41:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/43-11.htm">Jeremiah 43:11</a>. </body></html>
