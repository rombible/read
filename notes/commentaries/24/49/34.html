Assuming the date to be rightly given, it indicates a time later than that of those that precede it, which belong probably to the group of predictions connected with Jeremiah 25. It has been maintained, however, by many critics that the absence of the name of Nebuchadnezzar, so prominent in Jeremiah’s predictions after the deportation of Jehoiachin, indicates an earlier rather than a later date, and that the compiler of the prophecies was mistaken in thus fixing the time of its delivery. The inference is, however, somewhat precarious, as the fact is common to the prophecies against the Philistines, Moabites, Ammonites, &c., that precede this. Elam, though commonly identified with Persia, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-11.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in that day, that the Lord shall set his hand again the second time to recover the remnant of his people, which shall be left, from Assyria, and from Egypt, and from Pathros, and from Cush, and from Elam, and from Shinar, and from Hamath, and from the islands of the sea.">Isaiah 11:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-2.htm" title="A grievous vision is declared to me; the treacherous dealer deals treacherously, and the spoiler spoils. Go up, O Elam: besiege, O Media; all the sighing thereof have I made to cease.">Isaiah 21:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-6.htm" title="And Elam bore the quiver with chariots of men and horsemen, and Kir uncovered the shield.">Isaiah 22:6</a>, appears to be used with a somewhat wider connotation for the tribes beyond the Tigris (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-25.htm" title="And all the kings of Zimri, and all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of the Medes,">Jeremiah 25:25</a>). The tone of the prophecy seems to imply that Elam had been prominent among the enemies of the people of Jehovah (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-6.htm" title="And Elam bore the quiver with chariots of men and horsemen, and Kir uncovered the shield.">Isaiah 22:6</a>), and this has led to the inference that they had taken part in the attack on Judah, as auxiliaries in the army of Nebuchadnezzar. It is significant that the thought that Elam is to be the instrument of Jehovah for the destruction of Babylon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-2.htm" title="A grievous vision is declared to me; the treacherous dealer deals treacherously, and the spoiler spoils. Go up, O Elam: besiege, O Media; all the sighing thereof have I made to cease.">Isaiah 21:2</a>), and that out of it was to come the appointed deliverer of Israel, does not seem to have been present to the prophet’s mind. His horizon is, as it were, bounded for the time by the more immediate future.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/jeremiah/49.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-34.htm" title="The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet against Elam in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, saying,">Jeremiah 49:34</a></span>. <span class="ital">The word that came to Jeremiah against Elam </span>— Elam we find to have been an independent, and even powerful kingdom, in the days of Abraham, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-1.htm" title="And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations;">Genesis 14:1</a>. “But I am not of opinion with those writers,” says Blaney, “who hold that by Elam, in Scripture, Persia is always meant. There is no doubt but that when the monarchy of Persia was established under Cyrus, Elam was blended into and formed a part of it. But before that time Elam and Persia were two distinct kingdoms: of which this may be admitted for proof, that the kingdom of Persia, if Xenophon may be credited as an historian, was never subdued under the dominion of Nebuchadnezzar, but preserved its liberty in alliance with the Medes. Elam, on the contrary, is not only here prophesied of, as destined to become a part of the Babylonian conquests, but is actually spoken of, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-2.htm" title="And I saw in a vision; and it came to pass, when I saw, that I was at Shushan in the palace, which is in the province of Elam; and I saw in a vision, and I was by the river of Ulai.">Daniel 8:2</a>,) as a province of the Babylonish empire; over which Daniel seems to have presided, having Shushan for the seat of his government.

This country, better known as Susiana, is the modern Chuzistan, and lies on the east of Chaldaea, from which it is separated by the Tigris. In the cuneiform inscriptions we find the Elamites on friendly terms with Babylon. The suggestion therefore that they served as auxiliaries in the Chaldaean army in the expedition against Judah is not improbable. It was in the first year of Zedekiah that this prophecy was written, and thus it is a little prior to the prophecies against Babylon <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-59.htm">Jeremiah 51:59</a>, which immediately follow.

Even Rothstein, who is a decidedly conservative critic on the whole, rejects it. Co. on the other hand maintains that there is in it a Jeremianic kernel, expanded later. Gi. assigns its date to the time when Babylon had been overthrown by Persia. Sayce (HDB. I. 676) thinks that it has reference to the conquest of Anzan (one of the two ruling cities in Elam) by Teispes the Persian, the ancestor of Cyrus.

The title places this prophecy later than these in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-1.htm">Jeremiah 48:1-49:33</a>; viz. at the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah. From this filet, and from the absence of any reference to Nebuchadnezzar as the instrument of Elam's humiliation, Ewald conjectures that the Elamites had been concerned in the events which led to the dethronement and captivity of Jehoiachin. Dr. Payne Smith is inclined to accept this hypothesis, remarking that the Elamites "appear perpetually as the allies of Merodach-baladan and his sons in their struggles for independence." We are not yet, however, in  possession of information as to the relations of Elam to the great Babylonian empire which rose upon the ruins of the Assyrian. Ewald's conjecture is a possibility, and no more. And what was Elam? One of the most ancient kingdoms in the world (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14.htm">Genesis 14</a>.). Geographically it was the tract of country., partly mountainous, partly lowland, lying south of Assyria and east of Persia proper, to which Herodotus gives the name of Cissia, and the classical geographers that of Tusis or Tusiaua. This is clear, says Sehrader, from the Persian text of the Behistun inscription of Darius. It is fro-quently mentioned under the name "Ilam," or "Ilamti," in the Assyrian inscriptions, especially in those of Sargon, Sennacherib, and Assurbauipal. In B.C 721 Sargon states that he annexed a district or province of Elam (and hence, perhaps, we must explain the mention of the Elamites in the Assyrian army in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-6.htm">Isaiah 22:6</a>), which was, doubtless, one cause of the embittered feeling towards Assyria of the portion which remained independent. The annals of the heroic struggle of Merodach-baladan contain repeated reference to the King of Elam. Assurbanipal made no less than three invasions of Elam, and the singular pretext for the third is, curiously enough, associated with the remarkable fourteenth chapter of Genesis. It was this - that the Elamite king had refused to deliver up an image of the goddess Nana, which Kudur-nankhundi, an ancient Elamite monarch, had carried oft, and which had remained 1635 or (perhaps) 1535 years in Elam. This king has been plausibly conjectured to be a member of the same dynasty as "Chedorlaomer [  =   Kudur-Lagamar] King of Elam." This time it was all over with Elam; Shushan itself was plundered and destroyed, and far and wide the country was laid waste. That so restless and courageous a people should have become famous among the surrounding nations was only to be expected; and it is a striking proof of this that Ezekiel, in describing the companions whom fallen Egypt would meet with in Hades, mentions "Elam and all her multitude" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-24.htm">Ezekiel 32:24</a>). The fact that the Septuagint has the heading twice over - first very briefly (in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-14.htm">Jeremiah 25:14</a>, where it is followed by this prophecy), and then at full length (in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-1.htm">Jeremiah 26:1</a>, at the end of the prophecy of Elam) - has been variously explained. It is, at any rate, clear that there is some confusion in the present text of this translation. In connection with this prediction it is interesting to notice one of the results of a new cuneiform discovery among some tablets acquired in 1878 by the British Museum. At the very time when Nebuchadnezzar was taking an oath of allegiance from Zedekiah, he was also engaged in hostilities against Elam. "We do not know," says Mr. Pinches, "what brought the Babylonians into hostilities with the Elamites, but the result of the expedition was to bring the whole kingdom of Elam within the boundaries of the Babylonian monarchy" (<span class="accented">Transactions of the Society of Biblical Archaeology</span>, 7:214). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/49.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"Concerning Kedar and the Kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon smote." (The Kethib &#1504;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1491;&#1512;&#1488;&#1510;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512; is perhaps merely an error in transcription occasioned by the occurrence of the preceding &#1495;&#1510;&#1493;&#1512;). Kedar, the Kedarenes, a Bedouin nation descended from Ishmael, dwelling in tents throughout the region between Arabia Petraea and Babylonia (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-13.htm">Genesis 25:13</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-21.htm">Ezekiel 27:21</a>), is here, no doubt, a general name for all the nomadic tribes and shepherd nations of Arabia. Hazor elsewhere occurs only as the name of various cities in Palestine (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/11-1.htm">Joshua 11:1</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/15-23.htm">Joshua 15:23</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-25.htm">Joshua 15:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-23.htm">Joshua 19:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/11-33.htm">Nahum 11:33</a>), of which we need not think here, since it is Arabians who are spoken of. No locality or region of this name in Arabia is known. Jeremiah appears to have formed the name for the purpose of designating those Arabians who dwelt in &#1495;&#1510;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, "courts" or "villages," and who thus differed from the Bedouins proper, or nomads and dwellers in tents; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-11.htm">Isaiah 42:11</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-16.htm">Genesis 25:16</a>. The settled Arabians are to this day called Hadarijeh, in contrast with Wabarijeh, who dwell in tents. "Hadar, &#1495;&#1510;&#1512;, is the settled dwelling-place, in contrast with bedu&#770;, the steppe, where the tents are pitched, sometimes here, sometimes there, and only for a time" (Delitzsch on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-11.htm">Isaiah 42:11</a>). "The kingdoms of Hazor" are the regions of the settled tribes, ruled by their own princes or sheiks; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-24.htm">Jeremiah 25:24</a>.<p>(Note: According to Mrc. v. Niebuhr, Gesch. Ass. u. Bab. p. 210, "Hazor is the modern Hajar, a region which occupies the whole north-eastern corner of the Nejed, and to which, in the wider sense, Lascha, the region on the coast, also belongs" But &#1495;&#1510;&#1493;&#1512;, from &#1495;&#1510;&#1512;, which corresponds to Arab. htsr or hdr, is fundamentally different from Arab. hjr or h&#803;jr.)<p>In the prophecy, the general designation, "children of the east," i.e., Orientals, alternates with Kedar: the former is the most common name given to the tribes living to the east of Palestine, in the wilderness: cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-3.htm">Judges 6:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-3.htm">Job 1:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-4.htm">Ezekiel 25:4</a>. Instead of this name, Josephus uses the designation "Arabians" (Ant. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-6.htm">Ezekiel 25:6</a>. 1); later, "Nabateans" or "Kedarenes" became common. Here also (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-32.htm">Jeremiah 49:32</a>) is used the special designation &#1511;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1510;&#1497; &#1508;&#1488;&#1492; cut (at) the corner (of the hair), which points to the custom, usual among several of these Bedouin tribes, of cropping the hair of the head and beard; see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-25.htm">Jeremiah 9:25</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-23.htm">Jeremiah 25:23</a>.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-28.htm">Jeremiah 49:28</a><p>"Thus saith Jahveh, Arise, go up to Kedar, and destroy the children of the east. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-29.htm">Jeremiah 49:29</a>.
