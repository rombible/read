Idumæa was a populous and powerful country in the time of John Hyrcanus. Petra, as we have seen, was rebuilt by the Romans as a centre of trade and government, and had its baths, and theatres, and temples. But the end came at last, and there are few lands, once the seat of a thriving nation, more utterly desolate than that of Edom. From the ninth century of the Christian era it disappears from history (Robinson’s <span class= "ital">Researches, ii.</span> 575).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/jeremiah/49.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/49-17.htm" title="Also Edom shall be a desolation: every one that goes by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss at all the plagues thereof....">Jeremiah 49:17-19</a></span>. <span class="ital">Edom shall be a desolation; every one shall hiss, </span>&c. — See note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-16.htm" title="To make their land desolate, and a perpetual hissing; every one that passes thereby shall be astonished, and wag his head.">Jeremiah 18:16</a>. <span class="ital">As in the overthrow of Sodom, </span>&c. — A proverbial expression, denoting an utter destruction. <span class="ital">Behold, he shall come up like a lion, </span>&c. — This is a description of Nebuchadnezzar’s marching with his army against Idumea, whom the prophet compares to a lion coming out of his den near Jordan.

The phrase is characteristic of Jeremiah, who has no scruple in repeating a forcible expression, and so enforcing an important truth (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-11.htm">Jeremiah 25:11, 38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-23.htm">Jeremiah 50:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-43.htm">Jeremiah 51:43</a>). What so "astonishing" as the reverses of once flourishing kingdoms! For the Bible knows nothing of the "necessity" of the decay and death of nations. The "covenant" which Jehovah offers contains the pledge of indestructibility. <span class="cmt_word">Everyone that goeth by it,</span> etc. Another self-reminiscence (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-8.htm">Jeremiah 19:8</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/49.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-9.htm">Jeremiah 49:9</a> is a reproduction of <a href="http://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-5.htm">Obadiah 1:5</a>, but in such a way that what Obadiah brings forward as a comparison is directly applied by Jeremiah to the enemy: our prophet represents the enemy as grape-gatherers who leave nothing to glean, and as nocturnal thieves who destroy what is sufficient for them, i.e., destroy till they have enough, drag away and destroy as much as they can. The after-clauses, "they will not leave," etc., "they destroy," etc., are thus not to be taken as questions. The reference to Obadiah does not entitle us to supply &#1492;&#1500;&#1493;&#1488; from that passage. The connection here is somewhat different. The following verse is joined by means of &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, "for;" and the thought, "for I have stripped Esau, I have discovered his secret places," shows that the enemy is to be understood by the grape-gatherers and nocturnal thieves: he will leave nothing to glean - will plunder all the goods and treasures of Edom, even those that have been hidden. On this subject, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-6.htm">Obadiah 1:6</a>. &#1495;&#1513;&#1474;&#1507;, "to strip off leaves, make bare" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-26.htm">Jeremiah 13:26</a>), has been chosen with a regard to &#1504;&#1495;&#1508;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1468; in Obadiah. &#1493;&#1504;&#1495;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492; &#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500;, lit., "and he hides himself, he will not be able to do it;" i.e., Esau (Edom) tries to hide himself; he will not be able to do it - he will not remain concealed from the enemy. There are not sufficient grounds for changing the perf. &#1504;&#1495;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492;  equals &#1504;&#1495;&#1489;&#1468;&#1488;  into the inf. abs. &#1504;&#1495;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492;, as Ewald and Graf do. "His seed is destroyed," i.e., his family, the posterity of Esau, the Edomites, his brethren," the descendants of nations related to the family, and of others similar who had intermingled with them, as the Amalekites, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/36-12.htm">Genesis 36:12</a>, Horites, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/36-20.htm">Genesis 36:20</a>., Simeonites, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-42.htm">1 Chronicles 4:42</a>, "and his neighbours," the neighbouring tribes, as Dedan, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-8.htm">Jeremiah 49:8</a>, Thema and Buz, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-23.htm">Jeremiah 25:23</a>. "And he is not" is added to give intensity, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-7.htm">Isaiah 19:7</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-15.htm">Jeremiah 31:15</a>. The last idea is made more intensive by <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-11.htm">Jeremiah 49:11</a>, "Leave your orphans and widows." Edom is addressed, and the imperative expresses what must happen. The men of Edom will be obliged to leave their wives and children, and these will be left behind as widows and orphans, because the men fall in battle. Yet the Lord will care for them, so that they shall not perish. In this comfort there is contained a very bitter truth for the Edomites who hated Jahveh. &#1506;&#1494;&#1489;&#1492; is the imperative (Ewald, 228, a), not infinitive (Hitzig); and &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1496;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468; is a rare form of the jussive for &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1496;&#1495;&#1504;&#1492;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-7.htm">Ezekiel 37:7</a>; cf. Ewald, 191, b. Reasons are given for these threats in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-12.htm">Jeremiah 49:12</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-13.htm">Jeremiah 49:13</a>, first in the thought that Edom cannot continue to be the only one unpunished, then in the bringing forward of the solemnly uttered purpose of God. "Those who should not be compelled to drink." Those meant are the Israelites, who, as the people of God, ought to have been free from the penal judgment with which the Lord visits the nations. If, now, these are not left (spared such an infliction), still less can Edom, as a heathen nation, lay claim to exemption. By this Jeremiah does not mean to say that nay injustice befalls the Jews if they are obliged to drink the cup of the wrath of God, but merely that their having been chosen to be the people of God does not give them any right to exemption from the judgments of God on the world, i.e., if they make themselves like the heathen through their sins and vices. The inf. abs. &#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1493; for &#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1492; intensifies: "ye shall (must) drink." The idea is founded on that pervading <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25.htm">Jeremiah 25</a>, and there is use made of the words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-29.htm">Jeremiah 25:29</a>. The &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-13.htm">Jeremiah 49:13</a> is mainly dependent on the clause immediately preceding: "thou shalt certainly drink." On "by myself have I sworn" cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-5.htm">Jeremiah 22:5</a>. In the threat that Edom shall be laid waste there is an accumulation of words corresponding to the excitement of feeling accompanying an utterance under solemn oath. &#1495;&#1512;&#1489; is used instead of the more common &#1495;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492;; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-18.htm">Jeremiah 25:18</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-22.htm">Jeremiah 44:22</a>, etc. &#1495;&#1512;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514; &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-9.htm">Jeremiah 25:9</a>. Bozrah was at that time the capital of the Edomites (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-22.htm">Jeremiah 49:22</a>); it lay south from the Dead Sea, on the site of the village Buseireh (Little Bozrah), in Jebal, which is still surrounded by a castle and with ruins of considerable extent, and is situated on an eminence; see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-12.htm">Amos 1:12</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/36-33.htm">Genesis 36:33</a>. "And all its cities," i.e., the rest of the cities of Idumea; cf. &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;&#1492;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-2.htm">Jeremiah 49:2</a>.</body></html>
