Elam, like the other nations in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/25-13.htm" title="And I will bring on that land all my words which I have pronounced against it, even all that is written in this book, which Jeremiah has prophesied against all the nations.">Jeremiah 25:13-25</a>, and in Jeremiah 48, 49, had apparently risen in rebellion. Of this we have, perhaps, a trace in the statement of <a href="http://apocrypha.org/judith/1-1.htm" title="In the twelfth year of the reign of Nabuchodonosor, who reigned in Nineve, the great city; in the days of Arphaxad, which reigned over the Medes in Ecbatane,">Judith 1:1-13</a>, that Nebuchadnezzar defeated Arphaxad, a king of Media, in the seventeenth year of his reign. The words find an historical fulfilment in the fact that Shushan, “in the province of Elam,” became one of the royal residences of the Chaldæan kings (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-2.htm" title="And I saw in a vision; and it came to pass, when I saw, that I was at Shushan in the palace, which is in the province of Elam; and I saw in a vision, and I was by the river of Ulai.">Daniel 8:2</a>), and continued to be so under those of Persia, who, as regards the population of Elam proper, were as conquerors (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/1-1.htm" title="The words of Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah. And it came to pass in the month Chisleu, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the palace,">Nehemiah 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/1-2.htm" title="That in those days, when the king Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom, which was in Shushan the palace,">Esther 1:2</a>). A like prediction of the fall of Elam, among other nations, before the attack of the King of Babylon is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-24.htm" title="There is Elam and all her multitude round about her grave, all of them slain, fallen by the sword, which are gone down uncircumcised into the nether parts of the earth, which caused their terror in the land of the living; yet have they borne their shame with them that go down to the pit.">Ezekiel 32:24</a>.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/49.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>49:34-39 The Elamites were the Persians; they acted against God's Israel, and must be reckoned with. Evil pursues sinners. God will make them know that he reigns. Yet the destruction of Elam shall not be for ever. But this promise was to have its full accomplishment in the days of the Messiah. In reading the Divine assurance of the destruction of all the enemies of the church, the believer sees that the issue of the holy war is not doubtful. It is blessed to recollect, that He who is for us, is more than all against us.

The throne of Cyrus, God's instrument, set up over Media, of which Elam was a part, may be meant [Grotius]; or rather, that of Nebuchadnezzar (Jer 43:10). Then the restoration of Elam (Jer 49:39) will refer partly to that which took place on the reduction of Babylon by Cyrus, prince of Persia and Media.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/49.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> God here calls the throne of Nebuchadnezzar, or Cyrus, or Alexander, (whoever he was that conquered the Persians,) his throne: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. Because God gave it the conqueror. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. Or because God showed himself the Lord of hosts, or the Lord of the whole earth, by disposing the kingdom of Persia at his pleasure. He doth not threaten the destruction of the whole nation, but the making of it all tributary, so as it should have no kings nor princes of its own. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/49.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And I will set my throne in Elam,.... Either when Alexander subdued it, or Cyrus, or rather Nebuchadnezzar, whose palace probably was, as it is certain his successors was, in Shushan in Elam, as before observed from <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-2.htm">Daniel 8:2</a>. This is called the Lord's throne, because he gave it to him; his conquest of Elam, and his dominion over it, were from him: <p>and will destroy from thence the king and the princes, saith the Lord; so that there should be no more kings of Elam, and princes and nobles of their own, after this time; and because mention is made of the kings of Elam in the times of Nebuchadnezzar, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-25.htm">Jeremiah 25:25</a>; though that is observed in the first year of his reign, some have thought that it is best to understand it or Cyrus, the Lord's servant and anointed; and whose throne might well be called the throne of God, which he gave him, and set him on in an eminent manner, not only there, but elsewhere; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/1-2.htm">Ezra 1:2</a>; and when this country of Elam, or Elymais, became at part of the Persian empire, and never had any more kings to reign over it separately.

The enemy is to march against a peaceful nation, dwelling securely, that has neither doors nor bars, i.e., does not live in cities surrounded by walls with gates and bars (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-7.htm">1 Samuel 23:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-5.htm">Deuteronomy 3:5</a>), whose territory, therefore, is easily conquered.
