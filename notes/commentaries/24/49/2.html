We read not how or when this prophecy was fulfilled, whether by the Maccabees, <span class="bld">/APC 1Ma 5:6</span>, or rather after the coming of Christ, when most of these nations were destroyed. God threatens not only their metropolis, which was Rabbah their mother city, but all the other cities belonging to the Ammonites, which were as it were daughters to Rabbah. But how the last clause of this prophecy was ever fulfilled, if it were not in the time of the Maccabees, I cannot understand; for though they were swallowed up afterward by the Roman empire, yet Israel being also subdued by them, and scattered into all parts, it is not likely that many of them were suffered to, abide in any considerable numbers in a country so near their own. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/49.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the Lord,.... Or, "are coming" (y); as they did, in a very little time after this prophecy: <p>that I will cause an alarm of war to be heard in Rabbah of the Ammonites; the metropolis of the Ammonites; it was their royal city in the times of David, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-1.htm">1 Kings 11:1</a>; called by Polybius (z) Rabbahamana; and by Ptolemy (a) Philadelphia, which name it had from Ptolemy Philadelphus, who rebuilt it; this the Lord threatens with the sound of the trumpet, the alarm of war, or the noise of warriors, as the Targum; the Chaldean army under Nebuchadnezzar, who, about five years after the destruction of Jerusalem, subdued the Ammonites, as Josephus (b) relates: <p>and it shall be a desolate heap; be utterly destroyed; its walls broken down, and houses demolished, and made a heap of rubbish: and <p>her daughters shall be burnt with fire: Rabbah was the mother city, and the other cities of the Ammonites were her daughters, which are threatened to be destroyed with fire by the enemy; or it may mean the villages round about Rabbah, it being usual in Scripture for villages to be called the daughters of cities; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-46.htm">Ezekiel 16:46</a>; so the Targum here paraphrases it, <p>"the inhabitants of her villages shall be burnt with fire:'' <p>then shall Israel be heirs unto them that were his heirs, saith the Lord: that is, shall inherit their land again, which the Ammonites pretended to be the lawful heirs of; yea, not only possess their own land, but the land of Ammon too: this was fulfilled not immediately upon the destruction of Ammon, but in part upon the return of the Jews from the Babylonish captivity, when they repossessed their own country; and partly in the times of the Maccabees, when they subdued the Ammonites, <p>"Afterward he passed over to the children of Ammon, where he found a mighty power, and much people, with Timotheus their captain.''

He who flees from the fear shall fall into the pit, and he who goes up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare; for I will bring against it, against Moab, the year of their recompense, saith Jahveh."<p>The subject of &#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-39.htm">Jeremiah 48:39</a> is Moab viewed as a nation. &#1492;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468; might be imperative, but in this case we would be obliged to take &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473; also as an imperative (as Hitzig and Graf do). It is simpler to take both forms as perfects: "they howl...Moab turns the back, is ashamed" ( equals  for shame). On &#1492;&#1497;&#1492; &#1500;&#1513;&#1474;&#1495;&#1511;, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-26.htm">Jeremiah 48:26</a>. &#1502;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;, object of terror, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-17.htm">Jeremiah 17:17</a>. "All who are round about him," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-17.htm">Jeremiah 48:17</a>. "For (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-40.htm">Jeremiah 48:40</a>) the enemy rushes down upon Moab like an eagle, and seizes Kerioth and all his strongholds." The subject is left unnamed, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-18.htm">Jeremiah 46:18</a>, but it is Nebuchadnezzar. The figure of the eagle, darting down in flight on its prey, is founded on <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-49.htm">Deuteronomy 28:49</a> (on &#1488;&#1500;- for &#1506;&#1500;, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-22.htm">Jeremiah 49:22</a>). Kerioth, the capital, is taken (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-24.htm">Jeremiah 48:24</a>); so are the other strongholds or fastnesses of the country. The mere fact that &#1511;&#1512;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; has the article does not justify any one in taking it as an appellative, "the cities;" this appears from a comparison of <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/2-2.htm">Amos 2:2</a> with this verse. No plural of &#1511;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492; occurs anywhere. Then the fear of death falls on the heroes of Moab like a woman in labour. &#1502;&#1510;&#1512;&#1492;, partic. Hiphil from &#1510;&#1512;&#1512;, uterum comprimens, is found only here and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-22.htm">Jeremiah 49:22</a>, where the figure is repeated. Moab is annihilated, so that it is no longer a nation (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-2.htm">Jeremiah 48:2</a>), because it has risen up in pride against the God of Israel; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-26.htm">Jeremiah 48:26</a>. He who flees from one danger falls into the other. The play on the words &#1508;&#1468;&#1495;&#1491;, fear, horror, &#1508;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;, pit, and &#1508;&#1468;&#1495;, spring-trap, as well as the mode in which it is carried out, is taken from <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-17.htm">Isaiah 24:17</a>., - a prophecy of the judgment on the world; see a similar idea presented in <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/5-19.htm">Amos 5:19</a>, but somewhat differently expressed. The Kethib &#1492;&#1504;&#1497;&#1505;, perfect Hiphil, "he flees," is less suitable than the Qeri &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1505; (after Isaiah). The last clause, "for I will bring," etc., is quite in Jeremiah's peculiar style; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-23.htm">Jeremiah 4:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-12.htm">Jeremiah 23:12</a>. &#1488;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492; belongs to &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1502;&#1493;&#1488;&#1489;: the noun is anticipated by the pronoun, as frequently occurs; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-14.htm">Jeremiah 9:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/41-3.htm">Jeremiah 41:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/43-11.htm">Jeremiah 43:11</a>. </body></html>
