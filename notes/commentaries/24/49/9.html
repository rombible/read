The scope of the prophet in this place is only to show that Edom should be totally destroyed; their destruction should not be like the gleaning of grapes, where the gatherers content themselves with taking the principal clusters, but for single grapes, or small clusters, they leave them; nor yet like the robbings of thieves, who take for their hunger, and when they have got enough leave the rest. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/49.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>If grape gatherers come to thee, would they not leave some gleaning grapes?.... If gatherers of grapes, at the time of the vintage, should come into thy fields to gather the grapes, being ripe, would not they leave some for the poor to glean? certainly they would, and not take every cluster. The Targum renders it, <p>"if thy spoilers, as grape gatherers, should come to thee,'' &amp;c. <p>if thieves by night, they will destroy till they have enough; who break into houses by night, these will eat and drink as much as is sufficient, and carry off what serves their turn; but they seldom take away everything they find in a house; they leave some things behind them; but it is suggested that the Chaldeans should take away all from the Edomites, and leave them nothing; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-5.htm">Obadiah 1:5</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/49.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">If <span class="cverse3">{l}</span> grapegatherers come to thee, would they not leave <i>some</i> gleaning grapes? if thieves by night, they will destroy till they have enough.</span><p>(l) Meaning that God would utterly destroy them and not spare one, though the grape gatherers leave some grapes, and thieves seek but till they have enough, Ob 1:5.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/49.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">9</span>. <span class="ital">would they not leave some gleaning grapes</span>?] The <span class="ital">v</span>. is based on <a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-5.htm" title="If thieves came to you, if robbers by night, (how are you cut off!) would they not have stolen till they had enough? if the grape gatherers came to you, would they not leave some grapes?">Obadiah 1:5</a>, but while the general sense is the same, Obadiah contrasts the extremities to which the foe proceeds with the comparative moderation shewn by grape-gatherers or thieves.

The summons given to Heshbon to howl implies that this city, formerly the residence of Sihon, was then in possession of the Ammonites. There is obscurity in the clause announcing the reason, "for &#1506;&#1497; (lxx &#x393;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#836;&#769;) is laid waste:" the word seems to be a proper noun, but there is no city of this name known in the Ammonite country, or the land east of the Jordan; while we must not think of Ai (&#1492;&#1506;&#1497;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/7-2.htm">Joshua 7:2</a>.), which was situated on the west side of the Jordan. Venema and Ewald are inclined to take the word as an appellative, synonymous with &#1514;&#1468;&#1500;, "ruins" (which is the meaning of &#1506;&#1497;), and regard it as the subject of Rabbah, the capital, "because it has been laid in ruins." But a comparison of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-20.htm">Jeremiah 48:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-20.htm">Jeremiah 4:20</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/11-3.htm">Zechariah 11:3</a>, rather favours our taking &#1506;&#1497; as the subject. Graf and others would therefore change &#1506;&#1497; into &#1506;&#1512;, as (they say) the capital of the Ammonites was called by the Israelites. But there are no historical traces of this designation of Rabbah. There remains hardly any other course open than to consider &#1506;&#1497; as the name of an important Ammonite city. The mere fact that it is mentioned nowhere else cannot form a strong foundation for the objection against this assumption, for we do not find anywhere a list of the Ammonite cities. The inhabitants of the other towns are to put on signs of sorrow, and go about mourning "in the enclosures," i.e., in the open country, since the cities, being reduced to ashes, no longer afford shelter. Most expositors understand &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514; as meaning sheep-folds (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/32-16.htm">Numbers 32:16</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/32-24.htm">Numbers 32:24</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-36.htm">Numbers 32:36</a>); but there is no reason for taking this special view of the meaning of the word, according to which &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514; would stand for  &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514; &#1510;&#1488;&#1503;. &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1512;&#1492; and &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1512; also mean the wall of a vineyard, or the hedges of the vineyards, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/22-24.htm">Numbers 22:24</a> specially the enclosure of the vineyards at the cross-roads in the country east of the Jordan. This is the meaning here. We must not, with Ngelsbach, think of city walls on which one could run up and down, for the purpose of taking measures for defence: the words to not signify the walls of a city. The carrying away into exile of Malcam with his priests and princes gives the reason for the sorrow. &#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1468;&#1501; is here not the earthly king, but the god Milcom viewed as the king of the Ammonites, as is clear from the addition &#1499;&#1468;&#1492;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493; noitidd, and from the parallel passage in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-7.htm">Jeremiah 48:7</a>. The clause is copied from <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/1-15.htm">Amos 1:15</a>, but &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; has been substituted for &#1499;&#1468;&#1492;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493;, in order that &#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1468;&#1501; may be understood of Milcom, the chief deity (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-5.htm">1 Kings 11:5</a>).</body></html>
