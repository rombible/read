In PP. 120:5 it appears as the representative of the fierce nomadic life of the Arabians. Hazor appears as the name of many cities in Palestine (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/11-1.htm" title="And it came to pass, when Jabin king of Hazor had heard those things, that he sent to Jobab king of Madon, and to the king of Shimron, and to the king of Achshaph,">Joshua 11:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-23.htm" title="And Kedesh, and Hazor, and Ithnan,">Joshua 15:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-36.htm" title="And Adamah, and Ramah, and Hazor,">Joshua 19:36</a>), but the combination with Kedar points to quite a different region. The probable explanation is that Jeremiah uses the term (as a like word, <span class= "ital">hazērein, </span>is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-11.htm" title="Let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up their voice, the villages that Kedar does inhabit: let the inhabitants of the rock sing, let them shout from the top of the mountains.">Isaiah 42:11</a> for the “villages” of Kedar) for the region in which the Kedar Arabs had ceased to be nomadic, and had made a permanent settlement. According to Niebuhr (<span class= "ital">Assur u. Bab., </span>p. 210) it answers to the modern <span class= "ital">Hadschar </span>in the angle formed by the southern course of the Euphrates and the Persian Gulf.<p><span class= "bld">Spoil the men of the east.</span>—Literally, the <span class= "ital">B’eni-Kedem. </span>or children of the East. The term appears in the Old Testament history from a very early date (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/29-1.htm" title="Then Jacob went on his journey, and came into the land of the people of the east.">Genesis 29:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-3.htm" title="And so it was, when Israel had sown, that the Midianites came up, and the Amalekites, and the children of the east, even they came up against them;">Judges 6:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-33.htm" title="Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of the east were gathered together, and went over, and pitched in the valley of Jezreel.">Judges 6:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/7-12.htm" title="And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand by the sea side for multitude.">Judges 7:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-30.htm" title="And Solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east country, and all the wisdom of Egypt.">1Kings 4:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-3.htm" title="His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east.">Job 1:3</a>), and has, as might be expected, though obviously indicating a nomadic form of life, like that of the Midianites, a somewhat wide and undefined connotation. The picture of the attack on them presents a marked contrast to that of the attack on Damascus: not palaces and treasures, but tents and flocks, the curtains or hangings of the tent, their implements (weapons, kneading troughs, and the like), their very camels, seized by the conquerors.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/jeremiah/49.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/49-28.htm" title="Concerning Kedar, and concerning the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon shall smite, thus said the LORD; Arise you, go up to Kedar, and spoil the men of the east....">Jeremiah 49:28-29</a></span>. <span class="ital">Concerning Kedar and the kingdoms of Hazor </span>— Kedar is well known to have been one of the sons of Ishmael, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-13.htm" title="And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,">Genesis 25:13</a>, who settled in Arabia. But of Hazor we find no satisfactory account given by commentators. There is, indeed, a city called <span class="ital">Hazor, </span>mentioned <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/11-10.htm" title="And Joshua at that time turned back, and took Hazor, and smote the king thereof with the sword: for Hazor beforetime was the head of all those kingdoms.">Joshua 11:10</a>, and in other parts of Scripture: but this was in the land of Canaan; whereas <span class="ital">the kingdoms of Hazor, </span>here mentioned, were evidently in Arabia, in the neighbourhood, at least, of Kedar. Among the sons of Joktan, however, who were prior to the Ishmaelites in Arabia, and whose descendants are therefore looked on as the only genuine Arabs, we find one whose name was <span class="ital">Hazar-maveth, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/10-26.htm" title="And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah,...">Genesis 10:26-30</a>. And, as by Kedar all the descendants of Ishmael are probably here designed, so all the other branches of the family of Joktan may, in like manner, be included under the general name of Hazor. And perhaps the most probable reason why the Arabians are called <span class="ital">a mingled people </span>is, that they were thus made up of the people of different descents; some of them being sprung from Joktan, others from Ishmael, to whom must be added the sons of Abraham by Keturah, who are also said to have been settled in <span class="ital">Kedem, </span>or the east country, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-6.htm" title="But to the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, to the east country.">Genesis 25:6</a>, and perhaps other families besides.

A new prophecy concerning the Arabians; for Kedar was a son of Ishmael, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-13.htm">Genesis 25:13</a>; whose posterity inhabited Arabia Petraea. Hazor was Petra itself, the metropolis of the country, whose king had several petty kings and kingdoms under him; for this is not the Hazor in the land of Canaan destroyed by Joshua, which had been the head of several kingdoms; and where Jabin king of Canaan afterwards reigned, <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/11-10.htm">Joshua 11:10</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-2.htm">Judges 4:2</a>; though some think that some of those Hazorites in Joshua's time made their escape, and fled into these parts, and built a city, and called it after the name of the former: <p>which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon shall smite, thus saith the Lord: that is, "thus saith the Lord concerning", or "unto", or "against Kedar" (p), &amp;c. as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-1.htm">Jeremiah 49:1</a>; which the king of Babylon "hath smitten"; the past for the future, common in prophetic language: or, "is about to smite" (q); would do it in a very little time; for the phrase, "thus saith the Lord", is not to be connected with what follows after, but with what goes before; though indeed the next words are the words of the Lord to the Chaldeans: <p>arise ye, go up to Kedar; in a hostile manner; invade that country, and possess it: <p>and spoil the men of the east; the Arabians, which lay east of Judea and Babylon: or, "the children of Kedem" (r); the same with Kedemah, another son of Ishmael, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-15.htm">Genesis 25:15</a>; whose posterity dwelt still more to the east; so Kimchi; though the Targum renders it "the children of the east". <p>(p) "ad Cedar", V.

This utterance, like the last, is rejected by Gi. and Co., though accepted, at any rate as containing a genuine element, by Kuenen, Erbt, and others.
