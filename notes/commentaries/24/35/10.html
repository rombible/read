He lived nearly 300 years before, 2Ki 10:15. Jonadab charged his posterity not to drink wine. He also appointed them to dwell in tents, or movable dwelling: this would teach them not to think of settling any where in this world. To keep low, would be the way to continue long in the land where they were strangers. Humility and contentment are always the best policy, and men's surest protection. Also, that they might not run into unlawful pleasures, they were to deny themselves even lawful delights. The consideration that we are strangers and pilgrims should oblige us to abstain from all fleshly lusts. Let them have little to lose, and then losing times would be the less dreadful: let them sit loose to what they had, and then they might with less pain be stript of it. Those are in the best frame to meet sufferings who live a life of self-denial, and who despise the vanities of the world. Jonadab's posterity observed these rules strictly, only using proper means for their safety in a time of general suffering.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/35.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Our father - Not merely our ancestor, but the founder of our institutions. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/35.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. all that he &#8230; charged us &#8230; all our days, we &#8230; wives &#8230; sons &#8230; daughters&#8212;unreserved obedience in all particulars, at all times, and on the part of all, without exception: in these respects Israel's obedience to God was wanting.

Jaazaniah was probably the then chief of the Rechabites. The chamber of the sons of Hanan was situated next the princes' chamber, which stood over that of Maaseiah the door-keeper. Nothing further is known about Hanan the son of Jigdaliah; here he is called "the man of God," an honourable title of the prophets - see e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-22.htm">1 Kings 12:22</a> - for, according to the usual mode of construction, &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1492;&#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; does not belong to Jigdaliah, but to Hanan, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/28-1.htm">Jeremiah 28:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-1.htm">Zechariah 1:1</a>. "The chamber of the princes" is the chamber where the princes, the chiefs of the people, used to assemble in the temple. Its position is more exactly described by &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500; &#1500;&#1500;, "over the chamber of Maaseiah," but not very clearly for us, since the buildings of the temple fore-courts are nowhere else more exactly described; however, see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-10.htm">Jeremiah 36:10</a>. Maaseiah was &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512; &#1492;&#1505;&#1468;&#1507;, "keeper of the threshold," i.e., overseer of the watchmen of the temple gates, of which, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-24.htm">Jeremiah 52:24</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-18.htm">2 Kings 25:18</a>, there were three, who are there mentioned along with the high priest and his substitute Maaseiah is probably the same whose son Zephaniah was &#1499;&#1468;&#1492;&#1503; &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1492; , cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-24.htm">Jeremiah 52:24</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-3.htm">Jeremiah 37:3</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-25.htm">Jeremiah 29:25</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-1.htm">Jeremiah 21:1</a>.</body></html>
