The name Jeremiah may possibly indicate that there was some previous connexion between the Rechabites and the prophet’s family.<p><span class= "bld">His brethren, and all his sons . . .</span>—The words may be taken in their literal sense, but on the assumption that the Rechabites were a religious order rather than a family, the terms may indicate different stages or degrees of membership, the “brethren” being those who were fully incorporated, the “sons,” those who like “the sons of the prophets” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-38.htm" title="And Elisha came again to Gilgal: and there was a dearth in the land; and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him: and he said to his servant, Set on the great pot, and seethe pottage for the sons of the prophets.">2Kings 4:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-1.htm" title="And the sons of the prophets said to Elisha, Behold now, the place where we dwell with you is too strait for us.">2Kings 6:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-1.htm" title="And Elisha the prophet called one of the children of the prophets, and said to him, Gird up your loins, and take this box of oil in your hand, and go to Ramothgilead:">2Kings 9:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/7-14.htm" title="Then answered Amos, and said to Amaziah, I was no prophet, neither was I a prophet's son; but I was an herdsman, and a gatherer of sycomore fruit:">Amos 7:14</a>) were still in training as probationers. Such a use of the word “brethren” would grow naturally out of that of “sons,” and is found in this wider sense of priests and Levites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/15-5.htm" title="Of the sons of Kohath; Uriel the chief, and his brothers an hundred and twenty:">1Chronicles 15:5-18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/26-7.htm" title="The sons of Shemaiah; Othni, and Rephael, and Obed, Elzabad, whose brothers were strong men, Elihu, and Semachiah.">1Chronicles 26:7-32</a> and elsewhere) and of prophets (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-9.htm" title="Then said he to me, See you do it not: for I am your fellow servant, and of your brothers the prophets, and of them which keep the sayings of this book: worship God.">Revelation 22:9</a>).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/35.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>35:1-11 Jonadab was famous for wisdom and piety. He lived nearly 300 years before, 2Ki 10:15. Jonadab charged his posterity not to drink wine. He also appointed them to dwell in tents, or movable dwelling: this would teach them not to think of settling any where in this world. To keep low, would be the way to continue long in the land where they were strangers. Humility and contentment are always the best policy, and men's surest protection. Also, that they might not run into unlawful pleasures, they were to deny themselves even lawful delights. The consideration that we are strangers and pilgrims should oblige us to abstain from all fleshly lusts. Let them have little to lose, and then losing times would be the less dreadful: let them sit loose to what they had, and then they might with less pain be stript of it. Those are in the best frame to meet sufferings who live a life of self-denial, and who despise the vanities of the world. Jonadab's posterity observed these rules strictly, only using proper means for their safety in a time of general suffering.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/35.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Jaazaniah was the chief of that portion of the tribe which had taken refuge in Jerusalem. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/35.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3.
