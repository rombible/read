The Jewish historian Hegesippus (see Euseb. <span class= "ital">Hist. Eccl. </span>ii. 23), in his account of the martyrdom of James the Just, names the sons of the Rechabites as looking on in reverential sympathy with one whose life, like their own, carried the Nazarite type to its highest perfection. In the account which Diodorus Siculns (xix. 94) gives of the Nabathæans as neither sowing seed, nor planting fruit-trees, nor building houses, and enforcing this rule of life under pain of death, we can scarcely fail to recognise the Rechabite type. Benjamin of Tudela, in the twelfth century, reports that he found 100,000 Jews who were named Rechabites, and who lived after their fashion near <span class= "ital">El Jubar, </span>and that they were governed by a prince of the house of David. More recent travellers, Dr. Wolff (<span class= "ital">Journal, </span>1829, ii. 334; 1839, <span class= "ital">p. </span>389) and Signor Pierotti (<span class= "ital">Transactions of British Association, </span>1862), report that they have met tribes near Mecca, on the Dead Sea, or in Yemen and Senaar, who observed the rule of Jonadab, claimed to be his descendants, referred to <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-19.htm" title="Therefore thus said the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Jonadab the son of Rechab shall not want a man to stand before me for ever.">Jeremiah 35:19</a> as fulfilled in them, and led the life of devout Jews. It is probable, however, that in these later instances we may trace the effect of the Wahabee ascetic movement among the Mahomedan Arabs, identifying its rule with the old practice of the son of Rechab (Burckhardt: <span class= "ital">Bedouins and Wahabys, </span>p. 283).<p>The words “stand before” have, however, in Hebrew a distinct secondary meaning. It was a definitely liturgical expression for the ministrations of the Levites who were chosen to “stand before” the Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-8.htm" title="At that time the LORD separated the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the covenant of the LORD, to stand before the LORD to minister to him, and to bless in his name, to this day.">Deuteronomy 10:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-5.htm" title="For the LORD your God has chosen him out of all your tribes, to stand to minister in the name of the LORD, him and his sons for ever.">Deuteronomy 18:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-7.htm" title="Then he shall minister in the name of the LORD his God, as all his brothers the Levites do, which stand there before the LORD.">Deuteronomy 18:7</a>), and a like meaning is prominent in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-10.htm" title="And come and stand before me in this house, which is called by my name, and say, We are delivered to do all these abominations?">Jeremiah 7:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-19.htm" title="Therefore thus said the LORD, If you return, then will I bring you again, and you shall stand before me: and if you take forth the precious from the vile, you shall be as my mouth: let them return to you; but return not you to them.">Jeremiah 15:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-22.htm" title="And the men turned their faces from there, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the LORD.">Genesis 18:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-28.htm" title="And Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before it in those days,) saying, Shall I yet again go out to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother, or shall I cease? And the LORD said, Go up; for to morrow I will deliver them into your hand.">Judges 20:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/134-1.htm" title="Behold, bless you the LORD, all you servants of the LORD, which by night stand in the house of the LORD.">Psalm 134:1</a>. The Targum of this passage, indeed, actually gives “ministering before me” as its paraphrase. The natural inference would be that the Rechabites were by these words admitted, in virtue of their Nazarite character, to serve as Levites in the Temple—to be, in fact, a higher class of Nethinim (see Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-2.htm" title="Now the first inhabitants that dwelled in their possessions in their cities were, the Israelites, the priests, Levites, and the Nethinims.">1Chronicles 9:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-43.htm" title="The Nethinims: the children of Ziha, the children of Hasupha, the children of Tabbaoth,">Ezra 2:43</a>)—and this view is confirmed (1) by the fact that the LXX. ascribes Psalms 71 to “the sons of Jonadab, the first that were led captive;<span class= "ital">” </span>(2) that a son of Rechab is associated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-14.htm" title="But the dung gate repaired Malchiah the son of Rechab, the ruler of part of Bethhaccerem; he built it, and set up the doors thereof, the locks thereof, and the bars thereof.">Nehemiah 3:14</a> with priests and Levites and nobles in repairing the walls of Jerusalem; (3) in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-55.htm" title="And the families of the scribes which dwelled at Jabez; the Tirathites, the Shimeathites, and Suchathites. These are the Kenites that came of Hemath, the father of the house of Rechab.">1Chronicles 2:55</a> the Rechabites have become scribes, and in the Vulgate (evidence of a Jewish tradition as to the meaning of the words), the proper names of the English version, “Tirathites, Shimeathites, and Sucathites,” which add nothing to our knowledge, are represented by “c<span class= "ital">anentes et resonantes et in tabernaculis commorantes” </span>(“singing, and playing instruments, and dwelling in tents”), which unite the functions of Levites with the mode of life of the Rechabites. So Hegesippus (as above) speaks of priests who were of the sons of Rechab in the Apostolic age.<p><span class= "bld"><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/35.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>35:12-19 The trial of the Rechabites' constancy was for a sign; it made the disobedience of the Jews to God the more marked. The Rechabites were obedient to one who was but a man like themselves, and Jonadab never did for his seed what God has done for his people. Mercy is promised to the Rechabites. We are not told respecting the performance of this promise; but doubtless it was performed, and travellers say the Rechabites may be found a separate people to this day. Let us follow the counsels of our pious forefathers, and we shall find good in so doing.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/35.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Travelers bear witness to the existence of a large tribe who represent themselves as the descendants of the Rechabites. The prediction was also literally fulfilled in the Rechabites being in some way incorporated into the tribe of Levi, whose office especially it was to "stand before" Yahweh <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-8.htm">Deuteronomy 10:8</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/35.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19. not want a man to stand before me&#8212;There shall always be left representatives of the clan to worship Me (Jer 15:1, 19); or, "before Me" means simple existence, for all things in existence are in God's sight (Ps 89:36). The Rechabites returned from the captivity. Wolff found traces of them in Arabia.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/35.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">For ever</span> here signifies the <span class="ital">ever</span> of the Jewish state or church; whether the promise relates to the abiding of Jonadab’s family, when many families of the Jews were quite rooted out, cut off, and extinct, or to some special favour that God would show them, or to some place of office they should have in or about the temple, (as some judge, because, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-55.htm" title="And the families of the scribes which dwelled at Jabez; the Tirathites, the Shimeathites, and Suchathites.

But it is a question of more moment, How God promiseth a reward to these sons’ of Jonadab for obeying the command of their father, and whether they had sinned if they had not obeyed this command of Jonadab; which brings in another question, <span class="ital">Whether parents have a power to oblige their children in matters which God hath left at liberty</span>. To which I answer, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. <span class="ital">God might reward these Rechabites for their reverence and obedience to Jonadab their father, though these were not strictly, by the Divine law, obliged thus far to have obeyed him</span>; as he rewarded David for his thoughts in his heart to build him a house, though it was not God’s will that he should do it; so as God’s promise of the reward doth not prove their obedience in this particular to have been their duty. Admit that it remained still a matter of liberty, yet the general honour and reverence they testified might be rewarded by God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. Unquestionably <span class="ital">parents have not a power to determine children in all things as to which God hath left them a liberty</span>, for then they have a power to make their children slaves, and to take away all their natural liberty. To marry or not, and to this or that person, is matter of liberty. Parents cannot in this case determine their children; Bethuel, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-58.htm" title="And they called Rebekah, and said to her, Will you go with this man? And she said, I will go.">Genesis 24:58</a></span>, asketh Rebekah if she would go with Abraham’s servant before he would send her. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. <span class="ital">In matters of civil concernment they have a far greater power than in matters of religion</span>. All souls are God’s, and conscience can be under no other dominion than that of God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>4. <span class="ital">In civil things parents have a great power, during the nonage of children, and after also in matters which concern their parents’ good</span>, as to command them to assist them, to help to supply their necessities, &c. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>5. <span class="ital">Parents being set over children, and instead of God to them, as it is their duty to advise their children to the best of their ability for their good; so it is the duty of children to receive their advice, and not to depart from it, unless they see circumstances so mistaken by parents, or so altered by the providence of God, as they may reasonably judge their parents, had these known or foreseen it, would not have so advised.</span> But that parents have an absolute power to determine children in all things as to which God hath not forbidden them, and that children by the law of God are obliged to an obedience to all such commands, however they may see their parents mistaken, or God by his providence may have altered circumstances, I see no reason to conclude. Jonadab had prudently advised his sons as before mentioned; they were things they might do, and which by experience they found not hurtful to them, but of great profit and advantage, and that with reference to all the ends of man’s life: herein they yield obedience, and pay a reverence to their parent; this pleaseth God, he promiseth to reward them with the continuance of their family, according to what he had said, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-12.htm" title="Honor your father and your mother: that your days may be long on the land which the LORD your God gives you.">Exodus 20:12</a></span>, in the fifth commandment, which the apostle calleth the first commandment with promise. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/35.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel,.... Who has enjoined children obedience to their parents, and has promised to reward it, and does: <p>Jonadab the son of Rechab shall not want a man to stand before me for ever; which may be understood of a long time, of ages to come; or as long as the people of the Jews were a people, or the world should stand, the posterity of this man should continue: or, "a man shall not be cut off from Jonadab &amp;c." (h); his offspring shall never fail. It is certain that some of this family returned from the captivity, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-55.htm">1 Chronicles 2:55</a>; and, according to Scaliger (i), the Hasidaeans sprung from them. And, if any credit could be given to Benjamin Tudelensis, there were Rechabites in the twelfth century, since the times of Christ; for he tells (k) us, that in his travels he found a place where Jews dwelt, who were called Rechabites. The phrase, "to stand before me", is by the Targum paraphrased, <p>"ministering before me;'' <p>serving and worshipping God, for they were religious people; that is, in their own families, carrying on religious worship among themselves, and not in the temple, where they had no office, and did no service; though some think they had, because called scribes, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-55.htm">1 Chronicles 2:55</a>. Kimchi says that some of their Rabbins asserted that the daughters of these people married priests, and so some of their children's children offered sacrifice on the altar. And if what Eusebius reports from Hegesippus is true, there were priests of this family after the times of Christ; for he says (l), that when the Jews were stoning James the just, a priest of the sons of Rechab cried out, saying, stop, what are ye doing? but these testimonies are not to be depended on; however, we may be sure of this, that the promise of God shall not fail, but be certainly accomplished. Very appropriate are the words of the learned Alting (m) upon this subject: <p>"not only the Lord promises length of life to the obedient, which proselytes, equally with Israelites, have the promise of; but, particularly, that the posterity of Jonadab should not perish, should have a place in the church of God, and an admission to the gracious enjoyment of God; not as priests and Levites, but as other Israelites and strangers, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/56-4.htm">Isaiah 56:4</a>; so that the posterity of Jonadab must still continue, and hope of restoration of them with the Israelites remains; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-36.htm">Jeremiah 31:36</a>; but in the same way and manner; so that being equally sharers in exile, they are to be restored after a long interruption. Indeed, the family is not at this day known; but from the ignorance of men, to the denial of a thing, there is no available argument. Families cannot be confounded, since they descend by the fathers; mothers do not belong to them; and as is the father as to tribe, so also is the son and grandson, and so on. A genealogical series may perish from the knowledge of men, but not from the nature of things, and the knowledge of God. Though the seeds of wheat, barley, and other things, may be mixed together, that men cannot distinguish them, yet their distinction does not perish; and God not only knows it, but also discovers it, when he makes every seed to rise in its own body, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-37.htm">1 Corinthians 15:37</a>; so must we judge concerning families.'' <p>Perhaps, since these Rechabites were proselytes, and not Israelites, the conversion of the Gentiles may be respected; who are priests in a spiritual sense, and minister before the Lord, offering up, through Christ, the spiritual sacrifices of prayer and praise; and such a generation to serve the Lord will never be wanting. <p>(h)    "non exidetur vir Jonadabo", Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator, Schmidt, &amp;c.

Hist</span>. II. 23) where “priests of the sons of Rechab” are spoken of. Benjamin of Tudela, a Jewish traveller of the 12th century, mentions a body of Jews who were called Rechabites, and whose customs corresponded with those detailed in Jeremiah. Dr Wolff (<span class="ital">Journal</span>, 1829) describes a body of Rechabites near Mecca who claimed to be sons of Jonadab. But it is by no means clear that the title in these three cases meant anything more than a certain amount of asceticism.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/35.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The example of the Rechabites is one for Judah. - Jeremiah is to proclaim the word of the Lord to the people of Judah, as follows: <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-13.htm">Jeremiah 35:13</a>. "Thus saith Jahveh of hosts, the God of Israel: Go and say to the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Will ye not receive instruction by listening to my words? saith Jahveh. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-14.htm">Jeremiah 35:14</a>. The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab, who commanded this sons not to drink wine, are performed, and they have drunk no wine to this day, but have obeyed the command of their father. But I have spoken unto you, rising up early and speaking, yet ye have not listened unto me. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-15.htm">Jeremiah 35:15</a>. And I sent unto you all my servants the prophets, rising early and sending them, saying, Turn ye, now, every one from his evil way, and do good deeds, and do not go after other gods, to serve them; then shall ye dwell in the land which I have given to you and to your fathers. But ye did not incline your ear, nor hearken unto me. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-16.htm">Jeremiah 35:16</a>. Yea, the children of Jonadab the son of Rechab have observed the commandment of their father which he commanded them, while this people have not hearkened unto me. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-17.htm">Jeremiah 35:17</a>. Therefore, thus saith Jahveh, the God of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will bring upon Judah and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the evil which I have uttered regarding them, because I spake unto them and they did not hear, and I called unto them, but they did not answer. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-18.htm">Jeremiah 35:18</a>. And to the house of the Rechabites Jeremiah said: Thus saith Jahveh of hosts, the God of Israel, Because ye have listened to the command of Jonadab your father, and have kept all his commandments, and have done according to all that he commanded you, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-19.htm">Jeremiah 35:19</a>. Therefore, thus saith Jahveh of hosts, the God of Israel, Jonadab the son of Rechab shall not want a man to stand before me for ever."<p>The command, "Go and speak to the men of Judah," etc., shows that it was not in the chamber of the temple, in presence of the Rechabites, but probably in one of the temple fore-courts, that Jeremiah addressed the following word of the Lord to the people assembled there. In order to shame the Jews thoroughly, he shows them the faithfulness with which the Rechabites observe the ordinances of their ancestor Jonadab. The character of the address, as one intended to rouse feelings of shame, is indicated even at the beginning of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-13.htm">Jeremiah 35:13</a> : "Will ye not receive instruction by hearkening to the words of the Lord?" The Hoph. &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1511;&#1501; is construed as a passive with the accus.; in the older writers we frequently find this construction, in which the passive is used impersonally, hence the sing. is here employed: cf. Ges. 143, 1, Ew. 295, b. "To this day" - now for nearly 300 years without interruption; for Jonadab was already held in high esteem when Jehu ascended the throne, 883 b.c. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-15.htm">2 Kings 10:15</a>). Judah, on the contrary, does not listen to the commandments which his God unceasingly inculcates on him, but rather wanders after other gods, to serve them. On <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-15.htm">Jeremiah 35:15</a> cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-4.htm">Jeremiah 25:4-5</a>. &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1488;&#1491;&#1502;&#1492; stands for &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1488;&#1491;&#1502;&#1492; , <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-5.htm">Jeremiah 25:5</a>. - In <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-16.htm">Jeremiah 35:16</a>, where the introductory &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, imo, indicates a culmination, the idea is once more briefly expressed.
