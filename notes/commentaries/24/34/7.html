Lachish was one of the strongest towns of the Amorites in the time of Joshua (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-3.htm" title="Why Adonizedec king of Jerusalem, sent to Hoham king of Hebron, and to Piram king of Jarmuth, and to Japhia king of Lachish, and to Debir king of Eglon, saying,">Joshua 10:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-5.htm" title="Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon, gathered themselves together, and went up, they and all their hosts, and encamped before Gibeon, and made war against it.">Joshua 10:5</a>), and was situated in the <span class= "ital">Shephelah, </span>or lowland district (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-39.htm" title="Lachish, and Bozkath, and Eglon,">Joshua 15:39</a>). It was restored or fortified by Rehoboam, as a defence against the northern kingdom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-9.htm" title="And Adoraim, and Lachish, and Azekah,">2Chronicles 11:9</a>). Amaziah took refuge there on his flight from the conspiracy at Jerusalem (2 Chron. 14:19; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/25-27.htm" title="Now after the time that Amaziah did turn away from following the LORD they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem; and he fled to Lachish: but they sent to Lachish after him, and slew him there.">2Chronicles 25:27</a>). It was taken by Sennacherib on his way from Assyria to Egypt, and made the monarch’s headquarters (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-9.htm" title="After this did Sennacherib king of Assyria send his servants to Jerusalem, (but he himself laid siege against Lachish, and all his power with him,) to Hezekiah king of Judah, and to all Judah that were at Jerusalem, saying,">2Chronicles 32:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-17.htm" title="And the king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rabsaris and Rabshakeh from Lachish to king Hezekiah with a great host against Jerusalem. And they went up and came to Jerusalem. And when they were come up, they came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool, which is in the highway of the fuller's field.">2Kings 18:17</a>). A slab at Kouyunjik (Layard’s <span class= "ital">Nineveh and Babylon, </span>149-152; <span class= "ital">Monuments of Nineveh, </span>2nd Series, Plates xxi, 24) represents the siege of <span class= "ital">Lakhisha </span>by the armies of Sennacherib, and gives something like a ground-plan of the city. Its site has not been identified with certainty, but ruins still known as <span class= "ital">Um-lakis </span>are found between Gaza and Eleutheropolis. It is mentioned here as being, next to Jerusalem, one of the strongest fortresses of the kingdom of Judah, which as yet had resisted the attack of Nebuchadnezzar’s armies. Azekah, less conspicuous in history, was also in the <span class= "ital">Shephelah </span>region, and is named with other cities in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/joshua/10-10.htm" title="And the LORD discomfited them before Israel, and slew them with a great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them along the way that goes up to Bethhoron, and smote them to Azekah, and to Makkedah.">Joshua 10:10-11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-35.htm" title="Jarmuth, and Adullam, Socoh, and Azekah,">Joshua 15:35</a>. The Philistines were encamped between it and Shochoh in the days of Saul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-1.htm" title="Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle, and were gathered together at Shochoh, which belongs to Judah, and pitched between Shochoh and Azekah, in Ephesdammim.">1Samuel 17:1</a>). It also was fortified by Rehoboam (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-9.htm" title="And Adoraim, and Lachish, and Azekah,">2Chronicles 11:9</a>).

This law had, it seems, fallen into disuse; but King Zedekiah, upon the approach of the Chaldean army, whether from religious motives, or a political view to employ the men who were set free in the service of the war, engaged the people in a covenant to act conformably to the law; and they released their brethren accordingly. But no sooner were their fears abated, by the retreat of the Chaldeans, than, in defiance of every principle of religion, honour, and humanity, they imposed the yoke of servitude anew upon those unhappy persons. Archbishop Usher computes the ninth year of Zedekiah’s reign to have been the sabbatical year, and supposes that, on this account, the covenant of general release was entered into at the beginning of that year. But the sabbatical year, which was every seventh year from that in which the Israelites entered into the possession of the land of Canaan, had nothing at all to do with the release of servants. In the year of sabbath they were only restrained from sowing their ground, and pruning their vineyards. But every seventh year, from the beginning of their service, the Hebrew bond-slaves were to be discharged. Six years were they to serve, and in the seventh they were to go out free. Only the fiftieth year, or year of jubilee, was also to be a time of general release, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/25-39.htm" title="And if your brother that dwells by you be waxen poor, and be sold to you; you shall not compel him to serve as a bondservant:...">Leviticus 25:39-41</a>.

Certainly it is so far true that Jeremiah, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-2.htm">Jeremiah 34:2-5</a>, expresses himself more fully regarding the fate of King Zedekiah at the fall of Jerusalem into the hands of the Chaldeans than in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-3.htm">Jeremiah 32:3-5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-3.htm">Jeremiah 21:3</a>., and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-17.htm">Jeremiah 37:17</a>; but we are not warranted in drawing the inference that this message forms a historical appendix or supplement to <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-3.htm">Jeremiah 32:3</a>., and was the occasion or reason of Jeremiah's imprisonment. See, on the contrary, the remarks on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-3.htm">Jeremiah 32:3</a>. It is not given here as an appendix to explain the reason of the prophet's imprisonment, but as a prophecy from which we may see how King Zedekiah was forewarned, from the very beginning of the siege, of what its issue would be, that he might frame his conduct accordingly. Nor does it belong to the period when Nebuchadnezzar, after beating off the Egyptians who had come to the relief of the beleaguered city, had returned to the siege of Jerusalem, but to the earliest period of the siege, when Zedekiah might still cherish the hope of defeating and driving off the Chaldeans through the help of the Egyptians. - According to <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-1.htm">Jeremiah 34:1</a>, the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah when "Nebuchadnezzar and," i.e., with, "all his host, and all the kingdoms of the land of the dominion of his hand, and all the nations, were fighting against Jerusalem and all her towns." The words are multiplied to represent the strength of the Chaldean army, so as to deepen the impression of overpowering might, against which resistance is vain. The army consists of men drawn from all the kingdoms of the territory he rules, and of all nations. &#1488;&#1512;&#1509; &#1502;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1514; means the same as &#1488;&#1512;&#1509; &#1502;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-28.htm">Jeremiah 51:28</a>, the territory over which his dominion, which includes many kingdoms, extends. The lxx have omitted "all the nations" as superfluous. See a like conglomeration of words in a similar description, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/26-7.htm">Ezekiel 26:7</a>. "All her towns" are the towns of Judah which belong to Jerusalem; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-15.htm">Jeremiah 19:15</a>. According to <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-7.htm">Jeremiah 34:7</a>, the strong towns not yet taken are meant, especially those strongly fortified, Lachish and Azekah in the plain (<a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/15-39.htm">Joshua 15:39</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-35.htm">Joshua 15:35</a>), the former of which is shown still under the name Um Lakhis, while the latter is to be sought for in the vicinity of Socho; see on <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/10-3.htm">Joshua 10:3</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/10-10.htm">Joshua 10:10</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-9.htm">2 Chronicles 11:9</a>. - Jeremiah is to say to the king:</body></html>
