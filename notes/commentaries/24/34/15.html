It was not merely that the king had issued an edict, or that judges had given their decisions in accordance with the old law, but princes and people had met together in the courts of the Temple, and there, in the presence of Jehovah, had entered into this covenant, as did their descendants afterwards in the days of Nehemiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/nehemiah/5-12.htm" title="Then said they, We will restore them, and will require nothing of them; so will we do as you say.

This law they and their fathers had broken. And when there was some hope that the siege was raised, they forced the servants they had released into their services again. Those who think to cheat God by dissembled repentance and partial reformation, put the greatest cheat upon their own souls. This shows that liberty to sin, is really only liberty to have the sorest judgments. It is just with God to disappoint expectations of mercy, when we disappoint the expectations of duty. And when reformation springs only from terror, it is seldom lasting. Solemn vows thus entered into, profane the ordinances of God; and the most forward to bind themselves by appeals to God, are commonly most ready to break them. Let us look to our hearts, that our repentance may be real, and take care that the law of God regulates our conduct.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/34.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The house of bondmen - The miserable prison in which, after being worked in the fields all day in gangs, the slaves were shut up at night.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/34.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15. in the house &#8230; called by my name&#8212;the usual place of making such covenants (2Ki 23:3; compare 1Ki 8:31; Ne 10:29).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/34.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Ye were now turned; </span> that is, reformed in this particular, in which you had done the thing which I commanded you, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">proclaiming a liberty</span> to your servants.

It came to Jeremiah "after King Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people in Jerusalem, to proclaim liberty to them, that every one should send away his man-servant, or his maid-servant, being a Hebrew or Hebrewess, so that none should impose servitude on any one of them who was a Jew, his brother. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-10.htm">Jeremiah 34:10</a>. And all the princes and all the people who entered into the covenant obeyed, each one setting free his man-servant and his maid-servant, and not imposing servitude on them any more: they obeyed and each one set them free. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-11.htm">Jeremiah 34:11</a>. But they turned round afterwards, and brought back the servants and the handmaids whom they had set free, and brought them under subjection, for servants and for handmaids." The covenant which Zedekiah concluded with all the people at Jerusalem, according to what follows, consisted in a solemn vow made before the Lord in the temple, probably confirmed by sacrifices, to set free the male and female slaves of Hebrew descent, in conformity with the law, <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/21-1.htm">Exodus 21:1-4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-12.htm">Deuteronomy 15:12</a>.<p>The law required the gratuitous manumission of these after seven years of service. This time, indeed, is not mentioned in our verses, but it is assumed as well known through the law. But, in the general departure of the people from the Lord and His commandments, the observance of this law had probably long been intermitted, so that, in consequence of the solemn engagement to obey it once more, a great number of Hebrew male and female slaves received their freedom, inasmuch as very many had served longer than seven years; however, we need not suppose that all bond men and women were liberated at once. The resolution, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-9.htm">Jeremiah 34:9</a>, that every one should liberate his Hebrew man-or maid-servant, and that no one should continue to impose servitude on a Jew, his brother, i.e., compel him any longer to serve as a slave, is conditioned by the law, which is assumed as well known: this also accords with the expression &#1500;&#1489;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; &#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1470;&#1489;&#1468;&#1501;, which is used in a general way of the treatment of Hebrew men-and maid-servants, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-39.htm">Leviticus 25:39</a>. However, it is also possible that a liberation of all bond men and women took place without regard to the duration of their servitude, partly for the purpose of averting, by such obedience to the law, the calamity now threatening the city, and partly also to employ the liberated slaves in the defence of the city; for, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-21.htm">Jeremiah 34:21</a>., the emancipation took place during the siege of Jerusalem, and after the departure of the Chaldeans the solemn promise was revoked. The expression &#1511;&#1514;&#1488; &#1491;&#1512;&#1493;&#1512;, "to proclaim liberty," is taken from <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-10.htm">Leviticus 25:10</a>, but it does not prove that the manumission took place on a sabbath-or jubilee-year. &#1500;&#1492;&#1501; refers ad sensum to those who were bondmen and had a right to be set free. The general expression is explained by &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1495; &#1495;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501;, and this again is more closely defined by &#1500;&#1489;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; &#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1470;&#1489;&#1468;&#1501; (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-39.htm">Leviticus 25:39</a>). &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;  &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497; &#1488;&#1495;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;, (that no one should labour) "though a Jew, who is his brother," i.e., a fellow-countryman; i.e., that no one should impose servitude on a Jew, as being a compatriot. "To enter into a covenant" is to assume its obligation; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/15-12.htm">2 Chronicles 15:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-8.htm">Ezekiel 16:8</a>. The Kethib &#1497;&#1499;&#1489;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1501; receives, in the Qeri, the vowels of the Kal, since the Hiphil of this verb does not occur elsewhere, only the Kal, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-10.htm">2 Chronicles 28:10</a>; but the alteration is unnecessary - the Hiphil may intensify the active meaning. </body></html>
