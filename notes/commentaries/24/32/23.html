When at any time we are perplexed about the methods of Providence, it is good for us to look to first principles. Let us consider that God is the fountain of all being, power, and life; that with him no difficulty is such as cannot be overcome; that he is a God of boundless mercy; that he is a God of strict justice; and that he directs every thing for the best. Jeremiah owns that God was righteous in causing evil to come upon them. Whatever trouble we are in, personal or public, we may comfort ourselves that the Lord sees it, and knows how to remedy it. We must not dispute God's will, but we may seek to know what it means.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/32.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Possessed - See <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-10.htm">Jeremiah 8:10</a> note. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/32.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>23. all &#8230; thou commandedst &#8230; all this evil&#8212;Their punishment was thus exactly commensurate with their sin.

Having acknowledged God’s power, omniscience, goodness, truth, and faithfulness, he comes to own his justice, confessing that this people for whom God had done so much had very ill requited him, not obeying his voice, which he expounds by not <span class="ital">walking in his law</span>; for the law was God’s voice to them. This he aggravateth by saying they had done nothing of what he had commanded, not breaking some particular law, but the whole law of God. Therefore God was righteous in bringing this sword, pestilence, and famine upon them. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/32.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And they came in and possessed it,.... After forty years travel in the wilderness; they entered into it with Joshua at the head of them, and the Lord with them; giving victory over the Canaanites, who were soon subdued; and the Israelites with little trouble settled in their land, which was divided to them by lot, and possessed as their inheritance: <p>but they obeyed not thy voice; though they promised at Sinai they would, and though they were so much obliged by the goodness of God to them; this shows great ingratitude in them: <p>neither walked in thy law; moral, ceremonial, and judicial, given at Harsh as the rule of their obedience; but they walked not according to it: <p>they have done nothing of all that thou commandedst them to do; they were not only deficient in some things, but in everything; they not only broke some of the laws of God, but all of them; there was not one law, one command, observed by them as it ought to have been; and yet these people were always prone to establish their own righteousness, and seek for justification by it: <p>therefore thou hast caused all this evil to come upon them; the Chaldean army, now besieging them; and the famine and pestilence among them; which, the prophet serves, were but the righteous judgments of God upon them for their sins. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/32.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And they came in, and possessed it; but they obeyed not thy voice, neither walked in thy law; they have done nothing of all that thou commandedst them to do: therefore thou hast caused all this evil to come upon them:</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/32.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The prayer of Jeremiah. - Although Jeremiah has declared, in the words of the Lord, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-14.htm">Jeremiah 32:14</a>., the meaning of the purchase of the field to the witnesses who were present at the transaction, yet the intimation that houses, fields, and vineyards would once more be bought, seemed so improbable, in view of the impending capture and destruction of Jerusalem by the Chaldeans, that he betakes himself to the Lord in prayer, asking for further disclosures regarding the future of the people and the land, less for his own sake than for that of the people, who could with difficulty rise to such confidence of faith. The prayer runs thus, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-17.htm">Jeremiah 32:17</a> : "Ah, Lord Jahveh! behold, Thou hast made the heaven and the earth by Thy great power and Thine outstretched arm; to Thee nothing is impossible. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-18.htm">Jeremiah 32:18</a>. Thou showest mercy unto thousands, and repayest the iniquity of fathers into the bosom of their children after them, Thou great and mighty God, whose name is Jahveh of hosts. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-19.htm">Jeremiah 32:19</a>. Great in counsel and mighty in deed, whose eyes are open to all the ways of the children of men, to give unto every one according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his works: <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-20.htm">Jeremiah 32:20</a>. Thou who didst signs and wonders in the land of Egypt until this day, both in Israel and among [other] men, and madest for Thyself a name, as it is this day; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-21.htm">Jeremiah 32:21</a>. And didst lead Thy people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs and wonders, and with strong hand and outstretched arm, and with great terror, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-22.htm">Jeremiah 32:22</a>. And didst give them this land, which Thou hast sworn to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-23.htm">Jeremiah 32:23</a>. And they came and took possession of it, but they hearkened not to Thy voice and walked not in Thy law: all that Thou commandedst them to do they did not, therefore didst Thou cause all this evil to come against them. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-24.htm">Jeremiah 32:24</a>. Behold, the besiegers' mounds are come to the city, to take it, and the city will be given into the hands of the Chaldeans, who fight against it, because of the sword, hunger, and pestilence; and what Thou didst speak is come to pass, and, behold, Thou seest it. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-25.htm">Jeremiah 32:25</a>. Yet Thou hast said to me, O Lord Jahveh, 'Buy thee the field for money, and take witnesses,' while the city is being delivered into the hands of the Chaldeans."<p>This prayer contains a laudation of the omnipotence of the Lord and the justice of His dealing among all men (<a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-17.htm">Jeremiah 32:17-19</a>), and especially in the guidance of the people Israel (<a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-20.htm">Jeremiah 32:20-23</a>), with the view of connecting with it the question, how the divine command to buy the field is to be reconciled with the decreed deliverance of the city into the power of the Chaldeans (<a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-24.htm">Jeremiah 32:24</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-25.htm">Jeremiah 32:25</a>). <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-17.htm">Jeremiah 32:17</a>. God proclaims His omnipotence in the creation of the heaven and the earth, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-5.htm">Jeremiah 27:5</a>. From this it is plain that nothing is too wonderful for God, i.e., is impossible for Him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-14.htm">Genesis 18:14</a>. As Creator and Ruler of the world, God exercises grace and justice. The words of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-18.htm">Jeremiah 32:18</a> are a reminiscence and free imitation of the passages <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>. and <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-7.htm">Jeremiah 34:7</a>, where the Lord so depicts His dealings in the guidance of men. To "recompense iniquity into the bosom" (see <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-6.htm">Isaiah 65:6</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/79-12.htm">Psalm 79:12</a>), i.e., to pour into the bosom of the garment the reward for iniquity, so that it may be carried away and borne; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/3-15.htm">Ruth 3:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-23.htm">Proverbs 17:23</a>. "The great and mighty God," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-17.htm">Deuteronomy 10:17</a>. On "Jahveh of hosts is His name," cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-16.htm">Jeremiah 10:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-35.htm">Jeremiah 31:35</a>. &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1493; is to be explained thus: "O Thou great God, whose name is Jahveh of hosts." </body></html>
