This was to signify, that though Jerusalem was besieged, and the whole country likely to be laid waste, yet the time would come, when houses, and fields, and vineyards, should be again possessed. It concerns ministers to make it appear that they believe what they preach to others. And it is good to manage even our worldly affairs in faith; to do common business with reference to the providence and promise of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/32.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For the prophecies on which the charge was grounded see <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-4.htm">Jeremiah 21:4-7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-9.htm">Jeremiah 21:9</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/32.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. his eyes shall behold his eyes&#8212;that is, only before reaching Babylon, which he was not to see.

After &#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, the Masoretic text wants &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501;, which is supplied in the Qeri. Hengstenberg is of opinion that the expression was abbreviated here, inasmuch as it has already occurred before, several times, in its full form (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-27.htm">Jeremiah 31:27</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31</a>); but Jeremiah does not usually abbreviate when he repeats an expression, and &#1489;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501; has perhaps been dropped merely through an error in transcription. "The city shall be built for Jahveh," so that it thenceforth belongs to Him, is consecrated to Him. The extent of the new city is described as being "from the tower of Hananeel to the gate of the corner." The tower of Hananeel, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-1.htm">Nehemiah 3:1</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/4-10.htm">Zechariah 4:10</a>, was situated on the north-east corner of the city wall; the gate of the corner was at the north-west corner of the city, to the north or north-west of the present "Jaffa Gate;" see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-13.htm">2 Kings 14:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-9.htm">2 Chronicles 26:9</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-10.htm">Zechariah 14:10</a>. This account thus briefly describes the whole north side. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-39.htm">Jeremiah 31:39</a>. The measuring-line (&#1511;&#1493;&#1492; as found here, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-23.htm">1 Kings 7:23</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-16.htm">Zechariah 1:16</a>, is the original form, afterwards shortened into &#1511;&#1493;, the Qeri) further goes out &#1504;&#1490;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;, "before itself," i.e., straight out over the hill Gareb. &#1506;&#1500; does not mean "away towards, or on" (Hitzig); nor is the true reading &#1506;&#1491;, "as far as, even to," which is met with in several codices: the correct rendering is "away over," so that a part, at least, of the hill was included within the city bounds. "And turns towards Goah." These two places last named are unknown. From the context of the passage only this much is clear, that both of them were situated on the west of the city; for the starting-point of the line spoken of is in the north-west, and the valley of Ben-hinnom joins in at the end of it, in the south, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-40.htm">Jeremiah 31:40</a>. &#1490;&#1468;&#1512;&#1489; means "itching," for &#1490;&#1468;&#1512;&#1489; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/21-20.htm">Leviticus 21:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/22-22.htm">Leviticus 22:22</a> means "the itch;" in Arabic also "the leprosy." From this, many expositors infer that the hill Gareb was the hill where lepers were obliged to dwell by themselves, outside the city. This supposition is probable; there is no truth, however, in the assumption of Schleussner, Krafft (Topogr. von Jerus. S. 158), Hitzig, and Hengstenberg, that the hill Bezetha, included within the city bounds by the third wall of Agrippa, is the one meant; for the line described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-39.htm">Jeremiah 31:39</a> is not to be sought for on the north side of the city. With Graf, we look for the hill Gareb on the mount which lies westward from the valley of Ben-hinnom and at the end of the valley of Rephaim, towards the north (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-8.htm">Joshua 15:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-16.htm">Joshua 18:16</a>), so that it is likely we must consider it to be identical with "the top of the mountain" mentioned in these passages. This mountain is the rocky ridge which bounds the valley of Ben-hinnom on the west, and stretches northwards, on the west side of the valley of Gihon and the Lower Pool (Birket es Sultn), to near the high road to Jaffa, where it turns off towards the west on the under (i.e., south) side of the Upper Pool (Birket el Mamilla); see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-8.htm">Joshua 15:8</a>. It is not, as Thenius supposes (Jerusalem before the Exile, an appendix to his commentary on the Books of Kings), the bare rocky hill situated on the north, and overhanging the Upper Pool; on this view, Goah could only be the steep descent from the plateau into the valley of Kidron, opposite this hill, towards the east. Regarding Goah, only this much can be said with certainty, that the supposition, made by Vitringa and Hengstenberg, of a connection between the name and Golgotha, is untenable; lexical considerations and facts are all against it. Golgotha was situated in the north-west: Goah must be sought for south-west from Jerusalem. The translation of the Chaldee, "cattle-pond," is a mere inference from &#1490;&#1468;&#1506;&#1492;, "to bellow." But, in spite of the uncertainty experienced in determining the positions of the hill Gareb and Goah, this much is evident from the verse before us, that the city, which is thus to be built anew, will extend to the west beyond the space occupied by old Jerusalem, and include within it districts or spots which lay outside old (i.e., pre-and post-exile) Jerusalem, and which had been divided off from the city, as unclean places.</body></html>
