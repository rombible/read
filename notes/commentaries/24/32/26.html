For they have polluted their houses by idolatrous worship upon the roofs of them, openly and publicly, in contempt of my authority, and defiance of my justice. <span class="ital">For the children of Israel and Judah have only done evil before me, </span>&c. — If they had offended me only by some particular acts of sin, or by omitting their duty in only some few instances, or but for a short time, I might have been thought to act with severity toward them; but from the time they first began to be a nation <span class="ital">they have only provoked me to anger with the works of their hands </span>— Passing from one course of sin, and from one species of idolatry, to another. <span class="ital">For this city hath been a provocation of mine anger, </span>&c. — The conduct of its inhabitants has been generally and long provoking: they began betimes, and have continued in the commission of the most daring wickedness from age to age. <span class="ital">From the day that they built it </span>— Or, <span class="ital">that it was built, </span>the verb personal being often used for the impersonal. Solomon completed the building of Jerusalem, having greatly enlarged and beautified it with the temple and other stately buildings, and he afterward greatly defiled it by idolatry, the sin here spoken of. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-7.htm" title="Then did Solomon build an high place for Chemosh, the abomination of Moab, in the hill that is before Jerusalem, and for Molech, the abomination of the children of Ammon.">1 Kings 11:7</a>, compared with <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-13.htm" title="And the high places that were before Jerusalem, which were on the right hand of the mount of corruption, which Solomon the king of Israel had built for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Zidonians, and for Chemosh the abomination of the Moabites, and for Milcom the abomination of the children of Ammon, did the king defile.">2 Kings 23:13</a>. And, except in David’s time, the worship of God could hardly be said to be preserved pure through the entire reign of any one king. <span class="ital">That I should remove it from before my face </span>— As if they had pursued these idolatrous practices on purpose to provoke me to destroy the city, and to cast its inhabitants out of it. As nothing can be more easy than for people to keep close to the divine rule, as to external acts of worship, so nothing is more provoking to God than their not doing so. And yet nothing has been more rarely done in any nation; as if men had set themselves to bid defiance to a jealous God. <span class="ital">Because of all the evil of the children of Israel</span> — Still God makes their destruction to be of themselves, provoking him to that wrath which he executed upon them. <span class="ital">They, their kings, their princes,</span> &c. — The whole head was sick, the whole heart faint. All orders of men were so corrupted that there was no hope of their reformation or amendment. <span class="ital">They have turned unto me the back and not the face </span>— They have behaved themselves contemptuously toward me, like men who, when they are admonished or instructed, instead of looking toward those who instruct or admonish them, turn their backs upon them: see note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-27.htm" title="Saying to a stock, You are my father; and to a stone, You have brought me forth: for they have turned their back to me, and not their face: but in the time of their trouble they will say, Arise, and save us.">Jeremiah 2:27</a>. <span class="ital">Though I taught them, rising up early. </span>&c. — Their sin would not have been so great and heinous if I, by my prophets, had not so continually instructed and reproved them; and they as stubbornly refused to hearken to the instruction, and to be amended by the reproofs. <span class="ital">They set their abominations </span>— Their idols, which, above all things, the jealous God abhors; <span class="ital">in the house which is called by my name </span>— That is, in the temple, which was ordinarily called <span class="ital">the house of the Lord. </span>This they did under some of the idolatrous kings. <span class="ital">And they built the high places of Baal, </span>&c. — See the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/19-5.htm" title="They have built also the high places of Baal, to burn their sons with fire for burnt offerings to Baal, which I commanded not, nor spoke it, neither came it into my mind:...">Jeremiah 19:5-6</a>, where all the clauses of this verse are explained.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/32.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>32:26-44 God's answer discovers the purposes of his wrath against that generation of the Jews, and the purposes of his grace concerning future generations. It is sin, and nothing else, that ruins them. The restoration of Judah and Jerusalem is promised. This people were now at length brought to despair. But God gives hope of mercy which he had in store for them hereafter. Doubtless the promises are sure to all believers. God will own them for his, and he will prove himself theirs. He will give them a heart to fear him. All true Christians shall have a disposition to mutual love. Though they may have different views about lesser things, they shall all be one in the great things of God; in their views of the evil of sin, and the low estate of fallen man, the way of salvation through the Saviour, the nature of true holiness, the vanity of the world, and the importance of eternal things. Whom God loves, he loves to the end. We have no reason to distrust God's faithfulness and constancy, but only our own hearts. He will settle them again in Canaan. These promises shall surely be performed. Jeremiah's purchase was the pledge of many a purchase that should be made after the captivity; and those inheritances are but faint resemblances of the possessions in the heavenly Canaan, which are kept for all who have God's fear in their hearts, and do not depart from him. Let us then bear up under our trials, assured we shall obtain all the good he has promised us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/32.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The answer is divided into two parts;<p>(a) <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-26.htm">Jeremiah 32:26-35</a>, the sins of Judah are shown to be the cause of her punishment:<p>(b) <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-36.htm">Jeremiah 32:36-44</a>, this punishment was not for Judah's destruction, but for her amendment.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/32.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>25. for the city, &c.&#8212;rather, "though," &c.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/32.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/32.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then came the word of the Lord unto Jeremiah,....

The <span class="ital">vv</span>. after 27, purporting to give the Lord’s reply to Jeremiah’s question as to the fitness of his action in purchasing the field, bear fully the marks of a later addition. Their substance indeed is quite in harmony with other prophecies in the Book, and they consist to a large extent of Jeremianic expressions. On the other hand, they are quite unnatural in this context. See further in note on <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/32-36.htm" title="And now therefore thus said the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning this city, whereof you say, It shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence;...">Jeremiah 32:36-44</a></span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 26-44.</span> - The Divine answer. This falls into two parts. First, Jehovah repeats the burden of so many prophecies, that Israel has only to blame himself for his punishment (vers. 26-35); and then a bright future is disclosed beyond the gloomy interval of conquest and captivity - a future when men shall buy fields, and comply with all the legal formalities, precisely as Jeremiah has done (vers. 36-44). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/32.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Lord has further shown this omnipotence and righteousness in His guidance of Israel, in His leading them out of Egypt with wonders and signs; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-22.htm">Deuteronomy 6:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/34-11.htm">Deuteronomy 34:11</a>. "Until this day" cannot mean that the wonders continue in Egypt until this day - still less, that their glorious remembrance continues till this day (Calvin, Rosenmller, etc.). Just as little can we connect the words with what follows, "until this day, in Egypt and among men," as Jerome supposed; although the idea et in Israel et in cunctis mortalibus quotidie tua signa complentur is in itself quite right. Logically considered, "until this day" belongs to the verb. '&#1493;&#1513;&#1474;&#1502;&#1514;&#1468; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;, and the construction is pregnant, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-7.htm">Jeremiah 11:7</a> : "Thou hast done wonders in Egypt, and hast still been doing them until this day in Israel and among other men." "Men," in contrast to "Israel," are mankind outside of Israel - other men, the heathen; on the expression, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-7.htm">Judges 18:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-4.htm">Isaiah 43:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-5.htm">Psalm 73:5</a>. "As at this day:" cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-5.htm">Jeremiah 11:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-18.htm">Jeremiah 25:18</a>. Through signs and wonders the Lord wrought, leading Israel out of Egypt, and into the land of Canaan, which had been promised to their fathers. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-21.htm">Jeremiah 32:21</a> is almost exactly the same as <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-8.htm">Deuteronomy 26:8</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-34.htm">Deuteronomy 4:34</a>. &#1502;&#1493;&#1512;&#1488; refers to the terror spread among the neighbouring nations, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-14.htm">Exodus 15:14</a>., by the wonders, especially the slaying of the first-born among the Egyptians, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-30.htm">Exodus 12:30</a>., and the miracle at the Red Sea. On "a land flowing with milk and honey," cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>. </body></html>
