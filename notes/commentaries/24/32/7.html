It was worth while to buy a field even for what might seem the contingency of that remote reversion. Roman history records a parallel act of patriotic faith in the purchase of land at Rome at its full market value, at the very time when the armies of Hannibal were marching to the gate of the city (Livy, xxvi. 11). Nothing more is known of the Hanameel who is here mentioned than that he was the first cousin of the prophet (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/32-8.htm" title="So Hanameel my uncle's son came to me in the court of the prison according to the word of the LORD, and said to me, Buy my field, I pray you, that is in Anathoth, which is in the country of Benjamin: for the right of inheritance is yours, and the redemption is yours; buy it for yourself. Then I knew that this was the word of the LORD.">Jeremiah 32:8-9</a>). The word “uncle” in this verse therefore applies strictly to Shallum. As the lands belonging to the priests and Levites as such could not be alienated (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-34.htm" title="But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold; for it is their perpetual possession.">Leviticus 25:34</a>), we must assume either that the land in question had come into the family by marriage and was private property, or that the law had been so far relaxed as to allow of the transfer of land within the limits of the family, and up to the date of the next year of jubilee. In such a case, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/3-12.htm" title="And now it is true that I am your near kinsman: however, there is a kinsman nearer than I.">Ruth 3:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/4-4.htm" title="And I thought to advertise you, saying, Buy it before the inhabitants, and before the elders of my people. If you will redeem it, redeem it: but if you will not redeem it, then tell me, that I may know: for there is none to redeem it beside you; and I am after you. And he said, I will redeem it.">Ruth 4:4</a>, the option of purchase was offered in <span class= "ital">the </span>first instance to the next of kin (the <span class= "ital">Goël, </span>or “redeemer,” of the family), so that it might still be kept in the line of succession (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-24.htm" title="And in all the land of your possession you shall grant a redemption for the land.">Leviticus 25:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-32.htm" title="Notwithstanding the cities of the Levites, and the houses of the cities of their possession, may the Levites redeem at any time.">Leviticus 25:32</a>). The prophet naturally lays stress on the fact that he was warned beforehand of the visit of Hanameel and of its object. The coincidence was to him what the arrival of the messenger of Cornelius was to Peter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/10-19.htm" title="While Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said to him, Behold, three men seek you.">Acts 10:19-21</a>).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/32.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>32:1-15 Jeremiah, being in prison for his prophecy, purchased a piece of ground. This was to signify, that though Jerusalem was besieged, and the whole country likely to be laid waste, yet the time would come, when houses, and fields, and vineyards, should be again possessed. It concerns ministers to make it appear that they believe what they preach to others.

The prohibition to sell these suburban fields (Le 25:34) applied merely to their alienating them from Levites to another tribe; so that this chapter does not contravene that prohibition. Besides, what is here meant is only the purchase of the use of the field till the year of jubilee. On the failure of the owner, the next of kin had the right of redeeming it (Le 25:25, &c.; Ru 4:3-6).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/32.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> From hence may be concluded the certainty of future contingency in God’s eye; the coming of <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Hanameel</span> was a future contingency, yet certainly known to God, so as he could tell the prophet he would come. Anathoth (as appears from <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/21-18.htm" title="Anathoth with her suburbs, and Almon with her suburbs; four cities.">Joshua 21:18</a></span>) was one of the cities of the Levites; hence ariseth a question, how it could be sold to Jeremiah, who by the law might not possess it, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-20.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Aaron, You shall have no inheritance in their land, neither shall you have any part among them: I am your part and your inheritance among the children of Israel.">Numbers 18:20</a></span>, being a Levite. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. Some excuse it from the command of God, who might dispense with his own law; but this seemeth not enough, because it is said afterward, the right of redemption is thine. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. Others therefore say the Levites might have some small possessions, though no ploughed land; they might have houses, and orchards, and gardens, in cities and suburbs. But that these might be sold seemeth contrary to the law, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-34.htm" title="But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold; for it is their perpetual possession.">Leviticus 25:34</a></span>.

Hilkiah, the father of Jeremiah, and this Shallum, were own brothers; so that Jeremiah and Hanameel were brothers' sons, or own cousins: this coming of Hanameel to Jeremiah being a contingent event, with respect to second causes, and yet foretold as what would certainly be, shows that such events are foreknown by the Lord, and are sure to him: <p>saying, buy thee my field that is in Anathoth; the place from whence Jeremiah came, and was but about two or three miles from Jerusalem, and therefore must be now in the possession of the Chaldean army; wherefore it may seem very strange in Hanameel to propose it to sale, and stranger still in Jeremiah to buy it: though something of this kind was done at Rome, while Hannibal was besieging it; the field where Hannibal pitched his camp was offered to sale at Rome, and found a buyer (t); but then he that bought it was in high spirits, and in a strong belief that the city would not be taken, and that the enemy would be obliged to quit the siege; but Jeremiah knew, and firmly believed, on the other hand, that the city of Jerusalem, and all the country round it, would fall into the hands of the king of Babylon. Moreover, Anathoth was a city of the priests, and the fields adjoining to it belonged to them; as some of them did to Abiathar the priest in his time, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-26.htm">1 Kings 2:26</a>; and such fields as belonged to the priests and Levites were not to be sold, according to the law in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-34.htm">Leviticus 25:34</a>; to which it is answered, that this was not arable land, which the Levites might not possess; but some meadow, orchard, or garden, in the suburbs of the city, which though it might not be sold to strangers, yet might be sold among themselves; though it is more probable that this was a field that came fro, in some of his ancestors by his mother's or grandmother's side, and so might be disposed of; as it seems certain to be lawfully done, not only as it was the will of God, who could indeed dispense with his own law, was that in the way, but since it was a matter of right, and incumbent on him, as follows: <p>for the right of redemption is thine to buy it; that is, had it been sold to another, it would have lain upon him to have redeemed it, as being next of kin, that so it might not pass to another tribe and family. <p>(t) Florus, l. 2. c. 6. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/32.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Behold, Hanameel the son of Shallum thy uncle shall come to thee, saying, <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> Buy for thee my field that <i>is</i> in Anathoth: for the right of redemption <i>is</i> thine <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> to buy <i>it</i>.</span><p>(c) By which was meant that the people would return again out of captivity and enjoy their possessions and vineyards as in Jer 32:15,44.<p>(d) Because he was next of the kindred, as in Ru 4:4.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/32.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">7</span>. <span class="ital">Hanamel the son of Shallum thine uncle</span>] The distinct statement in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/32-8.htm" title="So Hanameel my uncle's son came to me in the court of the prison according to the word of the LORD, and said to me, Buy my field, I pray you, that is in Anathoth, which is in the country of Benjamin: for the right of inheritance is yours, and the redemption is yours; buy it for yourself.

There is, therefore, no reason why we should deviate (as most commentators do) from the ordinary Hebrew usage, and suppose "thine uncle" in this verse to refer to Shallum, and not rather to Hanameel. But how are we to explain this singular variation in phraseology? Either from the fact that the Hebrew for "uncle" is simply a word expressive of affection (it means "beloved," see <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-1.htm">Isaiah 5:1</a>), and might, therefore, just as well be applied to a cousin as to an uncle: or else. upon the supposition that the word for "son (of)" has fallen out of the text before "mine uncle," both in this verse and in ver. 12. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/32.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The time and the circumstances of the following message from God. - The message came to Jeremiah in the tenth year of Zedekiah, i.e., in the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-1.htm">Jeremiah 25:1</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-12.htm">Jeremiah 52:12</a>), when the army of the king of Babylon was besieging Jerusalem, and Jeremiah was kept in confinement in the fore-court of the royal palace. These historical data are inserted (<a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-2.htm">Jeremiah 32:2-5</a>) in the form of circumstantial clauses: '&#1493;&#1488;&#1494; &#1495;&#1497;&#1500; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;, "for at that time the army of the king of Babylon was besieging Jerusalem." The siege had begun in the ninth year of Zedekiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-1.htm">Jeremiah 39:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-4.htm">Jeremiah 52:4</a>), and was afterwards raised for a short time, in consequence of the approach of an auxiliary corps of Egyptians; but, as soon as these had been defeated, it was resumed (<a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-5.htm">Jeremiah 37:5</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-11.htm">Jeremiah 37:11</a>). Jeremiah was then kept confined in the court of the prison of the royal palace (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-25.htm">Nehemiah 3:25</a>), "where Zedekiah, king of Judah, had imprisoned him, saying: Why dost thou prophesy, 'Thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, so that he shall take it; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-4.htm">Jeremiah 32:4</a>. And Zedekiah, the king of Judah, shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, but shall assuredly be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon, and his mouth shall speak with his mouth, and his eyes shall behold his eyes; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-5.htm">Jeremiah 32:5</a>. And he shall lead Zedekiah to Babylon, and there shall he be until I visit him, saith the Lord. Though ye fight with the Chaldeans, ye shall not succeed?'" - We have already found an utterance of like import in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-1.htm">Jeremiah 21:1-14</a>, but that is not here referred to; for it was fulfilled at the beginning of the siege of Jerusalem, and did not bring on Jeremiah the consequences mentioned here. From <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37.htm">Jeremiah 37</a> we learn that Jeremiah, during the siege of Jerusalem, on till the time when it was raised through the approach of the Egyptian army, had not been imprisoned, but went freely in and out among the people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-4.htm">Jeremiah 37:4</a>.). Not till during the temporary raising of the siege, when he wanted to go out of the city into the land of Benjamin, was he seized and thrown into a dungeon, on the pretence that he intended to go over to the Chaldeans. There he remained many days, till King Zedekiah ordered him to be brought, and questioned him privately as to the issue of the conflict; when Jeremiah replied, "Thou shalt be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon." On this occasion Jeremiah complained to the king of his imprisonment, and requested that he might not be sent back into the dungeon, where he must soon perish; the king then ordered him (<a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-11.htm">Jeremiah 37:11-21</a>) to be taken into the court of the prison-house (&#1495;&#1510;&#1512; , <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-21.htm">Jeremiah 37:21</a>), where he remained in confinement till the city was taken (<a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-13.htm">Jeremiah 38:13</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-28.htm">Jeremiah 38:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-14.htm">Jeremiah 39:14</a>). The statement in our verses as to the cause of this imprisonment does not contradict, but agrees with the notice in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37.htm">Jeremiah 37</a>, as soon as we perceive that this account contains merely a brief passing notice of the matter. The same holds true of the utterance of the prophet in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-3.htm">Jeremiah 32:3-5</a>. Jeremiah, even at the beginning of the siege (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-3.htm">Jeremiah 21:3</a>.), had sent a message of similar import to the king, and repeated the same afterwards: <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-3.htm">Jeremiah 34:3-5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-17.htm">Jeremiah 37:17</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-17.htm">Jeremiah 38:17-23</a>. The words of our verses are taken from these repeated utterances; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-4.htm">Jeremiah 32:4</a> agrees almost verbatim with <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-3.htm">Jeremiah 34:3</a>; and the words, "there shall he remain &#1506;&#1491;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1491;&#1497; &#1488;&#1514;&#1493;, till I regard him with favour," are based upon the clearer utterance as to the end of Zedekiah, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-4.htm">Jeremiah 34:4-5</a>. - The circumstances under which Jeremiah received the following commission from the Lord are thus exactly stated, in order to show how little prospect the present of the kingdom of Judah offered for the future, which was portrayed by the purchase of the field. Not only must the kingdom of Judah inevitably succumb to the power of the Chaldeans, and its population go into exile, but even Jeremiah is imprisoned, in so hopeless a condition, that he is no longer sure of his life for a single day. </body></html>
