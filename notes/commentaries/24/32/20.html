It is conceivable that what he had heard of the frogs, and the lice, and the boils of Egypt might seem to Jeremiah the perpetuation, in part, of the old plagues; but we get, perhaps, an adequate meaning by seeing in the words the assertion that the old signs and wonders continued in their effect and in their memory. The “name” continued, though the signs themselves had passed away.<p><span class= "bld">Among other men.</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">among men. </span>There is no word for “other” in the Hebrew, and the words have their full force of declaring God’s universal government over mankind at large.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/32.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>32:16-25 Jeremiah adores the Lord and his infinite perfections. When at any time we are perplexed about the methods of Providence, it is good for us to look to first principles. Let us consider that God is the fountain of all being, power, and life; that with him no difficulty is such as cannot be overcome; that he is a God of boundless mercy; that he is a God of strict justice; and that he directs every thing for the best. Jeremiah owns that God was righteous in causing evil to come upon them. Whatever trouble we are in, personal or public, we may comfort ourselves that the Lord sees it, and knows how to remedy it. We must not dispute God's will, but we may seek to know what it means.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/32.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The sense is, who hast set, i. e., performed <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-2.htm">Exodus 10:2</a> signs etc., and hast continued working them unto this day, both in lsrael and among men (i. e., the pagan). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/32.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20. even unto this day&#8212;Thou hast given "signs" of Thy power from the day when Thou didst deliver Israel out of Egypt by mighty miracles, down to the present time [Maurer].

The prophet here descends to particular instances of the power, wisdom, and goodness of God; and begins with the miracles wrought in Egypt, the plagues inflicted on the Egyptians for refusing to let Israel go; these were set among them, they were true and real things, and obvious to everyone's view; there was no deception in them, they were plain to the senses of men; and the remembrance of them continued among the Egyptians to the times of the prophet; the tradition of what was done was handed down among them to that age: for that any marks of these things remained is not to be supposed; the tracks of Pharaoh's chariot wheels to be still seen in the Red sea must be rejected as fabulous, though Orosius relates it: <p>and in Israel, and amongst other men: that is, signs and wonders were set among the Israelites, or wrought for them; such as bringing them out of Egypt; leading them through the Red sea as on dry land; feeding them in the wilderness with manna and quails; subduing their enemies, and settling them in the land of Canaan; and in other nations very wonderful things have been done in one age or another: or else the meaning is, that the miracles done in Egypt were not only remembered there to this time, but also by the Israelites, and by other men, to whom the knowledge of these things came; on account of which God was more or less everywhere glorified, as follows: <p>and hast made thee a name as at this day; that is, got praise, honour, and glory, in Egypt, in Israel, and in other nations. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/32.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{k}</span> Who hast set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, <i>even</i> to this day, and in Israel, and among <i>other</i> men; and hast made thee a name, as at this day;</span><p>(k) Meaning that his miracles in delivering his people would never be forgotten.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/32.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">20</span>. <span class="ital">which didst set</span>] Cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-22.htm" title="And the LORD showed signs and wonders, great and sore, on Egypt, on Pharaoh, and on all his household, before our eyes:">Deuteronomy 6:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-10.htm" title="And showed signs and wonders on Pharaoh, and on all his servants, and on all the people of his land: for you knew that they dealt proudly against them.

"I wrote it (the necessary terms) in the letter (the usual letter of purchase), and sealed it, and took witnesses, and weighed out the money on the balance" (it was then and still is the custom in the East to weigh money). &#1495;&#1514;&#1501; means here, not to append a seal instead of subscribing the name, or for attestation (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-8.htm">1 Kings 21:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/10-1.htm">Nehemiah 10:1</a>; 2), but to seal up, make sure by sealing (<a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-11.htm">Isaiah 29:11</a>, etc.). For, from <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-11.htm">Jeremiah 32:11</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-12.htm">Jeremiah 32:12</a>, we perceive that two copies of the bill of purchase were prepared, one sealed up, and the other open; so that, in case the open one were lost, or were accidentally or designedly injured or defaced, a perfect original might still exist in the sealed-up copy. Then "Jeremiah took the bill of purchase, the sealed one," - the specification and the conditions - "and the open one." The words &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1510;&#1493;&#1492; &#1493;&#1492;&#1495;&#1511;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; are in apposition with '&#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1505;&#1508;&#1512; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;. The Vulgate renders stipulationes et rata; Jerome, stipulatione rata, which he explains by stipulationibus et sponsionibus corroborata. &#1502;&#1510;&#1493;&#1492;, usually "a command, order," is probably employed here in the general sense of "specification," namely, the object and the price of purchase; &#1495;&#1511;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, "statutes," the conditions and stipulations of sale. The apposition has the meaning, "containing the agreement and the conditions." Both copies of this bill, the prophet-before the eyes of Hanamel, his cousin (&#1491;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497;, either in the general sense of a near relation, since the relationship has been stated exactly enough already, or &#1489;&#1468;&#1503;&#1470; has been inadvertently omitted), and before the eyes of, i.e., in the presence of "the witnesses, who wrote in the letter of purchase," i.e., had subscribed it as witnesses in attestation of the matter, and in the eyes of all the Jews who were sitting in the court of the prison, and in whose presence the transaction had been concluded - delivered up to his attendant Baruch, son of Nerijah, the son of Mahsejah, with the words, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-14.htm">Jeremiah 32:14</a> : "Thus saith Jahveh of hosts, the God of Israel: Take these letters, this sealed-up letter of purchase and this open letter, and put them into an earthen vessel, that they may remain a long time there. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-15.htm">Jeremiah 32:15</a>. For thus saith Jahveh of hosts, the God of Israel: Houses, and fields, and vineyards shall still be bought in this land." - The second utterance of the Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-15.htm">Jeremiah 32:15</a>) declares the reason why the letters were to be preserved in an earthen vessel, in order to protect them from damp, decay, and destruction, namely, because one could make use of them afterwards, when sale of property would still be taking place. There is also implied the intimation, that the present desolation of the land and the transportation of its inhabitants will only last during their time; and then the population of Judah will return, and enter again on the possession of their land. The purchase of the field on the part of Jeremiah had this meaning; and for the sake of this meaning it was announced to him by God, and completed before witnesses, in the presence of the Jews who happened to be in the court of the prison. </body></html>
