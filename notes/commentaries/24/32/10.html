The minuteness with which the transaction is recorded is every way remarkable, partly as showing that the prophet was careful that no legal formality should be lacking to give validity to the purchase; partly, as the next verse shows, because there was a secret, unattested, unsealed (and in that sense “open”) document, which the witnesses did not subscribe, and with the contents of which they were probably not acquainted. The sealed document was one closed up as a safeguard against fraudulent alterations (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-11.htm" title="And the vision of all is become to you as the words of a book that is sealed, which men deliver to one that is learned, saying, Read this, I pray you: and he said, I cannot; for it is sealed:">Isaiah 29:11</a>). In the weighing of the money we see an indication of the old practice—probably consequent on the practice of “clipping” coined money—of dealing even with the current coin as if it were bullion, just as bankers weigh a parcel of sovereigns now before giving credit for the amount. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/23-16.htm" title="And Abraham listened to Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant.">Genesis 23:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/11-12.htm" title="And I said to them, If you think good, give me my price; and if not, forbear.

And I took the purchase-deed, both that which was sealed containing the oiler and the conditions, and that which was open etc. There were two indentures, of which one was called the purchase-deed, and was signed by the purchaser and the witnesses. It was then sealed, not in our sense of appending a seal in place of signatures, but to close it up. The open deed was probably an exact copy, and was that intended for common use. In case its authenticity was called in question, the sealed copy would have to be produced before the judge, the seal opened, and if its contents agreed with those of the open deed, the decision would be in the buyer's favor.<p>By the offer is probably meant the specification. The conditions, literally, the statutes, would be the stipulations and terms of the sale, e. g. as to its restoration at the year of jubile, its price etc. The placing of the deeds in jar was of course intended to preserve them from damp during the long years of the exile. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/32.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. subscribed&#8212;I wrote in the deed, "book of purchase" (Jer 32:12).<p>weighed&#8212;coined money was not in early use; hence money was "weighed" (Ge 23:16).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/32.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> I went through with the purchase, setting my hand to and sealing the deed, and taking witnesses to it, as is usual. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/32.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And I subscribed the evidence,....

And I took the purchase deed, that which was sealed (containing the offer and the conditions), and that which was open; and I gave the purchase deed unto Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah (rather, Makhseiah), in the sight of Hanameel my uncle, and in the sight of the witnesses who subscribed the purchase deed, in the sight of all the Jews who were sitting in the court of the guard. And I charged Baruch before them, saying, Thus saith Jehovah Sabaoth, the God of Israel, Take these deeds, this sealed purchase deed, and this open deed; and put them into an earthen vessel, that they may continue many days." The deed was made in two copies, so that if the open one were lost, or suspected of having been tampered with, an appeal might always be made to the sealed copy. The latter was to be placed in an earthen vessel, to preserve it from injury by damp. It ought to be added that the words in ver. 11, rendered "containing the offer and the conditions," are difficult. "Containing" is not expressed in the Hebrew, and "offer" is not the ordinary meaning, though etymologically justifiable. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/32.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The time and the circumstances of the following message from God. - The message came to Jeremiah in the tenth year of Zedekiah, i.e., in the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-1.htm">Jeremiah 25:1</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-12.htm">Jeremiah 52:12</a>), when the army of the king of Babylon was besieging Jerusalem, and Jeremiah was kept in confinement in the fore-court of the royal palace. These historical data are inserted (<a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-2.htm">Jeremiah 32:2-5</a>) in the form of circumstantial clauses: '&#1493;&#1488;&#1494; &#1495;&#1497;&#1500; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;, "for at that time the army of the king of Babylon was besieging Jerusalem." The siege had begun in the ninth year of Zedekiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-1.htm">Jeremiah 39:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-4.htm">Jeremiah 52:4</a>), and was afterwards raised for a short time, in consequence of the approach of an auxiliary corps of Egyptians; but, as soon as these had been defeated, it was resumed (<a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-5.htm">Jeremiah 37:5</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-11.htm">Jeremiah 37:11</a>). Jeremiah was then kept confined in the court of the prison of the royal palace (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-25.htm">Nehemiah 3:25</a>), "where Zedekiah, king of Judah, had imprisoned him, saying: Why dost thou prophesy, 'Thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, so that he shall take it; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-4.htm">Jeremiah 32:4</a>. And Zedekiah, the king of Judah, shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, but shall assuredly be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon, and his mouth shall speak with his mouth, and his eyes shall behold his eyes; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-5.htm">Jeremiah 32:5</a>. And he shall lead Zedekiah to Babylon, and there shall he be until I visit him, saith the Lord. Though ye fight with the Chaldeans, ye shall not succeed?'" - We have already found an utterance of like import in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-1.htm">Jeremiah 21:1-14</a>, but that is not here referred to; for it was fulfilled at the beginning of the siege of Jerusalem, and did not bring on Jeremiah the consequences mentioned here. From <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37.htm">Jeremiah 37</a> we learn that Jeremiah, during the siege of Jerusalem, on till the time when it was raised through the approach of the Egyptian army, had not been imprisoned, but went freely in and out among the people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-4.htm">Jeremiah 37:4</a>.). Not till during the temporary raising of the siege, when he wanted to go out of the city into the land of Benjamin, was he seized and thrown into a dungeon, on the pretence that he intended to go over to the Chaldeans. There he remained many days, till King Zedekiah ordered him to be brought, and questioned him privately as to the issue of the conflict; when Jeremiah replied, "Thou shalt be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon." On this occasion Jeremiah complained to the king of his imprisonment, and requested that he might not be sent back into the dungeon, where he must soon perish; the king then ordered him (<a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-11.htm">Jeremiah 37:11-21</a>) to be taken into the court of the prison-house (&#1495;&#1510;&#1512; , <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-21.htm">Jeremiah 37:21</a>), where he remained in confinement till the city was taken (<a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-13.htm">Jeremiah 38:13</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-28.htm">Jeremiah 38:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-14.htm">Jeremiah 39:14</a>). The statement in our verses as to the cause of this imprisonment does not contradict, but agrees with the notice in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37.htm">Jeremiah 37</a>, as soon as we perceive that this account contains merely a brief passing notice of the matter. The same holds true of the utterance of the prophet in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-3.htm">Jeremiah 32:3-5</a>. Jeremiah, even at the beginning of the siege (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-3.htm">Jeremiah 21:3</a>.), had sent a message of similar import to the king, and repeated the same afterwards: <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-3.htm">Jeremiah 34:3-5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-17.htm">Jeremiah 37:17</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-17.htm">Jeremiah 38:17-23</a>. The words of our verses are taken from these repeated utterances; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-4.htm">Jeremiah 32:4</a> agrees almost verbatim with <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-3.htm">Jeremiah 34:3</a>; and the words, "there shall he remain &#1506;&#1491;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1491;&#1497; &#1488;&#1514;&#1493;, till I regard him with favour," are based upon the clearer utterance as to the end of Zedekiah, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-4.htm">Jeremiah 34:4-5</a>. - The circumstances under which Jeremiah received the following commission from the Lord are thus exactly stated, in order to show how little prospect the present of the kingdom of Judah offered for the future, which was portrayed by the purchase of the field. Not only must the kingdom of Judah inevitably succumb to the power of the Chaldeans, and its population go into exile, but even Jeremiah is imprisoned, in so hopeless a condition, that he is no longer sure of his life for a single day. </body></html>
