This was to signify, that though Jerusalem was besieged, and the whole country likely to be laid waste, yet the time would come, when houses, and fields, and vineyards, should be again possessed. It concerns ministers to make it appear that they believe what they preach to others. And it is good to manage even our worldly affairs in faith; to do common business with reference to the providence and promise of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/32.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Translate: And I wrote the particulars of the purchase in the deed ... And I took the purchase-deed, both that which was sealed containing the oiler and the conditions, and that which was open etc. There were two indentures, of which one was called the purchase-deed, and was signed by the purchaser and the witnesses. It was then sealed, not in our sense of appending a seal in place of signatures, but to close it up. The open deed was probably an exact copy, and was that intended for common use. In case its authenticity was called in question, the sealed copy would have to be produced before the judge, the seal opened, and if its contents agreed with those of the open deed, the decision would be in the buyer's favor.<p>By the offer is probably meant the specification. The conditions, literally, the statutes, would be the stipulations and terms of the sale, e. g. as to its restoration at the year of jubile, its price etc. The placing of the deeds in jar was of course intended to preserve them from damp during the long years of the exile. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/32.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12.

The Lord said to him: "Behold, Hanamel, the son of Shallum, thine uncle, cometh to thee, saying, 'Buy thee my field at Anathoth, for thou hast the redemption-right to purchase it.' " According to a mode of construction common elsewhere, &#1491;&#1468;&#1491;&#1498; might be taken as in apposition to &#1495;&#1504;&#1502;&#1488;&#1500;: "Hanamel, son of Shallum, thine uncle." But <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-8.htm">Jeremiah 32:8</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-9.htm">Jeremiah 32:9</a>, in which Jeremiah calls Hanamel &#1489;&#1468;&#1503;&#1470;&#1491;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497;, son of my uncle, show that &#1491;&#1468;&#1491;&#1498; is in apposition to &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1501;: "son of Shallum, [who is] thine uncle." The right of redemption consisted in this, that if any one was forced through circumstances to sell his landed property, the nearest blood-relation had the right, or rather was obliged, to preserve the possession for the family, either through pre-emption, or redemption from the stranger who had bought it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-25.htm">Leviticus 25:25</a>). For the land which God had given to the tribes and families of Israel for a hereditary possession could not be sold, so as to pass into the hands of strangers; and for this reason, in the year of jubilee, what had bee sold since the previous jubilee reverted, without payment of any kind, to the original possessor or his heirs. (Cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-23.htm">Leviticus 25:23-28</a>, and Keil's Bibl. Archol. ii. 141, p. 208ff.) </body></html>
