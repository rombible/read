And as the bottle was broken, so shall Judah and Jerusalem be broken by the Chaldeans. No human hand can repair it; but if they return to the Lord he will heal. As they filled Tophet with the slain sacrificed to their idols, so will God fill the whole city with the slain that shall fall as sacrifices to his justice. Whatever men may think, God will appear as terrible against sin and sinners as the Scriptures state; nor shall the unbelief of men make his promise or his threatenings of no effect. The obstinacy of sinners in sinful ways, is their own fault; if they are deaf to the word of God, it is because they have stopped their ears.

The first series, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-6.htm">Jeremiah 19:6-9</a>, is introduced by &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;, which intimates the meaning of the pitcher; and the other, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-10.htm">Jeremiah 19:10-13</a>, is bound up with the breaking of the pitcher. But both series are, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-6.htm">Jeremiah 19:6</a>, opened by the mention of the locality of the act. As <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-5.htm">Jeremiah 19:5</a> was but an expansion of <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-31.htm">Jeremiah 7:31</a>, so <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-6.htm">Jeremiah 19:6</a> is a literal repetition of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-32.htm">Jeremiah 7:32</a>. The valley of Benhinnom, with its places for abominable sacrifices (&#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1514;, see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-32.htm">Jeremiah 7:32</a>), shall in the future be called Valley of Slaughter; i.e., at the judgment on Jerusalem it will be the place where the inhabitants of Jerusalem and Judah will be slain by the enemy. There God will make void (&#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;, playing on &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1489;&#1468;&#1511;), i.e., bring to nothing; for what is poured out comes to nothing; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-3.htm">Isaiah 19:3</a>. There they shall fall by the sword in such numbers that their corpses shall be food for the beasts of prey (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-33.htm">Jeremiah 7:33</a>), and the city of Jerusalem shall be frightfully ravaged (<a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-8.htm">Jeremiah 19:8</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-16.htm">Jeremiah 18:16</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-9.htm">Jeremiah 25:9</a>, etc.). &#1502;&#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1492; (plural form of suffix without Jod; cf. Ew. 258, a), the wounds she has received. - In <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-9.htm">Jeremiah 19:9</a> is added yet another item to complete the awful picture, the terrible famine during the siege, partly taken from the words of <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-53.htm">Deuteronomy 28:53</a>. and <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-29.htm">Leviticus 26:29</a>. That this appalling misery did actually come about during the last siege by the Chaldeans, we learn from <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-10.htm">Lamentations 4:10</a>. - The second series, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-10.htm">Jeremiah 19:10-13</a>, is introduced by the act of breaking the pitcher. This happens before the eyes of the elders who have accompanied Jeremiah thither: to them the explanatory word of the Lord is addressed. As the earthen pitcher, so shall Jerusalem - people and city - be broken to pieces; and that irremediably. This is implied in: as one breaks a potter's vessel, etc. (&#1492;&#1512;&#1508;&#1492; for &#1492;&#1512;&#1508;&#1488;). The next clause: and in Tophet they shall bury, etc., is omitted by the lxx as a repetition from <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-32.htm">Jeremiah 7:32</a>, and is object to by Ew., Hitz., and Graf, as not being in keeping with its context. Ew. proposes to insert it before "as one breaketh;" but this transposition only obscures the meaning of the clause. It connects very suitably with the idea of the incurable breaking in sunder. Because the breaking up of Jerusalem and its inhabitants shall be incurable, shall be like the breaking of a pitcher dashed into countless fragments, therefore there will be lack of room in Jerusalem to bury the dead, and the unclean places of Tophet will need to be used for that purpose. With this the further thought of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-12.htm">Jeremiah 19:12</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-13.htm">Jeremiah 19:13</a> connects simply and suitably. Thus (as had been said at <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-11.htm">Jeremiah 19:11</a>) will I do unto this place and its inhabitants, &#1493;&#1500;&#1514;&#1514;, and that to make the city as Tophet, i.e., not "a mass of sherds and rubbish, as Tophet now is" (Graf); for neither was Tophet then a rubbish-heap, nor did it so become by the breaking of the pitcher. But Josiah had turned all the place of Tophet in the valley of Benhinnom into an unclean region (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-10.htm">2 Kings 23:10</a>). All Jerusalem shall become an unclean place like Tophet. This is put in so many words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-13.htm">Jeremiah 19:13</a> : The houses of Jerusalem shall become unclean like the place Tophet, namely, all houses on whose roofs idolatry has been practised. The construction of &#1492;&#1496;&#1468;&#1502;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501; causes some difficulty. The position of the word at the end disfavours our connecting it with the subject &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;, and so does the article, which does not countenance its being taken as predicate. To get rid of the article, J. D. Mich. and Ew. sought to change the reading into &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; &#1496;&#1502;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501;, after <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-33.htm">Isaiah 30:33</a>. But &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;  means a Tophet-like place, not Tophet itself, and so gives no meaning to the purpose. No other course is open than to join the word with "the place Tophet:" like the place Tophet, which is unclean. The plural would then be explained less from the collective force of &#1502;&#1511;&#1493;&#1501; than from regard to the plural subject. "All the houses" opens a supplementary definition of the subject: as concerning all houses; cf. Ew. 310, a. On the worship of the stars by sacrifice on the housetops, transplanted by Manasseh to Jerusalem, see the expos. of <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-5.htm">Zephaniah 1:5</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-3.htm">2 Kings 21:3</a>. '&#1493;&#1492;&#1505;&#1468;&#1498;, coinciding literally with <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-18.htm">Jeremiah 7:18</a>; the inf. absol. being attached to the verb. finit. of the former clause (Ew. 351, c.). - Thus far the word of the Lord to Jeremiah, which he was to proclaim in the valley of Benhinnom. - The execution of the divine commission is, as being a matter of course, not expressly recounted, but is implied in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-14.htm">Jeremiah 19:14</a> as having taken place. </body></html>
