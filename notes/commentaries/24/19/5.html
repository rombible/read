For the opening of this text, as also of those other texts that mention this idolatry, we must open what is meant by <span class="ital">Baal, Moloch, Tophet</span>, and <span class="ital">the valley of the son of Hinnom</span>. There is no doubt but Baal and Molech, or Moloch, signify the same thing; <span class="ital">Baal</span> signifieth a <span class="ital">lord, Molech</span> a <span class="ital">king</span>. They ordinarily called their idols by these names; as also <span class="ital">Malcham</span>, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-5.htm" title="And them that worship the host of heaven on the housetops; and them that worship and that swear by the LORD, and that swear by Malcham;">Zephaniah 1:5</a></span>; upon which account God would not be called <span class="ital">Baal</span>, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-16.htm" title="And it shall be at that day, said the LORD, that you shall call me Ishi; and shall call me no more Baali.">Hosea 2:16</a></span>, though he was called <span class="ital">Jehovah, Elohim</span>, and <span class="ital">Adonai</span>, all which signified lord, as <span class="ital">Baal</span> did. Both Baal and Molech seem common names to all idols. There was more than one idol in the house of Baal, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-26.htm" title="And they brought forth the images out of the house of Baal, and burned them.">2 Kings 10:26</a></span>. The Ammonites called their principal idol <span class="ital">Milcom</span> and <span class="ital">Molech</span>, as appears from <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-5.htm" title="For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.">1 Kings 11:5</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-13.htm" title="And the high places that were before Jerusalem, which were on the right hand of the mount of corruption, which Solomon the king of Israel had built for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Zidonians, and for Chemosh the abomination of the Moabites, and for Milcom the abomination of the children of Ammon, did the king defile.">2 Kings 23:13</a></span>. To this idol they sacrificed their children. It was a very ancient idolatry, as appeareth by the very early law of God against it, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/20-3.htm" title="And I will set my face against that man, and will cut him off from among his people; because he has given of his seed to Molech, to defile my sanctuary, and to profane my holy name....">Leviticus 20:3-5</a></span>. Some say it was derived from Saturn, whom they make contemporary with Deborah and Barak, who, to appease the gods in an imminent danger, sacrificed his son. Others say it began in the time of Serug, the father of Nahor, of whom we read <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/11-20.htm" title="And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug:">Genesis 11:20</a></span>, and that it had its original from the devil, speaking out of the belly of some dead persons, commanding this homage, possibly in imitation of God, who, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-2.htm" title="And he said, Take now your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love, and get you into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering on one of the mountains which I will tell you of.">Genesis 22:2</a></span>, to try Abraham’s obedience, commanded him to offer up Isaac upon the Mount Moriah. We must know there were other sacrifices they offered to Baal: they <span class="ital">burnt incense to Baal</span>, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-5.htm" title="And he put down the idolatrous priests, whom the kings of Judah had ordained to burn incense in the high places in the cities of Judah, and in the places round about Jerusalem; them also that burned incense to Baal, to the sun, and to the moon, and to the planets, and to all the host of heaven.">2 Kings 23:5</a></span>; <span class="ital">they offered sacrifices and burnt-offerings of beasts</span>, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-26.htm" title="And they took the bullock which was given them, and they dressed it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, O Baal, hear us. But there was no voice, nor any that answered. And they leaped on the altar which was made.">1 Kings 18:26</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-24.htm" title="And when they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings, Jehu appointed fourscore men without, and said, If any of the men whom I have brought into your hands escape, he that lets him go, his life shall be for the life of him.">2 Kings 10:24</a></span>; only in some extraordinary straits, to show their great obedience to the devil, they offered their children. What creature they worshipped under this name is not certain, but very probably it was the sun, from <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-5.htm" title="And he put down the idolatrous priests, whom the kings of Judah had ordained to burn incense in the high places in the cities of Judah, and in the places round about Jerusalem; them also that burned incense to Baal, to the sun, and to the moon, and to the planets, and to all the host of heaven.">2 Kings 23:5</a></span>, or some superior being, which they owned as their supreme lord and king, which they, some of them, mistook the <span class="ital">sun, moon, and stars</span> to be; they being glorious beings removed out of men’s knowledge, so as they had not sufficient means to understand their natures, might, considering their motions, and vast influence they had upon all other creatures, mistake them for animate and supreme beings, to which as they paid other homages, (such as swearing by them, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-5.htm" title="And them that worship the host of heaven on the housetops; and them that worship and that swear by the LORD, and that swear by Malcham;">Zephaniah 1:5</a></span>, burning incense, offering beasts, praying to them,) so in imitation of the heathens, and in a pretence of high devotion and homage in some special cases and straits, they offered their children. Some think they only made them go <span class="ital">through the fire</span>, but did not burn them; and indeed so most of the scriptures express this abominable idolatry; but some scriptures speak it plain enough, that they actually burnt them: the psalmist, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-37.htm" title="Yes, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters to devils,">Psalm 106:37</a></span>, saith, <span class="ital">They shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan, and the land was polluted with blood</span>, which it could not have been by their children’s merely passing through the fire; and it is laid to their charge, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-20.htm" title="Moreover you have taken your sons and your daughters, whom you have borne to me, and these have you sacrificed to them to be devoured. Is this of your prostitutions a small matter,">Ezekiel 16:20</a>,21</span>, <span class="ital">Thou hast taken thy sons and thy daughters, whom thou hast borne unto me, and those hast thou sacrificed to them to be devoured. That thou hast slain my children, and delivered them to cause them to pass through the fire for them</span>. We read of the idolatry of Jeroboam, who worshipped the true God, but by calves set up at Dan and Beth-el. Ahab exceeded this, bringing in the terminative worship of the creatures, worshipping the <span class="ital">sun, moon, and stars</span>, under the name of <span class="ital">Baal</span>. But, the first in Judah, of whom we read that he made <span class="ital">his son to pass through the fire</span>, was Ahaz, the father of Hezekiah, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-3.htm" title="But he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, yes, and made his son to pass through the fire, according to the abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD cast out from before the children of Israel.">2 Kings 16:3</a></span>. He was followed by his grandchild Manasseh, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-6.htm" title="And he made his son pass through the fire, and observed times, and used enchantments, and dealt with familiar spirits and wizards: he worked much wickedness in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.">2 Kings 21:6</a></span>. Josiah, the good son of a bad father, <span class="ital">defiled</span> the place where this abominable idolatry was committed, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-10.htm" title="And he defiled Topheth, which is in the valley of the children of Hinnom, that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Molech.">2 Kings 23:10</a></span>. The place where they committed this horrible abomination was the valley of the son of Hinnom, very near the city, and the particular place was called Tophet. There was a high place built for the idol, and many think that the name <span class="ital">Tophet</span> ariseth from their use of a <span class="ital">drum</span> or <span class="ital">tabret</span>, with which, while the poor children were burning, they made great noises to drown the sound of the children’s yellings; though others think the word <span class="ital">Tophet</span> originally signifies hell, or the place of the damned, of which this place, both for the torments and roarings in it, was a lively representation. Now of this barbarous and horrible idolatry God saith, <span class="ital">he commanded them not, neither came it into his mind</span>. It was so far from it, that God had most severely forbid it, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/20-2.htm" title="Again, you shall say to the children of Israel, Whoever he be of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn in Israel, that gives any of his seed to Molech; he shall surely be put to death: the people of the land shall stone him with stones....">Leviticus 20:2-5</a></span>, making it a capital crime for any to do it, and for any to conceal others that they knew did it; so that here is a <span class="ital">meiosis</span>, less spoken than was true fit the case; but possibly God’s expressing a thing of this nature, being an error in his worship, under these soft terms, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I commanded them not, neither did it come into my mind, </span> giveth no small ground to considerate men to judge that we must have a command from God, though not for every individual act of our worship, nor for every circumstance of human action which we do in his worship, yet for every specifical religious act, and for any thing whereby we pay a homage to God; it being indeed the most reasonable thing imaginable, that God should have the same privilege which every prince or great man amongst men claimeth as his right, to prescribe the acts, modes, and methods for his own homage. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/19.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>They have also built the high places of Baal,.... Or, they have even built, &amp;c. and so the words explain what is before suggested of their idolatry; these were the temples in which they placed his image, and the altars on which they sacrificed to him; as follows: <p>to burn their sons with fire, for burnt offerings unto Baal; the same idol that is sometimes called Moloch, the names being much of the same signification; the one signifying a "lord" or "master"; the other a king; and to the idol under each name they burned their children with fire, and offered them as burnt offerings unto it; which was a most cruel and barbarous way of sacrificing. Some think they only caused them to pass through two fires; but the text is express for it, that they burnt them with fire, and made burnt offerings of them, as they did with slain beasts. It seems very likely that they did both: <p>which I commanded not; in my law, as the Targum adds; and which was intimation enough to avoid it; though this was not all, he expressly forbad it, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-2.htm">Leviticus 20:2</a>; <p>nor spake it, neither came it into my mind; and it is marvellous it should ever enter into the heart of man; none but Satan himself could ever have devised such a way of worship. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/19.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">They have built also the high places of Baal, to burn their sons with fire <i>for</i> burnt offerings to Baal, which I <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> commanded not, nor spoke <i>it</i>, neither came <i>it</i> into my mind:</span><p>(c) By which is declared that whatever is not commanded by God's word concerning is service is against his word.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/19.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">5</span>. <span class="ital">of Baal</span>] See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-8.htm" title="The priests said not, Where is the LORD? and they that handle the law knew me not: the pastors also transgressed against me, and the prophets prophesied by Baal, and walked after things that do not profit.">Jeremiah 2:8</a>. <span class="ital">Topheth</span> is the corresponding word in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-31.htm" title="And they have built the high places of Tophet, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my heart.">Jeremiah 7:31</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">5, 6</span>.
