The words of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-9.htm" title="You shall break them with a rod of iron; you shall dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.">Psalm 2:9</a> had portrayed the Messianic king as ruling over the nations, even as “breaking them in pieces like a potter’s vessel.” But it was a new and strange thing to hear these words applied to themselves, to see their own nation treated, not as the potter’s clay that could be remodelled, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/18-1.htm" title="The word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,">Jeremiah 18:1-6</a>, either for a nobler, or, at least, for some serviceable use, but as the vessel which once broken could never be restored. Happily for Israel, there was a depth of Divine compassion which the parable failed to represent. The after-history showed that though, as far as that generation went, the punishment was final, and their existing polity could never be made whole again, there was yet hope for the nation. The things that were “impossible with man” were “possible with God.” The fragments of the broken vessel might be gathered from the heap of rubbish on which the prophet had flung them, and brought into a new shape, for uses less glorious indeed than that for which it had been originally designed, but far other than those of a mere vessel of dishonour.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/jeremiah/19.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/19-10.htm" title="Then shall you break the bottle in the sight of the men that go with you,...">Jeremiah 19:10-13</a></span>. <span class="ital">Then shalt thou break the bottle, </span>&c. — This was intended to be a symbolical representation of the ruin threatened against them, used in order to strike the beholders more powerfully than mere words could do. Of such symbolical actions as these there are several instances in the Scriptures. <span class="ital">Thus saith the Lord, Even so will I break this people </span>— That is, as Jeremiah breaketh the bottle: <span class="ital">That cannot be made whole again </span>— That is, the ruin of Jerusalem shall be an utter ruin: no hand can repair it but his that broke it; and if they return to him, though he has torn, he will heal. In fact, Jerusalem was so utterly destroyed by the Chaldeans that there was little left standing of it. So that after their captivity they were obliged to build a new city in the place of the former. <span class="ital">And they shall bury them in Tophet </span>— These words are omitted by the LXX.; <span class="ital">till there be no place to bury </span>— Till there is no room to bury more; for the meaning is, that the whole valley of Tophet should be so filled with dead bodies, that there should be no room to lay any more there; by which is expressed the greatness of the slaughter. <span class="ital">And even make this city as Tophet </span>— A place of slaughter. <span class="ital">And the houses of Jerusalem shall be defiled as Tophet </span>— Namely, polluted with dead bodies. <span class="ital">Because of the houses upon whose roofs they have burned incense </span>— The houses of the Jews were built with flat roofs, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-8.htm" title="When you build a new house, then you shall make a battlement for your roof, that you bring not blood on your house, if any man fall from there.">Deuteronomy 22:8</a>, and there they dedicated altars to the host of heaven, where they could have a full view of them.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/19.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>19:10-15 The potter's vessel, after it is hardened, can never be pieced again when it is broken. And as the bottle was broken, so shall Judah and Jerusalem be broken by the Chaldeans. No human hand can repair it; but if they return to the Lord he will heal. As they filled Tophet with the slain sacrificed to their idols, so will God fill the whole city with the slain that shall fall as sacrifices to his justice. Whatever men may think, God will appear as terrible against sin and sinners as the Scriptures state; nor shall the unbelief of men make his promise or his threatenings of no effect. The obstinacy of sinners in sinful ways, is their own fault; if they are deaf to the word of God, it is because they have stopped their ears. We have need to pray that God, by his grace, would deliver us from hardness of heart, and contempt of his word and commandments.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Make void - The verb used here is that from which "bottle" <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-1.htm">Jeremiah 19:1</a> is derived, and as it represents the sound made by the water running out, it would be better translated, "pour out."

Horrible evil will the Lord bring on this place, i.e., Jerusalem. The ears of every one that hears it will tingle, so utterly stunning will the news of it turn out to be; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-12.htm">2 Kings 21:12</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-11.htm">1 Samuel 3:11</a>, where we find &#1514;&#1468;&#1510;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492;; cf. Ew. 197, a. This they have brought on themselves by their dreadful sins. They have forsaken Jahveh, disowned this place;  &#1504;&#1499;&#1468;&#1512; , prop. find strange, <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-27.htm">Deuteronomy 32:27</a>, then treat as strange, deny, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-29.htm">Job 21:29</a>. In substance: they have not treated Jerusalem as the city of the sanctuary of their God, but, as it mentioned after, they have burnt incense in it to other (strange) gods. The words: they and their fathers, and the kings of Judah, are not the subject to "knew not," as is "they and their," etc., in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-15.htm">Jeremiah 9:15</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-13.htm">Jeremiah 16:13</a>, but to the preceding verb of the principal clause. "And have filled the city with the blood of innocents." This Grot. and others understand by the blood of the children slain for Moloch; and for this, appeal is made to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-37.htm">Psalm 106:37</a>., where the pouring out of innocent blood is explained to be that of sons and daughters offered to idols. But this passage cannot be the standard for the present one, neither can the statement that here we have to deal with idolatry alone. This latter is petitio principii. If shedding the blood of innocents had been said of offerings to Moloch, then <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-5.htm">Jeremiah 19:5</a> must be taken as epexegesis. But in opposition to this we have not only the parallelism of the clauses, but also and especially the circumstance, that not till <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-5.htm">Jeremiah 19:5</a> is mention made of altars on which to offer children of Moloch. We therefore understand the filling of Jerusalem with the blood of innocents, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-6.htm">Jeremiah 7:6</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-34.htm">Jeremiah 2:34</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-3.htm">Jeremiah 22:3</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-17.htm">Jeremiah 22:17</a>, of judicial murder or of bloody persecution of the godly; and on two grounds: 1. because alongside of idolatry we always find mentioned as the chief sin the perversion of justice to the shedding of innocent blood (cf. the passages cited), so that this sin would not likely be omitted here, as one cause of the dreadful judgment about to pass on Jerusalem; 2. because our passage recalls the very wording of <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-16.htm">2 Kings 21:16</a>, where, after mentioning his idolatry, it is said of Manasseh: Also innocent blood hath he shed, until he made Jerusalem full (&#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1488;) to the brink.<p>The climax in the enumeration of sins in these verses is accordingly this: 1. The disowning of the holiness of Jerusalem as the abode of the Lord by the public practice of idolatry; 2. the shedding of innocent blood as extremity of injustice and godless judicial practices; 3. as worst of all abominations, the building of altars for burning their own children to Moloch. That the Moloch-sacrifices are mentioned last, as being worst of all, is shown by the three relative clauses: which I have not commanded, etc., which by an impassioned gradation of phrases mark God's abomination of these horrors. On this subject cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-31.htm">Jeremiah 7:31</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-35.htm">Jeremiah 32:35</a>.</body></html>
