So Ezekiel waited for seven days among the exiles that dwelt by the river of Chebar, till the word of the Lord came to him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-16.htm" title="And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of the LORD came to me, saying,">Ezekiel 3:16</a>).

God is ever ready to return in mercy to those he has afflicted; and he never rejects any who rely on his promises. He has declared enough to silence even the causeless fears of his people, which discourge them in the way of duty. Whatever loss or suffering we may fear from obedience, is provided against in God's word; and he will protect and deliver all who trust in him and serve him. It is folly to quit our place, especially to quit a holy land, because we meet with trouble in it. And the evils we think to escape by sin, we certainly bring upon ourselves. We may apply this to the common troubles of life; and those who think to avoid them by changing their place, will find that the grievances common to men will meet them wherever they go. Sinners who dissemble with God in solemn professions especially should be rebuked with sharpness; for their actions speak more plainly than words. We know not what is good for ourselves; and what we are most fond of, and have our hearts most set upon, often proves hurtful, and sometimes fatal.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/42.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>After ten days - On previous occasions Jeremiah when consulted answered at once <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-3.htm">Jeremiah 21:3</a>. The present delay (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/28-12.htm">Jeremiah 28:12</a>) was probably granted by God in order to free the minds of the people from the panic caused by the murder of Gedaliah and their fear of Chaldaean vengeance.

Man left to himself would have given an immediate response to the people, who were impatient of delay. The delay was designed to test the sincerity of their professed willingness to obey, and that they should have full time to deliberate (De 8:2).

Abarbinel thinks it was on the tenth day of the seventh month, the day of atonement, that the answer was returned; but it is clear, from the context, that it was ten days from the time the Jews applied to the prophet to inquire of the Lord for them, and he promised to do it, that this word came from the Lord to him; not that he was praying all this while, as some think; but, having spread the case before the Lord, he waited for an answer; which was deferred, that it might have the greater weight with it when it came; and that it might appear that it was not of the prophet himself, a device of his own; and chiefly this was to mortify these people, who were impatient of an answer; and whose hypocrisy the Lord knew; and whose disobedience he foresaw; and therefore did not think fit to give the answer directly, but keep them in suspense awhile. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/42.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{c}</span> And it came to pass after ten days, that the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah.</span><p>(c) Here is declared the vision and the opportunity of it, of which mention was made, Jer 40:1.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/42.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">7</span>. <span class="ital">after ten days</span>] Pe. points out the importance of the <span class="ital">v</span>., as giving us an insight into the nature of prophecy.

Keil thinks it was for the sake of the people, who needed time to collect themselves and listen calmly to the revelation. Ezekiel once waited seven days (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-16.htm">Ezekiel 3:16</a>); but this was owing to his own disturbed state of mind. The answer of the Lord extends to ver. 18, the last four verses being an epilogue enforcing the Divine declaration. It consists of the promise (vers. 9-12) that, if the people will remain quietly in the land, they will be protected; and of the threat (vers. 13-18) that, if they presume to migrate into Egypt, they will perish there by sword, famine, and pestilence. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/42.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"And there drew near all the captains, namely, Johanan the son of Kareah, and Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah, and all the people, from little to great, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/42-2.htm">Jeremiah 42:2</a>. And said to Jeremiah the prophet, Let our supplication come before thee, and pray for us to Jahveh thy God, for all this remnant (for we are left a few out of many, as thine eyes see us); <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/42-3.htm">Jeremiah 42:3</a>. That Jahveh thy God may tell us the way in which we should go, and the thing that we should do." Of the captains, two, viz., Johanan and Jezaniah, are mentioned as the leaders of the people and the directors of the whole undertaking, who also, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/42-1.htm">Jeremiah 42:1</a>., insolently accuse the prophet of falsehood, and carry out the proposed march to Egypt. Jezaniah is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/40-8.htm">Jeremiah 40:8</a> called the Maachathite; here he is named in connection with his father, "the son of Hoshaiah;" while in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/43-2.htm">Jeremiah 43:2</a>, in conjunction with Johanan the son of Kareah, Azariah the son of Hoshaiah is mentioned, which name the lxx also have in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/42-1.htm">Jeremiah 42:1</a> of this chapter. Hitzig, Ewald, etc., are consequently of the opinion that &#1497;&#1494;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492; in our verse has been written by mistake for &#1506;&#1494;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492;. But more probable is the supposition that the error is in the &#1506;&#1494;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492; of <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/43-2.htm">Jeremiah 43:2</a>, inasmuch as there is no reason to doubt the identity of Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah with the Jezaniah descended from Maacha (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/40-8.htm">Jeremiah 40:8</a>); and the assumption that &#1497;&#1494;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492; is incorrect in two passages (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/42-1.htm">Jeremiah 42:1</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/40-8.htm">Jeremiah 40:8</a>) is highly improbable. They go to the prophet Jeremiah, whom they had taken with them from Mizpah, where he was living among the people, with the rest of the inhabitants of the place (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/41-16.htm">Jeremiah 41:16</a>). &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1504;&#1488;  as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-20.htm">Jeremiah 37:20</a>; see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-7.htm">Jeremiah 36:7</a>. The request made to the prophet that he would intercede for them with the Lord, which they further urge on the ground that the number left out of the whole people is small, while there is implied in this the wish that God may not let this small remnant also perish; - this request N&#1492;gelsbach considers a piece of hypocrisy, and the form of asking the prophet "a mere farce," since it is quite plain from <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/43-1.htm">Jeremiah 43:1-6</a> that the desire to go to Egypt was already deeply rooted in their minds, and from this they would not allow themselves to be moved, even by the earnest warning of the prophet. But to hypocrites, who were playing a mere farce with the prophet, the Lord would have probably replied in a different way from what we find in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/42-8.htm">Jeremiah 42:8-22</a>. As the Searcher of hearts, He certainly would have laid bare their hypocrisy. And however unequivocally the whole address implies the existence of disobedience to the voice of God, it yet contains nothing which can justify the assumption that it was only in hypocrisy that they wished to learn the will of God. We must therefore assume that their request addressed to the prophet was made in earnest, although they expected that the Lord's reply would be given in terms favourable to their intention. They wished to obtain from God information as to which way they should go, and what they should do, - not as to whether they should remain in the country or go to Egypt. "The way that we should go" is, of course, not to be understood literally, as if they merely wished to be told the road by which they would most safely reach Egypt; neither, on the other hand, are the words to be understood in a merely figurative sense, of the mode of procedure they ought to pursue; but they are to be understood of the road they ought to take in order to avoid the vengeance of the Chaldeans which they dreaded, - in the sense, whither they ought to go, in order to preserve their lives from the danger which threatened them.</body></html>
