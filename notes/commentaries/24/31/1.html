He cannot bear to think of that division, with its deep lines of cleavage in the religious and social life of the people, being perpetuated. Israel should be Israel. This is the crown and consummation of the promise of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-24.htm" title="The fierce anger of the LORD shall not return, until he has done it, and until he have performed the intents of his heart: in the latter days you shall consider it.">Jeremiah 30:24</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/jeremiah/31.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-1.htm" title="At the same time, said the LORD, will I be the God of all the families of Israel, and they shall be my people.">Jeremiah 31:1</a></span>. <span class="ital">At the same time, saith the Lord </span>— Namely, <span class="ital">in the latter days, </span>mentioned <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-24.htm" title="The fierce anger of the LORD shall not return, until he has done it, and until he have performed the intents of his heart: in the latter days you shall consider it.">Jeremiah 30:24</a>. <span class="ital">I will be the God of all the families of</span> <span class="ital">Israel </span>— Not of the two tribes only, but of all the tribes; not of the house of Aaron only and the families of Levi, but of all the families. <span class="ital">And they shall be my people — </span>I will favour them, and do them good, and they shall be subject to, and shall worship and obey me. “This second part of the prophecy,” says Calmet, “principally respects the return of the ten tribes. And I have shown, in a particular dissertation, that not only Judah, Benjamin, and Levi, but also the twelve tribes returned into their own country.” Doubtless, many individuals of the ten tribes returned with the Jews from Babylon, having been incorporated among them in the several places where they were settled; yet this seems to have been only a very partial accomplishment of this prophecy, which, as Blaney observes, “points out circumstances that certainly were not fulfilled at the return of the Jews from the Babylonish captivity, nor have hitherto had their completion.” But, <span class="ital">in the latter days, </span>when the fulness of the Gentiles are brought in, <span class="ital">all Israel shall be saved; for, </span>as Isaiah and St. Paul testify, <span class="ital">there shall come out of Zion the deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob. </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-19.htm" title="So shall they fear the name of the LORD from the west, and his glory from the rising of the sun.

When brought very low, and difficulties appear, it is good to remember that it has been so with the church formerly. But it is hard under present frowns to take comfort from former smiles; yet it is the happiness of those who, through grace, are interested in the love of God, that it is an everlasting love, from everlasting in the counsels, to everlasting in the continuance. Those whom God loves with this love, he will draw to himself, by the influences of his Spirit upon their souls. When praising God for what he has done, we must call upon him for the favours his church needs and expects. When the Lord calls, we must not plead that we cannot come; for he that calls us, will help us, will strengthen us. The goodness of God shall lead them to repentance. And they shall weep for sin with more bitterness, and more tenderness, when delivered out of their captivity, than when groaning under it. If we take God for our Father, and join the church of the first-born, we shall want nothing that is good for us. These predictions doubtless refer also to a future gathering of the Israelites from all quarters of the globe. And they figuratively describe the conversion of sinners to Christ, and the plain and safe way in which they are led.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/31.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>At the same time - literally, At that time, i. e., "the latter day." mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-24.htm">Jeremiah 30:24</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/31.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 31<p>Jer 31:1-40.

"Thus saith Jahveh: Behold, I will turn the captivity of the tents of Jacob, and will take pity on his dwellings; and the city shall be built again upon its own hill, and the palace shall be inhabited after its own fashion. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-19.htm">Jeremiah 30:19</a>. And there shall come forth from them praise and the voice of those who laugh; and I will multiply them, so that they shall not be few, and I will honour them, so that they shall not be mean. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-20.htm">Jeremiah 30:20</a>. And his sons shall be as in former times, and his congregation shall be established before me, and I will punish all that oppress him. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-21.htm">Jeremiah 30:21</a>. And his leader shall spring from himself, and his ruler shall proceed from his midst; and I will bring him near, so that he shall approach to me; for who is he that became surety for his life in drawing near to me? saith Jahveh. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-22.htm">Jeremiah 30:22</a>. And ye shall become my people, and I will be your God."<p>The dwellings of Israel that have been laid waste, and the cities that have been destroyed, shall be restored and inhabited as formerly, so that songs of praise and tones of joy shall resound from them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-18.htm">Jeremiah 30:18</a>.). "The captivity of the tents of Jacob" means the miserable condition of the dwellings of Jacob, i.e., of all Israel; for "to turn the captivity" has everywhere a figurative sense, and signifies the turning of adversity and misery into prosperity and comfort; see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-14.htm">Jeremiah 29:14</a>. Hitzig is quite wrong in his rendering: "I bring back the captives of the tents of Jacob, i.e., those who have been carried away out of the tents." That "tents" does not stand for those who dwell in tents, but is a poetic expression for "habitations," is perfectly clear from the parallel "his dwellings." To "take pity on the dwellings" means to "restore the dwellings that have been destroyed" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-18.htm">Jeremiah 9:18</a>). The anarthrous &#1506;&#1497;&#1512; must not be restricted to the capital, but means every city that has been destroyed; here, the capital naturally claims the first consideration. "Upon its hills" is equivalent to saying on its former site, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/11-13.htm">Joshua 11:13</a>; it does not mean "on the mound made by its ruins," in support of which Ngelsbach erroneously adduces <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/13-17.htm">Deuteronomy 13:17</a>. &#1488;&#1512;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503; in like manner stands, in the most general way, for every palace. &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;&#1493; does not mean "on the proper place," i.e., on an open, elevated spot on the hill (Hitzig), neither does it mean "on its right position" (Ewald); both of these renderings are against the usage of the words: but it signifies "according to its right" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-11.htm">Deuteronomy 17:11</a>), i.e., in accordance with what a palace requires, after its own fashion. &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;, to be inhabited, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-6.htm">Jeremiah 17:6</a>, etc. "Out of them" refers to the cities and palaces. Thence proceeds, resounds praise or thanksgiving for the divine grace shown them (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-11.htm">Jeremiah 33:11</a>), and the voice, i.e., the tones or sounds, of those who laugh (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-17.htm">Jeremiah 15:17</a>), i.e., of the people living in the cities and palaces, rejoicing over their good fortune. "I will increase them, so that they shall not become fewer," cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-6.htm">Jeremiah 29:6</a>; "I will bring them to honour (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-22.htm">Isaiah 8:22</a>), so that they shall not be lightly esteemed." - In <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-20.htm">Jeremiah 30:20</a>. the singular suffixes refer to Jacob as a nation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-18.htm">Jeremiah 30:18</a>). "His sons" are the members of the nation; they become as they were previously, in former times - sicut olim sub Davide et Salmonoe, florentissimo rerum statu. "The congregation will be established before me," i.e., under my survey (&#1514;&#1468;&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1503; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102-29.htm">Psalm 102:29</a>), i.e., they shall no more be shaken or moved from their position.</body></html>
