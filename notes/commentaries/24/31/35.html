The stability and permanence of natural order is a pledge and earnest of the fulfilment of His promises to Israel as a people. The new Covenant of pardon and illumination is to be, what the first Covenant was not, eternal in its duration. We have learnt, through the teaching of St. Paul, while not excluding Israel according to the flesh from its share in that fulfilment, to extend its range to the children of the faith of Abraham, the true Israel of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/2-28.htm" title="For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision, which is outward in the flesh:">Romans 2:28-29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/4-11.htm" title="And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed to them also:">Romans 4:11-12</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/jeremiah/31.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/31-35.htm" title="Thus said the LORD, which gives the sun for a light by day, and the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night, which divides the sea when the waves thereof roar; The LORD of hosts is his name:...">Jeremiah 31:35-37</a></span>. <span class="ital">Thus saith the Lord, who giveth the sun for a light by day</span> — All the acts here mentioned are such as manifest the divine, almighty power of him who is the Lord of all the hosts of the creation. <span class="ital">Which divideth, </span>or, <span class="ital">who did divide, the sea </span>— Namely, as the words are generally interpreted, the Red sea, to give the Israelites passage. The original words, however, <span class="greekheb">רגע הים</span>, which occur <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-15.htm" title="But I am the LORD your God, that divided the sea, whose waves roared: The LORD of hosts is his name.">Isaiah 51:15</a>, where they are translated as here, are by Bishop Lowth rendered, <span class="ital">who stilleth the sea, </span>a sense which accords better with the words immediately following, <span class="ital">when the waves thereof roar </span>— That is, even when the waves are most tumultuous, and roar most dreadfully, he, with infinite ease, quiets them, and produces a perfect calm. In this sense the same word is interpreted <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-2.htm" title="Thus said the LORD, The people which were left of the sword found grace in the wilderness; even Israel, when I went to cause him to rest.">Jeremiah 31:2</a> of this chapter, and also <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-34.htm" title="Their Redeemer is strong; the LORD of hosts is his name: he shall thoroughly plead their cause, that he may give rest to the land, and disquiet the inhabitants of Babylon.">Jeremiah 50:34</a>. <span class="ital">If these ordinances </span>— Hebrew, <span class="greekheb">החקים</span>, <span class="ital">these appointments </span>respecting the heavenly bodies and their motions and uses; <span class="ital">depart from before me </span>— Be altered or suspended in their operations; <span class="ital">then shall the seed of Israel cease from being a nation,</span> &c. — Thus God makes the continuance of the laws of nature a pledge of the continuance of Israel as a people. The prediction implies, 1st, That God would preserve a remnant of them in the country to which they were led captive, and would restore them to their own land; 2d, That there should be another remnant of them, at the beginning of the gospel, called <span class="greekheb">οι Σωζομενοι</span>, <span class="ital">the saved, </span>(<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-47.htm" title="Praising God, and having favor with all the people.

To this place St. Paul, speaking of the conversion of the Jews in the latter times, seems to refer when he says, <span class="ital">The gifts and calling of God </span>[to the Jews] <span class="ital">are without repentance, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-29.htm" title="For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance.">Romans 11:29</a>. <span class="ital">If heaven above can be measured, </span>&c. — If the height and extent thereof can be ascertained by men, which is impossible, <span class="ital">I will also cast off all the seed of Israel, </span>&c. — That is, I will never cast them all off — a promise which the apostle, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/11-1.htm" title="I say then, Has God cast away his people? God forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin....">Romans 11:1-2</a>,) proves to have been made good by God, notwithstanding the rejection of the great body of that people.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/31.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>31:35-40 As surely as the heavenly bodies will continue their settled course, according to the will of their Creator, to the end of time, and as the raging sea obeys him, so surely will the Jews be continued a separate people. Words can scarcely set forth more strongly the restoration of Israel. The rebuilding of Jerusalem, and its enlargement and establishment, shall be an earnest of the great things God will do for the gospel church. The personal happiness of every true believer, as well as the future restoration of Israel, is secured by promise, covenant, and oath. This Divine love passes knowledge; and to those who take hold upon it, every present mercy is an earnest of salvation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/31.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Divideth ... - Rather, stirreth up the sea so that its waves roar. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/31.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>35. divideth &#8230; sea when &#8230; waves &#8230; roar &#8230; Lord of hosts &#8230; name&#8212;quoted from Isa 51:15, the genuineness of which passage is thus established on Jeremiah's authority.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/31.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The word egd is here ill translated <span class="ital">divide</span>, which hath led some interpreters to think that God here hath a respect to his dividing the Red Sea, that the Israelites might pass over, which seemeth not at all here to be intended.

The proverb means, "Children atone for the misdeeds of their fathers," or "The sins of the fathers are visited on their innocent children." On this point, cf. the explanations given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-2.htm">Ezekiel 18:2</a>. "Then shall they no more say" is rightly explained by Hitzig to mean, "They shall have no more occasion to say." But the meaning of the words is not yet made plain by this; in particular, the question how we must understand <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-30.htm">Jeremiah 31:30</a> is not settled. Graf, referring to <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-7.htm">Jeremiah 23:7-8</a>, supplies &#1497;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; after &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1470;&#1488;&#1501;, and thus obtains the meaning, Then will they no more accuse God of unrighteousness, as in that wicked proverb, but they will perceive that every one has to suffer for his own guilt. Hitzig and Ngelsbach have declared against this insertion - the former with the remark that, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-7.htm">Jeremiah 23:7-8</a>, because both members of the sentence begin with protestations, the whole is clear, while here it is not so - the latter resting on the fact that the dropping of the proverb from current use certainly implies a correct knowledge of the righteousness of God, but one which is very elementary and merely negative; while, on the other hand, the whole connection of the passage now before us shows that it is intended to describe a period when the theocratic life is in a most flourishing condition. Then expositors take <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-30.htm">Jeremiah 31:30</a> as the utterance of the prophet, and as embodying the notion that the average level of morality shall be so high at this future period, that only some sins will continue to be committed, and these as isolated exceptions to the rule. Taken all in all, Israel will be a holy people, in which the general spirit pervading them will repress the evil in some individuals, that would otherwise manifest itself. But we cannot imagine how these ideas can be supposed to be contained in the words, "Every man shall die for his own sins," etc. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-30.htm">Jeremiah 31:30</a> unquestionably contains the opposite of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-29.htm">Jeremiah 31:29</a>. The proverb mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-29.htm">Jeremiah 31:29</a> involves the complaint against God, that in punishing sin He deals unjustly. According to this view, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-30.htm">Jeremiah 31:30</a> must contain the declaration that, in the future, the righteousness of God is to be revealed in the punishment of sins. As we have already remarked on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-3.htm">Ezekiel 18:3</a>., the verse in question rather means, that after the re-establishment of Israel, the Lord will make known to His people His grace in so glorious a manner that the favoured ones will fully perceive the righteousness of His judgments. The experience of the unmerited love and compassion of the Lord softens the heart so much, that the favoured one no longer doubts the righteousness of the divine punishment. Such knowledge of true blessedness cannot be called elementary; rather, it implies a deep experience of divine grace and a great advance in the life of faith. Nor does the verse contain a judgment expressed by the prophet in opposition to that of his contemporaries, but it simply declares that the opinion contained in that current proverb shall no longer be accepted then, but the favoured people will recognise in the death of the sinner the punishment due to them for their own sin. Viewed in this manner, these verses prepare the way for the following announcement concerning the nature of the new covenant. </body></html>
