The “smiting upon the thigh” is, like the Publican’s “smiting on his breast” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-13.htm" title="And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes to heaven, but smote on his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner.">Luke 18:13</a>), an Eastern expression of extremest grief. So in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-17.htm" title="I will also smite my hands together, and I will cause my fury to rest: I the LORD have said it.">Ezekiel 21:17</a> we have the “smiting of the hands together” as a symbol of anger, which is also sorrow. In Homer (<span class= "ital">Odyss. </span>xiii. 193) we have the very gesture here depicted—<p>“And then he groaned, and smote on both his thighs<p>With headlong hands, and so in sorrow spoke.”<p><span class= "bld">The reproach of my youth</span>—<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> the shame which the sins of his youth had brought upon him.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/jeremiah/31.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-19.htm" title="Surely after that I was turned, I repented; and after that I was instructed, I smote on my thigh: I was ashamed, yes, even confounded, because I did bear the reproach of my youth.">Jeremiah 31:19</a></span>. <span class="ital">Surely after that I was turned, I repented </span>— After I was enlightened and impressed with a due sense of my duty, and of the many deviations from it of which I had been guilty, and after my will was subjected to the will of God, I straightway became a true penitent, and expressed my repentance by all the outward and inward signs of an unfeigned sorrow for, and hatred to, my past conduct. <span class="ital">And after that I was instructed </span>— Respecting my sin and folly, in <span class="ital">forsaking the fountain of living waters </span>for <span class="ital">the broken cisterns that could hold no water; I smote upon my thigh </span>— Through the most poignant grief and concern, and with indignation against myself. <span class="ital">I was ashamed, yea, even confounded </span>— At my own stupidity and frowardness, and could neither with any confidence look up to God, nor with any comfort reflect upon myself; <span class="ital">because I did bear the reproach of my youth </span>— The burden of my former sins lay heavy upon my mind, and I became sensible that all the calamities and reproaches I had undergone were the due deserts of my offences. Ephraim <span class="ital">smote upon his thigh, </span>as the publican <span class="ital">upon his breast. </span>We find, both in the Holy Scriptures, and other ancient records, smiting on the thigh mentioned as an expression of great surprise and concern. Thus God commands Ezekiel <span class="ital">to cry and howl, </span>on account of the <span class="ital">sword </span>that <span class="ital">should be upon his people, </span>and to <span class="ital">smite upon his thigh. </span>We find the same custom noticed by Homer, <span class="ital">Iliad </span>16. 50:124. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>— — — — — — <span class="greekheb">αυταρ Αχιλλευς Μηρω πληξαμενος Πατροληα πρωσεειπεν</span>, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Divine </span>Achilles <span class="ital">view’d the rising flames, And smote his thigh, and thus aloud exclaims, Arm, arm, Patroclus!

He is angry at himself for his sin, and folly, and frowardness. He finds he cannot, by his own power, keep himself close with God, much less bring himself back when he is revolted. Therefore he prays, Turn thou me, and I shall be turned. His will was bowed to the will of God. When the teaching of God's Spirit went with the corrections of his providence, then the work was done. This is our comfort in affliction, that the Lord thinks upon us. God has mercy in store, rich mercy, sure mercy, suitable mercy, for all who seek him in sincerity.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/31.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>After that I was turned - i. e., after I had turned away from Thee.

The prophet foretelleth that before this promised deliverance should come, the Israelites should be in another temper, that their uncircumcised hearts should be humbled, they should accept of the punishment of their sins, confess God’s justice and righteousness, and their own wantonness and unruliness, pray unto God to change their hearts, which would never else be changed, and change their conditions, which would depend upon that change of their hearts, laying claim to God as their God, who had promised, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/30-1.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, when all these things are come on you, the blessing and the curse, which I have set before you, and you shall call them to mind among all the nations, where the LORD your God has driven you,">Deu 30:1</a>,2</span>, that when the blessings and the curses spoken of <span class="bld">Deu 28 Deu 29</span> should come upon them, and <span class="ital">they should call them to mind among all the nations whither the Lord had driven them, if they returned unto the Lord their God, and obeyed his voice, according to all that he commanded them, they and their children, with all their heart, and all their soul; that then the Lord their God would turn their captivity, and have compassion on them</span>, &c. Now, saith Ephraim, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">after I was turned, </span> after God had changed our hearts, we <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">repented</span> and changed our practices; after that God had instructed us, either by his prophets, or by briers and thorns, by our afflictions, or by his Holy Spirit, we smote upon our thighs in testimony of our sorrow and affliction, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-12.htm" title="Cry and howl, son of man: for it shall be on my people, it shall be on all the princes of Israel: terrors by reason of the sword shall be on my people: smite therefore on your thigh.">Ezekiel 21:12</a></span>. <span class="ital">Then I was ashamed and confounded for my sins</span>, understanding that I did but bear the just punishment of the sins which I had long ago committed, in the time of my wantonness, rebellion, and disobedience to God. This is expressed by the term youth, because ordinarily men and women’s youth is their time of wantonness; persons ordinarily growing more considerate and sober as years increase upon them. Thus the prophet foretelleth that God would prepare this people for mercy. In the next verses he showeth how ready God’s ear would be to hear. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/31.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Surely after that I was turned I repented,.... Ephraim's prayer was answered; as he prayed he might be turned, he was; and when he was turned, then he repented, not only of sin in general, but of such sins as he had been particularly guilty of; not only of the grosser actions of life, but of inward sins, secret lusts and corruptions; even of sins of holy things, having now different sentiments, affections, and conduct: and this is what is called evangelical repentance, and is from the grace of God; springs from love; flows from a sight of God and a view of Christ; is increased by the discoveries of God's love, and is unto life and salvation; and this sort of repentance follows upon conversion; there must be first a true and real conversion before this evangelical repentance can take place: <p>and after that I was instructed I smote upon my thigh: as expressive of sorrow for sin after a godly sort; of indignation at it; and shame and confusion for it; and also of astonishment, at the mercy, forbearance, and long suffering of God, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-12.htm">Ezekiel 21:12</a>; and this humiliation follows upon spiritual instruction, which is previously necessary to it; "after it was made known to me" (u); as the words may be rendered; what a sinful, guilty, impure, and impotent, and unrighteous creature he was; after that he became acquainted with himself, and his wretched state and condition; when instructed either by the rod, or by the word, and by the Spirit of God, in the use of both, or either; when led into the knowledge of divine things; of the love and grace of God through Christ; of the person, offices, and glory of Christ; of the way of life and salvation by him; and of the doctrines of pardon, and righteousness, and acceptance through him: <p>I was ashamed, yea, even confounded, because I did bear the reproach of my youth; in his conscience; the sins and follies of his youth being presented and set before him, and he convinced of them, was filled with shame and confusion at the remembrance of them; which is a common thing when a man is thoroughly awakened and converted, and is brought to true repentance and humiliation.
