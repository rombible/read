In Heb 8:8,9, this place is quoted as the sum of the covenant of grace made with believers in Jesus Christ. Not, I will give them a new law; for Christ came not to destroy the law, but to fulfil it; but the law shall be written in their hearts by the finger of the Spirit, as formerly written in the tables of stone. The Lord will, by his grace, make his people willing people in the day of his power. All shall know the Lord; all shall be welcome to the knowledge of God, and shall have the means of that knowledge. There shall be an outpouring of the Holy Spirit, at the time the gospel is published. No man shall finally perish, but for his own sins; none, who is willing to accept of Christ's salvation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/31.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A sour grape - Better, sour grapes. The idea that Jeremiah and Ezekiel (marginal reference) modified the terms of the second Commandment arises from a mistaken exegesis of their words. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-18.htm">Jeremiah 32:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-16.htm">Deuteronomy 24:16</a>. The obdurate Jews made it a reproach to the divine justice that the nation was to be sorely visited for Manasseh's sin. But this was only because generation after generation had, instead of repenting, repeated the sins of that evil time, and even in a worse form. justice must at length have its course. The acknowledgment that each man died for his own iniquity was a sign of their return to a more just and right state of feeling.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/31.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>30.

His own personal iniquity; and not a corporeal death only, but an eternal one, which is the just wages of sin. It seems to intimate, that, after the Babylonish captivity, no public calamity should come upon them for the sins of their fathers and their own jointly, but for their own iniquities singly; so their last destruction by the Romans was for their personal disbelief and rejection of the Messiah; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-24.htm">John 8:24</a>; and the calamities upon them ever since have been for the same reason. Indeed, they imprecated his blood upon them, and upon their children, and so it is; but then, their children are under the power of the same sin of unbelief, and will remain so, until the veil is taken away, and they turn to the Lord; after which it will still be a more clear case that everyone shall die for his own iniquity; <p>every man that eateth the sour grape, his teeth shall be set on edge; sin, though it may be esteemed a sweet morsel, is a sour grape, and will prove so in the issue; and will give a man as much trouble and disquietude, when he is convinced of the evil of it, or suffers the punishment of it, as when a man's "teeth are set on edge"; and indeed the consequence of it will be weeping, wailing, and gnashing of teeth. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/31.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But every one shall die for his own iniquity: every man that eateth the sour grape, his teeth shall be set on edge.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/31.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The re-establishment and blessing of Judah. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-23.htm">Jeremiah 31:23</a>. "Thus saith Jahveh of hosts, the God of Israel: Once more shall they say this word in the land of Judah and in its cities, when I turn their captivity: 'Jahveh bless thee, O habitation of righteousness, O mountain of holiness!' <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-24.htm">Jeremiah 31:24</a>.

For I have satiated the weary soul, and I have filled every languishing soul. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-26.htm">Jeremiah 31:26</a>. Because of this I awoke and looked, and my sleep was sweet unto me."<p>The prophecy which treats of Judah alone is condensed, but states much in few words - not merely the restitutio in statum integritatis, but also rich blessing thereafter. "May Jahveh bless thee" is a benediction, equivalent to "may you be blessed;" cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/128-5.htm">Psalm 128:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/134-3.htm">Psalm 134:3</a>. &#1504;&#1493;&#1492; &#1510;&#1491;&#1511; does not mean "habitation of salvation," but "habitation of righteousness;" cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-21.htm">Isaiah 1:21</a>, where it is said of Jerusalem that righteousness formerly dwelt in it. This state of matters is again to exist; Jerusalem is again to become a city in which righteousness dwells. "The holy mountain" is Zion, including Moriah, where the Lord had set up His throne. That the designation "the holy mountain" was applied to the whole of Jerusalem cannot be made out from <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-6.htm">Psalm 2:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/48-2.htm">Psalm 48:2</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-9.htm">Isaiah 11:9</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/27-13.htm">Isaiah 27:13</a>, which have been adduced to prove the assertion. The prayer for the blessing implies that Zion will again be the seat of the Divine King of His people. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-24.htm">Jeremiah 31:24</a>. "There dwell in it (in the land of Judah) Judah and all his towns," i.e., the population of Judah and of all its towns, as "husbandmen and (those who) pasture flocks," i.e., each one pursuing undisturbed his own peaceful employment, agriculture and cattle-rearing, and (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-25.htm">Jeremiah 31:25</a>) so blessed in these callings that they are kept from every need and want. &#1491;&#1468;&#1488;&#1489;&#1492; may either be viewed as the perfect, before which the relative is to be supplied, or an adjectival form imitated from the Aramaic participle, masc. &#1491;&#1468;&#1488;&#1489;. </body></html>
