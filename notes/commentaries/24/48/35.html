The destruction of Moab is further prophesied, to awaken them by national repentance and reformation to prevent the trouble, or by a personal repentance and reformation to prepare for it. In reading this long roll of threatenings, and mediating on the terror, it will be of more use to us to keep in view the power of God's anger and the terror of his judgments, and to have our hearts possessed with a holy awe of God and of his wrath, than to search into all the figures and expressions here used. Yet it is not perpetual destruction. The chapter ends with a promise of their return out of captivity in the latter days. Even with Moabites God will not contend for ever, nor be always wroth. The Jews refer it to the days of the Messiah; then the captives of the Gentiles, under the yoke of sin and Satan, shall be brought back by Divine grace, which shall make them free indeed.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/48.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The meaning is that, taking up the lamentation of Heshbon, the Moabites break forth into a wail, heard as far as Elealeh, scarcely two miles distant <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/32-37.htm">Numbers 32:37</a>, but thence spreading over the land to towns on the southern and southwestern borders of the land.<p>An heifer of three years old - Applied in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/15-5.htm">Isaiah 15:5</a> to Zoar, but here to Horonaim.

Zoar, Horonaim, and Eglah formed a tripolis, or confederacy of three towns, and Eglah might therefore be put after either one or the other.<p>Nimrim - Probably the Wady-en-Nemeirah at the southeastern end of the Dead Sea. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/48.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>35. him that offereth&#8212;namely, whole burnt offerings as the Hebrew requires [Grotius].

Those who "heard" are the prophet and the people of God. There is an accumulation of words to describe the pride of Moab. Isaiah's expression also, &#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1514;&#1493; &#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1499;&#1503; &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493;, is here expanded into two clauses, and Jahveh is named as the subject.

The Masoretes took &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; in the sense of "staves," and took staves as a symbol of princes, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/11-6.htm">Hosea 11:6</a>. Luther, in his translation, "I know his anger well, that he cannot do so very much, and attempts to do more than he can," follows the Vulgate, Ego scio jactantiam ejus, et quod non sit juxta eam virtus ejus, nec juxta quod poterat conata sit facere, which again seems to have followed the lxx in taking &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493; for &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493;.) </body></html>
