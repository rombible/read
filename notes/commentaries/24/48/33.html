Of this the prophet says, in a form which reminds us of the <span class= "greekheb">δωρα αδωρα </span>(“gifts that are no gifts”) of Soph. Aias. 674, that it shall be “no shouting,” <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> that it shall be turned to wailing and lamentation, or the shout and tumult of battle shall have taken its place.<span class= "bld"><p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/48.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>48:14-47. The destruction of Moab is further prophesied, to awaken them by national repentance and reformation to prevent the trouble, or by a personal repentance and reformation to prepare for it. In reading this long roll of threatenings, and mediating on the terror, it will be of more use to us to keep in view the power of God's anger and the terror of his judgments, and to have our hearts possessed with a holy awe of God and of his wrath, than to search into all the figures and expressions here used. Yet it is not perpetual destruction. The chapter ends with a promise of their return out of captivity in the latter days. Even with Moabites God will not contend for ever, nor be always wroth. The Jews refer it to the days of the Messiah; then the captives of the Gentiles, under the yoke of sin and Satan, shall be brought back by Divine grace, which shall make them free indeed.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/48.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Winepresses - Rather, "wine-vats," into which the wine runs from the presses.<p>Their shouting shall be no shouting - The vintage shout is - silence.

Joy is taken away as from the nearer regions (Canaan and Palestine), so from the farther "land of Moab"; what has happened to Judah shall befall Moab, too (Jer 48:26, 27) [Maurer]. However, Moab alone seems to be spoken of here; nor does the parallelism forbid "plentiful field" answering to "Moab." English Version is therefore better.<p>shouting&#8212;repeated; as at the conclusion of the vintage, men sing over and over again the same cry of joy.

Or, from Carmel (k); not Mount Carmel in the land of Israel; for the prophecy is of Moab; though that reached to Sibmah; but here it signifies any fruitful place, like Carmel, where were good pasturage, corn, and fruit bearing trees, which produced great plenty of good things, and caused joy to the owners of them: but now all being destroyed by the enemy, joy and gladness would cease: <p>and from the land of Moab; from all parts of it, where there had used to be plenty, and so joy: <p>and I have caused wine to fail from the wine presses: there being no grapes to put into them, or men to tread them, were there any; or, if put in and trodden, not the owners, but the enemy, should have the wine; so that it should fail from the Moabites; they should be never the better for it. These are the words of the Lord, who has the disposal of the fruits of the earth: <p>none shall tread with shouting; as treaders in the wine press used to do, to encourage one another, and make their labour more easy, and the time to pass on in it more pleasantly; but now there should neither be treading nor shouting; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-10.htm">Isaiah 16:10</a>; <p>their shouting shall be no shouting; not a shouting of joy, as used to be when they trod out the wine; but a cry of mourning and lamentation, because of the sword of the enemy. <p>(k) "de Carmelo", V.

In <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-9.htm">Isaiah 16:9, 10</a> an allusion is made to this double meaning, and so, perhaps, it may be here ("There shall be shouting, but not that of the peaceful vintagers at their work").

And I will destroy from Moab, saith Jahveh, him that offers on a high place and burns incense to his gods."<p>Through his pride, Moab has incurred the sentence of destruction to his power. In arrogance and rage he has exalted himself over Jahveh and His people Israel; therefore must he now be humbled, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-26.htm">Jeremiah 48:26-30</a>.

No other explanation of the word can find support from the language used. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-14.htm">Isaiah 19:14</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/25-10.htm">Isaiah 25:10</a>. In the last clause of <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-26.htm">Jeremiah 48:26</a>, the emphasis lies on &#1490;&#1468;&#1501; &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;: "he also (Moab, like Israel before) shall become a laughing-stock." This statement is enforced by the question put in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-27.htm">Jeremiah 48:27</a>, "Was not Israel a laughing-stock to thee?" &#1493;&#1488;&#1501;&#1470;&#1488;&#1501; shows a double question, like &#1492;&#1470;&#1488;&#1501;; and &#1493;&#1488;&#1501; in the first clause may be further strengthened by the interrogative &#1492; before &#1513;&#1474;&#1495;&#1511;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-17.htm">Genesis 17:17</a>.
