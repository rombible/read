The destruction of Moab is further prophesied, to awaken them by national repentance and reformation to prevent the trouble, or by a personal repentance and reformation to prepare for it. In reading this long roll of threatenings, and mediating on the terror, it will be of more use to us to keep in view the power of God's anger and the terror of his judgments, and to have our hearts possessed with a holy awe of God and of his wrath, than to search into all the figures and expressions here used. Yet it is not perpetual destruction. The chapter ends with a promise of their return out of captivity in the latter days. Even with Moabites God will not contend for ever, nor be always wroth. The Jews refer it to the days of the Messiah; then the captives of the Gentiles, under the yoke of sin and Satan, shall be brought back by Divine grace, which shall make them free indeed.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/48.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Like pipes - A wind instrument, used at funerals <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-23.htm">Matthew 9:23</a>.<p>The riches that he hath gotten - literally, "that which remains over, a superfluity." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/48.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>36.

That are sounded on mournful occasions, as at funerals, and the like; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-23.htm">Matthew 9:23</a>. This the prophet said, as Kimchi observes, in the person of the people, the inhabitants of Moab; whose hearts would yearn and sound for the calamities of their country like the doleful sound of minstrels. So the Targum, <p>"therefore the Moabites shall sound in their hearts like a harp:'' <p>and my heart shall sound like pipes for the men of Kirheres; as for the country of Moab in general, so for this principal city, and the inhabitants of it, in particular; See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-11.htm">Isaiah 16:11</a>; <p>because the riches that he hath gotten is perished; either Moab or Kirheres; the abundance of goods they had got together were now lost, falling into the hands of the enemy; and which was matter of lamentation.

Isaiah’s word is “an harp” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-11.htm" title="Then shall you say to them, Because your fathers have forsaken me, said the LORD, and have walked after other gods, and have served them, and have worshipped them, and have forsaken me, and have not kept my law;">Jeremiah 16:11</a>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/48.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 36-42.</span> - The description of Moab's lamentations continued. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 36.</span> - Based on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-11.htm">Isaiah 16:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/15-7.htm">Isaiah 15:7</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Like pipes.</span> Isaiah has, "like the harp [or, 'lute']." The pipe, or flute, was specially used at funeral ceremonies (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-23.htm">Matthew 9:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-32.htm">Luke 7:32</a>), and therefore, perhaps, seemed to Jeremiah more appropriate. <span class="cmt_word">Because the riches</span>, etc. This is, no doubt, what we should have expected, but this is not what Jeremiah wrote; "because" should rather be <span class="accented">therefore.</span> Jeremiah simply transferred a clause (substantially at least) from his original, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/15-7.htm">Isaiah 15:7</a>, but into a context where it stands rather less naturally. The meaning of the words in Isaiah is that, the desolation being so great, the Moabites shall carry away as much of their goods as they can. In this new context, however, we can only explain this unexpected "therefore" by referring to a habit of the Israelitish mind by which that which contributed to a result was regarded as worked purposely for that result. Good instances of this habit are <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-5.htm">Genesis 18:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-3.htm">Psalm 45:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-6.htm">Psalm 51:6</a>; comp. Winer's 'New Testament Grammar' (Clark), pp. 573, 574, especially note 1 on p. 574, though the idiom also occurs in Old Testament passages in which the religious view of life is hardly traceable. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/48.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-29.htm">Jeremiah 48:29</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-30.htm">Jeremiah 48:30</a> only more fully develop the idea contained in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-6.htm">Isaiah 16:6</a>. Those who "heard" are the prophet and the people of God. There is an accumulation of words to describe the pride of Moab. Isaiah's expression also, &#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1514;&#1493; &#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1499;&#1503; &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493;, is here expanded into two clauses, and Jahveh is named as the subject. Not only have the people of God perceived the pride of Moab, but God also knows his wrath. &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493; belongs to &#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1499;&#1503; as a genitive, as in Isaiah &#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1499;&#1503; means "not right," contrary to actual facts, i.e., untrue.<p>(Note: The Masoretic accentuation, according to which Athnach is placed under &#1499;&#1468;&#1503;, exhibits another view of the words in the text: this is shown by the Chaldee paraphrase, "their nobles endure not, they have not done what is right." The Masoretes took &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; in the sense of "staves," and took staves as a symbol of princes, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/11-6.htm">Hosea 11:6</a>. Luther, in his translation, "I know his anger well, that he cannot do so very much, and attempts to do more than he can," follows the Vulgate, Ego scio jactantiam ejus, et quod non sit juxta eam virtus ejus, nec juxta quod poterat conata sit facere, which again seems to have followed the lxx in taking &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493; for &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493;.) </body></html>
