The Chaldeans are to destroy the Moabites. We should be thankful that we are required to seek the salvation of men's lives, and the salvation of their souls, not to shed their blood; but we shall be the more without excuse if we do this pleasant work deceitfully. The cities shall be laid in ruins, and the country shall be wasted. There will be great sorrow. There will be great hurry. If any could give wings to sinners, still they could not fly out of the reach of Divine indignation. There are many who persist in unrepented iniquity, yet long enjoy outward prosperity. They had been long corrupt and unreformed, secure and sensual in prosperity. They have no changes of their peace and prosperity, therefore their hearts and lives are unchanged, Ps 55:19.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/48.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I will send - tilters "unto him and they shall" tilt "him, and they shall empty his vessels, and break their" pitchers "in pieces."

"His vessels" are the cities of Moab; the broken "bottles" the men slain [Grotius].

This being their case, they should not continue in it; a change would be made, and that in a very short time, as there was; for, according to Josephus (p), it was about five years after the destruction of Jerusalem that the Moabites were subdued by the king of Babylon: <p>that I will send unto him wanderers that shall cause him to wander; the Chaldeans, who wandered out of their own country to Moab, directed by the providence of God to come there to do his work; and who, at first, might be treated by the Moabites with contempt, as vagrants, but would soon be made to know that they would cause them to wander; or would remove them out of their own country into other lands, particularly Babylon, to be vagrants there. The word may be rendered "travellers" (q); and signifies such that walk with great strength of body, in a stately way, and with great agility and swiftness; in which manner the Chaldeans are described as coming to Moab, and who should cause them to travel back with them in all haste; see word in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-1.htm">Isaiah 63:1</a>. The Targum renders it "spoilers"; according to the metaphor of wine used in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-11.htm">Jeremiah 48:11</a>, it may signify a sort of persons that cause wine to go, or empty it from one vessel to another; such as we call "wine coopers"; and this agrees with what follows: <p>and shall empty his vessels, and break their bottles; depopulate the cities of Moab; destroy the inhabitants of them, and make them barren and empty of men. The Targum is, <p>"I will send spoilers upon them, and they shall spoil them, and empty their substance, and consume the good of their land;'' <p>see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-8.htm">Jeremiah 48:8</a>. The Septuagint version is, "they shall cut in pieces his horns"; which, as Origen (r) interprets them, were a kind of cups anciently used; for in former times they drank out of horns, either of oxen, or other animals; and Pliny (s) says that the northern people used to drink out of the horns of buffaloes, a creature larger than a bull, and which the Muscovites call "thur"; the same is asserted by Athenaeus (t), and others, that the horns of beasts were drinking vessels before cups were invented. <p>(p) Antiqu. l. 10. c. 9. sect. 7.

The figure of earthenware jars of wine is continued. They are emptied by being tilted on one side, an operation which was performed slowly and carefully, that the jars might be safe and the wine run off clear while the sediment was left.

The confusion of numbers and pronouns is remarkable.

To &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-6.htm">Jeremiah 48:6</a> we must supply &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1514; as the subject: "your souls shall be." Ewald would change &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1501; into &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501;; but this proposal has against it the fact that the plural form &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; is found in but a single case, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-20.htm">Ezekiel 13:20</a>, and &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1514; everywhere else: besides, &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; is often used in the singular of several persons, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-6.htm">2 Samuel 19:6</a>, and may further be easily taken here in a distributive sense; cf. &#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1496;&#1493;&#1468; &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-6.htm">Jeremiah 51:6</a>. The assumption of C. B. Michaelis, Rosenmller, Maurer, and of the translators of our "Authorized" English Version, that &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492; is the second person, and refers to the cities, i.e., their inhabitants, is against the context. &#1506;&#1512;&#1493;&#1506;&#1512; cannot here be the name of a town, because neither Aroer in the tribe of Reuben, which was situated on the Arnon, nor Aroer of the tribe of Gad, which was before Rabbath-Ammon, lay in the wilderness; the comparison, too, of the fugitives to a city is unsuitable. The clause reminds us of <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-6.htm">Jeremiah 17:6</a>, and &#1506;&#1512;&#1493;&#1506;&#1512;  equals  the &#1506;&#1512;&#1506;&#1512; of that passage; the form found here is either an error of transcription caused by thinking of Aroer, or a play upon the name of the city, for the purpose of pointing out the fate impending over it.</body></html>
