Wine not so treated retained its first crude bitterness. So, the prophet says, it is with nations. It is not good for them to remain too long in a prosperity which does but strengthen their natural arrogance. There is a wholesome discipline in defeat, even in exile. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-47.htm" title="Yet will I bring again the captivity of Moab in the latter days, said the LORD. Thus far is the judgment of Moab.">Jeremiah 48:47</a> we have the hope of the prophet that the discipline will do its work. The “vessels” and “bottles” of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-12.htm" title="Therefore, behold, the days come, said the LORD, that I will send to him wanderers, that shall cause him to wander, and shall empty his vessels, and break their bottles.">Jeremiah 48:12</a> are, of course, the cities and villages of Moab.

It had now been in a state of peace and prosperity since the time of Shalmaneser, having experienced no particular calamity since the judgment foretold by Isaiah, and inflicted by that prince; so that there were forty years between that affliction and this here spoken of. The comparison between the state of the Moabites and that of wine is elegant, and is kept up with great propriety. All wines, it is said, ought to be kept for some time upon their lees, in order to preserve their strength and flavour; on which account <span class="ital">the lees </span>are expressed by a word that signifies <span class="ital">the preservers. </span>Wine is apt to be damaged by being drawn off too soon into other vessels. By this allegory, therefore, Moab is represented as having enjoyed singular advantages from having constantly remained in his own country ever since he became a people. And the prophet’s words imply, that the Moabites had increased in pride and insolence in proportion to the duration of their national tranquillity and prosperity. <span class="ital">Behold, saith the Lord, I will send unto him wanderers </span>— The Chaldean soldiers, that come out of a foreign country. These shall make a prey of him, and carry off as much of his wealth as they can, and spoil the rest. Blaney thinks the allegory begun in the preceding verse, is here continued and accordingly renders <span class="greekheb">וצעים</span>, <span class="ital">tilters, </span>observing, that the Chaldeans, who are here designed, “should lower the vessels of Moab, namely, the cities, and empty them; and also break to pieces their bottles or pitchers, that is, destroy the lesser towns and villages, dependant on the cities; to which the bottles, or pitchers, answer, being filled with the redundancy of the larger vessels.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/48.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>48:1-13. The Chaldeans are to destroy the Moabites. We should be thankful that we are required to seek the salvation of men's lives, and the salvation of their souls, not to shed their blood; but we shall be the more without excuse if we do this pleasant work deceitfully. The cities shall be laid in ruins, and the country shall be wasted. There will be great sorrow. There will be great hurry. If any could give wings to sinners, still they could not fly out of the reach of Divine indignation. There are many who persist in unrepented iniquity, yet long enjoy outward prosperity. They had been long corrupt and unreformed, secure and sensual in prosperity. They have no changes of their peace and prosperity, therefore their hearts and lives are unchanged, Ps 55:19.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/48.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Moab from the time it conquered the Emims <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-9.htm">Deuteronomy 2:9-10</a>, and so became a nation, had retained quiet possession of its land, and enjoyed comparative prosperity. From the Moabite Stone we gather that King Mesha, after the death of Ahab threw off the yoke of Israel; nor except for a short time under Jeroboam II was Israel able to bring the Moabites back into subjection. They gradually drove the Reubenites back, and recovered most of the territory taken from the Amorites by Moses, and which originally had belonged to them.<p>He hath settled on his lees - Good wine was thought to be the better for being left to stand upon its sediment <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/25-6.htm">Isaiah 25:6</a>, and in all cases its flavor was rendered thereby stronger (marginal reference). "By being emptied from vessel to vessel" it became vapid and tasteless. So a nation by going into captivity is rendered tame and feeble. By his taste is meant the flavor of the wine, and so Moab's national character. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/48.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11. settled on &#8230; lees&#8212;(See on [978]Isa 25:6; Zep 1:12).

Lived in great peace and prosperity from the time they became a kingdom; being very little disturbed with wars by their neighbours, or very rarely; so that they were in very prosperous and flourishing circumstances, which occasioned that pride and haughtiness they were notorious for. This is an emblem of unregenerate men; who, though sinners from their birth, and liable to the curse of the law, subject to the stroke of death, and must come to judgment; yet stupid and quite at ease, having no sight of sin, nor feeling of the burden of its guilt, nor grief or trouble for it; no sense of danger, or fear of hell; but in the utmost security: all which arise from ignorance, hardness of heart, profaneness, and infidelity; thoughtlessness about their immortal souls; putting the evil day far from them; and being under the influence of Satan, who keeps his goods in peace: <p>and he hath settled on his lees; a metaphor taken from wine; which, the longer it remains on the lees, the better body it has, and the richer and stronger it is; and denotes the great tranquillity of the Moabites; the riches they were possessed of, and in which they trusted. The Targum renders it, <p>"quiet in their substance;'' <p>herein they were an emblem of unconverted sinners, who are settled and hardened in the corruptions of their nature; and not at all disturbed at the evil of sin; the wrath of God; his judgments on men; the last and awful judgment; or at the terrors of hell; and likewise of such who trust in their own righteousness, and depend upon that for salvation: <p>and hath not been emptied from vessel to vessel; like wine that has never been racked off from the vessel or vessels it was first put into: they were never removed from place to place, but always continued in their land; in which they were an emblem of such who have never seen their own emptiness, and their want of the grace of God, and have never been emptied of sin, nor of self-righteousness: <p>neither hath he gone into captivity; this explains in proper words the metaphor in the preceding clause: the Moabites had never been carried captive out of their own land into others; an emblem of such who have never seen their captive state to sin and Satan; or ever brought to complain of it, or become the captives of Christ; <p>therefore his taste remained in him, and his scent is not changed; his wealth, riches, and prosperity, continued without any change and alteration; and also his sins and vices, idolatry, pride, luxury, and which were the cause of his ruin; and for that reason are here mentioned; an emblem of unregenerate men, whose taste is vitiated by sin, and continues as it was originally; they relish sin, and disrelish everything that is good; and savour the things that be of man, and not the things of God; and so are in a most dangerous condition. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/48.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Moab hath been at ease from his youth, and he hath settled on his lees, and hath not been <span class="cverse3">{i}</span> emptied from vessel to vessel, neither hath he gone into captivity: therefore his taste remained in him, and his scent is not changed.</span><p>(i) Has not been removed as the Jews have, but have lived at ease, and as a wine that feeds itself on his lees.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/48.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">11</span>. <span class="ital">Moab hath been at ease from his youth</span>] He hath not been driven from his land hitherto.

The "youth" of Moab dates from its subjugation of the aboriginal Emim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-10.htm">Deuteronomy 2:10</a>)' Since that event, though often at war, sometimes tributary and sometimes expelled from a part of the territory claimed by them (see the inscription on the Moabite Stone), yet they had  never been disturbed in their ancestral homes to the south of the river Amen. <span class="cmt_word">He hath settled on his less.</span> It was the custom to leave wine for a time on its lees or sediment, in order to heighten its strength and flavour (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/25-6.htm">Isaiah 25:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Emptied from vessel to vessel.</span> Thevenot, an old traveller in Persia, remarks of the Shiraz wine that, after it is separated from the lees, it is apt to grow sour. "The wine is put into large earthen jars, each holding from ten or twelve to fourteen <span class="accented">carabas</span>; but when a jar has been opened, it must be emptied as soon as possible, and the wine put into bottles or <span class="accented">carabas</span>, otherwise it spoils and becomes sour" ('Voyages,' 2:245, quoted by Lowth on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/25-6.htm">Isaiah 25:6</a>). In the application of the figure, the "taste" of Moab means obviously the national character. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/48.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-5.htm">Jeremiah 48:5</a> this idea is further elucidated. The inhabitants flee, weeping as they go, towards the south, before the conquering enemy advancing from the north, up the ascent of Luhith, and down the descent of Horonaim. The idea is taken from <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/15-5.htm">Isaiah 15:5</a>, but applied by Jeremiah in his own peculiar manner; &#1497;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492; &#1489;&#1468;&#1493; is changed into &#1497;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492; &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1497;, and the notion of weeping is thereby intensified. We take &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1497; as an adverbial accusative, but in fact it is to be rendered like the preceding &#1489;&#1468;&#1489;&#1499;&#1497;; and &#1497;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492; stands with an indefinite nominative: "one ascends  equals  they ascend," not "weeping rises over weeping," as Hitzig, Graf, and others take it. For, in the latter case, &#1489;&#1468;&#1489;&#1499;&#1497; could not be separated from &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1497;, nor stand first; cf. the instances adduced by Graf, &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1492; &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1492; and &#1506;&#1497;&#1503; &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1497;&#1503;. The form &#1495;&#1500;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514; for &#1495;&#1500;&#1468;&#1495;&#1497;&#1514; is either an error of transcription or an optional form, and there is no ground for taking the word as appellative, as Hitzig does, "the ascent of boards, i.e., as boards tower one above another, so does weeping rise," - an unnatural figure, and one devoid of all taste. The last words of the second member of the verse present some difficulty, chiefly on account of &#1510;&#1512;&#1497;, which the lxx have omitted, and which Ewald and Umbreit set down as spurious, although (as Graf rightly remarks) they do not thereby explain how it came into the text. To suppose, with the Rabbinical writers, that the construct state &#1510;&#1512;&#1497; stands for the absolute, is not only inadmissible, as being against the principles of grammar, but also contrary to the whole scope of the passage. The context shows that the clamour cannot proceed from the enemy, but only from the fugitive Moabites. Only two explanations are possible: either &#1510;&#1512;&#1497; must be taken in the sense of angustiae, and in connection with &#1510;&#1506;&#1511;&#1514;, "straits, distress of crying," a cry of distress, as De Wette does; or, "oppressors of the cry of distress," as Ngelsbach takes it. We prefer the former, in spite of the objection of Graf, that the expression "distress of crying," for "a cry of distress," would be a strange one: for this objection may be made against his own explanation, that &#1510;&#1512;&#1497; means the bursting open of the mouth in making a loud cry; and &#1510;&#1512;&#1497; &#1494;&#1506;&#1511;&#1492; is a loud outcry for help.</body></html>
