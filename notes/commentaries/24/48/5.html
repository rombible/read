Jerome (<span class= "ital">Onomast. s.v. Luith</span>) describes it as between Zoar and Areopolis (= Rabbath-Moab). The ascent was probably to a local sanctuary. A various reading, <span class= "ital">Laboth, </span>followed by the LXX., gives the meaning “the ascent of planks,” as though it were a wooden staircase. Alike in that and in the descent from Horonaim (possibly the fugitives who came down from the heights of the one city are represented as going up with wailing to the other) the enemies of Moab would hear the cry that proclaimed its downfall.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/48.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>48:1-13. The Chaldeans are to destroy the Moabites. We should be thankful that we are required to seek the salvation of men's lives, and the salvation of their souls, not to shed their blood; but we shall be the more without excuse if we do this pleasant work deceitfully. The cities shall be laid in ruins, and the country shall be wasted. There will be great sorrow. There will be great hurry. If any could give wings to sinners, still they could not fly out of the reach of Divine indignation. There are many who persist in unrepented iniquity, yet long enjoy outward prosperity. They had been long corrupt and unreformed, secure and sensual in prosperity. They have no changes of their peace and prosperity, therefore their hearts and lives are unchanged, Ps 55:19.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/48.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Luhith was situated upon an eminence, and Jeremiah describes one set of weeping fugitives as pressing close upon another.<p>In the going down of Horonaim ... - Rather, in the descent of Horonaim they have heard the distresses of the cry of breaking, i. e., the cry of distress occasioned by the ruin inflicted by the enemy.

Of this place See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/15-5.htm">Isaiah 15:5</a>; <p>for in the going down of Horonaim the enemies have heard a cry of destruction; a place before mentioned, which lay low, in the descent of which, the enemies, the Chaldeans, heard the cries of those that fled from Horonaim, and went up from thence to Luhith, which cry was as follows: <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/48.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For in the ascent of <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> Luhith continual weeping shall go up; for in the descent of Horonaim the enemies have heard a cry of destruction.</span><p>(d) Horonaim and Luhith were two places by which the Moabites would flee, Isa 15:5.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/48.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">5</span>. See preceding note.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/48.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For in the going up of Luhith,</span> etc. The verse is substantially taken from Isaiah (Isaiah 15:5), but with variations peculiar to this chapter. The most peculiar of these is that in the first verse half, which is literally, <span class="accented">weeping goeth up</span> (not, <span class="accented">shall go up</span>)  <span class="accented">with weeping</span>, which is explained by Dr. Payne Smith to mean "one set of weeping fugitives pressing close upon another." To the present commentator (as also to Delitzsch - see his note on Isaiah 15:5) there seems no reasonable doubt that <span class="accented">b'ki</span>, the word rendered "weeping," should rather be <span class="accented">bo</span>, "upon it," so that the passage will run, as in Isaiah, "for the going up of Luhith with weeping doth one go up if," Hitzig (whom for once we find agreeing with Delitzsch) remarks that the miswriting <span class="accented">b'ki</span> for <span class="accented">bo</span> may be easily accounted for by the fact that <span class="accented">ki</span>, "for," is the word which follows next. We have no right to ascribe to Jeremiah such an artificial and un-Hebraic an expression as that of the received text. Small as the matter may be in itself, it is not unimportant as suggesting to the <span class="accented">Old</span> Testament student a caution against the too unreserved adoption of the canon <span class="accented">Lectioni faciliori praestat ardua</span>. <span class="cmt_word">In the going down of Horonaim.</span> An interesting variation from Isaiah. The older poet, less attentive to minutiae, had said vaguely, "in the road to Horonaim;" by a slight change of expression, the younger and more reflective writer produces a striking antithesis between the ascent to the hill-town, and the descent to the hollow in which Horonaim ("double cavern") appears to have been situated. It is possible, however, that Jeremiah has preserved the original reading, and that "the road" in Isaiah, <span class="accented">l.c.</span>, is due to the carelessness of a scribe. <span class="cmt_word">The enemies have heard a cry of destruction.</span> But why this reference to the enemies? The rendering, however, is ungrammatical. The text is, literally, <span class="accented">the enemies of the cry of destruction have they heard.</span> The prophecy in Isaiah omits "the enemies of," and has a different verb for "have they heard." Can the inserted words be an intrusion from the margin? The later scribes were accustomed to insert glosses in the margin on occasions where we should have thought them entirely unnecessary for the purpose of explanation. But then why "the enemies of"? It is an insoluble enigma. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/47.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The prophet sees, in the spirit, the threatened desolation as already come upon Philistia, and portrays it in its effects upon the people and the country. "Baldness (a sign of the deepest and most painful sorrow) has come upon Gaza;" cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-16.htm">Micah 1:16</a>. &#1504;&#1491;&#1502;&#1514;&#1492; is rendered by the Vulgate conticuit. After this Graf and Ngelsbach take the meaning of being "speechless through pain and sorrow;" cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-10.htm">Lamentations 2:10</a>. Others translate "to be destroyed." Both renderings are lexically permissible, for &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492; and &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1501; have both meanings. In support of the first, the parallelism of the members has been adduced; but this is not decisive, for figurative and literal representations are often interchanged. On the whole, it is impossible to reach any definite conclusion; for both renderings give suitable ideas, and these not fundamentally different in reality the one from the other. &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; &#1506;&#1502;&#1511;&#1501;, "the rest of their valley" (the suffix referring to Gaza and Ashkelon), is the low country round about Gaza and Ashkelon, which are specially mentioned from their being the two chief fortresses of Philistia. &#1506;&#1502;&#1511; is suitably applied to the low-lying belt of the country, elsewhere called &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1500;&#1492;, "the low country," as distinguished from the hill-country; for &#1506;&#1502;&#1511; does not always denote a deep valley, but is also sometimes used, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/17-16.htm">Joshua 17:16</a>, etc., of the plain of Jezreel, and of other plains which are far from being deeply-sunk valleys. Thus there is no valid reason for following the arbitrary translation of the lxx, &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;  &#787;&#x395;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bc;, and changing &#1506;&#1502;&#1511;&#1501; into &#1506;&#1504;&#1511;&#1497;&#1501;, as Hitzig and Graf do; more especially is it utterly improbable that in the Chaldean period Anakim were still to be found in Philistia. The mention of them, moreover, is out of place here; and still less can we follow Graf in his belief that the inhabitants of Gath are the "rest of the Anakim." In the last clause of <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/47-5.htm">Jeremiah 47:5</a>, Philistia is set forth as a woman, who tears her body (with her nails) in despair, makes incisions on her body; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-6.htm">Jeremiah 16:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/41-5.htm">Jeremiah 41:5</a>. The question, "How long dost thou tear thyself?" forms a transition to the plaintive request, "Gather thyself," i.e., draw thyself back into thy scabbard. But the seer replies, "How can it rest? for Jahveh hath given it a commission against Ashkelon and the Philistine sea-coast." For &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1496;&#1497;, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/47-7.htm">Jeremiah 47:7</a>, we must read the 3rd pers. fem. &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1496;, as the following &#1500;&#1492;&#1468; shows. The form probably got into the text from an oversight, through looking at &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1496;&#1497; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/47-6.htm">Jeremiah 47:6</a>. &#1495;&#1493;&#1507;, "the sea-coast," a designation of Philistia, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-16.htm">Ezekiel 25:16</a>.<p>The prophecy concludes without a glance at the Messianic future. The threatened destruction of the Philistines has actually begun with the conquest of Philistia by Nebuchadnezzar, but has not yet culminated in the extermination of the people. The extermination and complete extirpation are thus not merely repeated by Ezek; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-15.htm">Ezekiel 25:15</a>., but after the exile the threats are once more repeated against the Philistines by Zechariah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/9-5.htm">Zechariah 9:5</a>): they only reached their complete fulfilment when, as Zechariah announces, in the addition made to <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-30.htm">Isaiah 14:30</a>., their idolatry also was removed from them, and their incorporation into the Church of God was accomplished through judgment. Cf. the remarks on <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-10.htm">Zephaniah 2:10</a>. </body></html>
