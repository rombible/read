The panic-cry of the one city was echoed in the other; it reached even to Jahaz (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-21.htm" title="And judgment is come on the plain country; on Holon, and on Jahazah, and on Mephaath,">Jeremiah 48:21</a>), to the south-west of Heshbon.<p><span class= "bld">From Zoar even unto Horonaim . . .</span>—Both names represent the south district of Moab.

Nothing is known, however, of any town so constituted, and the epithet of the “third-year heifer,” <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> a heifer not brought under the yoke, would be a suitable name enough for either Zoar or Horonaim, as a virgin fortress, as yet untaken by the foe. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-16.htm" title="For Israel slides back as a backsliding heifer: now the LORD will feed them as a lamb in a large place.">Hosea 4:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/10-11.htm" title="And Ephraim is as an heifer that is taught, and loves to tread out the corn; but I passed over on her fair neck: I will make Ephraim to ride; Judah shall plow, and Jacob shall break his clods.">Hosea 10:11</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">The waters also of Nimrim shall be desolate.</span>—Recent travellers, Seetzen and De Saulcy, have found a brook Nimrah, with a mass of ruins near it, near the southern extremity of the Dead Sea.

The destruction of Moab is further prophesied, to awaken them by national repentance and reformation to prevent the trouble, or by a personal repentance and reformation to prepare for it. In reading this long roll of threatenings, and mediating on the terror, it will be of more use to us to keep in view the power of God's anger and the terror of his judgments, and to have our hearts possessed with a holy awe of God and of his wrath, than to search into all the figures and expressions here used. Yet it is not perpetual destruction. The chapter ends with a promise of their return out of captivity in the latter days. Even with Moabites God will not contend for ever, nor be always wroth.

Two cities in the land of Moab; of which see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/15-4.htm">Isaiah 15:4</a>. Heshbon being destroyed, a cry was made by the inhabitants of it, which either reached from thence to Elealeh; or the destruction being carried on to that city, the cry was continued there: <p>and even unto Jahaz, have they uttered their voice; another city of Moab; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/15-4.htm">Isaiah 15:4</a>; which also was laid waste, and where the Moabites uttered their voice of lamentation on account of it: <p>from Zoar even unto Horonaim, as an heifer of three years old: that is, as the destruction should go on to Zoar, and so to Horonaim; of which places see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/15-5.htm">Isaiah 15:5</a>; so the cry of the distressed, and of those that flee, should also go from place to place; and be as loud, and as strong, and heard as far, as the lowing of a heifer of three years old. Naturalists (l) observe, that the voice in all female creatures is smaller and shriller, excepting the ox; for the voices of the females of that creature is stronger than in the males; and also that the taming of these creatures is when they are three years old, that is the proper time; before it is too soon, and afterwards too late (m); and then it is their voice is fuller, and their strength firmer, to which the allusion here is; See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/15-5.htm">Isaiah 15:5</a>; <p>for the waters also of Nimrim shall be desolate; being disturbed by the Chaldean army, their horses treading them with their feet, and so fouling them; or being mixed with the blood of the slain, and so unfit to drink. A sad case this, to have neither wine nor water; See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/15-6.htm">Isaiah 15:6</a>; to which may be added, that Jerom also makes mention of a village in his time called Benamerium, to the north of Zoar; and seems rather the place intended. <p>(l) Aristotel.

The first words need emendation; “How criest thou, O H. and El.” (Gi.), or “Crying are H. and El.” (Du.). Elealeh according to Conder (HBD.) was about a mile N. of Heshbon.

The cry of one town echoes to another, and is taken up afresh by its terrified inhabitants. Heshbon and Elealeh lay on eminences but a short distance apart, so that the shrill cry of lamentation would be heard far away in the southeast at Jahaz. Zoar and Horonaim both lay in the southern half of Moah (see on vers. 3, 4). <span class="cmt_word">An heifer of three years old.</span> If this is the right rendering, the phrase is descriptive of Horonaim, which may, in the time of Jeremiah, have been a "virgin fortress." But the phrase, thus understood, comes in very oddly, and in the parallel passage in Isaiah it stands, not after Horonaim, but after Zoar; it hardly seems likely that there were two Gibraltars in Moab. Another rendering (Ewald, Keil) is, "(to) the third Eglath." This involves an allusion to the fact that there were other places in Moab called Egiath or Eglah, which has been rendered highly probable by Gesenius. <span class="cmt_word">The waters also of Nimrhn.</span> Canon Tristram speaks of the "plenteous brooks gushing from the lofty hills into the Ghor-en-Numeira." Consul Wetzstein, however, says that nature appears there under so unspeakably gloomy an aspect, that the identification is impossible. He proposes a site in the Wady So'eb, about fourteen miles east of the Jordan, which with its luxuriant meadows, covered with the flocks of the Bedouin, is probably suitable to the passages in Isaiah and Jeremiah (Excursus it. in Delitzsch's 'Jesaja,' 4th edit., pp. 572, 573). So also Seetzen, who remarks that the lower part of this wady is still called Nahr Nimrin. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-27.htm">Joshua 13:27</a> a place called Beth - nimrah is mentioned as situated in the valley (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the Jordan valley); no doubt this was in the wady referred to by the prophets. "The valley" seems to have been sometimes used in a wider signification, so as to include lateral valleys like that of Nimrim. The antiquity of the name is shown by its occurrence in the Annals of Thothmos III., who penetrated into the heart of Palestine, and, in the temple of Karnak, enumerates the cities which he conquered. From before  <span class="date">B.C. 1600</span> to nearly A.D.  this secluded valley has borne precisely the same name! <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/48.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>A transition is now made from figurative to literal language, and Moab is summoned to leave the cities and take refuge in inaccessible rocks, because he will not be able to offer resistance to the enemy; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-6.htm">Jeremiah 48:6</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-9.htm">Jeremiah 48:9</a>. "Like a dove that builds its nest over deep crevices." The reference is to wild pigeons, which occur in large numbers in Palestine, and make their nests in the clefts of high rocks (Sol 2:14) even at the present day, e.g., in the wilderness of Engedi; cf. Robinson's Palestine, ii. 203. &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497; , lit., "on the other side of the mouth of the deep pit," or of the abyss, i.e., over the yawning hollows. &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497; is a poetic form for &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1489;&#1512;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-20.htm">Isaiah 7:20</a>. The humiliation of Moab finds its justification in what is brought out in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-29.htm">Jeremiah 48:29</a>., his boundless pride and hatred against Israel. </body></html>
