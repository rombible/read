The Chaldeans are to destroy the Moabites. We should be thankful that we are required to seek the salvation of men's lives, and the salvation of their souls, not to shed their blood; but we shall be the more without excuse if we do this pleasant work deceitfully. The cities shall be laid in ruins, and the country shall be wasted. There will be great sorrow. There will be great hurry. If any could give wings to sinners, still they could not fly out of the reach of Divine indignation. There are many who persist in unrepented iniquity, yet long enjoy outward prosperity. They had been long corrupt and unreformed, secure and sensual in prosperity. They have no changes of their peace and prosperity, therefore their hearts and lives are unchanged, Ps 55:19.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/48.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Israel was ashamed of Beth-el - After Salmaneser had carried Israel away, they could trust no longer in the calf of Bethel established by Jeroboam. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/48.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13. ashamed&#8212;have the shame of disappointment as to the hopes they entertained of aid from Chemosh, their idol.<p>Beth-el&#8212;(1Ki 12:27, 29)&#8212;that is, the golden calf set up there by Jeroboam.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/48.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> It is a natural and a penal shame which is here spoken of; we are naturally ashamed when we have reposed a great confidence in, and made great boasts of, a thing which, when it comes to be tried, proveth of no use, but mischievous to us. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Chemosh</span> was their great idol, in which the Moabites had great confidence, and of which they boasted; the prophet tells them they should be ashamed of this idol, or for this idol; as the Israelites, that is, the ten tribes, were ashamed of or for the golden calves, which Jeroboam set up at Dan and Beth-el, which were the cause of ruin to those tribes.

The lxx, Vulgate, and Syriac render &#1502;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1498; by fortresses, hence Ewald would read &#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;&#1498; instead; but there is no ground for the change, since the peculiar rendering alluded to has evidently originated from &#1502;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; having been confounded with &#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1494;. Others, as Dahler, refer the word to idols; but these are always designated as &#1502;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497; &#1497;&#1491;. Graf translates "property," and points to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-2.htm">1 Samuel 25:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-16.htm">Exodus 23:16</a>; but this meaning also has really nothing to support it, for &#1502;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; in these passages denotes only agriculture and its produce, and the combination of the word with &#1488;&#1493;&#1510;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514; in this passage does not require such a rendering. We abide by the common meaning of "doings" or "works," not evil deeds specially (Hitzig), but "all that Moab undertakes." Neither their efforts to maintain and increase their power, nor their wealth, will avail them in any way. They shall be overcome. Moab is addressed as a country or kingdom. &#1500;&#1499;&#1491;, to seize, capture; of a land, to take, conquer. Chemosh, with his priests and princes, shall go into exile. &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; is perhaps a mere error of the copyist for &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;, Chemosh, the chief deity of the Moabites and Ammonites, worshipped as a king and the war-god of his people: see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-29.htm">Numbers 21:29</a>. As in the last-named passage the Moabites are called the people of Chemosh, so here, not merely the priests, but also the princes of Moab, are called his priests and his princes. The Kethib &#1497;&#1495;&#1491; is not to be changed, although Jeremiah elsewhere always uses &#1497;&#1495;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;, which is substituted in the Qeri; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-3.htm">Jeremiah 49:3</a>. In confirmation of this, it is added, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-8.htm">Jeremiah 48:8</a>, that all the cities of Moab, without exception, shall be laid waste, and the whole country, valley and plain, shall be brought to ruin. &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1512;, "the level," is the table-land stretching from the Arnon to Heshbon, and north-eastwards as far as Rabbath-Ammon, and which originally belonged to the Moabites, hence called "the fields of Moab" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-40.htm">Numbers 21:40</a>; but it was taken from them by the Amorites, and after the conquest of the latter was taken possession of by the Israelites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-10.htm">Deuteronomy 3:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-43.htm">Deuteronomy 4:43</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-9.htm">Joshua 13:9</a>), but at that time had been taken back once more by the Moabites. &#1492;&#1506;&#1502;&#1511; is the valley of the Jordan, commonly called &#1492;&#1506;&#1512;&#1489;&#1492;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-27.htm">Joshua 13:27</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-19.htm">Joshua 13:19</a>; here it is that portion of the valley towards the west which bounds the table-land. &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; can only be taken in a causal signification, "because," as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-13.htm">Jeremiah 16:13</a>, or in a relative meaning, quod, or "as." </body></html>
