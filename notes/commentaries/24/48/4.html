The Chaldeans are to destroy the Moabites. We should be thankful that we are required to seek the salvation of men's lives, and the salvation of their souls, not to shed their blood; but we shall be the more without excuse if we do this pleasant work deceitfully. The cities shall be laid in ruins, and the country shall be wasted. There will be great sorrow. There will be great hurry. If any could give wings to sinners, still they could not fly out of the reach of Divine indignation. There are many who persist in unrepented iniquity, yet long enjoy outward prosperity. They had been long corrupt and unreformed, secure and sensual in prosperity. They have no changes of their peace and prosperity, therefore their hearts and lives are unchanged, Ps 55:19.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/48.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Moab - Probably the city elsewhere called Ar-Moab.

Either the whole nation in general; so the Targum, <p>"the kingdom of Moab is broken;'' <p>and so Abarbinel; or a city so called, which some take to be the city Areopolis. Jerom (g) says, that Moab is a city of Arabia, now called Areopolis; and which also has the name of Rabbathmoab, or "grand Moab"; <p>her little ones have caused a cry to be heard; seeing their parents killed, and they left desolate, and in the hands of the enemy; and not only so, but just going to be dashed in pieces by them. The Targum interprets it, her governors; and so Jarchi, who thinks they are so called, because they are lesser than kings. Kimchi and Ben Melech suggest, that these are called so by way of contempt. The word "tzeir" signifies both "little" and "great", as the learned Pocock (h) has abundantly proved. <p>(g) De locis Heb. fol. 87. H. &amp; 93. B. (h) Not. Miscell. in Port.

We should expect Ar-Moab. <span class="cmt_word">Her little ones</span>. The received text, as it stands, is untranslatable, and our choice lies between the correction suggested by the vowel points, and the reading of the Septuagint and a few of the extant Hebrew manuscripts, "unto Zoar." In favour of the latter, which is adopted by Ewald and Graf, it may he urged that Zoar and Horenaim are mentioned together, not only in ver. 34, but also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/15-5.htm">Isaiah 15:5</a>, which has evidently been imitated in the following verse. It is not quite clear what "her little ones" in the first mentioned correction mean. Some think, the children; others, the poor; Hitzig prefers the small towns of Moab. On the site of "Zoar," see Smith's 'Dictionary of the Bible,' but compare Canon Tristram in 'The Land of Moab.' <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/47.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The prophet sees, in the spirit, the threatened desolation as already come upon Philistia, and portrays it in its effects upon the people and the country. "Baldness (a sign of the deepest and most painful sorrow) has come upon Gaza;" cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-16.htm">Micah 1:16</a>. &#1504;&#1491;&#1502;&#1514;&#1492; is rendered by the Vulgate conticuit. After this Graf and Ngelsbach take the meaning of being "speechless through pain and sorrow;" cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-10.htm">Lamentations 2:10</a>. Others translate "to be destroyed." Both renderings are lexically permissible, for &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492; and &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1501; have both meanings. In support of the first, the parallelism of the members has been adduced; but this is not decisive, for figurative and literal representations are often interchanged. On the whole, it is impossible to reach any definite conclusion; for both renderings give suitable ideas, and these not fundamentally different in reality the one from the other. &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; &#1506;&#1502;&#1511;&#1501;, "the rest of their valley" (the suffix referring to Gaza and Ashkelon), is the low country round about Gaza and Ashkelon, which are specially mentioned from their being the two chief fortresses of Philistia. &#1506;&#1502;&#1511; is suitably applied to the low-lying belt of the country, elsewhere called &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1500;&#1492;, "the low country," as distinguished from the hill-country; for &#1506;&#1502;&#1511; does not always denote a deep valley, but is also sometimes used, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/17-16.htm">Joshua 17:16</a>, etc., of the plain of Jezreel, and of other plains which are far from being deeply-sunk valleys. Thus there is no valid reason for following the arbitrary translation of the lxx, &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;  &#787;&#x395;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bc;, and changing &#1506;&#1502;&#1511;&#1501; into &#1506;&#1504;&#1511;&#1497;&#1501;, as Hitzig and Graf do; more especially is it utterly improbable that in the Chaldean period Anakim were still to be found in Philistia. The mention of them, moreover, is out of place here; and still less can we follow Graf in his belief that the inhabitants of Gath are the "rest of the Anakim." In the last clause of <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/47-5.htm">Jeremiah 47:5</a>, Philistia is set forth as a woman, who tears her body (with her nails) in despair, makes incisions on her body; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-6.htm">Jeremiah 16:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/41-5.htm">Jeremiah 41:5</a>. The question, "How long dost thou tear thyself?" forms a transition to the plaintive request, "Gather thyself," i.e., draw thyself back into thy scabbard. But the seer replies, "How can it rest? for Jahveh hath given it a commission against Ashkelon and the Philistine sea-coast." For &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1496;&#1497;, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/47-7.htm">Jeremiah 47:7</a>, we must read the 3rd pers. fem. &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1496;, as the following &#1500;&#1492;&#1468; shows. The form probably got into the text from an oversight, through looking at &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1496;&#1497; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/47-6.htm">Jeremiah 47:6</a>. &#1495;&#1493;&#1507;, "the sea-coast," a designation of Philistia, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-16.htm">Ezekiel 25:16</a>.<p>The prophecy concludes without a glance at the Messianic future. The threatened destruction of the Philistines has actually begun with the conquest of Philistia by Nebuchadnezzar, but has not yet culminated in the extermination of the people. The extermination and complete extirpation are thus not merely repeated by Ezek; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-15.htm">Ezekiel 25:15</a>., but after the exile the threats are once more repeated against the Philistines by Zechariah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/9-5.htm">Zechariah 9:5</a>): they only reached their complete fulfilment when, as Zechariah announces, in the addition made to <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-30.htm">Isaiah 14:30</a>., their idolatry also was removed from them, and their incorporation into the Church of God was accomplished through judgment. Cf. the remarks on <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-10.htm">Zephaniah 2:10</a>. </body></html>
