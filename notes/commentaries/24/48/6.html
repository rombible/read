The LXX., which adopts the meaning in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-6.htm" title="For he shall be like the heath in the desert, and shall not see when good comes; but shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness, in a salt land and not inhabited.">Jeremiah 17:6</a>, here strangely enough gives “as a wild ass in the wilderness.” <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/11-1.htm" title="In the LORD put I my trust: how say you to my soul, Flee as a bird to your mountain?">Psalm 11:1</a> gives us an example of a like comparison. Here probably there is, as before, a paronomasia on the name of the Moabite city Aroer, which closely resembles the Hebrew word for “heath.” In thus finding an ominous significance in the names of cities, Jeremiah follows in the wake of Micah 1.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/48.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>48:1-13. The Chaldeans are to destroy the Moabites. We should be thankful that we are required to seek the salvation of men's lives, and the salvation of their souls, not to shed their blood; but we shall be the more without excuse if we do this pleasant work deceitfully. The cities shall be laid in ruins, and the country shall be wasted. There will be great sorrow. There will be great hurry. If any could give wings to sinners, still they could not fly out of the reach of Divine indignation. There are many who persist in unrepented iniquity, yet long enjoy outward prosperity. They had been long corrupt and unreformed, secure and sensual in prosperity. They have no changes of their peace and prosperity, therefore their hearts and lives are unchanged, Ps 55:19.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/48.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Like the heath - Or, Like a destitute man.

They exhort one another to flee.<p>heath&#8212;or the juniper (see on [977]Jer 17:6). Maurer translates, "Be like one naked in the wilderness." But the sense is, Live in the wilderness like the heath, or juniper; do not "trust in" walls (Jer 48:7) [Grotius]. (Compare Mt 24:16-18).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/48.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> It is of no great moment whether we understand these as the words of the Moabites, calling one to another to flee, and save their lives, though they lost all they had, and left themselves as bare as a naked tree; or as the words of the prophets speaking to the Moabites to the same sense. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/48.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Flee, save your lives,.... These are either the words of the Moabites, their cry of destruction mentioned in the latter part of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-5.htm">Jeremiah 48:5</a>; who, seeing nothing but ruin before their eyes, advise one another to flee in all haste, and save their lives if possible, since nothing else could be saved: or else they are the words of the prophet, giving counsel to the Moabites to betake themselves to flight for the safety of their lives, these being in great danger; so Abarbinel; with whom others agree, only think they are spoken ironically; suggesting, that when they had endeavoured by flight to save their lives, it would be to no purpose; they should not escape the hands of their enemies; which seems to be the truest sense: <p>and be like the heath in the wilderness; which is called "erice", or "ling", which grows in waste places. Kimchi and Menachem in Jarchi interpret it of a tree that grows in dry and desert places; a low, naked, barren, fruitless shrub; signifying, that, when they were fled from their habitations, they should be as solitary and stripped of all their good things as such a bare and naked shrub in a desert. Kimchi's note is, that when they had left their cities and fled, their cities would be as the heath in the wilderness. The Targum is, <p>"and be ye as the tower of Aroer, "as they" who dwell in tents in the wilderness.'' <p>Jarchi observes that the tower of Aroer was built in the wilderness, and there was no inhabitant round it but those that dwelt in tents; and, the tower standing where there was no inhabitant, it looked like a waste. The Septuagint version is very foreign, "as a wild ass in the wilderness"; which is followed by the Arabic version. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/48.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Flee, save your lives, and be like the <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> bush in the wilderness.</span><p>(e) Hide yourselves in barren places, where the enemy will not pursue after you, Jer 17:6.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/48.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">6</span>. <span class="ital">the heath</span>] See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-6.htm" title="For he shall be like the heath in the desert, and shall not see when good comes; but shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness, in a salt land and not inhabited.">Jeremiah 17:6</a>. The LXX read somewhat differently from MT., rendering <span class="ital">wild ass</span> (as shy and difficult to capture). This is probably right. Cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-5.htm" title="Who has sent out the wild ass free? or who has loosed the bands of the wild ass?">Job 39:5</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/48.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Flee, save your lives;</span> literally, <span class="accented">your souls</span>. The prophet's human feeling prompts him to this counsel; but he knows full well that a life of abject misery is the utmost that can be hoped for. <span class="cmt_word">And be like the heath in the wilderness;</span> literally, <span class="accented">and</span> (<span class="accented">your souls</span>) <span class="accented">shall be like destitute ones in the wilderness</span>. Imagine the case of one who has been robbed of everything, and left alone in the desert; not less miserable is that of the Moabite fugitives. The word rendered "the heath" (<span class="accented">aro'er</span>) <span class="accented">is</span> either miswritten for <span class="accented">ar'ar</span>, which occurs in the sense of "destitute" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-6.htm">Jeremiah 17:6</a> (see note), or also a rare plural form of the same word. The sense remains the same. It is tempting to see an allusion to one of the towns called Aroer (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/17-2.htm">Isaiah 17:2</a>). But the only Aroer the prophet could be thinking of is that on the Amen (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-36.htm">Deuteronomy 2:36</a>), which could not be described as "in the wilderness." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/47.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The prophet sees, in the spirit, the threatened desolation as already come upon Philistia, and portrays it in its effects upon the people and the country. "Baldness (a sign of the deepest and most painful sorrow) has come upon Gaza;" cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-16.htm">Micah 1:16</a>. &#1504;&#1491;&#1502;&#1514;&#1492; is rendered by the Vulgate conticuit. After this Graf and Ngelsbach take the meaning of being "speechless through pain and sorrow;" cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-10.htm">Lamentations 2:10</a>. Others translate "to be destroyed." Both renderings are lexically permissible, for &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492; and &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1501; have both meanings. In support of the first, the parallelism of the members has been adduced; but this is not decisive, for figurative and literal representations are often interchanged. On the whole, it is impossible to reach any definite conclusion; for both renderings give suitable ideas, and these not fundamentally different in reality the one from the other. &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; &#1506;&#1502;&#1511;&#1501;, "the rest of their valley" (the suffix referring to Gaza and Ashkelon), is the low country round about Gaza and Ashkelon, which are specially mentioned from their being the two chief fortresses of Philistia. &#1506;&#1502;&#1511; is suitably applied to the low-lying belt of the country, elsewhere called &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1500;&#1492;, "the low country," as distinguished from the hill-country; for &#1506;&#1502;&#1511; does not always denote a deep valley, but is also sometimes used, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/17-16.htm">Joshua 17:16</a>, etc., of the plain of Jezreel, and of other plains which are far from being deeply-sunk valleys. Thus there is no valid reason for following the arbitrary translation of the lxx, &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;  &#787;&#x395;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bc;, and changing &#1506;&#1502;&#1511;&#1501; into &#1506;&#1504;&#1511;&#1497;&#1501;, as Hitzig and Graf do; more especially is it utterly improbable that in the Chaldean period Anakim were still to be found in Philistia. The mention of them, moreover, is out of place here; and still less can we follow Graf in his belief that the inhabitants of Gath are the "rest of the Anakim." In the last clause of <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/47-5.htm">Jeremiah 47:5</a>, Philistia is set forth as a woman, who tears her body (with her nails) in despair, makes incisions on her body; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-6.htm">Jeremiah 16:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/41-5.htm">Jeremiah 41:5</a>. The question, "How long dost thou tear thyself?" forms a transition to the plaintive request, "Gather thyself," i.e., draw thyself back into thy scabbard. But the seer replies, "How can it rest? for Jahveh hath given it a commission against Ashkelon and the Philistine sea-coast." For &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1496;&#1497;, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/47-7.htm">Jeremiah 47:7</a>, we must read the 3rd pers. fem. &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1496;, as the following &#1500;&#1492;&#1468; shows. The form probably got into the text from an oversight, through looking at &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1496;&#1497; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/47-6.htm">Jeremiah 47:6</a>. &#1495;&#1493;&#1507;, "the sea-coast," a designation of Philistia, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-16.htm">Ezekiel 25:16</a>.<p>The prophecy concludes without a glance at the Messianic future. The threatened destruction of the Philistines has actually begun with the conquest of Philistia by Nebuchadnezzar, but has not yet culminated in the extermination of the people. The extermination and complete extirpation are thus not merely repeated by Ezek; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-15.htm">Ezekiel 25:15</a>., but after the exile the threats are once more repeated against the Philistines by Zechariah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/9-5.htm">Zechariah 9:5</a>): they only reached their complete fulfilment when, as Zechariah announces, in the addition made to <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-30.htm">Isaiah 14:30</a>., their idolatry also was removed from them, and their incorporation into the Church of God was accomplished through judgment. Cf. the remarks on <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-10.htm">Zephaniah 2:10</a>. </body></html>
