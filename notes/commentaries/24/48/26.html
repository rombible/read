The destruction of Moab is further prophesied, to awaken them by national repentance and reformation to prevent the trouble, or by a personal repentance and reformation to prepare for it. In reading this long roll of threatenings, and mediating on the terror, it will be of more use to us to keep in view the power of God's anger and the terror of his judgments, and to have our hearts possessed with a holy awe of God and of his wrath, than to search into all the figures and expressions here used. Yet it is not perpetual destruction. The chapter ends with a promise of their return out of captivity in the latter days. Even with Moabites God will not contend for ever, nor be always wroth. The Jews refer it to the days of the Messiah; then the captives of the Gentiles, under the yoke of sin and Satan, shall be brought back by Divine grace, which shall make them free indeed.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/48.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Make ye him drunken - With the wine-cup of God's fury, until terror deprive him of his senses. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/48.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>26. drunken&#8212;(see on [980]Jer 13:12; Jer 25:17).

Not with wine, but with the cup of divine wrath; with the vengeance of God; with sore judgments, afflictions, and calamities; give him his fill of them, till he is quite intoxicated with them, and has lost his senses, and is brought to madness and distraction, and reels, and staggers, and falls to the ground, like a drunken man; and his state and kingdom is quite ruined: this is said to the enemies of Moab, the king of Babylon and his army: <p>for he magnified himself against the Lord; made himself as great as he; yea, set himself above him; thought himself out of his reach; spoke proudly, haughtily, and contemptibly of him, and blasphemously against him, as if he could not deliver his people, or destroy his and their enemies.

Some render it, "he shall clap the hand at Moab in his vomit" (b); men shall laugh at him as he lies wallowing in it, or rejoice at his fall and ruin; but this is expressed in the next clause: <p>and he also shall be in derision; as drunken men are; he shall be derided by others, as others have been derided by him; now it will be his turn. <p>(a)   "plaudat", Junius &amp; Tremellius, Cocceius; "plaudet", Piscator; "complodat", Munster, Tigurine version, Schmidt; "allidet", Lyranus.

At an earlier point the prophet said that it was the callousness produced by long prosperity (ver. 11); but here another sin is mentioned - Moab's haughty contempt of Jehovah. "For this it deserves that its contempt should be thrown back upon itself, by its being made, like a drunken man, the scorn of all" (Ewald). The figure is, no doubt, a coarse one, but not unnatural in the oratory (we must put aside inspiration, which leaves the forms of speech untouched) of a rude people like the Jews. It occurs not unfrequently elsewhere; see especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-14.htm">Isaiah 19:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-15.htm">Habakkuk 2:15, 16</a>; and, for milder examples of the figure, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-13.htm">Jeremiah 13:13</a> and 25. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Make ye him drunken.</span> The command is issued to the agents of the Divine wrath (comp. vers. 10, 21). <span class="cmt_word">He magnified himself against the Lord.</span> Offences against Israel being also offences against Israel's God (see Jephthah's striking words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-23.htm">Judges 11:23, 24</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Shall wallow;</span> rather, <span class="accented">shall fall heavily</span> (literally, <span class="accented">shall clap</span> - a pregnant expression). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/48.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-18.htm">Jeremiah 48:18-25</a> is further described the downfall of this strong and glorious power. The inhabitants if Dibon are to come down from their glory and sit in misery; those of Aroer are to ask the fugitives what has happened, that they may learn that the whole table-land on to the Arnon has been taken by the enemy; and they are to howl over the calamity. The idea presented in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-18.htm">Jeremiah 48:18</a> is an imitation of that in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/47-1.htm">Isaiah 47:1</a>, "Come down, O daughter of Babylon, sit in the dust;" but &#1512;&#1491;&#1497; is intensified by the addition of &#1502;&#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1491;, and &#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1497; &#1506;&#1500; is changed into  &#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1497; &#1489;&#1510;&#1468;&#1502;&#1488; (the Kethib &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1497; has evidently been written by mistake for &#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1497;, the Qeri). &#1510;&#1502;&#1488; elsewhere means "thirst;" but "sit down in the thirst" would be too strange an expression; hence &#1510;&#1502;&#1488; must here have the meaning of  &#1510;&#1502;&#1488;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-3.htm">Isaiah 44:3</a>, "the thirsty arid land:" thus it remains a question whether we should point the word &#1510;&#1502;&#1488;, or take &#1510;&#1502;&#1488; as another form of &#1510;&#1502;&#1488;, as &#1495;&#1500;&#1489; sa ,&#1510;&#1502;&#1488; fo mro is of &#1495;&#1500;&#1489;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-19.htm">Ezekiel 23:19</a>. There is no sufficient reason why Hitzig and Ewald should give the word a meaning foreign to it, from the Arabic or Syriac. Dibon lay about four miles north from the Arnon, at the foot of a mountain, in a very beautiful plain, where, under the name of Dibn, many traces of walls, and a well by the wayside, hewn out of the rock, are still to be found (Seetzen, i. S. 409f.). Hence it must have been well provided with water, even though we should be obliged to understand by "the water of Dimon" (Dibon), which Isaiah mentions (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/15-9.htm">Isaiah 15:9</a>), the river Arnon, which is about three miles off. The command to "sit down in an arid land" thus forms a suitable figure, representing the humiliation and devastation of Dibon. That the city was fortified, is evident from the mention of the fortifications in the last clause. &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1514; , as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-19.htm">Jeremiah 46:19</a>. Aroer was situated on the north bank of the Arnon (Mojeb), where its ruins still remain, under the old name Ar&#1490;'ir (Burckhardt, p. 372). It was a frontier town, between the kingdom of Sihon (afterwards the territory of the Israelites) and the possession of the Moabites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-36.htm">Deuteronomy 2:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-12.htm">Deuteronomy 3:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-48.htm">Deuteronomy 4:48</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/12-2.htm">Joshua 12:2</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/13-9.htm">Joshua 13:9</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-16.htm">Joshua 13:16</a>). But after the Moabites had regained the northern portion of their original territory, it lay in the midst of the land. The fugitives here represented as passing by are endeavouring, by crossing the Arnon, to escape from the enemy advancing from the north, and subduing the country before them. &#1504;&#1505; &#1493;&#1504;&#1502;&#1500;&#1496;&#1492; means fugitives of every kind. The co-ordination of the same word or synonymous terms in the masc. and fem. serves to generalize the idea; see on <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-1.htm">Isaiah 3:1</a>, and Ewald, 172, c. In &#1504;&#1502;&#1500;&#1496;&#1492;  the tone is retracted through the influence of the distinctive accent; the form is participial. The question, "What has happened?" is answered in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-20.htm">Jeremiah 48:20</a>. &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;, "for ( equals  certainly) it is broken down." The Kethib &#1492;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497; &#1493;&#1468;&#1494;&#1506;&#1511;&#1497; must not be changed. Moab is addressed: with &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468; is introduced the summons, addressed to individuals, to proclaim at the Arnon the calamity that has befallen the country to the north of that river. </body></html>
