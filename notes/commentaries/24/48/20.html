It appears in the war-song quoted, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-14.htm" title="Why it is said in the book of the wars of the LORD, What he did in the Red sea, and in the brooks of Arnon,">Numbers 21:14</a>, from the “Book of the Wars of the Lord,” and the “high places” on either side its course were crowned with the castles of the lords of Moab (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-28.htm" title="For there is a fire gone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon: it has consumed Ar of Moab, and the lords of the high places of Arnon.">Numbers 21:28</a>). The verse contains the answer to the question that precedes it—“This is what has come to pass, Moab is confounded and spoiled.” For the “plain country” see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-8.htm" title="And the spoiler shall come on every city, and no city shall escape: the valley also shall perish, and the plain shall be destroyed, as the LORD has spoken.">Jeremiah 48:8</a>.<span class= "bld"><p>(20) <span class= "bld">Make ye him drunken . . .</span>—The image is suggested by the wine-cup of Jehovah’s fury in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-15.htm" title="For thus said the LORD God of Israel to me; Take the wine cup of this fury at my hand, and cause all the nations, to whom I send you, to drink it.">Jeremiah 25:15</a>, and was familiar in the symbolic language of the prophets (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-17.htm" title="Awake, awake, stand up, O Jerusalem, which have drunk at the hand of the LORD the cup of his fury; you have drunken the dregs of the cup of trembling, and wrung them out.">Isaiah 51:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-20.htm" title="His eyes shall see his destruction, and he shall drink of the wrath of the Almighty.">Job 21:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-32.htm" title="Thus said the Lord GOD; You shall drink of your sister's cup deep and large: you shall be laughed to scorn and had in derision; it contains much.">Ezekiel 23:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-10.htm" title="The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb:">Revelation 14:10</a>). The words that follow paint the image in its strongest colours. As men looked with scorn on the drunkard wallowing in his shame, so should they look on Moab, that had been so boastful in its pride, when it was brought low.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/48.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>48:14-47. The destruction of Moab is further prophesied, to awaken them by national repentance and reformation to prevent the trouble, or by a personal repentance and reformation to prepare for it. In reading this long roll of threatenings, and mediating on the terror, it will be of more use to us to keep in view the power of God's anger and the terror of his judgments, and to have our hearts possessed with a holy awe of God and of his wrath, than to search into all the figures and expressions here used. Yet it is not perpetual destruction. The chapter ends with a promise of their return out of captivity in the latter days. Even with Moabites God will not contend for ever, nor be always wroth. The Jews refer it to the days of the Messiah; then the captives of the Gentiles, under the yoke of sin and Satan, shall be brought back by Divine grace, which shall make them free indeed.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/48.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Or, "Moab is ashamed, because she (Dibon) is broken" by her fortifications being battered down. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/48.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20.

As to the form &#1502;&#1489;&#1496;&#1495;&#1501;, with Segol in the pretone, cf. Ewald, 70, a; Olshausen, Gram. S. 377. Moab will then be no longer able to boast of his valour; this is the meaning of the question in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-14.htm">Jeremiah 48:14</a> : on this term in the address, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-23.htm">Jeremiah 2:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-8.htm">Jeremiah 8:8</a>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-15.htm">Jeremiah 48:15</a> it is further stated that the result will show this: "Moab is laid waste." &#1493;&#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492; &#1506;&#1500;&#1492; is variously interpreted. An explanation which has met with much acceptance, but which nevertheless is really untenable, is founded on <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-40.htm">Judges 20:40</a> ("The whole city went up towards heaven" i.e., in smoke and fire): "As for his cities, fire or smoke ascends;" but there is no mention here either of smoke or fire. Kimchi long ago came near the truth when he sought to find the subject &#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1491; in shudad &#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1468;&#1491;: "and the devastator comes against his cities." However, the contrast between &#1506;&#1500;&#1492; and &#1497;&#1512;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468; is not fully brought out in this way: it is better to leave the subject indeterminate: "and his cities they climb" (Kueper), or: "they go up to his cities" (Bttcher, Neue Aehrenlese, ii. 163). The enemy who mounts the cities is evidently intended. The change &#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1468;&#1491; into &#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1491; is both unnecessary and unsuitable; but J. D. Michaelis, Ewald, Dahler, Graf, after making the alteration, translate, "The destroyer of Moab and of his cities draws near." Hitzig justly remarks, in opposition to this conjecture: "There is nothing to justify the mere placing of the subject at the head of the sentence (contrast <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-8.htm">Jeremiah 48:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-18.htm">Jeremiah 48:18</a>); besides, one does not see why the cities of Moab are distinguished from Moab itself; and cf. 20b." &#1497;&#1512;&#1491; &#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1496;&#1495;, "to sink down to the slaughter," cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-27.htm">Jeremiah 50:27</a>; and on this use of &#1497;&#1512;&#1491;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-7.htm">Isaiah 34:7</a>. The enemy ascends into the cities, the young soldiers of Moab descend to the shambles. This threatening is enforced by the addition, "saith the King," etc. Jahveh is called the King, in contrast with the belief of the Moabites, that their god Chemosh was the king of his people (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-7.htm">Jeremiah 48:7</a>). The true King of the Moabites also is Jahveh, the God of hosts, i.e., the Ruler of the whole world. </body></html>
