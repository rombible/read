The destruction of Moab is further prophesied, to awaken them by national repentance and reformation to prevent the trouble, or by a personal repentance and reformation to prepare for it. In reading this long roll of threatenings, and mediating on the terror, it will be of more use to us to keep in view the power of God's anger and the terror of his judgments, and to have our hearts possessed with a holy awe of God and of his wrath, than to search into all the figures and expressions here used. Yet it is not perpetual destruction. The chapter ends with a promise of their return out of captivity in the latter days. Even with Moabites God will not contend for ever, nor be always wroth. The Jews refer it to the days of the Messiah; then the captives of the Gentiles, under the yoke of sin and Satan, shall be brought back by Divine grace, which shall make them free indeed.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/48.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Because of the force - Rather, without force. Translate it: "The fugitives have stood, (i. e., halted) powerless in the shadow of Heshbon." As Heshbon was the capital of the Ammonites, the sense is that the defeated Moabites looked to Ammon for protection.<p>But afire ... - Not only will Ammon refuse aid to Moab, but her ruin is to come forth from Heshbon. To show this Jeremiah has recourse to the old triumphal poetry of the Mosaic age (marginal reference).<p>The corner - i. e., of the beard ..."the crown of the head." The fire of war consumes both far and near, both hair and beard, i. e., everything that it can singe and destroy.<p>The tumultuous ones - literally, "sons of the battle-shout," the brave Moabite warriors. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/48.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>46.

The inhabitants of Moab, who worshipped the idol Chemosh; of which see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-7.htm">Jeremiah 48:7</a>; and so called his people, as Israel were called the people of the Lord; now these, notwithstanding their idol, whom they worshipped, and in whom they trusted, should perish; and sad and deplorable would be their condition and circumstances: <p>for thy sons are taken captives, and thy daughters captives; this explains the woe that should come upon them, and in what sense they should perish; since their sons and daughters, who they hoped would have continued their name and nation, were taken, and would be carried captives into Babylon; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-29.htm">Numbers 21:29</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/48.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Woe be to thee, O Moab! the people of <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> Chemosh perisheth: for thy sons are taken captives, and thy daughters captives.</span><p>(b) Who vaunted themselves of their idol as though he could have defended them.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/48.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 46.</span> - Based on <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-29.htm">Numbers 21:29</a>.

"How it is broken! they howl. How hath Moab turned the back, for shame! And Moab becomes a laughing-stock and a terror to all his neighbours. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-40.htm">Jeremiah 48:40</a>. For thus saith Jahveh: Behold, he shall fly like the eagle, and spread his wings over Moab. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-41.htm">Jeremiah 48:41</a>. Kerioth is taken, and the strongholds are seized, and the heart of the heroes of Moab on that day become like the heart of a travailing woman. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-42.htm">Jeremiah 48:42</a>. And Moab is destroyed from being a people, because he hath boasted against Jahveh. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-43.htm">Jeremiah 48:43</a>. Fear, and a pit, and a snare, are against thee, O inhabitants of Moab, saith Jahveh. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-44.htm">Jeremiah 48:44</a>. He who flees from the fear shall fall into the pit, and he who goes up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare; for I will bring against it, against Moab, the year of their recompense, saith Jahveh."<p>The subject of &#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-39.htm">Jeremiah 48:39</a> is Moab viewed as a nation. &#1492;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468; might be imperative, but in this case we would be obliged to take &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473; also as an imperative (as Hitzig and Graf do). It is simpler to take both forms as perfects: "they howl...Moab turns the back, is ashamed" ( equals  for shame). On &#1492;&#1497;&#1492; &#1500;&#1513;&#1474;&#1495;&#1511;, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-26.htm">Jeremiah 48:26</a>. &#1502;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;, object of terror, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-17.htm">Jeremiah 17:17</a>. "All who are round about him," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-17.htm">Jeremiah 48:17</a>. "For (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-40.htm">Jeremiah 48:40</a>) the enemy rushes down upon Moab like an eagle, and seizes Kerioth and all his strongholds." The subject is left unnamed, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-18.htm">Jeremiah 46:18</a>, but it is Nebuchadnezzar. The figure of the eagle, darting down in flight on its prey, is founded on <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-49.htm">Deuteronomy 28:49</a> (on &#1488;&#1500;- for &#1506;&#1500;, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-22.htm">Jeremiah 49:22</a>). Kerioth, the capital, is taken (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-24.htm">Jeremiah 48:24</a>); so are the other strongholds or fastnesses of the country. The mere fact that &#1511;&#1512;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; has the article does not justify any one in taking it as an appellative, "the cities;" this appears from a comparison of <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/2-2.htm">Amos 2:2</a> with this verse. No plural of &#1511;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492; occurs anywhere. Then the fear of death falls on the heroes of Moab like a woman in labour. &#1502;&#1510;&#1512;&#1492;, partic. Hiphil from &#1510;&#1512;&#1512;, uterum comprimens, is found only here and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-22.htm">Jeremiah 49:22</a>, where the figure is repeated. Moab is annihilated, so that it is no longer a nation (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-2.htm">Jeremiah 48:2</a>), because it has risen up in pride against the God of Israel; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-26.htm">Jeremiah 48:26</a>. He who flees from one danger falls into the other. The play on the words &#1508;&#1468;&#1495;&#1491;, fear, horror, &#1508;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;, pit, and &#1508;&#1468;&#1495;, spring-trap, as well as the mode in which it is carried out, is taken from <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-17.htm">Isaiah 24:17</a>., - a prophecy of the judgment on the world; see a similar idea presented in <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/5-19.htm">Amos 5:19</a>, but somewhat differently expressed. The Kethib &#1492;&#1504;&#1497;&#1505;, perfect Hiphil, "he flees," is less suitable than the Qeri &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1505; (after Isaiah). The last clause, "for I will bring," etc., is quite in Jeremiah's peculiar style; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-23.htm">Jeremiah 4:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-12.htm">Jeremiah 23:12</a>. &#1488;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492; belongs to &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1502;&#1493;&#1488;&#1489;: the noun is anticipated by the pronoun, as frequently occurs; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-14.htm">Jeremiah 9:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/41-3.htm">Jeremiah 41:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/43-11.htm">Jeremiah 43:11</a>. </body></html>
