With Moab, as with other nations, it was her self-exalting pride that called for chastisement.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/48.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>48:14-47. The destruction of Moab is further prophesied, to awaken them by national repentance and reformation to prevent the trouble, or by a personal repentance and reformation to prepare for it. In reading this long roll of threatenings, and mediating on the terror, it will be of more use to us to keep in view the power of God's anger and the terror of his judgments, and to have our hearts possessed with a holy awe of God and of his wrath, than to search into all the figures and expressions here used. Yet it is not perpetual destruction. The chapter ends with a promise of their return out of captivity in the latter days. Even with Moabites God will not contend for ever, nor be always wroth. The Jews refer it to the days of the Messiah; then the captives of the Gentiles, under the yoke of sin and Satan, shall be brought back by Divine grace, which shall make them free indeed.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/48.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Surprised - captured by force. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/48.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>42.

For some time, not always; since the captivity of Moab is promised to be returned, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-47.htm">Jeremiah 48:47</a>; or from being such a people as they had been, enjoying so much ease, wealth, power, and prosperity. Abarbinel takes it to be a comparative, and renders it, "more than a people"; that is, shall be destroyed more than any other people; but the former sense is best; <p>because he hath magnified himself against the Lord; the Targum is, against the people of the Lord; this is the cause of his destruction; See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-26.htm">Jeremiah 48:26</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/48.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And Moab shall be destroyed from being a people, because he hath magnified himself against the LORD.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/48.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Further lamentation over the fall of Moab. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-36.htm">Jeremiah 48:36</a>.

For every head is baldness, and every beard is shorn; on all hands there are cuts, and on loins sackcloth. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-38.htm">Jeremiah 48:38</a>. On all the roofs of Moab, and in its streets, it is all mourning; for I have broken Moab like a vessel, in which there is no pleasure, saith Jahveh."<p>The prophet once more lifts up his lamentation over Moab (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-36.htm">Jeremiah 48:36</a> corresponds to <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-31.htm">Jeremiah 48:31</a>), and gives reason for it in the picture he draws of the deep affliction of the Moabites. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-36.htm">Jeremiah 48:36</a> is an imitation of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-11.htm">Isaiah 16:11</a>; the thought presented in v. 36b accords with that found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/15-7.htm">Isaiah 15:7</a>. Isaiah says, "My bowels sound (groan) like the harp," whose strings give a tremulous sound when struck with the plectrum. Instead of this, Jeremiah puts the sounding of pipes, the instruments used in dirges (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-23.htm">Matthew 9:23</a>). Moab and Kir-heres are mentioned together, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-31.htm">Jeremiah 48:31</a>. &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1499;&#1468;&#1503;, in the second clause, does not stand for &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1499;&#1468;&#1503;, "on this account that" (Kimchi, Hitzig, Graf, etc.), but is co-ordinated with the first &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1499;&#1468;&#1503;. The idea is not, "Therefore my heart mourns over Moab, because the savings are perished;" but because the sentence of desolation has been passed on the whole of Moab, therefore the heart of the prophet makes lament, and therefore, too, all the property which Moab has acquired is lost. &#1497;&#1514;&#1512;&#1492;, as a collective noun, is joined with the plural verb &#1488;&#1489;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;. On the construction &#1497;&#1514;&#1512;&#1514; &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492;, cf. Gesenius, 123, 3, Rem. 1; Ewald, 332, c. The proof of this is given by the deep sorrow and wailing of the whole Moabite nation, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-37.htm">Jeremiah 48:37</a>. On all sides are tokens of the deepest sadness, - heads shorn bald, beards cut off, incisions on the hands, sackcloth round the loins.</body></html>
