The strong works and fortifications they had made about their cities, and so thought themselves safe in them; which is the sense of the Septuagint and Vulgate Latin versions, and those that follow them. Kimchi and Ben Melech interpret it of their cattle and other possessions, as the word is rendered in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-2.htm">1 Samuel 25:2</a>; which they observe. It may very well be understood of their idols, the works of their hands, in which they placed their confidence; and therefore their chief God after mentioned is threatened to be taken and carried away: <p>and in thy treasures: their gold and silver, and other riches they had heaped together: <p>thou shalt be taken: some particular city seems to be meant, the city Moab, or Ar of Moab, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-4.htm">Jeremiah 48:4</a>; or Horonaim, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-5.htm">Jeremiah 48:5</a>; <p>and Chemosh shall go forth in captivity, with his priests and his princes together; this was the god of the Ammonites, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-24.htm">Judges 11:24</a>; and of the Moabites, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-7.htm">1 Kings 11:7</a>; hence the Moabites are called the people of Chemosh, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-29.htm">Numbers 21:29</a>; which Philo the Jew (i) explains thus; that is, thy people and power are found blind, and deprived of sight; and says that Chemosh is interpreted "as groping", or feeling, which is the property of one that cannot see. "Mosh" in Hebrew signifies to grope or feel; and "caph" is a servile letter, and a note of similitude; and by another Jewish writer (k) Chemosh is called the god of the blind. Jerom (l) takes it to be the same idol with Baalpeor, thought by some the Priapus of the Heathens. Camus, the god of festivals and merriment, seems to have had his name from hence; very probably the sun was worshipped by the Moabites under this name, which may be so called from its swiftness; for the Arabic word, "camash", signifies swift and hastening (m); as the sun is to run its race. The Moabites put their trust in this their deity; and to let them see that he would be of no avail unto them, in this time of their distress, he himself should be taken away by the enemy out of his temple, for the sake of the gold or silver that was upon him, and with him the priests that attended his service; or his worshippers, as the Targum; and the princes of the nation that served him, and supported the worship of him, and defrayed the expenses of it. <p>(i) Allegor. l. 2. p. 104.

Jeremiah transports the hearers of the word of God at once into the midst of the catastrophe which is to come on Moab; this is with the view of humbling the pride of this people, and chastening them for their sins. The woe is uttered over Nebo, but holds also of the towns named afterwards. Nebo is not the mountain of that name (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-49.htm">Deuteronomy 32:49</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/34-1.htm">Deuteronomy 34:1</a>), but the city, which probably did not lie far from the peak in the mountain-range of Abarim, which bore the same name (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/32-3.htm">Numbers 32:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-38.htm">Numbers 32:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/15-2.htm">Isaiah 15:2</a>), although in the Onomasticon, s.v. &#x39d;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#834;, the situation of the mountain is given as being six Roman miles from Heshbon, towards the west, and s.v. &#x39d;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c1;, that of the city, eight Roman miles south from Heshbon, for both accounts point to a situation in the south-west. The Arab. name nba equals  is still applied to some ruins; cf. Robinson's Palestine, iii. p. 170. "Kiriathaim is taken." The site of this town, mentioned as early as <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/14-5.htm">Genesis 14:5</a>, has been fixed, since the time of Burckhardt, as that of a mass of ruins called et Teim, about five miles south of Heshbon; but Dietrich, in Merx' Archiv. i. S. 337ff., has shown this is incorrect. According to Eusebius, in his Onomasticon, Kiriathaim lay ten Roman miles to the west of Medeba: this suits not merely the position of et Teim, but also the ruins of Kereyat south-west from Medeba, on the ridge of Mount Attarus, a little to the south of M'kaur (Machaerus), and of Baara in the Wady Zerka Maein, where also is the plain mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/14-5.htm">Genesis 14:5</a>, either in the plain stretching direct east from Kereyat between Wady Zerka Maein and Wady Wal, or south-east in the beautiful plain el Kura, described by Burckhardt, p. 371ff., between the Wal and the Mojeb. Nebo and Kiriathaim lay on the eastern border of the high range of mountains, and seem to be comprehended under &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1490;&#1468;&#1489;, "the height, the high fortress," in the third clause of <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-1.htm">Jeremiah 48:1</a>, as the representatives of the mountain country of Moab. Various expositors, certainly, take the word as a proper name designating an elevated region; Graf and Ngelsbach take it to be a name of Kir-Moab (Kir-heres, Kir-haresheth, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-31.htm">Jeremiah 48:31</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-36.htm">Jeremiah 48:36</a>), the chief fortress in the country, the modern Kerek in the southern part of Moab; but no valid proof has been adduced. By "the height" Hitzig understands the highlands, which learn of the fall of these towns in the lowlands, and feel this disgrace that has come on Moab, but have not yet themselves been taken. But this view is untenable, because the towns of Nebo and Kiriathaim are not situated in the level country. Again, since &#1492;&#1493;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492; is common to the two clauses, the distinction between &#1504;&#1500;&#1499;&#1468;&#1491;&#1492; and &#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; could hardly be pressed so far as to make the latter the opposite of the former, in the sense of being still unconquered. The meaning rather is, that through Nebo's being laid waste, and the capture of Kiriathaim, the fortress on which the Moabites trusted is no more. And to this <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-3.htm">Jeremiah 48:3</a> appropriately adds, "the boasting of Moab is gone," i.e., Moab has no more ground for boasting. "In Heshbon they (the enemy, or the conquerors) plot evil against Moab." Heshbon was formerly the capital of the Amorite kingdom of Sihon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-26.htm">Numbers 21:26</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-24.htm">Deuteronomy 2:24</a>, etc.), and was assigned to the tribe of Reuben (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-17.htm">Joshua 13:17</a>); but because it lay on the boundary of the territory belonging to the tribe, it was given up to the Gadites, and set apart as a Levitical city (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/21-37.htm">Joshua 21:37</a>). It lay ten Roman miles east from the Jordan, opposite Jericho, almost intermediate between the Arnon and the Jabbok, and is still pointed out, though in ruins, under the old name Heshbn (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-37.htm">Numbers 32:37</a>). At the time of Jeremiah it was taken possession of by the Ammonites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-3.htm">Jeremiah 49:3</a>), consequently it was the frontier town of the Moabite territory at that time; and being such, it is here named as the town where the enemy, coming from the north, deliberate regarding the conquest of Moab - "meditate evil," i.e., decide upon conquest and devastation. The suffix of &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492; refers to Moab as a country, and hence is feminine; cf. v. 4. "We will destroy it (Moab) &#1502;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;, so that it shall no longer be a nation." Just as in &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1503; &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468; there is a play on the words, so is there also in the expression &#1502;&#1491;&#1502;&#1503; &#1514;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497; which follows. This very circumstance forms an argument for taking Madmen as a proper name, instead of an appellative, as Venema and Hitzig have done, after the example of the lxx: "Yea, thou shalt be destroyed (and made into) a dunghill." In support of this rendering they point to <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-27.htm">2 Kings 10:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/6-11.htm">Ezra 6:11</a>. But the verb &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1501;, in its meaning, ill accords with &#1502;&#1491;&#1502;&#1503; in the sense of a dung-heap, and in this case there would be no foundation for a play upon the words (Graf). It is no proof of the non-existence of a place called Madmen in Moab, that it is not mentioned elsewhere; Madmena in the tribe of Benjamin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-31.htm">Isaiah 10:31</a>), and Madmanna in Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-31.htm">Joshua 15:31</a>), are also mentioned but once. These passages rather show that the name Madmen was not uncommon; and it was perhaps with reference to this name that Isaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/25-10.htm">Isaiah 25:10</a>) chose the figure of the dunghill. &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1501;, to be silent, means, in the Niphal, to be brought to silence, be exterminated, perish; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-26.htm">Jeremiah 49:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-37.htm">Jeremiah 25:37</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-14.htm">Jeremiah 8:14</a>, etc. As to the form &#1514;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497; instead of &#1514;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497; , cf. Ewald, 140, b; Gesenius, 67, Rem. 5. The following clause refers to Madmen: "after thee shall the sword go;" cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-15.htm">Jeremiah 9:15</a>.</body></html>
