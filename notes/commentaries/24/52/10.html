As to the account given of the flight, capture, and condemnation of the king, both <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39.htm">Jeremiah 39</a> and 2 Kings mit the notices given in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-10.htm">Jeremiah 52:10</a>, "and also all the princes of Judah he caused to be slain (i.e., executed) at Riblah," and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-11.htm">Jeremiah 52:11</a>, "and he put him in the prison-house till the day of his death." &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;&#1470;&#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; has been rendered &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; &#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; by the lxx; on this fact Hitzig bases the opinion that the Hebrew words signify "the house of punishment," or "the house of correction," in which Zedekiah was obliged to turn the mill like other culprits, and as Samson was once obliged to do (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/16-21.htm">Judges 16:21</a>). But this meaning of the words cannot be substantiated. &#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1492; means "oversight, mustering, or visitation (Heimsuchung), or vengeance," e.g., <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-3.htm">Isaiah 10:3</a>, but not punishment (Strafe), and the plural, "watches" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/9-1.htm">Ezekiel 9:1</a>) and "custody," <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/54-11.htm">Ezekiel 54:11</a>; hence the expression used here signifies "the house of custody," or "the house of the watches." The translation of the lxx can decide nothing against this, because their interpretation is based upon traditions which are themselves unfounded. Regarding this, Ewald well remarks (History of the People of Israel, iii. p. 748 of 2nd:ed.): "That Zedekiah must have laboured at the mill, as is mentioned in later chronicles (see Aug. Mai, Scriptorum veterum nova collectio, t. i. P. 2, p. 6; cf. Chr. Sam. Ch. xlv.), is probably a mere inference from <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/5-13.htm">Lamentations 5:13</a>." </body></html>
