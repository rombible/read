The large brazen articles, the two pillars at the porch (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-15.htm">1 Kings 7:15</a>.), the bases (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-27.htm">1 Kings 7:27</a>.), and the brazen sea (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-23.htm">1 Kings 7:23</a>.), which were too vast in their proportions to be easily carried away to Babylon, were broken to pieces by the Chaldeans, who carried off the brass of which they were made. &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; is more correct than &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;  (Kings), and "all their brass" is more precise than simply "their brass" (Kings). In the enumeration of the smaller brazen vessels used for the temple service, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-18.htm">Jeremiah 52:18</a>, there is omitted, in 2 Kings, &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1494;&#1512;&#1511;&#1493;&#1514;, "and the bowls" (used in sacrifice); this omission is perhaps due merely to an error in transcription. The enumeration of the gold and silver vessels in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-19.htm">Jeremiah 52:19</a> has been much more abbreviated in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-15.htm">2 Kings 25:15</a>, where only "the fire-pans and the bowls" are mentioned, while in the text here, besides these there are named "the basons," then "the pots (Eng. vers. caldrons), and the candlesticks, and the pans (Eng. vers. spoons), and the cups." For particulars regarding these different vessels, see on <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-40.htm">1 Kings 7:40</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-45.htm">1 Kings 7:45</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-50.htm">1 Kings 7:50</a>. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-20.htm">Jeremiah 52:20</a>, reference is made to the fact that the mass of metal in the vessels that were carried away was without weight. The same is stated in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-16.htm">2 Kings 25:16</a>, where, however, there is no mention of the twelve brazen bulls; while in the text of Jeremiah, &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514; &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1499;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; is faulty, and we must read instead, &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493; &#1493;&#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1499;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514;. The assertion of Graf, in his commentary on this verse, and of Thenius on <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-16.htm">2 Kings 25:16</a>, - that the notice regarding the twelve brazen bulls is incorrect, because these were then no longer in Jerusalem (27:19), but had previously been removed by Ahaz from under the brazen sea for Tiglath-pileser, - we have already, under <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-17.htm">2 Kings 16:17</a>, shown to be erroneous. The apposition of &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;  to &#1500;&#1504;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501; explains the reference of the suffix. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-21.htm">Jeremiah 52:21-23</a>, the narrator, in order to call attention to the amount of art exhibited on the vessels destroyed by the Chaldeans, gives a brief description of the brazen pillars with their capitals. This description is much shortened in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-17.htm">2 Kings 25:17</a>, and contains notices completing that which is given of these works of art in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7.htm">1 Kings 7</a>.
