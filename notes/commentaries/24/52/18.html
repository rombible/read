The deviations for the most part originated through the freedom exercised by the epitomizer in his work, or only when mistakes were made by later copyists. The text before us has some amplifications (especially the notices regarding the ornaments of the brazen pillars, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-23.htm">Jeremiah 52:23</a>) which are found nowhere else in the Old Testament. The difference in date between <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-12.htm">Jeremiah 52:12</a> ("on the tenth of the month") and the passage in Kings ("on the seventh of the month") has arisen through one number having been mistaken for another in copying; it cannot now be decided which is correct; see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-18.htm">2 Kings 25:18</a>. As to Nebuzaradan, see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-13.htm">Jeremiah 39:13</a>. Instead of &#1506;&#1502;&#1491; , is found &#1506;&#1489;&#1491; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-8.htm">2 Kings 25:8</a>, which certainly is a simpler reading, but one having less appearance of being the original. The only strange point is the want of the relative &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; in plain prose before &#1506;&#1502;&#1491;, which is probably to be pointed &#1506;&#1502;&#1491;. &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, instead of &#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; (Kings), is a pregnant expression for "he came into Jerusalem." - <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-14.htm">Jeremiah 52:14</a>. From the expression &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1495;&#1493;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;, as given in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-14.htm">Jeremiah 52:14</a>, "all" is omitted in Kings, as being not indispensable for the meaning. </body></html>
