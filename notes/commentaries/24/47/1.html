Prophecy against the Philistines.<p>1. Pharaoh-necho probably smote Gaza on his return after defeating Josiah at Megiddo (2Ch 35:20) [Grotius]. Or, Pharaoh-hophra (Jer 37:5, 7) is intended: probably on his return from his fruitless attempt to save Jerusalem from the Chaldeans, he smote Gaza in order that his expedition might not be thought altogether in vain [Calvin] (Am 1:6, 7).The destruction of the Philistines, Tyrians, Zidonians, and others by the sea-side. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> In the former chapter the prophet foretold the judgments of God upon the Egyptians, who were the Jews’ seeming friends, but their real enemies, as they were occasions to them of idolatry, and of a sinful confidence in them. He comes in this chapter to foretell the judgments of God upon the Philistines, who were inveterate enemies to the Jews, against whom also Isaiah, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-29.htm" title="Rejoice not you, whole Palestina, because the rod of him that smote you is broken: for out of the serpent's root shall come forth a cockatrice, and his fruit shall be a fiery flying serpent.">Isaiah 14:29</a></span> of his prophecy, and Ezekiel, and Amos prophesied, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-15.htm" title="Thus said the Lord GOD; Because the Philistines have dealt by revenge, and have taken vengeance with a despiteful heart, to destroy it for the old hatred;">Ezekiel 25:15</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-6.htm" title="Thus said the LORD; For three transgressions of Gaza, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they carried away captive the whole captivity, to deliver them up to Edom:">Amos 1:6</a></span>; and also Zephaniah, in <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-4.htm" title="For Gaza shall be forsaken, and Ashkelon a desolation: they shall drive out Ashdod at the noon day, and Ekron shall be rooted up.">Zephaniah 2:4</a>,5</span> of his prophecy. When the king of Egypt took Gaza, one of the five cities of the Philistines, the Scripture doth not tell us. Some think it was either in his way to Carchemish, or as he came back a conqueror from the battle at Megiddo, where Josiah was slain. The time when Jeremiah had this revelation is set down to let us know that it was in the time of the Philistines’ prosperity, when the prophet could see no such effect existent, or probable in its causes. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/47.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>The word of the Lord that came to Jeremiah the prophet against the Philistines,.... As the former prophecies were against the Egyptians, the friends and allies of the Jews, in whom they trusted; this is against the Philistines, the near neighbours of the Jews, and their implacable enemies: the time of this prophecy was, <p>before Pharaoh smote Gaza; one of the five cities of the Philistines, a very strong and fortified place, as its name signifies; See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-26.htm">Acts 8:26</a>. The Jews, in their chronicle, say (t) this was fulfilled in the eighth year of Zedekiah, when Pharaoh came out of Egypt, while the Chaldeans were besieging Jerusalem; which they hearing of, broke up the siege, and went forth to meet him; upon which he went to Gaza, and destroyed that, and returned to Egypt again. Both Jarchi and Kimchi make mention of this, but say it was in the tenth year of Zedekiah; and which, no doubt, is the truest reading, since the Chaldean army did not come up against Jerusalem until the ninth year of his reign. But it is more likely that this Pharaoh was Pharaohnecho, and that he fell upon Gaza, and smote it, either when he came to Carchemish, or when he returned from thence, after he had slain Josiah. Now this prophecy was delivered out before anything of this kind happened, and when the Philistines were in the utmost peace, and in no fear or expectation of destruction; and the smiting of this single city by the king of Egypt is foretold, as the forerunner and pledge of a greater destruction of the land by the king of Babylon, next mentioned. <p>(t) Seder Olam Rabba, c. 26. p. 75. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/47.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet against the Philistines, before Pharaoh smote <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> Gaza.</span><p>(a) Or Azzah, a city of the Philistines.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/47.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">1</span>.

A difficult expression is &#1511;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492;&#1468; &#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473; &#1497;&#1500;&#1498;, "her (viz., that of the daughter of Egypt) voice is like (the voice of) the serpent (which) goes." &#1497;&#1500;&#1498; must be taken as part of a relative sentence, since this verb is nowhere used of a voice or sound; hence it cannot be so joined here. Ewald, following the &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; of the lxx, would read &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1511;, "hissing," instead of &#1497;&#1500;&#1498;, and translates, "it makes a noise like the hissing serpent." He more fully defines the meaning thus: "Even though Egypt were hidden like a serpent in a thicket, yet it would be heard in its flight, like a nasty serpent hissing fiercely, while it hurries away from the axe of the wood-cutter." But, apart from the arbitrary change of &#1497;&#1500;&#1498; into &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1511; (the former word is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-14.htm">Genesis 3:14</a> of the going, i.e., crawling, of a serpent), Ewald puts into the words an idea altogether foreign to them. The nasty, fierce hissing of the serpent that is forced to flee, is quite unsuitable; for there is no further mention made of the flight of the Egyptians, but Egypt is hewn down like a forest by woodcutters. Moreover, as Graf has already well remarked, Egypt is not compared to a serpent, but only its voice to the voice or hiss of a serpent. For &#1511;&#1493;&#1500; signifies, not merely the voice, but any sound, even the rustling and rattling of leaves (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-8.htm">Genesis 3:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-36.htm">Leviticus 26:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-24.htm">2 Samuel 5:24</a>); hence it may denote the noise caused by a serpent crawling on its belly in the thicket. The comparison, as Graf has correctly observed, is like that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-4.htm">Isaiah 29:4</a>. There it is the daughter of Zion, but here it is the daughter of Egypt that lies on the ground, deeply humbled; weeping softly and moaning, making a sound like that of a serpent in a moss among fallen leaves, fleeing before the woodcutters.<p>(Note: The old translators have quite misunderstood these words, and attempted to apply them, each one according to his own fancy, to the enemy. Thus the lxx translate: &#x3a6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#1511;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501;( ) &#x3c9;&#788;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#787;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c9;&#x3c2; &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#837;&#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1500;( for &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1497;&#1500;) &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, &#x3ba;.&#x3c4;.&#x3bb;. Chald.: vox collisionis armorum eorum est sicut vox serpentum repentium; and similarly the Syriac. The Vulgate is: vox ejus quasi aeris&#1504;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;( for &#1504;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;) sonabit, quoniam cum exercitu properabunt et cum securibus venient. The translator of the Vulgate has thus read &#1511;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492;&#1468;, and referred the suffix to &#1511;&#1512;&#1509;, which he renders stimulator. Luther follows the Vulgate: "Sie faren daher, das der Harnisch brasselt, und kommen mit Heeres Krafft." Hitzig also seeks to change the text, after the lxx, turning &#1511;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492;&#1468; into &#1511;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501;, and &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1497;&#1500; into &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1500;. But this alteration disturbs the order of the sentence. Not only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-20.htm">Jeremiah 46:20</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-21.htm">Jeremiah 46:21</a>, but also in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-23.htm">Jeremiah 46:23</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-24.htm">Jeremiah 46:24</a>, the first clause always treats of Egypt, and what befalls her is only stated in the clauses which follow: so is it in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-22.htm">Jeremiah 46:22</a>. Thus the alteration made affords a very trivial result, viz., that the enemy advancing on Egypt march through the very sandy desert between Gaza and Egypt, and make slow progress, like serpents, because they wade through the sand; so that they make their appearance suddenly and unexpectedly.)<p>Thus she lies on the ground, for the enemy comes in force, with axes like woodcutters, to hew down the forest of men in Egypt. The mention of the axes is occasioned by the comparison of the foe to woodcutters; we are not to think of battle-axes as weapons of the Massagetae, Scythians, Persians, and other nations (Herodotus, i. 215, iv. 70, vii. 64; Xenophon, Cyroped. i. 2, 9). Axes here form the type of murderous weapons generally. On the comparison of a multitude of people to a forest, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-14.htm">Jeremiah 21:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-18.htm">Isaiah 10:18</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-33.htm">Isaiah 10:33</a>. The clause &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1495;&#1511;&#1512; is referred by L. de Dieu, J. D. Michaelis, Hitzig, Ngelsbach, etc., to the wood, "for it cannot be explored or penetrated;" thus a road must be made in order to get through it. However, the question is not about the enemy going or marching through Egypt, but about the destruction of Egypt and her powers. Rosenmller and Graf, with Raschi, are more correct in referring the clause to the hostile army, "for it cannot be investigated," i.e., it is impossible to learn the number of them. It is no great objection to this interpretation that the verb occurs in the singular: this must be retained as it is, since it is not the individual enemies that cannot be searched out, but it is the number of the whole army that cannot be reckoned. On the employment of &#1495;&#1511;&#1512; in the Niphal in connection with the impossibility of counting a multitude, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-47.htm">1 Kings 7:47</a>, and the expression &#1500;&#1488; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-9.htm">Job 5:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-10.htm">Job 9:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/36-36.htm">Job 36:36</a>. The clauses which follow, and conclude <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-23.htm">Jeremiah 46:23</a>, explain the thought further: "more numerous than grasshoppers," i.e., innumerable.</body></html>
