Jehoiakim burns one roll, God will have the same thing wrote in another. We learn here both what was the matter of Jeremiah’s prophecy, and the cause of the king’s anger; he had prophesied that the king of Babylon should come, take Jerusalem; and lay the country waste, which, as to Jehoiakim’s part, was fulfilled within six years after this, more fully in eighteen years; but corrupt princes can endure nothing that shall make their lives uneasy. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/36.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And thou shall say to Jehoiakim king of Judah,....

He takes no notice of himself and his family, as if his concern was only for the nation; and that he took it ill that anything should be said which expressed the ruin of that, and might dishearten the inhabitants of it. <p>(w) "de", Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator, Cocceius, Schmidt. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/36.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And thou shalt say to Jehoiakim king of Judah, Thus saith the LORD; Thou hast burned this scroll, saying, <span class="cverse3">{p}</span> Why hast thou written in it, saying, The king of Babylon shall certainly come and destroy this land, and shall cause to cease from there man and beast?</span><p>(p) These are Jehoiakim's words.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/36.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">29</span>. <span class="ital">Why hast thou written, etc</span>.] a quotation, though not <span class="ital">verbatim</span>, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-9.htm" title="Behold, I will send and take all the families of the north, said the LORD, and Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will bring them against this land, and against the inhabitants thereof, and against all these nations round about, and will utterly destroy them, and make them an astonishment, and an hissing, and perpetual desolations.">Jeremiah 25:9</a> f.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/36.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt say to Jehoiakim;</span> rather, <span class="accented">concerning Jehoiakim.</span> Intercourse between Jehoiakim and the prophet was broken off by the preceding scene.

The opinion of Hitzig, that leaves are to be understood, and that the Megillah, therefore, was not a roll, properly speaking, but a book with leaves, cannot be substantiated. In the synagogues, the Jews even at the present day, according to the ancient custom, use real rolls, which are rolled up on a stick. On these the Scripture text is written, though not in lines which occupy the whole breadth of the roll; the whole space is divided into parts. "Scribebatur," says Buxtorf in Institutione epistolari Hebr. p. 4, "volumen lineis, non per longitudinem totius chartae aut pergamenti deductis, sed in plures areas divisis, quomodo sunt latera paginarum in libris complicatis. Istae propterea voce metaphoric vocantur&#1491;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514;&#1493;&#1514;januae valvae, quod figuram januae referent." The subject of &#1497;&#1511;&#1512;&#1506;&#1492; is not Jehudi, as Hitzig thinks, but the king, and the word does not signify "he cut it out," but "he cut it in pieces" (the suffix refers to &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1490;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;). We are not, with many expositors, to view the conduct of the king in such a way as to think that, whenever Jehudi had read some portions, he cut these off and threw them into the fire, so that the book was, with these interruptions, read through to the end, and at the same time gradually destroyed. Such conduct Graf justly characterizes as trifling and silly, and not in harmony with the anger of a king having a violent disposition. But we cannot see how the imperfect &#1497;&#1511;&#1512;&#1506; (in Ngelsbach's opinion) proves that Jehudi read the whole, when the text states that only three or four columns were read. The meaning, peculiar to the imperfect, of the continuation or repetition of an act, is fully made out by supposing that the king cut down the roll bit by bit, and threw the pieces into the fire one after the other. Neither does the expression &#1506;&#1491;&#1470;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501; &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1490;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; imply that the whole book was read; for &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1501; does not denote the completion of the reading, but the completion of the burning: hence the words are to be translated, "till the whole roll had completely got upon the fire," i.e., was completely burnt; cf. &#1514;&#1468;&#1501; &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/47-18.htm">Genesis 47:18</a>. The inf. absol. &#1493;&#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1498; is a continuation of the finite verb, as frequently occurs, e.g., in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-5.htm">Jeremiah 14:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-44.htm">Jeremiah 32:44</a>.</body></html>
