Elishama may have been identical with the prince of that name in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-25.htm" title="But it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, came, and ten men with him, and smote Gedaliah, that he died, and the Jews and the Chaldees that were with him at Mizpah.">2Kings 25:25</a>, and, if so, was the grandfather of a man who afterwards plays a conspicuous part in the history of the prophet’s life (Jeremiah 41) He appears to have taken a purely official line, as scribe, standing neutral between the prophet and his opponents. Delaiah (the name signifies “the Lord delivers,” and is found as that of a priest in the time of David, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/24-18.htm" title="The three and twentieth to Delaiah, the four and twentieth to Maaziah.">1Chronicles 24:18</a>) joins Elnathan and Gemariah in pleading against the king’s destruction of the prophetic roll. The name Shemaiah, which appears here as that of his father, is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/6-10.htm" title="Afterward I came to the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabeel, who was shut up; and he said, Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple: for they will come to slay you; yes, in the night will they come to slay you.">Nehemiah 6:10</a> as belonging to a son of Delaiah, and this probably indicates relationship. On Elnathan, the son of Achbor, see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-22.htm" title="And Jehoiakim the king sent men into Egypt, namely, Elnathan the son of Achbor, and certain men with him into Egypt.">Jeremiah 26:22</a>. On Gemariah, see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-10.htm" title="Then read Baruch in the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of the LORD, in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the scribe, in the higher court, at the entry of the new gate of the LORD's house, in the ears of all the people.">Jeremiah 36:10</a>. Of Zedekiah nothing more is known, unless his father Hananiah be the prophet who opposes Jeremiah in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/28-1.htm" title="And it came to pass the same year, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fourth year, and in the fifth month, that Hananiah the son of Azur the prophet, which was of Gibeon, spoke to me in the house of the LORD, in the presence of the priests and of all the people, saying,">Jeremiah 28:1-17</a>.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/36.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>36:9-19 Shows of piety and devotion may be found even among those, who, though they keep up forms of godliness, are strangers and enemies to the power of it. The princes patiently attended the reading of the whole book. They were in great fear. But even those who are convinced to the truth and importance of what they hear, and are disposed to favour those who preach it, often have difficulties and reserves about their safety, interest, or preferment, so that they do not act according to their convictions, and try to get rid of what they find troublesome.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/36.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The scribe's chamber - The chancery in which the king's business was conducted.

The royal palace, which was not upon the mountain on which the temple stood, but lay lower, and therefore Micaiah is said to go down to it; with what design he went thither is not certain, whether out of ill will to Jeremiah and Baruch, or out of good will, being affected with what he had heard, and desirous that some steps might be taken by the government to prevent the calamities coming upon them, according to these prophecies; which latter seems most probable, since no charge or accusation is brought by him; and since his father, with others, to whom he gave the account afterwards, interceded with the king that the roll might not be burnt, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-25.htm">Jeremiah 36:25</a>; however, immediately after he had heard the roll read, he went to the king's house: <p>into the scribe's chamber; the secretary's office; formerly his grandfather Shaphan's, now Elishama's: <p>and, lo, all the princes sat there; some of them are mentioned by name: <p>even Elishama the scribe; or secretary; the prime minister, the principal secretary of state, and therefore named first, in whose chamber or office they were: <p>and Delaiah the son of Shemaiah; who this person was, or his office, is not known; he is nowhere else made mention of; and who his father was is not certain: <p>and Elnathan the son of Achbor; the same that Jehoiakim sent to Egypt to fetch Uriah from thence, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-22.htm">Jeremiah 26:22</a>; <p>and Gemariah the son of Shaphan: who was Micaiah's father, and in whose chamber Baruch read the roll: <p>and Zedekiah the son of Hananiah; of this prince also no account is given elsewhere: <p>and all the princes; the rest of them, who were either members of the great sanhedrim, or courtiers; it appears from hence that this court was very profane and irreligious; for though they had proclaimed a fast, to make a show of religion, or at the importunity of the people; yet they did not attend temple worship and service themselves, but were all together in the secretary's office, very probably about political affairs. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/36.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Then he went down into the king's house, into the scribe's chamber: and, lo, all the princes sat there, even Elishama the scribe, and Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, and Elnathan the son of Achbor, and Gemariah the son of Shaphan, and Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the princes.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/36.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">12</span>. <span class="ital">he went down</span>] See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-1.htm" title="Thus said the LORD; Go down to the house of the king of Judah, and speak there this word,">Jeremiah 22:1</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Elnathan the son of Achbor</span>] mentioned ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-22.htm" title="And Jehoiakim the king sent men into Egypt, namely, Elnathan the son of Achbor, and certain men with him into Egypt.">Jeremiah 26:22</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/36.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He went down</span> (see on Jeremiah 26:10). <span class="cmt_word">Sat there.</span> In deliberation on the affairs of the state. <span class="cmt_word">Elishama the scribe</span>.

Baruch, who is mentioned so early as <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-12.htm">Jeremiah 32:12</a>. as the attendant of the prophet, was, according to the passage now before us, his amanuensis, and executed his commissions. &#1488;&#1504;&#1497; &#1506;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-1.htm">Jeremiah 33:1</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-15.htm">Jeremiah 39:15</a>, might mean, "I am in prison;" but this does not accord with the request of the princes, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-19.htm">Jeremiah 36:19</a>, that Jeremiah should hide himself. Moreover, &#1506;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; does not mean "seized, captus," but "stopped, restrained, hindered;" see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/6-10.htm">Nehemiah 6:10</a>. The cause of hindrance is not mentioned, as being away from the purpose of the narrative. "To read in the roll in the ears of the people," i.e., to read to the people out of the book. &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493;&#1501; &#1510;&#1493;&#1501; does not mean "on any fast-day whatever," but, "on the fast-day." The article is omitted because there was no need for defining the fast-day more exactly. The special fast-day mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-9.htm">Jeremiah 36:9</a> is intended. '&#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1500; &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1504;&#1468;&#1514;&#1501; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;, "their supplication will fall down before the Lord," i.e., reach unto God, as if it were laid before His feet. &#1504;&#1508;&#1500; is transferred from the posture of the suppliant - his falling down before God - to his supplication. Hence, in Hiphil, to make the supplication fall down before the Lord is equivalent to laying the request at His feet; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-26.htm">Jeremiah 38:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/42-9.htm">Jeremiah 42:9</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/9-18.htm">Daniel 9:18</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-20.htm">Daniel 9:20</a>. If the supplication actually comes before God, it is also heard and finds success. This success is pointed out in '&#1493;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;, "that they may repent." If man, in a repentant spirit, supplicates God for grace, God grants him power for conversion. But the return of the people from their wicked way is indispensable, because the wrath which God has expressed concerning it is great, i.e., because God has threatened a heavy judgment of wrath. </body></html>
