It is found in later prophets (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/2-9.htm" title="And when I looked, behold, an hand was sent to me; and, see, a roll of a book was therein;">Ezekiel 2:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-1.htm" title="Moreover he said to me, Son of man, eat that you find; eat this roll, and go speak to the house of Israel.">Ezekiel 3:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/zechariah/5-1.htm" title="Then I turned, and lifted up my eyes, and looked, and behold a flying roll.">Zechariah 5:1-2</a>). It probably followed on the introduction of parchment as a material for writing on, and the consequent substitution of the roll for the papyrus books, for which, from their fragile fabric, a different form was necessary. The command thus given to Baruch is interesting as letting us, so to speak, into the “workshop” of the prophet. He speaks probably without premeditation, as the word of the Lord comes to him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-19.htm" title="But when they deliver you up, take no thought how or what you shall speak: for it shall be given you in that same hour what you shall speak.">Matthew 10:19</a>). A disciple acts as reporter, and preserves the utterance in writing. It is interesting in this respect to note the parallelism between Jeremiah’s <span class= "ital">modus operandi </span>and St. Paul’s (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-22.htm" title="I Tertius, who wrote this letter, salute you in the Lord.">Romans 16:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-11.htm" title="You see how large a letter I have written to you with my own hand.">Galatians 6:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-17.htm" title="The salutation of Paul with my own hand, which is the token in every letter: so I write.">2Thessalonians 3:17</a>). From time to time the prophet collects, repeats, revises, and, in modern phrase, edits what he has uttered. We have here accordingly what may be described as the history of the first volume of his discourses—a volume which perished, as the chapter records, but of which the earlier chapters of the present book are substantially a reproduction.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/jeremiah/36.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-2.htm" title="Take you a roll of a book, and write therein all the words that I have spoken to you against Israel, and against Judah, and against all the nations, from the day I spoke to you, from the days of Josiah, even to this day.">Jeremiah 36:2</a>. </span><span class="ital">Take thee a roll of a book </span>— Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-1.htm" title="Moreover the LORD said to me, Take you a great roll, and write in it with a man's pen concerning Mahershalalhashbaz.">Isaiah 8:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/2-9.htm" title="And when I looked, behold, an hand was sent to me; and, see, a roll of a book was therein;">Ezekiel 2:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/5-1.htm" title="Then I turned, and lifted up my eyes, and looked, and behold a flying roll.">Zechariah 5:1</a>. The ancient manner of writing was upon long scrolls of parchment, which they afterward rolled upon sticks. On these words it is remarked by Harmer, (vol. 4. chap. 7, obs. 122,) “Many things were rolled up, much in the shape of an ancient Jewish manuscript, which yet were not fit to write upon; the words then in this, and some other similar cases, may be understood to mean, Take thee a roll, or volume, fit to be made a book of, fit to be written on.” <span class="ital">And write therein all the words that I have spoken against Israel and Judah </span>— Jeremiah prophesied against Israel as well as against Judah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-4.htm" title="Hear you the word of the LORD, O house of Jacob, and all the families of the house of Israel:">Jeremiah 2:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-12.htm" title="Go and proclaim these words toward the north, and say, Return, you backsliding Israel, said the LORD; and I will not cause my anger to fall on you: for I am merciful, said the LORD, and I will not keep anger for ever.">Jeremiah 3:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-14.htm" title="Turn, O backsliding children, said the LORD; for I am married to you: and I will take you one of a city, and two of a family, and I will bring you to Zion:">Jeremiah 3:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-13.htm" title="And I have seen folly in the prophets of Samaria; they prophesied in Baal, and caused my people Israel to err.">Jeremiah 23:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-30.htm" title="For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have only done evil before me from their youth: for the children of Israel have only provoked me to anger with the work of their hands, said the LORD.">Jeremiah 32:30</a>. The kingdom of Israel was indeed destroyed by Shalmaneser, before the time of Jeremiah; but yet the prophet was ordered to reprove their sins, both to make the justice of God appear in punishing them so severely, and withal to warn the Jews by their example. Besides, there were some remains of these tribes still left, who joined themselves to the tribe of Judah. <span class="ital">And against all the nations </span>— See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/25-15.htm" title="For thus said the LORD God of Israel to me; Take the wine cup of this fury at my hand, and cause all the nations, to whom I send you, to drink it....">Jeremiah 25:15-16</a>. <span class="ital">From the day I spake unto thee, from the days of Josiah </span>— Namely, all the revelations which he had had from God for twenty-two years last past; for he began to prophesy in the thirteenth year of Josiah, who reigned thirty-one years, so that he prophesied eighteen years during Josiah’s life, and this was the fourth year of the reign of Jehoiakim, his successor.

The Lord declares to sinners the evil he purposes to do against them, that they may hear, and fear, and return from their evil ways; and whenever any one makes this use of God's warnings, in dependence on his promised mercy, he will find the Lord ready to forgive his sins.

A roll of parchment, which being wrote on, and rolled up, was called a book; but books, in those times, did not consist of leaves cut and stitched together, and bound up, as our books are, but sheets of parchments being written upon, were glued together, and then rolled up; hence such writings were called volumes; which name we still retain, and give to books, though the same practice is not used: <p>and write therein all the words that I have spoken unto thee against Israel, and against Judah; for though Israel was carried captive before the times of Jeremiah, and his prophecies were chiefly directed against Judah; yet as there were some of the ten tribes mixed with them, they were included in these prophecies, and therefore mentioned: <p>and against all the nations; such as Egypt, Edom, Ammon, and Moab, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-26.htm">Jeremiah 9:26</a>; <p>from the day that I spake unto thee, from the days of Josiah, even unto this day; that is, from the time the Lord called him to prophesy in his name, which was in, the thirteenth year of Josiah, who reigned one and thirty years; and this being the fourth year of Jehoiakim, it must be the three and twentieth year of his prophesying, and the a course of full two and twenty years; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-2.htm">Jeremiah 1:2</a>; now all the sermons, discourses, and prophecies, he had delivered out against one and another, during this time, must all be written in one roll or book, that that they might be read.

"Thus saith Jahveh of hosts, the God of Israel: Go and say to the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Will ye not receive instruction by listening to my words? saith Jahveh. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-14.htm">Jeremiah 35:14</a>. The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab, who commanded this sons not to drink wine, are performed, and they have drunk no wine to this day, but have obeyed the command of their father. But I have spoken unto you, rising up early and speaking, yet ye have not listened unto me. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-15.htm">Jeremiah 35:15</a>. And I sent unto you all my servants the prophets, rising early and sending them, saying, Turn ye, now, every one from his evil way, and do good deeds, and do not go after other gods, to serve them; then shall ye dwell in the land which I have given to you and to your fathers. But ye did not incline your ear, nor hearken unto me. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-16.htm">Jeremiah 35:16</a>. Yea, the children of Jonadab the son of Rechab have observed the commandment of their father which he commanded them, while this people have not hearkened unto me. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-17.htm">Jeremiah 35:17</a>. Therefore, thus saith Jahveh, the God of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will bring upon Judah and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the evil which I have uttered regarding them, because I spake unto them and they did not hear, and I called unto them, but they did not answer. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-18.htm">Jeremiah 35:18</a>. And to the house of the Rechabites Jeremiah said: Thus saith Jahveh of hosts, the God of Israel, Because ye have listened to the command of Jonadab your father, and have kept all his commandments, and have done according to all that he commanded you, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-19.htm">Jeremiah 35:19</a>. Therefore, thus saith Jahveh of hosts, the God of Israel, Jonadab the son of Rechab shall not want a man to stand before me for ever."<p>The command, "Go and speak to the men of Judah," etc., shows that it was not in the chamber of the temple, in presence of the Rechabites, but probably in one of the temple fore-courts, that Jeremiah addressed the following word of the Lord to the people assembled there. In order to shame the Jews thoroughly, he shows them the faithfulness with which the Rechabites observe the ordinances of their ancestor Jonadab. The character of the address, as one intended to rouse feelings of shame, is indicated even at the beginning of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-13.htm">Jeremiah 35:13</a> : "Will ye not receive instruction by hearkening to the words of the Lord?" The Hoph. &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1511;&#1501; is construed as a passive with the accus.; in the older writers we frequently find this construction, in which the passive is used impersonally, hence the sing. is here employed: cf. Ges. 143, 1, Ew. 295, b. "To this day" - now for nearly 300 years without interruption; for Jonadab was already held in high esteem when Jehu ascended the throne, 883 b.c. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-15.htm">2 Kings 10:15</a>). Judah, on the contrary, does not listen to the commandments which his God unceasingly inculcates on him, but rather wanders after other gods, to serve them. On <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-15.htm">Jeremiah 35:15</a> cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-4.htm">Jeremiah 25:4-5</a>. &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1488;&#1491;&#1502;&#1492; stands for &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1488;&#1491;&#1502;&#1492; , <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-5.htm">Jeremiah 25:5</a>. - In <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-16.htm">Jeremiah 35:16</a>, where the introductory &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, imo, indicates a culmination, the idea is once more briefly expressed. Ngelsbach incorrectly renders &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; "because," and makes <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-16.htm">Jeremiah 35:16</a> the protasis to <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-17.htm">Jeremiah 35:17</a>. "Such a protasis with because (quia), without any connection with what precedes, is contrary to the use of language" (Hitzig).
