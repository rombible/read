These, and expressions of the like kind, sufficiently indicate that God’s foreknowledge of future events lays no restraint on the will of man, nor takes away the liberty of human actions. <span class="ital">That I may forgive their iniquity and their sin </span>— Forgiveness of sin in Scripture sometimes signifies the acquitting of a sinner from the obligation sin had laid him under to eternal death; sometimes the remission of a temporal punishment: it may here be understood as comprehending both, though it is probable the latter is principally intended.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/36.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>36:1-8 The writing of the Scriptures was by Divine appointment. The Divine wisdom directed to this as a proper means; if it failed, the house of Judah would be the more without excuse. The Lord declares to sinners the evil he purposes to do against them, that they may hear, and fear, and return from their evil ways; and whenever any one makes this use of God's warnings, in dependence on his promised mercy, he will find the Lord ready to forgive his sins. All others will be left without excuse; and the consideration that great is the anger God has pronounced against us for sin, should quicken both our prayers and our endeavours.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/36.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-3.htm">Jeremiah 26:3</a>.

Forgiveness of sin in Scripture sometimes signifieth the acquitting of a sinner from the obligation sin layeth the sinner under to eternal death, sometimes the remission of a temporal punishment; it may here well be understood as comprehending both, though I think the latter to be what is here principally intended. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/36.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I purpose to do unto them,.... Not that there was any uncertainty in God as to the knowledge of future events, any more than a change in his purposes: he had purposed to bring evil upon them, which purpose would not be disannulled; and he knew that the Jews would not hearken to the prediction of it, or be concerned about it, and repent of their sins, and reform; but this method he was pleased to take, as being, humanly speaking, a probable one to awaken their attention, and which would leave them inexcusable: <p>that they may return every man from his evil way; repent of it, and reform: <p>that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin; by not inflicting on them the punishment and ruin threatened: where repentance is, remission of sin is likewise, and both are the gifts of divine grace, when spiritual and evangelical. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/36.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I purpose to do unto them; that they may return every man from his evil way; that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/36.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">3</span>. <span class="ital">It may be that the house of Judah, etc</span>.] Cp. ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-3.htm" title="If so be they will listen, and turn every man from his evil way, that I may repent me of the evil, which I purpose to do to them because of the evil of their doings.">Jeremiah 26:3</a>.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/35.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The example of the Rechabites is one for Judah. - Jeremiah is to proclaim the word of the Lord to the people of Judah, as follows: <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-13.htm">Jeremiah 35:13</a>. "Thus saith Jahveh of hosts, the God of Israel: Go and say to the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Will ye not receive instruction by listening to my words? saith Jahveh. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-14.htm">Jeremiah 35:14</a>. The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab, who commanded this sons not to drink wine, are performed, and they have drunk no wine to this day, but have obeyed the command of their father. But I have spoken unto you, rising up early and speaking, yet ye have not listened unto me. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-15.htm">Jeremiah 35:15</a>. And I sent unto you all my servants the prophets, rising early and sending them, saying, Turn ye, now, every one from his evil way, and do good deeds, and do not go after other gods, to serve them; then shall ye dwell in the land which I have given to you and to your fathers. But ye did not incline your ear, nor hearken unto me. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-16.htm">Jeremiah 35:16</a>. Yea, the children of Jonadab the son of Rechab have observed the commandment of their father which he commanded them, while this people have not hearkened unto me. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-17.htm">Jeremiah 35:17</a>. Therefore, thus saith Jahveh, the God of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will bring upon Judah and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the evil which I have uttered regarding them, because I spake unto them and they did not hear, and I called unto them, but they did not answer. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-18.htm">Jeremiah 35:18</a>. And to the house of the Rechabites Jeremiah said: Thus saith Jahveh of hosts, the God of Israel, Because ye have listened to the command of Jonadab your father, and have kept all his commandments, and have done according to all that he commanded you, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-19.htm">Jeremiah 35:19</a>. Therefore, thus saith Jahveh of hosts, the God of Israel, Jonadab the son of Rechab shall not want a man to stand before me for ever."<p>The command, "Go and speak to the men of Judah," etc., shows that it was not in the chamber of the temple, in presence of the Rechabites, but probably in one of the temple fore-courts, that Jeremiah addressed the following word of the Lord to the people assembled there. In order to shame the Jews thoroughly, he shows them the faithfulness with which the Rechabites observe the ordinances of their ancestor Jonadab. The character of the address, as one intended to rouse feelings of shame, is indicated even at the beginning of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-13.htm">Jeremiah 35:13</a> : "Will ye not receive instruction by hearkening to the words of the Lord?" The Hoph. &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1511;&#1501; is construed as a passive with the accus.; in the older writers we frequently find this construction, in which the passive is used impersonally, hence the sing. is here employed: cf. Ges. 143, 1, Ew. 295, b. "To this day" - now for nearly 300 years without interruption; for Jonadab was already held in high esteem when Jehu ascended the throne, 883 b.c. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-15.htm">2 Kings 10:15</a>). Judah, on the contrary, does not listen to the commandments which his God unceasingly inculcates on him, but rather wanders after other gods, to serve them. On <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-15.htm">Jeremiah 35:15</a> cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-4.htm">Jeremiah 25:4-5</a>. &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1488;&#1491;&#1502;&#1492; stands for &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1488;&#1491;&#1502;&#1492; , <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-5.htm">Jeremiah 25:5</a>. - In <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-16.htm">Jeremiah 35:16</a>, where the introductory &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, imo, indicates a culmination, the idea is once more briefly expressed. Ngelsbach incorrectly renders &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; "because," and makes <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-16.htm">Jeremiah 35:16</a> the protasis to <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-17.htm">Jeremiah 35:17</a>. "Such a protasis with because (quia), without any connection with what precedes, is contrary to the use of language" (Hitzig). On the threat of punishment in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-17.htm">Jeremiah 35:17</a>, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-11.htm">Jeremiah 11:11</a>. </body></html>
