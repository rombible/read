It was in November or December, and, as glass windows were unknown, a charcoal fire, placed after the Eastern fashion in a brazier, or earthen pot, in the middle of the room, was a necessity. So we find a fire in the court of the high priest’s palace in the raw early morning of a Passover in March or April (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-18.htm" title="And the servants and officers stood there, who had made a fire of coals; for it was cold: and they warmed themselves: and Peter stood with them, and warmed himself.">John 18:18</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/jeremiah/36.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-22.htm" title="Now the king sat in the winter house in the ninth month: and there was a fire on the hearth burning before him.">Jeremiah 36:22</a></span>. <span class="ital">Now the king sat in the winter-house </span>— The princes and great men had distinct houses, or apartments, fitted for the several seasons of the year, <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/3-15.htm" title="And I will smite the winter house with the summer house; and the houses of ivory shall perish, and the great houses shall have an end, said the LORD.">Amos 3:15</a>. <span class="ital">In the ninth month </span>— Which answers to the latter end of our November and part of December. <span class="ital">And there was a fire on the hearth burning before him </span>— Hebrew, <span class="greekheb">יאת האח לפניו מבערת</span>, <span class="ital">et focus coram ipso ardebat, </span>Buxtorff: literally, <span class="ital">And a hearth, </span>or, <span class="ital">fire-pan was burning before him. </span>Thus the LXX., <span class="greekheb">και εσγαρα πυρος κατα</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">προσωπον αυτου</span>: <span class="ital">and a pan of fire before him. </span>To the same purpose the Vulgate, <span class="ital">et posita erat arula coram eo plena prunis, There was set before him a little altar, or fire-pan, full of burning coals. </span>The reason of this phraseology we have in the account which Lightfoot gives us from Maimonides, namely, that chimneys were not admitted at Jerusalem by reason of the smoke. And Mr. Harmer tells us, (chap. 3. obs. 24,) that Sir John Chardin, in his MS. notes, supposes that the fire which was burning before Jehoiakim was <span class="ital">a pan of coals; </span>and cites a passage from him, which says, in French, “This was just as persons of quality warm themselves in winter in Persia, and particularly in Media, and wherever there is no want of wood. The manner in which they sit will not allow them to be near a chimney: in these places, therefore, of the East, they have great brasiers of lighted coals.” Harmer likewise informs us, that “the fires used at Aleppo, in the lodging rooms, are of <span class="ital">charcoal in pans; </span>and that pans of coals are the fires which are often made use of in winter in Egypt.” It may be observed further here, that this description of Jehoiakim sitting in his winter-house, in the ninth month, with a pan of fire before him, answers to Dr. Russel’s account, who says, that the most delicate in those countries make no fires till the end of November. How long they continue the use of them he does not say: but we learn from other sources, that in Judea they are continued far into the spring: see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-18.htm" title="And the servants and officers stood there, who had made a fire of coals; for it was cold: and they warmed themselves: and Peter stood with them, and warmed himself.">John 18:18</a>.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/36.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>36:20-32 Those who despise the word of God, will soon show, as this king did, that they hate it; and, like him, they would wish it destroyed.

The month Cisleu, which answers to part of November, and part of December; and so was the midst of winter, and a proper time for the king to be in his winter house; though, as this was a fast day, it would have been more proper for him to have been at the worship of God in the temple, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-9.htm">Jeremiah 36:9</a>. This winter house probably was a winter parlour, as distinguished from a summer parlour, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-20.htm">Judges 3:20</a>; and both might be under the same roof, or parts of the same house; only the one might be more airy and cool, and the other more close and warm. Kings had their summer and winter houses; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/3-15.htm">Amos 3:15</a>; this circumstance is mentioned for the sake of what follows, the burning of the roll; and accounts for there being a fire at hand to do it: <p>and there was a fire on the hearth burning before him; there was a stove, or some such vessel or instrument, in which a large fire of wood was made, at which the king sat to keep himself warm while the roll was reading, and about which the princes stood. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/36.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Now the king sat in the winterhouse in the <span class="cverse3">{l}</span> ninth month: and <i>there was a fire</i> on the hearth burning before him.</span><p>(l) Which contained part of November and part of December.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/36.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">22</span>. <span class="ital">in the winter house</span>] See on <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-9.htm" title="And it came to pass in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, in the ninth month, that they proclaimed a fast before the LORD to all the people in Jerusalem, and to all the people that came from the cities of Judah to Jerusalem.">Jeremiah 36:9</a></span>.

Amos (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-15.htm" title="And I will give you pastors according to my heart, which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding.">Jeremiah 3:15</a>) mentions both winter and summer houses. “In common parlance the lower apartments are simply <span class="ital">el beit</span>—the house; the upper is the <span class="ital">ullîyeh</span>, which is the summer house. Every respectable dwelling has both.… If these are on the same storey, then the external and airy apartment is the summer <span class="ital">house</span>, and that for winter is the interior and more sheltered room.

The change of one Hebrew consonant gives us the right sense.

According to Dr. Thomson ('The Land and the Book,' p. 309), the more airy part of a house is called "summerhouse," and the more sheltered room "winter house." The ninth month, in which the events now being related took place, corresponded approximately to our December. It was, therefore, the cold and rainy season; December is a stormy month in Palestine. <span class="cmt_word">A fire on the hearth;</span> rather, <span class="accented">in the chafing dish</span> (or, <span class="accented">brazier</span>).

But when they heard all the words read, "they were afraid one at another;" i.e., by looks, gestures, and words, they gave mutual expression of their fear, partly because of the contents of what had been read. Although they were generally acquainted with the sense and the spirit of Jeremiah's addresses, yet what had now been read made a powerful impression on them; for Baruch plainly had read, both to the people in the temple and to the princes, not the whole book, but only the main portions, containing the sternest denunciations of sin and the strongest threats of punishment. The statement, "he read in (out of) the book the words of Jeremiah" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-10.htm">Jeremiah 36:10</a>), does not mean that he read the whole book; this would only have wearied the people and weakened the impression made. But they were partly also terrified, perhaps, by the boldness of a declaration which so decidedly opposed the desires and hopes of the king; for the thought of the event mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-20.htm">Jeremiah 26:20</a>. would at once suggest to them the danger that might arise to the live of Jeremiah and Baruch from the despotic character of the king. They said therefore to Baruch, "We must tell the king all these things." For it was clear that the matter could not long remain concealed from the king, after the public reading in the temple. Hence they dared not, agreeably to their official relation to the king, hide from him what had taken place.</body></html>
