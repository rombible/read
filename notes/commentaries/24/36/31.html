See what enmity there is against God in the carnal mind, and wonder at his patience. The princes showed some concern, till they saw how light the king made of it.

So hardened was the king, that he and his servants neither were terrified by the threatenings of the prophet, nor felt deep sorrow, as Josiah did in a similar case (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-11.htm">2 Kings 22:11</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-27.htm">1 Kings 21:27</a>), nor did they listen to the earnest representations of the princes. &#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1497;&#1493; are the court-attendants of the king in contrast with the princes, who, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-16.htm">Jeremiah 36:16</a>, had been alarmed by what they heard read, and wished, by entreaties, to keep the king from the commission of such a wicked act as the destruction of the book.
