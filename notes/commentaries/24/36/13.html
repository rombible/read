The princes patiently attended the reading of the whole book. They were in great fear. But even those who are convinced to the truth and importance of what they hear, and are disposed to favour those who preach it, often have difficulties and reserves about their safety, interest, or preferment, so that they do not act according to their convictions, and try to get rid of what they find troublesome.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/36.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The scribe's chamber - The chancery in which the king's business was conducted.

Baruch, who is mentioned so early as <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-12.htm">Jeremiah 32:12</a>. as the attendant of the prophet, was, according to the passage now before us, his amanuensis, and executed his commissions. &#1488;&#1504;&#1497; &#1506;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-1.htm">Jeremiah 33:1</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-15.htm">Jeremiah 39:15</a>, might mean, "I am in prison;" but this does not accord with the request of the princes, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-19.htm">Jeremiah 36:19</a>, that Jeremiah should hide himself. Moreover, &#1506;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; does not mean "seized, captus," but "stopped, restrained, hindered;" see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/6-10.htm">Nehemiah 6:10</a>. The cause of hindrance is not mentioned, as being away from the purpose of the narrative. "To read in the roll in the ears of the people," i.e., to read to the people out of the book. &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493;&#1501; &#1510;&#1493;&#1501; does not mean "on any fast-day whatever," but, "on the fast-day." The article is omitted because there was no need for defining the fast-day more exactly. The special fast-day mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-9.htm">Jeremiah 36:9</a> is intended. '&#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1500; &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1504;&#1468;&#1514;&#1501; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;, "their supplication will fall down before the Lord," i.e., reach unto God, as if it were laid before His feet. &#1504;&#1508;&#1500; is transferred from the posture of the suppliant - his falling down before God - to his supplication. Hence, in Hiphil, to make the supplication fall down before the Lord is equivalent to laying the request at His feet; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-26.htm">Jeremiah 38:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/42-9.htm">Jeremiah 42:9</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/9-18.htm">Daniel 9:18</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-20.htm">Daniel 9:20</a>. If the supplication actually comes before God, it is also heard and finds success. This success is pointed out in '&#1493;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;, "that they may repent." If man, in a repentant spirit, supplicates God for grace, God grants him power for conversion. But the return of the people from their wicked way is indispensable, because the wrath which God has expressed concerning it is great, i.e., because God has threatened a heavy judgment of wrath. </body></html>
