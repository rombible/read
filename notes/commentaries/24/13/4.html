It has been suggested (1) that the word means “river” generally, or “rushing water,” applied by way of pre-eminence to the “great river” and therefore that it may have been used here in its general sense; and (2) that it may stand here for Ephratah, or Bethlehem, as the scene of Jeremiah’s symbolic actions, the place being chosen on account of its suggestive likeness to Euphrates. These conjectures, however, have no other basis than the assumed improbability of a double journey of two hundred and fifty miles, and this, as has been shown, can hardly be weighed as a serious element in the question. In Jeremiah 51 there can be no doubt that the writer means Euphrates. It may be noted, too, as a coincidence confirming this view, that Jeremiah appears as personally known to Nebuchadnezzar in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-11.htm" title="Now Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon gave charge concerning Jeremiah to Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, saying,">Jeremiah 39:11</a>. Those who make Ephratah the scene of what is here recorded, point to the caves and clefts in the rocky region between Bethlehem and the Dead Sea as agreeing with the description. On the other hand, the form <span class= "ital">Prath </span>is nowhere found as substituted for the familiar Ephratah.<p><span class= "bld">A hole of the rock.</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">cleft. </span>In the lower part of its course the Euphrates flows through an alluvial plain, and the words point therefore to some part of its upper course above Pylæ, where its course is through a valley more or less rocky.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/jeremiah/13.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-4.htm" title="Take the girdle that you have got, which is on your loins, and arise, go to Euphrates, and hide it there in a hole of the rock.">Jeremiah 13:4</a></span>. <span class="ital">Arise, go to Euphrates </span>— God commanded the prophet to go and hide the girdle on the bank of the Euphrates, to signify that the Jews should be carried captive over that river, called <span class="ital">the waters of Babylon, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/137-1.htm" title="By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yes, we wept, when we remembered Zion.">Psalm 137:1</a>. In the margin of our ancient English Bibles, it is observed, that, “because this river Perath, or Euphrates, was far from Jerusalem, it is evident that this was done in a vision.” And the generality of the best commentators have been of this opinion; it not being probable that the prophet should have been sent twice upon a journey of such considerable length and difficulty, to the very great loss of his time, merely upon the errands here mentioned, namely, to carry the girdle to the Euphrates, and to fetch it back, when, it seems, every purpose would have been answered altogether as well if the transaction had been represented in vision. Several things, it must be observed, are related in Scripture as actually done, which yet were certainly only performed in visions. One instance we have <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/25-15.htm" title="For thus said the LORD God of Israel to me; Take the wine cup of this fury at my hand, and cause all the nations, to whom I send you, to drink it....">Jeremiah 25:15-29</a>, where Jeremiah is commanded to take a cup of wine in his hand, and to cause several kings and nations, there enumerated, to drink of it: for it would be a perfect absurdity to believe that he actually went round to all those kings and nations, and made them drink of the contents of his cup. And yet he makes no more distinction in this latter case, than in that now before us, between mental and bodily action. Another remarkable instance we have <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-5.htm" title="And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if you be able to number them: and he said to him, So shall your seed be.">Genesis 15:5</a>, where the text says, that God <span class="ital">brought Abraham forth abroad, </span>and bid him <span class="ital">tell the stars; </span>and yet it appears, by a subsequent verse, that the sun was not then gone down. Indeed, in all these cases, and in many more that might be mentioned of a similar kind, it made no difference as to the end God had in view, whether the transactions related were visionary or real; for either way they served equally to represent the events which it was God’s pleasure to make known.

And we have the explanation, ver. 9-11. The people of Israel had been to God as this girdle. He caused them to cleave to him by the law he gave them, the prophets he sent among them, and the favours he showed them. They had by their idolatries and sins buried themselves in foreign earth, mingled among the nations, and were so corrupted that they were good for nothing. If we are proud of learning, power, and outward privileges, it is just with God to wither them. The minds of men should be awakened to a sense of their guilt and danger; yet nothing will be effectual without the influences of the Spirit.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In a hole of the rock - "In a cleft of the rock."

Euphrates&#8212;In order to support the view that Jeremiah's act was outward, Henderson considers that the Hebrew Phrath here is Ephratha, the original name of Beth-lehem, six miles south of Jerusalem, a journey easy to be made by Jeremiah. The non-addition of the word "river," which usually precedes Phrath, when meaning Euphrates, favors this view. But I prefer English Version. The Euphrates is specified as being near Babylon, the Jews future place of exile.<p>hole&#8212;typical of the prisons in which the Jews were to be confined.<p>the rock&#8212;some well-known rock. A sterile region, such as was that to which the Jews were led away (compare Isa 7:19) [Grotius].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> God having commanded the prophet to procure such a girdle as was before mentioned, and to tie it upon his loins, he a second time comes to him, and commandeth him to take this girdle, and carry it to Euphrates. This was one of the four great rivers that the river out of the garden of Eden divided itself into, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-10.htm" title="And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from there it was parted, and became into four heads.">Genesis 2:10</a>,14</span>.

Reuben’s lot was bounded by it. The prophet was commanded to hide his girdle in the <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">hole</span> of a <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">rock</span> in that river. But why there? Were there not other places nearer where the prophet might have hid it? It is judged by some that this command was also to signify unto them that they should be carried out of their own borders into captivity; or rather, that they had corrupted, and were become rotten, by doing after the fashions and manners of the heathens, who lived on the other side of Euphrates always, but having (a hundred years before this) captivated the ten tribes, lived also on this side of it. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/13.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Take the girdle which thou hast got, which is upon thy loins,....

A long interval elapses, and he is commanded to make a second journey to the same place, and fetch away the apron. What does this <span class="accented">P'rath</span> mean? It is by no means easy to decide. Hardly "the Euphrates," <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> because the common prefix, "the river," is wanting, though in so extraordinary a narrative it was peculiarly needed; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> because of the length of the journey to Babylonia, which has ex hyp. to be made twice; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> because the Euphrates is not a rocky river. Ewald suggested that "some wet place near Jerusalem" probably had the name of <span class="accented">P'rath</span>, and indicates a valley and spring called Forah, about six English miles north-east of Jerusalem. Mr. Birch appears to have hit independently on the same spot, which he identifies with the Parah of <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-23.htm">Joshua 18:23</a>, about three miles north-east of Anatbeth, and describes as a picturesque gorge between savage rocks, with a copious stream (<span class="accented">Quarterly Statement of the Palestine Exploration Fund</span>, October, 1880, p. 236). This combination, however, involves an emendation of the text (<span class="accented">P'rath</span> into <span class="accented">Parah</span>) <span class="accented">- logically</span> it involves this, as Mr. Birch has seen; Ewald's comparison of the Arabic <span class="accented">furat</span>, sweet water, seems inconsistent with his reference to Parah - for which there does not seem to be sufficient necessity; and it is better to adopt the view of the great old French Protestant scholar, Bochart, that <span class="accented">P'rath</span> is a shortened form of Ephrath, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> at once Bethlehem and the district in which Bethlehem lay (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-50.htm">1 Chronicles 2:50</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-4.htm">1 Chronicles 4:4</a>; and perhaps <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/132-6.htm">Psalm 132:6</a>). It need hardly be said that the limestone hills of this region afforded abundance of secluded rocks. There may, of course, be at the same time an allusion to the ordinary meaning of <span class="accented">P'rath</span>, viz. Euphrates, on the analogy of the allusion in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/27-12.htm">Isaiah 27:12</a>. Those who hold the view here rejected, that <span class="accented">P'rath is</span> equivalent to the Euphrates, sometimes suppose that the narrative is a parable or symbolical fiction, such as Luther, Calvin, and others find in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/1.htm">Hosea 1, 3</a>, the thing signified being in this case the carrying captive of the people to Babylon; and this seems the best way of making this interpretation plausible. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/12.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The spoilers of the Lord's heritage are also to be carried off out of their land; but after they, like Judah, have been punished, the Lord will have pity on them, and will bring them back one and all into their own land. And if the heathen, who now seduce the people of God to idolatry, learn the ways of God's people and be converted to the Lord, they shall receive citizenship amongst God's people and be built up amongst them; but if they will not do so, they shall be extirpated. Thus will the Lord manifest Himself before the whole earth as righteous judge, and through judgment secure the weal not only of Israel, but of the heathen peoples too. By this discovery of His world-plan the Lord makes so complete a reply to the prophet's murmuring concerning the prosperity of the ungodly (<a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-1.htm">Jeremiah 12:1-6</a>), that from it may clearly be seen the justice of God's government on earth. Viewed thus, both strophes of the passage before us (<a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-7.htm">Jeremiah 12:7-17</a>) connect themselves singularly well with <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-1.htm">Jeremiah 12:1-6</a>.<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-14.htm">Jeremiah 12:14-15</a><p>The evil neighbours that lay hands on Jahve's heritage are the neighbouring heathen nations, the Edomites, Moabites, Ammonites, Philistines, and Syrians. It does not, however, follow that this threatening has special reference to the event related in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-2.htm">2 Kings 24:2</a>, and that it belongs to the time of Jehoiakim. These nations were always endeavouring to assault Israel, and made use of every opportunity that seemed favourable for waging war against them and subjugating them; and not for the first time during the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, at which time it was indeed that they suffered the punishment here pronounced, of being carried away into exile. The neighbours are brought up here simply as representatives of the heathen nations, and what is said of them is true for all the heathen. The transition to the first person in &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1504;&#1497; is like that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-15.htm">Jeremiah 14:15</a>. Jahveh is possessor of the land of Israel, and so the adjoining peoples are His neighbours. &#1504;&#1490;&#1506; &#1489;, to touch as an enemy, to attack, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/2-12.htm">Zechariah 2:12</a>. I pluck the house of Judah out of their midst, i.e., the midst of the evil neighbours. This is understood by most commentators of the carrying of Judah into captivity, since &#1504;&#1514;&#1513;&#1473; cannot be taken in two different senses in the two corresponding clauses. For this word used of deportation, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-15.htm">1 Kings 14:15</a>. "Them," <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-15.htm">Jeremiah 12:15</a>, refers to the heathen peoples. After they have been carried forth of their land and have received their punishment, the Lord will again have compassion upon them, and will bring back each to its inheritance, its land. Here the restoration of Judah, the people of God, is assumed as a thing of course (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-16.htm">Jeremiah 12:16</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-37.htm">Jeremiah 32:37</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-44.htm">Jeremiah 32:44</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-26.htm">Jeremiah 33:26</a>).</body></html>
