Their sorrows would be great indeed. Do they ask, Wherefore come these things upon us? Let them know, it is for their obstinacy in sin. We cannot alter the natural colour of the skin; and so is it morally impossible to reclaim and reform these people. Sin is the blackness of the soul; it is the discolouring of it; we were shapen in it, so that we cannot get clear of it by any power of our own. But Almighty grace is able to change the Ethiopian's skin. Neither natural depravity, nor strong habits of sin, form an obstacle to the working of God, the new-creating Spirit. The Lord asks of Jerusalem, whether she is determined not be made clean. If any poor slave of sin feels that he could as soon change his nature as master his headstrong lusts, let him not despair; for things impossible to men are possible with God.

And his mother's name was Zebudah, the daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah.">2 Kings 23:36</a>). Most however take the utterance as belonging to the three months’ reign of his successor, Jehoiachin, whose mother, Nehushta, is referred to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-8.htm" title="Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem three months.

For the fulfillment, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-15.htm">2 Kings 24:15</a>. After a reign of three months, the young prince and his mother were carried to Babylon. <span class="cmt_word">And to the queen</span>; rather, <span class="accented">and to the queen-mother</span> (literally, <span class="accented">the mistress</span>). It will be noticed that, except in two cases, the names of the mothers of the reigning kings of Judah are scrupulously mentioned in the Books of Kings. This and the title of "mistress" are indications of the high rank they enjoyed in the social system. In the case of Asa, we are told that he removed his mother, Maachah, from her position as "mistress," or queen-mother, on account of her idolatry (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-13.htm">1 Kings 15:13</a>). The political value of the station is strikingly shown by the ease with which Athaliah, as queen-mother, usurped the supreme authority (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11.htm">2 Kings 11</a>.). From an historical point of view, the "queen-mother" of the Jews is a most interesting personage; she is a relic of the primitive age in which relationship was reckoned with regard to the mother (so with the Accadians, Etruseans, Finns, etc.). It should be added, however, that once (viz. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-19.htm">1 Kings 11:19</a>) the same title, "mistress," is applied to the queen-consort. <span class="cmt_word">Humble yourselves, sit down</span>; rather, <span class="accented">sit down in abase</span>-sent; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> take the station suitable for your abased circumstances (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/47-1.htm">Isaiah 47:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Your principalities</span>; rather, <span class="accented">your</span> <span class="accented">head</span>. <span class="accented">ornaments</span>. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/13.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>How the Lord will destroy His degenerate people, and how they may yet escape the impending ruin. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-12.htm">Jeremiah 13:12</a>. "And speak unto them this word: Thus hath Jahveh the God of Israel said, Every jar is filled with wine. And when they say to thee, Know we not that every jar is filled with wine? <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-13.htm">Jeremiah 13:13</a>.

And dash them one against another, the fathers and the sons together, saith Jahve; I will not spare, nor pity, nor have mercy, not to destroy them. -  <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-15.htm">Jeremiah 13:15</a>.

But if ye hear it not, then in concealment shall my soul weep for the pride, and weep and run down shall mine eye with tears, because the flock of Jahve is carried away captive."<p>To give emphasis to the threatening conveyed in the symbolical action, the kind and manner of the destruction awaiting them is forcibly set before the various ranks in Judah and Jerusalem by the interpretation, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-12.htm">Jeremiah 13:12-14</a>, of a proverbial saying and the application of it to them. The circumstantial way in which the figurative saying is brought in in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-12.htm">Jeremiah 13:12</a>, is designed to call attention to its import. &#1504;&#1489;&#1500;, an earthenware vessel, especially the wine jar (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-24.htm">Isaiah 30:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-2.htm">Lamentations 4:2</a>), is here the emblem of man; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-6.htm">Jeremiah 18:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-16.htm">Isaiah 29:16</a>. We must not, as Ng. does, suppose the similar to be used because such jars are an excellent emblem of that carnal aristocratic pride which lacked all substantial merit, by reason of their being of bulging shape, hollow within and without solidity, and of fragile material besides. No stress is laid on the bulging form and hollowness of the jars, but only on their fulness with wine and their brittleness. Nor can aristocratic haughtiness be predicated of all the inhabitants of the land. The saying: Every jar is filled with wine, seemed so plain and natural, that those addressed answer: Of that we are well aware. "The answer is that of the psychical man, who dreams of no deeper sense" (Hitz.). Just this very answer gives the prophet occasion to expound the deeper meaning of this word of God's. As one fills all wine jars, so must all inhabitants of the land be filled by God with wine of intoxication. Drunkenness is the effect of the intoxicating wine of God's wrath, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/60-5.htm">Psalm 60:5</a>. This wine Jahveh will give them (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-15.htm">Jeremiah 25:15</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-17.htm">Isaiah 51:17</a>, etc.), so that, filled with drunken frenzy, they shall helplessly destroy one another. This spirit will seize upon all ranks: upon the kings who sit upon the throne of David, not merely him who was reigning at the time; upon the priests and prophets as leaders of the people; and upon all inhabitants of Jerusalem, the metropolis, the spirit and temper of which exercises an unlimited influence upon the temper and destiny of the kingdom at large. I dash them one against the other, as jars are shivered when knocked together. Here Hitz. finds a foreshadowing of civil war, by which they should exterminate one another. Jeremiah was indeed thinking of the staggering against one another of drunken men, but in "dash them," etc., adhered simply to the figure of jars or pots. But what can be meant by the shivering of pots knocked together, other than mutual destruction? The kingdom of Judah did not indeed fall by civil war; but who can deny that the fury of the various factions in Judah and Jerusalem did really contribute to the fall of the realm? The shattering of the pots does not mean directly civil war; it is given as the result of the drunkenness of the inhabitants, under which they, no longer capable of self-control, dash against and so destroy one another. But besides, the breaking of jars reminds us of the stratagem of Gideon and his 300 warriors, who, by the sound of trumpets and the smashing of jars, threw the whole Midianite camp into such panic, that these foes turned their swords against one another and fled in wild confusion: <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/7-19.htm">Judges 7:19</a>., cf. too <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-20.htm">1 Samuel 14:20</a>. Thus shall Judah be broken without mercy or pity. To increase the emphasis, there is a cumulation of expressions, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-7.htm">Jeremiah 21:7</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-5.htm">Jeremiah 15:5</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-11.htm">Ezekiel 5:11</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-4.htm">Ezekiel 7:4</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-9.htm">Ezekiel 7:9</a>, etc. </body></html>
