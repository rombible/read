Their sorrows would be great indeed. Do they ask, Wherefore come these things upon us? Let them know, it is for their obstinacy in sin. We cannot alter the natural colour of the skin; and so is it morally impossible to reclaim and reform these people. Sin is the blackness of the soul; it is the discolouring of it; we were shapen in it, so that we cannot get clear of it by any power of our own. But Almighty grace is able to change the Ethiopian's skin. Neither natural depravity, nor strong habits of sin, form an obstacle to the working of God, the new-creating Spirit. The Lord asks of Jerusalem, whether she is determined not be made clean. If any poor slave of sin feels that he could as soon change his nature as master his headstrong lusts, let him not despair; for things impossible to men are possible with God. Let us then seek help from Him who is mighty to save.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And thine abominations - "Even thy abominations."

He concludes with pathetical interrogations, intimating that yet there was hope if they would reform; and though. giving over their case almost as desperate, and not knowing what would not be, yet he leaves no means untried, but asks them if it was not yet time, or when such a thing might be hoped for at their hands. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/13.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>I have seen thine adulteries,.... Not literally such, though they were greatly guilty of that sin; but figuratively, their idolatries: <p>thy neighings; expressive of their strong desires after other gods, like that of adulterers and adulteresses after one another; and both which are like the neighing of horses.

Woe unto thee, Jerusalem! thou shalt not be made clean after how long a time yet!"<p>From <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-18.htm">Jeremiah 13:18</a> on the prophet's discourse is addressed to the king and the queen-mother. The latter as such exercised great influence on the government, and is in the Books of Kings mentioned alongside of almost all the reigning kings (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-13.htm">1 Kings 15:13</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-13.htm">2 Kings 10:13</a>, etc.); so that we are not necessarily led to think of Jechoniah and his mother in especial. To them he proclaims the loss of the crown and the captivity of Judah. Set yourselves low down (cf. Gesen. 142, 3, b), i.e., descend from the throne; not in order to turn aside the threatening danger by humiliation, but, as the reason that follows show, because the kingdom is passing from you. For fallen is &#1502;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501;, your head-gear, lit., what is about or on your head (elsewhere pointed &#1502;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1514;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-13.htm">1 Samuel 19:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/26-7.htm">1 Samuel 26:7</a>), namely, your splendid crown. The perf. here is prophetic. The crown falls when the king loses country and kingship. This is put expressly in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-19.htm">Jeremiah 13:19</a>. The meaning of the first half of the verse, which is variously taken, may be gathered from the second. In the latter the complete deportation of Judah is spoken of as an accomplished fact, because it is as sure to happen as if it had taken place already. Accordingly the first clause cannot bespeak expectation merely, or be understood, as it is by Grotius, as meaning that Judah need hope for no help from Egypt. This interpretation is irreconcilable with "the cities of the south." "The south" is the south country of Judah, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-40.htm">Joshua 10:40</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/13-1.htm">Genesis 13:1</a>, etc., and is not to be taken according to the prophetic use of "king of the south," <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/11-5.htm">Daniel 11:5</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/11-9.htm">Daniel 11:9</a>. The shutting of the cities is not to be taken, with Jerome, as siege by the enemy, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/6-1.htm">Joshua 6:1</a>. There the closedness is otherwise illustrated: No man was going out or in; here, on the other hand, it is: No man openeth. "Shut" is to be explained according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-10.htm">Isaiah 24:10</a> : the cities are shut up by reason of ruins which block up the entrances to them; and in them is none that can open, because all Judah is utterly carried away. The cities of the south are mentioned, not because the enemy, avoiding the capital, had first brought the southern part of the land under his power, as Sennacherib had once advanced against Jerusalem from the south, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-13.htm">2 Kings 18:13</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-8.htm">Jeremiah 19:8</a> (Graf, Ng., etc.), but because they were the part of the kingdom most remote for an enemy approaching from the north; so that when they were taken, the land was reduced and the captivity of all Judah accomplished. For the form &#1492;&#1490;&#1500;&#1514; see Ew. 194, a, Ges. 75, Rem. 1. &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; is adverbial accusative: in entirety, like &#1502;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/58-2.htm">Psalm 58:2</a>, etc. For this cf. &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/1-6.htm">Amos 1:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-9.htm">Amos 1:9</a>.<p>The announcement of captivity is carried on in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-20.htm">Jeremiah 13:20</a>, where we have first an account of the impression which the carrying away captive will produce upon Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-20.htm">Jeremiah 13:20</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-21.htm">Jeremiah 13:21</a>), and next a statement of the cause of that judgment (<a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-22.htm">Jeremiah 13:22-27</a>). In &#1513;&#1474;&#1488;&#1497; and &#1512;&#1488;&#1497; a feminine is addressed, and, as appears from the suffix in &#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501;, one which is collective. The same holds good of the following verses on to <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-27.htm">Jeremiah 13:27</a>, where Jerusalem is named, doubtless the inhabitants of it, personified as the daughter of Zion - a frequent case. Ng. is wrong in supposing that the feminines in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-20.htm">Jeremiah 13:20</a> are called for by the previously mentioned queen-mother, that <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-20.htm">Jeremiah 13:20-22</a> are still addressed to her, and that not till <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-23.htm">Jeremiah 13:23</a> is there a transition from her in the address to the nation taken collectively and regarded as the mother of the country. The contents of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-20.htm">Jeremiah 13:20</a> do not tally with Ng.'s view; for the queen-mother was not the reigning sovereign, so that the inhabitants of the land could have been called her flock, however great was the influence she might exercise upon the king. The mention of foes coming from the north, and the question coupled therewith: Where is the flock? convey the thought that the flock is carried off by those enemies. The flock is the flock of Jahveh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-17.htm">Jeremiah 13:17</a>), and, in virtue of God's choice of it, a herd of gloriousness. The relative clause: "that was given thee," implies that the person addressed is to be regarded as the shepherd or owner of the flock. This will not apply to the capital and its citizens; for the influence exerted by the capital in the country is not so great as to make it appear the shepherd or lord of the people. But the relative clause is in good keeping with the idea of the idea of the daughter of Zion, with which is readily associated that of ruler of land and people. It intimates the suffering that will be endured by the daughter of Zion when those who have been hitherto her paramours are set up as head over her. The verse is variously explained. The old transll. and comm. take &#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1491; &#1506;&#1500; in the sense of visit, chastise; so too Chr. B. Mich. and Ros.; and Ew. besides, who alters the text acc. to the lxx, changing &#1497;&#1508;&#1511;&#1491; into the plural &#1497;&#1508;&#1511;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;. For this change there is no sufficient reason; and without such change, the signif. visit, punish, gives us no suitable sense. The phrase means also: to appoint or set over anybody; cf. e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-3.htm">Jeremiah 15:3</a>. The subject can only be Jahveh. The words from &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1468; onwards form an adversative circumstantial clause: and yet thou hast accustomed them &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1498;, for &#1488;&#1500;&#1497;&#1498; rof ,, to thee (cf. for &#1500;&#1502;&#1468;&#1491; c. &#1488;&#1500;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-2.htm">Jeremiah 10:2</a>). The connection of the words &#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1508;&#1497;&#1501; &#1500;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; depends upon the sig. assigned to &#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1508;&#1497;&#1501;. Gesen. (thes.) and Ros. still adhere to the meaning taken by Luther, Vat., and many others, viz., principes, princes, taking for the sense of the whole: whom thou hast accustomed (trained) to be princes over thee. This word is indeed the technical term for the old Edomitish chieftains of clans, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/36-15.htm">Genesis 36:15</a>., and is applied as an archaic term by <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/9-7.htm">Zechariah 9:7</a> to the tribal princes of Judah; but it does not, as a general rule, mean prince, but familiar, friend, Ps. 655:14, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-28.htm">Proverbs 16:28</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/7-5.htm">Micah 7:5</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-19.htm">Jeremiah 11:19</a>. This being the well-attested signification, it is, in the first place, not competent to render &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1498; over or against thee (adversus te, Jerome); and Hitz.'s exposition: thou hast instructed them to thy hurt, hast taught them a disposition hostile to thee, cannot be justified by usage. In the second place, &#1488;&#1500;&#1508;&#1497;&#1501; cannot be attached to the principal clause, "set over thee," and joined with "for a head:" if He set over thee - as princes for a head; but it belongs to "hast accustomed," while only "for a head" goes with "if He set" (as de Wet., Umbr., Ng., etc., construe). The prophet means the heathen kings, for whose favour Judah had hitherto been intriguing, the Babylonians and Egyptians. There is no cogent reason for referring the words, as many comm. do, to the Babylonians alone. For the statement is quite general throughout; and, on the one hand, Judah had, from the days of Ahaz on, courted the alliance not of the Babylonians alone, but of the Egyptians too (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-18.htm">Jeremiah 2:18</a>); and, on the other hand, after the death of Josiah, Judah had become subject to Egypt, and had had to endure the grievous domination of the Pharaohs, as Jeremiah had threatened, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-16.htm">Jeremiah 2:16</a>. If God deliver the daughter of Zion into the power of these her paramours, i.e., if she be subjected to their rule, then will grief and pain seize on her as on a woman in childbirth; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-24.htm">Jeremiah 6:24</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-23.htm">Jeremiah 22:23</a>, etc. &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514; &#1500;&#1491;&#1492;, woman of bearing; so here, only, elsewhere &#1497;&#1493;&#1500;&#1491;&#1492; (cf. the passages cited); &#1500;&#1491;&#1492; is infin., as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-3.htm">Isaiah 37:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-3.htm">2 Kings 19:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-11.htm">Hosea 9:11</a>. </body></html>
