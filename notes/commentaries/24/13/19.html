Or, as some think, the cities of Egypt are intended, from whence the Jews expected succour. These should fail them, and they should find no access to them. <span class="ital">Lift up your eyes, </span>&c. — He speaks as if their enemies were even then upon their march, nay, so near, that if they did but lift up their eyes and look, they might see them coming. <span class="ital">Where is the flock that was given thee? </span>— He streaks to the king, representing him under the idea of a shepherd, and the people under that of a flock. Or rather, as the pronouns are feminine, he addresses the daughter of Judah, that is, the city or state. “What wilt thou say, when the Lord shall demand of thee an account of the people committed to thy trust? What wilt thou answer when the sovereign monarch shall see dissipated, diminished, weakened, destroyed, <span class="ital">thy beautiful flock,” </span>or, as <span class="greekheb">צאן תפארתךְ</span>rather signifies, <span class="ital">the flock of thy glory. In the multitude of people, </span>says Solomon, <span class="ital">is the king’s honour. What wilt thou say when he shall punish thee? — </span>Thou wilt have nothing to say, but be wholly confounded, when God shall visit thee by this sore judgment. Or, when Nebuchadnezzar’s army, sent by God, shall visit thee. <span class="ital">For thou hast taught them to be captains, </span>&c. — Houbigant renders it, “Since thou hast made them expert against thee, and hast drawn them upon thine own head;” and Blaney, more literally, “Seeing it is thou that teachest them to be rulers in chief over thee.” “Thou hast frequently called them to thy succour, and taught them the way to thy country, whereof they dreamed not before; and not only thus, but by accumulating crimes upon crimes, and filling up the measure of thine iniquity, thou hast drawn down the vengeance of heaven, and put thyself in the power of the Chaldeans.” See Calmet. Some have understood the alliances, contracted heretofore with the Assyrians by Ahaz, and the conduct of Hezekiah toward the ambassadors of the king of Babylon, to be here alluded to. “But I rather think,” says Blaney, “that the wicked manners of the people are principally designed; which put them out of the protection of Almighty God, and rendered them an easy conquest to any enemy that came against them. Thus they taught their enemies to oppress, and to be lords over them; against whom, but for their own faults, they might have maintained their security and independence.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/13.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>13:18-27 Here is a message sent to king Jehoiakim, and his queen. Their sorrows would be great indeed. Do they ask, Wherefore come these things upon us? Let them know, it is for their obstinacy in sin. We cannot alter the natural colour of the skin; and so is it morally impossible to reclaim and reform these people. Sin is the blackness of the soul; it is the discolouring of it; we were shapen in it, so that we cannot get clear of it by any power of our own. But Almighty grace is able to change the Ethiopian's skin. Neither natural depravity, nor strong habits of sin, form an obstacle to the working of God, the new-creating Spirit. The Lord asks of Jerusalem, whether she is determined not be made clean. If any poor slave of sin feels that he could as soon change his nature as master his headstrong lusts, let him not despair; for things impossible to men are possible with God. Let us then seek help from Him who is mighty to save.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Shall be shut up - Rather, "are shut up, and no man openeth them."

Meaning the cities of Judah, which lay in the southern part of the land of Israel, and to the south of Babylon; which might be said to be shut up, and not in the power of any to open, when besieged by the Chaldean army; or rather when destroyed, that there were none to go in and out; though some think the cities of Egypt are intended, which lay south of Judea, from whence the Jews should not have the relief they expected, and where they should find no refuge; but the former sense seems best: <p>Judah shall be carried away captive all of it; it was in part carried away in Jehoiachin's time, and wholly in Zedekiah's; which seems to be here respected: <p>it shall be wholly carried away captive; or, in perfections (e); most perfectly and completely; the same thing is meant as before, only in different words repeated, to express the certainty of it. <p>(e) "perfectionibus", Vatablus, Montanus.

"And speak unto them this word: Thus hath Jahveh the God of Israel said, Every jar is filled with wine. And when they say to thee, Know we not that every jar is filled with wine? <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-13.htm">Jeremiah 13:13</a>. Then say to them: Thus hath Jahve said: Behold, I fill all inhabitants of this land - the kings that sit for David upon his throne, and the priests, and the prophets, and all inhabitants of Jerusalem - with drunkenness, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-14.htm">Jeremiah 13:14</a>. And dash them one against another, the fathers and the sons together, saith Jahve; I will not spare, nor pity, nor have mercy, not to destroy them. -  <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-15.htm">Jeremiah 13:15</a>.

But if ye hear it not, then in concealment shall my soul weep for the pride, and weep and run down shall mine eye with tears, because the flock of Jahve is carried away captive."<p>To give emphasis to the threatening conveyed in the symbolical action, the kind and manner of the destruction awaiting them is forcibly set before the various ranks in Judah and Jerusalem by the interpretation, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-12.htm">Jeremiah 13:12-14</a>, of a proverbial saying and the application of it to them. The circumstantial way in which the figurative saying is brought in in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-12.htm">Jeremiah 13:12</a>, is designed to call attention to its import. &#1504;&#1489;&#1500;, an earthenware vessel, especially the wine jar (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-24.htm">Isaiah 30:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-2.htm">Lamentations 4:2</a>), is here the emblem of man; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-6.htm">Jeremiah 18:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-16.htm">Isaiah 29:16</a>. We must not, as Ng. does, suppose the similar to be used because such jars are an excellent emblem of that carnal aristocratic pride which lacked all substantial merit, by reason of their being of bulging shape, hollow within and without solidity, and of fragile material besides. No stress is laid on the bulging form and hollowness of the jars, but only on their fulness with wine and their brittleness. Nor can aristocratic haughtiness be predicated of all the inhabitants of the land. The saying: Every jar is filled with wine, seemed so plain and natural, that those addressed answer: Of that we are well aware. "The answer is that of the psychical man, who dreams of no deeper sense" (Hitz.). Just this very answer gives the prophet occasion to expound the deeper meaning of this word of God's. As one fills all wine jars, so must all inhabitants of the land be filled by God with wine of intoxication. Drunkenness is the effect of the intoxicating wine of God's wrath, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/60-5.htm">Psalm 60:5</a>. This wine Jahveh will give them (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-15.htm">Jeremiah 25:15</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-17.htm">Isaiah 51:17</a>, etc.), so that, filled with drunken frenzy, they shall helplessly destroy one another. This spirit will seize upon all ranks: upon the kings who sit upon the throne of David, not merely him who was reigning at the time; upon the priests and prophets as leaders of the people; and upon all inhabitants of Jerusalem, the metropolis, the spirit and temper of which exercises an unlimited influence upon the temper and destiny of the kingdom at large. I dash them one against the other, as jars are shivered when knocked together. Here Hitz. finds a foreshadowing of civil war, by which they should exterminate one another. Jeremiah was indeed thinking of the staggering against one another of drunken men, but in "dash them," etc., adhered simply to the figure of jars or pots. But what can be meant by the shivering of pots knocked together, other than mutual destruction? The kingdom of Judah did not indeed fall by civil war; but who can deny that the fury of the various factions in Judah and Jerusalem did really contribute to the fall of the realm? The shattering of the pots does not mean directly civil war; it is given as the result of the drunkenness of the inhabitants, under which they, no longer capable of self-control, dash against and so destroy one another. But besides, the breaking of jars reminds us of the stratagem of Gideon and his 300 warriors, who, by the sound of trumpets and the smashing of jars, threw the whole Midianite camp into such panic, that these foes turned their swords against one another and fled in wild confusion: <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/7-19.htm">Judges 7:19</a>., cf. too <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-20.htm">1 Samuel 14:20</a>. Thus shall Judah be broken without mercy or pity. To increase the emphasis, there is a cumulation of expressions, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-7.htm">Jeremiah 21:7</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-5.htm">Jeremiah 15:5</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-11.htm">Ezekiel 5:11</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-4.htm">Ezekiel 7:4</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-9.htm">Ezekiel 7:9</a>, etc. </body></html>
