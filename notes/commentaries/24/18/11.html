They forsook God for idols. When men are parched with heat, and meet with cooling, refreshing streams, they use them. In these things men will not leave a certainty for an uncertainty; but Israel left the ancient paths appointed by the Divine law. They walked not in the highway, in which they might travel safely, but in a way in which they must stumble: such was the way of idolatry, and such is the way of iniquity. This made their land desolate, and themselves miserable. Calamities may be borne, if God smile upon us when under them; but if he is displeased, and refuses his help, we are undone. Multitudes forget the Lord and his Christ, and wander from the ancient paths, to walk in ways of their own devising.

God had told this people, that though he had by his prophet denounced his wrath and anger, and threatened to pluck them up and destroy them, yet if they turned from their sinful courses, he would show mercy to them, and alter the course of his providence. Now he tells them that this was their case, God had a work upon the wheel against them, and was framing evil against them, and bringing ruin upon them; therefore it was their wisdom now to return from their evil ways, and to make their doings good. Those who think that these exhortations are vain, if man hath not a power in himself to turn from his evil way, ought to consider that none denieth that man hath a power in himself, by virtue of that common grace of God which he denieth to no man, to turn from such evil courses as were before mentioned, viz. not to carry out burdens upon the sabbath day, not to Bow down to and worship idols, but to worship the true and living God according to the prescription of his word. In short, there is no man but hath a power to do much more than he doth do, and so much as may serve to avert temporal judgment; and although no man without special grace, beyond the outward means of grace, hath a power to do whatsoever God requireth in order to his salvation, yet he hath a power to do so much, as if he doth, no instance can be given of any to whom, so doing, God denied his special grace, enabling him to do whatsoever God requireth of him in order to eternal life. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/18.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Now therefore go to,.... This is the application of the above general rules of procedure to the people of the Jews, and particularly that which relates to the destruction of a nation or kingdom, and the declaration of it in order to reclaim them: <p>speak to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem,  <p>saying, thus saith the Lord; or, "to the man of Judah" (u); the body of the Jewish nation, and especially the inhabitants of the metropolis of it; which was the source of sin to the whole kingdom, and on which the calamity threatened would chiefly come, if not prevented by a reformation: <p>behold, I frame evil against you; as the potter frames his clay upon the wheel, to which the allusion is; which is to be understood of the evil of punishment, but not of any secret purpose, and settled determination, in the mind of God to bring it upon them; for that is never disannulled by himself or others, or ever changed; but some operation in Providence, which began to work towards their destruction; some providential step which God had taken, and which threatened their ruin: <p>and devise a device against you; the same as before; by which it looked as if he had thought of the matter, and had contrived a scheme, which if he went on with, would issue in the subversion of their whole state: <p>return you everyone from his evil way; that so the reformation may be as general as the corruption was: it supposes a sense of the evil of their former conduct, and repentance for their sins, of which their forsaking and abstaining from them would be an evidence: <p>and make your ways and your doings good; for it is not sufficient barely to abstain from sin, which is only a negative holiness; but there must be a performance of good works, a walking in them, a constant series and course of obedience to God, according to the rule of his word. <p>(u)   "ad virum Jehudah", Montanus, Cocceius, Schmidt. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/18.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Now therefore go to, speak to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I frame evil against you, and devise a device against you: return ye now every one from his evil way, and make your ways and your doings good.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/18.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">11</span>.

"Arise and go down into the potter's house; there will I cause thee to hear my words. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-3.htm">Jeremiah 18:3</a>. And I went down into the potter's house; and, behold, he wrought on the wheels. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-4.htm">Jeremiah 18:4</a>.

If it do that which is evil in mine eyes, so that it hearkens not unto my voice, then it repents me of the good which I said I would do unto it."<p>By God's command Jeremiah is to go and see the potter's treatment of the clay, and to receive thereafter God's interpretation of the same. Here he has set before his eyes that which suggests a comparison of man to the clay and of God to the potter, a comparison that frequently occurred to the Hebrews, and which had been made to appear in the first formation of man (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-9.htm">Job 10:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-6.htm">Job 33:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-16.htm">Isaiah 29:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-9.htm">Isaiah 45:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/64-7.htm">Isaiah 64:7</a>). This is done that he may forcibly represent to the people, by means of the emblem, the power of the Lord to do according to His will with all nations, and so with Israel too. From the "go down," we gather that the potteries of Jerusalem lay in a valley near the city. &#1492;&#1488;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; are the round frames by means of which the potter moulded his vessels. This sig. of the word is well approved here; but in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/1-16.htm">Exodus 1:16</a>, where too it is found, the meaning is doubtful, and it is a question whether the derivation is from &#1488;&#1489;&#1503; or from &#1488;&#1493;&#1508;&#1503;, wheel. The perfecta consec. &#1493;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1514; and &#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489; designate, taken in connection with the participle &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492;, actions that were possibly repeated: "and if the vessel was spoilt, he made it over again;" cf. Ew. 342, b. &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; , working in clay, of the material in which men work in order to make something of it; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/31-4.htm">Exodus 31:4</a>.<p>(Note: Instead of &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1502;&#1512; several codd. and editt. have &#1499;&#1468;&#1495;&#1502;&#1512;, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-6.htm">Jeremiah 18:6</a>, to which Ew. and Hitz. both take objection, so that they delete &#1499;&#1495;&#1502;&#1512; (Ew.) or &#1499;&#1468;&#1495;&#1502;&#1512; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491; &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1510;&#1512; (Hitz.) as being glosses, since the words are not in the lxx. The attempts of Umbr. and Nag. to obtain a sense for &#1499;&#1468;&#1495;&#1502;&#1512; are truly of such a kind as only to strengthen the suspicion of spuriousness. Umbr., who is followed by Graf, expounds: "as the clay in the hand of the potter does;" whereto Hitz. justly replies: "but is then the (failure) solely its own doing?" Ng. will have &#1499; to be the &#1499; verit.: the vessel was marred, as clay in the hand of the potter, in which case the &#1499;&#1495;&#1502;&#1512; still interrupts. But the failure of the attempts to make a good sense of &#1499;&#1495;&#1502;&#1512; does in no respect justify the uncritical procedure of Ew. and Hitz. in deleting the word without considering that the reading is by no means established, since not only do the most important and correct editions and a great number of codd. read &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1502;&#1512;, but Aquila, Theodot., the Chald, and Syr. give this reading; Norzi and Houbig. call it lectio accuratiorum codicum, and the Masora on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-6.htm">Jeremiah 18:6</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-9.htm">Job 10:9</a> confirms it. Cf. de Rossi variae lectt. ad h. l. and the critical remarks in the Biblia Hal. by J. H. Michaelis, according to which &#1499;&#1495;&#1502;&#1512; plainly made its way into the present verse from <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-6.htm">Jeremiah 18:6</a> by the error of a copyist; and it can only be from his prejudice in favour of the lxx that Hitz. pronounces &#1499;&#1495;&#1502;&#1512; original, as being "the reading traditionally in use.") </body></html>
