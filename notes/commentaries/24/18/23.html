The words might seem, at first, to refer specially to the conspiracy of the men of Anathoth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-21.htm" title="Therefore thus said the LORD of the men of Anathoth, that seek your life, saying, Prophesy not in the name of the LORD, that you die not by our hand:">Jeremiah 11:21</a>), but by this time, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-18.htm" title="Then said they, Come and let us devise devices against Jeremiah; for the law shall not perish from the priest, nor counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophet. Come, and let us smite him with the tongue, and let us not give heed to any of his words.">Jeremiah 18:18</a> shows, the hatred provoked by the warnings of the prophet had spread further, and united the priests and false prophets of Jerusalem in a common hostility against him. So afterwards, in the Gospel history, the conspiracies that began at Capernaum (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-6.htm" title="And the Pharisees went forth, and straightway took counsel with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.">Mark 3:6</a>) were developed in Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-1.htm" title="When the morning was come, all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death:">Matthew 27:1</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Deal thus with them.</span>—The interpolated word “thus,” intended to emphasise the prayer, really weakens it: <span class= "ital">in the. time of Thine anger deal with them, </span>as implying that the day of grace was past, that nothing now remained but retribution. The prayer was the utterance of an indignation, not unrighteous in itself, yet showing all too plainly, as has been said above, like the language of the so-called imprecatory Psalms, the contrast between the Jewish and the Christian and Christ-like way of meeting wrong and hatred. For us such prayers are among the things that have passed away, and we have learnt to admire and imitate the nobler temper of the proto-martyr, “Lord, lay not this sin to their charge” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-60.htm" title="And he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge. And when he had said this, he fell asleep.">Acts 7:60</a>). The New Testament utterances of St. Peter against Simon the sorcerer (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-20.htm" title="But Peter said to him, Your money perish with you, because you have thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money.">Acts 8:20</a>), of St. Paul against Ananias (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-3.htm" title="Then said Paul to him, God shall smite you, you white washed wall: for sit you to judge me after the law, and command me to be smitten contrary to the law?">Acts 23:3</a>), the Judaisers of Galatia (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-9.htm" title="As we said before, so say I now again, if any man preach any other gospel to you than that you have received, let him be accursed.">Galatians 1:9</a>), and Alexander the coppersmith (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-14.htm" title="Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord reward him according to his works:">2Timothy 4:14</a>), present an apparent parallelism; but the words spoken in these cases have more the character of an authoritative judicial sentence.<p><span class= "bld"><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/18.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>18:18-23 When the prophet called to repentance, instead of obeying the call, the people devised devices against him.

But the prophet had done his duty to them; and the same will be our rejoicing in a day of evil.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Yet, Lord - Better, But, Lord. They conceal their plots, but God knows, and therefore must punish.<p>Neither blot out ... - Or, "blot not out their sin from before Thy face that they may be made to stumble before Thee."<p>Thus - Omit this word. Since there is an acceptable time and a day of salvation, so there is a time of anger, and Jeremiah's prayer is that God would deal with his enemies at such a time, and when therefore no mercy would be shown. On imprecations such as these, see <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/109.htm">Psalm 109</a> introductory note. Though they did not flow from personal vengeance, but from a pure zeal for God's honor, yet they belong to the legal spirit of the Jewish covenant. We must not, because we have been shown a "more excellent way," condemn too harshly that sterner spirit of justice which animated so many of the saints of the earlier dispensation. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>23. forgive not&#8212;(Ps 109:9, 10, 14).<p>blot out&#8212;image from an account-book (Re 20:12).<p>before thee&#8212;Hypocrites suppose God is not near, so long as they escape punishment; but when He punishes, they are said to stand before Him, because they can no longer flatter themselves they can escape His eye (compare Ps 90:8).<p>deal thus&#8212;exert Thy power against them [Maurer].<p>time of thine anger&#8212;Though He seems to tarry, His time shall come at last (Ec 8:11, 12; 2Pe 3:9, 10).   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/18.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Lord, thou knowest all their counsel against me to slay me; </span> Lord, thou knowest I do not charge them falsely, though their counsels have been secret against my life. <span class="ital">Forgive not their iniquity, neither blot out their sin from thy sight</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Object.</span> Will some say, Doth Jeremiah here pray for the eternal damnation of his adversaries?

For <span class="ital">forgiving</span>, and not <span class="ital">forgiving sin</span>, doth not always in holy writ signify the discharging or not discharging the persons, from the obligation to eternal death, under which sin layeth them; but sometimes the discharging or not discharging of them from the punishments in this life, to which sin doth expose the sinner; and all Jeremiah’s meaning is, that however it should please God to deal with these wicked men as to their eternal state, yet he would so far not forgive, not blot out, their sins, as that he would set some mark of his vengeance on them in this life for their treachery and ingratitude to him. Whether we in it consider Jeremiah as an ordinary suppliant in this cause, praying in faith, or as a prophet, foreknowing what God would do, it ought to lay a law upon, all to take heed of being mischievous and treacherous to others. It is seldom but God, before they die, repays such men into their own bosom, especially if it be against any who are God’s ministers or people; and that for their speaking to or doing before them the will of God: it is a sin seldom escapes without a temporal vengeance; and if such men be saved at last, it will be as through fire.

Ew. wrongly translates: that my people forgot me. &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; means for; and the causal import is founded on the main idea of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-13.htm">Jeremiah 18:13</a> : A very horrible thing hath Israel done; for it hath done that which is unheard of in the natural world, it hath forsaken me, the rock of safety; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-32.htm">Jeremiah 2:32</a>. They burn odours, i.e., kindle sacrifices, to the vanity, i.e., the null gods, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/31-7.htm">Psalm 31:7</a>, i.e., to Baal, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-9.htm">Jeremiah 7:9</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-13.htm">Jeremiah 11:13</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-17.htm">Jeremiah 11:17</a>. The subject to &#1497;&#1499;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; may be most simply supplied from the idea of "the vanity:" the null gods made them to stumble; cf. for this idea <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-23.htm">2 Chronicles 28:23</a>. This seems more natural than to leave the subject indefinite, in which case the false prophets (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-27.htm">Jeremiah 23:27</a>) or the priests, or other seducers, would be the moving spirits. "The ancient paths" is apposition to "their ways:" upon their ways, the paths of the old time, i.e., not, however, the good old believing times, from whose ways the Israelites have but recently diverged. For &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501; never denotes the time not very long passed away, but always old, immemorial time, here specially the time of the patriarchs, who walked on the right paths of faithfulness to God, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-16.htm">Jeremiah 6:16</a>. Hitz. and Graf have taken "the ancient paths" as subject: the old paths have made the Israelites to stumble on their ways, which gives a most unnatural idea, while the "paths of the earliest time" is weakened into "the example of their ancestors;" and besides, the parallelism is destroyed. As "by-paths" is defined by the apposition "a way not cast up," so is "on their ways" by "the ancient paths." The Chet. &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497; is found only here; the Keri is formed after <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/77-20.htm">Psalm 77:20</a>. A way not cast up is one on which one cannot advance, reach the goal, or on which one suffers hurt and perishes. - In <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-16.htm">Jeremiah 18:16</a> the consequences of these doings are spoken of as having been wrought out by themselves, in order thus to bring out the God-ordained causal nexus between actions and their consequences. To make their land an object of horror to all that set foot on it. &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1511;&#1493;&#1514; occurs only here, while the Keri &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1511;&#1493;&#1514; is found only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-16.htm">Judges 5:16</a> for the piping of shepherds, from &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1511;, to hiss, to pipe. In connection with &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; as expression of horror or amazement, Jeremiah elsewhere uses only &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1511;&#1492;, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-8.htm">Jeremiah 19:8</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-9.htm">Jeremiah 25:9</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-18.htm">Jeremiah 25:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-18.htm">Jeremiah 29:18</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-37.htm">Jeremiah 51:37</a>, so that here the vowelling should perhaps be &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1511;&#1514;. The word does not here denote the hissing  equals  hissing down or against one, by way of contempt, but the sound midway between hissing and whistling which escapes one when one looks on something appalling.

Like an east wind, i.e., a violent storm-wind (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/48-8.htm">Psalm 48:8</a>), will I scatter them, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-24.htm">Jeremiah 13:24</a>. Because they have turned to Him the back and not the face (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-27.htm">Jeremiah 2:27</a>), so will He turn His back on them in the day of their ruin, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-5.htm">Ezekiel 35:5</a>. </body></html>
