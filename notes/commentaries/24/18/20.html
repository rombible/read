The prophet refers to his repeated though fruitless entreaties for the people in Jeremiah 14, 15. It is interesting to note the description of Jeremiah, in <a href="http://apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/15-14.htm" title="Then Onias answered, saying, This is a lover of the brethren, who prayeth much for the people, and for the holy city, to wit, Jeremias the prophet of God.">2 Maccabees 15:14</a>, as “a lover of the brethren who prayeth much for the people and the holy city.” Men had come to recognise that the spirit of intercession had been the prophet’s dominant characteristic.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/18.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>18:18-23 When the prophet called to repentance, instead of obeying the call, the people devised devices against him.

Kimchi interprets it of poison, which they would have had him drank of: <p>remember that I stood before thee to speak good for them, and to turn away thy wrath from them; he was an intercessor for them with God; pleaded with him on their behalf, that good things might be bestowed upon them, and that wrath might be averted from them; so Christ did for the Jews that crucified him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-34.htm">Luke 23:34</a>; this is an instance of their ingratitude; that though he had been an advocate for them, stood in the gap between God and them, and was importunate for their good, yet this was all the recompense he had from them; they sought his life to take it away. This kindness of his for them was forgotten by them; but he trusts the Lord will remember it, and not suffer them to act the base part they intended; and now he determines no more to plead their cause, but to imprecate evils upon them, as follows: <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/18.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Shall evil be recompensed for good? for they have digged a pit for my soul.

The idea is strengthened by Israel's being designated a virgin (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-17.htm">Jeremiah 14:17</a>). One could hardly believe that a virgin could be guilty of such barefaced and determined wickedness. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-14.htm">Jeremiah 18:14</a>. the public conduct is further described; and first, it is illustrated by a picture drawn from natural history, designed to fill the people with shame for their unnatural conduct. But the significance of the picture is disputed. The questions have a negative force: does it forsake?  equals  it does not forsake. The force of the first question is conditioned by the view taken of &#1502;&#1510;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; ; and &#1513;&#1474;&#1491;&#1497; may be either genitive to &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, or it may be the accusative of the object, and be either a poetic form for &#1513;&#1474;&#1491;&#1492;, or plural c. suff. 1. pers. (my fields). Chr. B. Mich., Schur., Ros., Maur., Neum. translate according to the latter view: Does the snow of Lebanon descending from the rock forsake my fields? i.e., does it ever cease, flowing down from the rock, to water my fields, the fields of my people? To this view, however, it is to be opposed, a. that "from the rock" thus appears superfluous, at least not in its proper place, since, according to the sense given, it would belong to "snow of Lebanon;" b. that the figure contains no real illustrative truth. The watering of the fields of God's people, i.e., of Palestine or Judah, by the snow of Lebanon could be brought about only by the water from the melting snow of Lebanon soaking into the ground, and so feeding the springs of the country. But this view of the supply for the springs that watered the land cannot be supposed to be a fact of natural history so well known that the prophet could found an argument on it. Most recent commentators therefore join &#1502;&#1510;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; &#1513;&#1474;&#1491;&#1497;, and translate: does the snow of Lebanon cease from the rock of the field (does it disappear)? The use of &#1506;&#1494;&#1489; with &#1502;&#1503; is unexampled, but is analogous to &#1506;&#1494;&#1489; &#1495;&#1505;&#1491; &#1502;&#1506;&#1501;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-27.htm">Genesis 24:27</a>, where, however, &#1506;&#1494;&#1489; is used transitively.<p>But even when translated as above, "rock of the field" is variously understood. Hitz. will have it to be Mount Zion, which in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-3.htm">Jeremiah 17:3</a> is called my mountain in the field, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-13.htm">Jeremiah 21:13</a>, rock of the plain; and says the trickling waters are the waters of Gihon, these being the only never-drying water of Jerusalem, the origin of which has never been known, and may have been commonly held to be from the snow of Lebanon. Graf and Ng., again, have justly objected that the connection between the snow of Lebanon and the water-springs of Zion is of too doubtful a kind, and does not become probable by appeal to <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/133-3.htm">Psalm 133:3</a>, where the dew of Hermon is said to descend on the mountains of Zion. For it is perfectly possible that a heavy dew after warm days might be carried to Jerusalem by means of the cool current of air coming down from the north over Hermon (cf. Del. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/133-3.htm">Psalm 133:3</a>); but not that the water of the springs of Jerusalem should have come from Lebanon. Like Ew., Umbr., Graf, and Ng., we therefore understand the rock of the field to be Lebanon itself. But it is not so called as being a detached, commanding rocky mountain, for this is not involved in the sig. of &#1513;&#1474;&#1491;&#1497; (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-3.htm">Jeremiah 17:3</a>); nor as bulwark of the field (Ng.), for &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; does not mean bulwark, and the change of &#1502;&#1510;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; into &#1502;&#1510;&#1493;&#1512;, from &#1502;&#1510;&#1493;&#1512;, a hemming in, siege, would give a most unsuitable figure. We hold the "field" to be the land of Israel, whence seen, the summit of Lebanon, and especially the peak of Hermon covered with eternal snows might very well be called the rock of the field.<p>(Note: "Hermon is not a conical mountain like Tabor, with a single lofty peak and a well-defined base, but a whole mountain mass of many days' journey in circuit, with a broad crest of summits. The highest of these lie within the Holy Land, and, according to the measurements of the English engineers, Majors Scott and Robe (1840), rise to a height of 9376 English feet - summits encompassed by far-stretching mountain ridges, from whose deep gloomy valleys the chief rivers of the country take their rise.... Behind the dark green foremost range (that having valleys clothed with pine and oak forests) high mountains raise their domes aloft; there is a fir wood sprinkled with snow as with silver, a marvellous mingling of bright and dark; and behind these rises the broad central ridge with its peaks covered with a deep and all but everlasting snows." - Van de Velde, Reise, i. S. 96f. Therewith cf. Robins. Phys. Geogr. p. 315: "In the ravines round about the highest of the two peaks, snow, or rather ice, lies the whole year round. In summer this gives the mountain, when seen from a distance, the appearance of being surrounded with radiant stripes descending from its crown.")<p>Observe the omission of the article before Lebanon, whereby it comes about that the name is joined appellatively to "snow:" the Lebanon-snow. And accordingly we regard the waters as those which trickle down from Hermon. The wealth of springs in Lebanon is well known, and the trickling water of Lebanon is used as an illustration in Sol 4:15. &#1497;&#1504;&#1468;&#1514;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;, are rooted up, strikes us as singular, since "root up" seems suitable neither for the drying up of springs, nor for: to be checked in their course. Dav. Kimchi thought, therefore, it stood for  ,&#1497;&#1504;&#1468;&#1514;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;omittuntur; but this word has not this signification. Probably a transposition has taken place, so that we have &#1497;&#1504;&#1514;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493; for &#1497;&#1504;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1493;&#1468;, since for &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514; in Niph. the sig. dry up is certified by <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-5.htm">Isaiah 19:5</a>. The predicate, too, &#1494;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; is singular. Strange waters are in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-24.htm">2 Kings 19:24</a> waters belonging to others; but this will not do here. So Ew. derives &#1494;&#1512; from &#1494;&#1512;&#1512;, press, urge, and correspondingly, &#1511;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; from &#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, spring, well up: waters pouring forth with fierce pressure. In this case, however, the following &#1504;&#1493;&#1494;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; would be superfluous, or at least feeble. Then, &#1502;&#1497;&#1501; &#1511;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/25-25.htm">Proverbs 25:25</a>, is cold water; and besides, &#1494;&#1512;&#1512; means constinxit, compressit, of which root-meaning the sig. to press forth is a contradiction. There is therefore nothing for it but to keep to the sig. strange for &#1494;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;; strange waters  equals  waters coming from afar, whose springs are not known, so that they could be stopped up. The predicate cold is quite in keeping, for cold waters do not readily dry up, the coldness being a protection against evaporation. Such, then, will be the meaning of the verse: As the Lebanon-snow does not forsake the rock, so the waters trickling thence do not dry up. From the application of this general idea, that in inanimate nature faithfulness and constancy are found, to Israel's bearing towards God arises a deeper significance, which shows why this figure was chosen. The rock in the field points to the Rock of Israel as the everlasting rock, rock of ages (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-29.htm">Isaiah 30:29</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-4.htm">Isaiah 26:4</a>), and the cold, i.e., refreshing waters, which trickle from the rock of the field, point to Jahveh, the fountain of living water, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-13.htm">Jeremiah 2:13</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-13.htm">Jeremiah 17:13</a>. Although the snow does not forsake Lebanon, Israel has forgotten the fountain of living water from which water of life flows to it; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-13.htm">Jeremiah 2:13</a>.</body></html>
