God has authority, and power, to form and fashion kingdoms and nations as he pleases. He may dispose of us as he thinks fit; and it would be as absurd for us to dispute this, as for the clay to quarrel with the potter. But he always goes by fixed rules of justice and goodness. When God is coming against us in judgments, we may be sure it is for our sins; but sincere conversion from the evil of sin will prevent the evil of punishment, as to persons, and to families, and nations.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I will repent of the evil ...

The change is not in God, but in the circumstances which regulate God's dealings: just as we say the land recedes from us when we sail forth, whereas it is we who recede from the land (Eze 18:21; 33:11). God's unchangeable principle is to do the best that can be done under all circumstances; if then He did not take into account the moral change in His people (their prayers, &c.), He would not be acting according to His own unchanging principle (Jer 18:9, 10). This is applied practically to the Jews' case (Jer 18:11; see Jer 26:3; Jon 3:10).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/18.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/18.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And at what instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom,....

"Arise and go down into the potter's house; there will I cause thee to hear my words. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-3.htm">Jeremiah 18:3</a>. And I went down into the potter's house; and, behold, he wrought on the wheels. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-4.htm">Jeremiah 18:4</a>.

If it do that which is evil in mine eyes, so that it hearkens not unto my voice, then it repents me of the good which I said I would do unto it."<p>By God's command Jeremiah is to go and see the potter's treatment of the clay, and to receive thereafter God's interpretation of the same. Here he has set before his eyes that which suggests a comparison of man to the clay and of God to the potter, a comparison that frequently occurred to the Hebrews, and which had been made to appear in the first formation of man (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-9.htm">Job 10:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-6.htm">Job 33:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-16.htm">Isaiah 29:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-9.htm">Isaiah 45:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/64-7.htm">Isaiah 64:7</a>). This is done that he may forcibly represent to the people, by means of the emblem, the power of the Lord to do according to His will with all nations, and so with Israel too. From the "go down," we gather that the potteries of Jerusalem lay in a valley near the city. &#1492;&#1488;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; are the round frames by means of which the potter moulded his vessels. This sig. of the word is well approved here; but in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/1-16.htm">Exodus 1:16</a>, where too it is found, the meaning is doubtful, and it is a question whether the derivation is from &#1488;&#1489;&#1503; or from &#1488;&#1493;&#1508;&#1503;, wheel. The perfecta consec. &#1493;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1514; and &#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489; designate, taken in connection with the participle &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492;, actions that were possibly repeated: "and if the vessel was spoilt, he made it over again;" cf. Ew. 342, b. &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; , working in clay, of the material in which men work in order to make something of it; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/31-4.htm">Exodus 31:4</a>.<p>(Note: Instead of &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1502;&#1512; several codd. and editt. have &#1499;&#1468;&#1495;&#1502;&#1512;, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-6.htm">Jeremiah 18:6</a>, to which Ew. and Hitz. both take objection, so that they delete &#1499;&#1495;&#1502;&#1512; (Ew.) or &#1499;&#1468;&#1495;&#1502;&#1512; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491; &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1510;&#1512; (Hitz.) as being glosses, since the words are not in the lxx. The attempts of Umbr. and Nag. to obtain a sense for &#1499;&#1468;&#1495;&#1502;&#1512; are truly of such a kind as only to strengthen the suspicion of spuriousness. Umbr., who is followed by Graf, expounds: "as the clay in the hand of the potter does;" whereto Hitz. justly replies: "but is then the (failure) solely its own doing?" Ng. will have &#1499; to be the &#1499; verit.: the vessel was marred, as clay in the hand of the potter, in which case the &#1499;&#1495;&#1502;&#1512; still interrupts. But the failure of the attempts to make a good sense of &#1499;&#1495;&#1502;&#1512; does in no respect justify the uncritical procedure of Ew. and Hitz. in deleting the word without considering that the reading is by no means established, since not only do the most important and correct editions and a great number of codd. read &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1502;&#1512;, but Aquila, Theodot., the Chald, and Syr. give this reading; Norzi and Houbig. call it lectio accuratiorum codicum, and the Masora on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-6.htm">Jeremiah 18:6</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-9.htm">Job 10:9</a> confirms it. Cf. de Rossi variae lectt. ad h. l. and the critical remarks in the Biblia Hal. by J. H. Michaelis, according to which &#1499;&#1495;&#1502;&#1512; plainly made its way into the present verse from <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-6.htm">Jeremiah 18:6</a> by the error of a copyist; and it can only be from his prejudice in favour of the lxx that Hitz. pronounces &#1499;&#1495;&#1502;&#1512; original, as being "the reading traditionally in use.") </body></html>
