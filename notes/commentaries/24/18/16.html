They forsook God for idols. When men are parched with heat, and meet with cooling, refreshing streams, they use them. In these things men will not leave a certainty for an uncertainty; but Israel left the ancient paths appointed by the Divine law. They walked not in the highway, in which they might travel safely, but in a way in which they must stumble: such was the way of idolatry, and such is the way of iniquity. This made their land desolate, and themselves miserable. Calamities may be borne, if God smile upon us when under them; but if he is displeased, and refuses his help, we are undone. Multitudes forget the Lord and his Christ, and wander from the ancient paths, to walk in ways of their own devising.

Not that this was the intention either of those that led them out of the right way into those wrong paths, or of them that went into them; but so it was eventually; this was the issue of things; their idolatry and other sins were the cause of their land being desolate; through the ravage of the enemy, let in upon them by way of judgment; and through the destruction of men by them; so that there were few or none to cultivate and manure it: <p>and a perpetual hissing; to be hissed at perpetually by the enemy, whenever they passed by it, and observed its desolation; thereby expressing their hatred at its inhabitants; their joy at its desolation; and their satisfaction in it, which would be for ever; or, as Kimchi interprets, a long time. This is the present case of the Jews; and has been ever since their destruction by the Romans; and will be until the fulness of the Gentiles is gathered in: <p>everyone that passeth thereby shall be astonished: to see the desolations made, and the strange alterations in a place once so famous for fruitfulness and number of inhabitants: <p>and wag his head; either out of pity, or rather in a way of derision and exultation; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-15.htm">Lamentations 2:15</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/18.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">To make their land desolate, and a perpetual hissing; every one that passeth thereby shall be astonished, and wag his head.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - The effect of this is to make the land of the transgressors an object of horror and <span class="accented">astonishment</span> (so render rather than desolate). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/18.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-6.htm">Jeremiah 18:6-10</a> the Lord discloses to the prophet the truth lying in the potter's treatment of the clay. The power the potter has over the clay to remould, according to his pleasure, the vessel he had formed from it if it went wrong; the same power God possesses over the people of Israel. This unlimited power of God over mankind is exercised according to man's conduct, not according to a decretum absolutum or unchangeable determination. If he pronounces a people's overthrow or ruin, and if that people turn from its wickedness, He repeals His decree (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-7.htm">Jeremiah 18:7</a>.); and conversely, if He promises a people welfare and prosperity, and if that people turn away from Him to wickedness, then too He changes His resolve to do good to it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-9.htm">Jeremiah 18:9</a>.). Inasmuch as He is even now making His decree known by the mouth of the prophet, it follows that the accomplishment of Jeremiah's last utterances is conditioned by the impression God's word makes on men. &#1512;&#1490;&#1506;, adv., in the moment, forthwith, and when repeated  equals  now...now, now...again. Ng. maintains that the arrangement here is paratactic, so that the &#1512;&#1490;&#1506;  does not belong to the nearest verb, but to the main idea, i.e., to the apodosis in this case. The remark is just; but the word does not mean suddenly, but immediately, and the sense is: when I have spoken against a people, and this people repents, then immediately I let it repent me. &#1504;&#1495;&#1501; &#1506;&#1500; as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/joel/2-13.htm">Joel 2:13</a>, etc. With "to pluck up," etc., "to build," etc., cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-10.htm">Jeremiah 1:10</a>. "Against which I spake," <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-8.htm">Jeremiah 18:8</a>, belongs to "that people," and seems as if it might be dispensed with; but is not therefore spurious because the lxx have omitted it. For &#1492;&#1512;&#1506;&#1492; the Keri has &#1492;&#1512;&#1506;, the most usual form, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-30.htm">Jeremiah 7:30</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-13.htm">Numbers 32:13</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/2-11.htm">Judges 2:11</a>, etc.; but the Chet. is called for by the following &#1492;&#1496;&#1468;&#1493;&#1489;&#1492; and &#1502;&#1512;&#1506;&#1514;&#1493;. &#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1496;&#1497;&#1489; &#1492;&#1496;&#1468;&#1493;&#1489;&#1492;, to show kindness, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/10-32.htm">Numbers 10:32</a>.<p>The emblematical interpretation of the potter with the clay lays a foundation for the prophecy that follows, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-11.htm">Jeremiah 18:11-17</a>, in which the people are told that it is only by reason of their stiffnecked persistency in wickedness that they render threatened judgment certain, whereas by return to their God they might prevent the ruin of the kingdom. </body></html>
