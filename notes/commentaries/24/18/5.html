God has authority, and power, to form and fashion kingdoms and nations as he pleases. He may dispose of us as he thinks fit; and it would be as absurd for us to dispute this, as for the clay to quarrel with the potter. But he always goes by fixed rules of justice and goodness. When God is coming against us in judgments, we may be sure it is for our sins; but sincere conversion from the evil of sin will prevent the evil of punishment, as to persons, and to families, and nations.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The wheels - literally, "the two wheels."

From the ends of the kingdom the people will come with offerings to the temple, to present thank-offerings for benefits received. The rhetorical enumeration of the various parts of the country appears again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-44.htm">Jeremiah 32:44</a>. The cities of Judah and the outskirts of Jerusalem denote the part of the country which bordered on Jerusalem; then we have the land of Benjamin, the northern province of the kingdom, and three districts into which the tribal domain of Judah was divided: the Shephelah in the west on the Mediterranean Sea, the hill-country, and the southland; see on <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/15-21.htm">Joshua 15:21</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/15-33.htm">Joshua 15:33</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-48.htm">Joshua 15:48</a>. The desert of Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-61.htm">Joshua 15:61</a>) is not mentioned, as being comprehended under the hill-country. The offerings are divided into two classes: bloody, burnt and slain offerings, and unbloody, meat-offerings and frankincense, which was strewed upon the meat-offering (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-1.htm">Leviticus 2:1</a>). The latter is not the incense-offering (Graf), which is not called &#1500;&#1489;&#1493;&#1504;&#1492;, but &#1511;&#1496;&#1512;&#1514;, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-7.htm">Exodus 30:7</a>., although frankincense was one of the ingredients of the incense prepared for burning (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-34.htm">Exodus 30:34</a>). These offerings they will bring as "praise-offering" into the house of the Lord. &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1491;&#1492; is not here used for &#1494;&#1489;&#1495; &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1491;&#1492;, praise-offering, as one species of slain-offering, but is, as we see from <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-11.htm">Jeremiah 33:11</a>, a general designation for the praise and thanks which they desire to express by means of the offerings specified.</body></html>
