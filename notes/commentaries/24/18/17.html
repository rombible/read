The east wind blowing from the desert was the wind of storms, tempests, and parching heat (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/4-8.htm" title="And it came to pass, when the sun did arise, that God prepared a vehement east wind; and the sun beat on the head of Jonah, that he fainted, and wished in himself to die, and said, It is better for me to die than to live.">Jonah 4:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/48-7.htm" title="You break the ships of Tarshish with an east wind.">Psalm 48:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/27-8.htm" title="In measure, when it shoots forth, you will debate with it: he stays his rough wind in the day of the east wind.">Isaiah 27:8</a>). I will shew them the back, and not the face.—The figure is boldly anthropomorphic. The light of God’s countenance is the fulness of joy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/6-25.htm" title="The LORD make his face shine on you, and be gracious to you:">Numbers 6:25</a>). To turn away that light was to leave the people to the darkness of their misery. What was thus done by Jehovah was but a righteous retribution on the people who had “turned their back” and “not their face” to Him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-27.htm" title="Saying to a stock, You are my father; and to a stone, You have brought me forth: for they have turned their back to me, and not their face: but in the time of their trouble they will say, Arise, and save us.">Jeremiah 2:27</a>).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/18.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>18:11-17 Sinners call it liberty to live at large; whereas for a man to be a slave to his lusts, is the very worst slavery. They forsook God for idols. When men are parched with heat, and meet with cooling, refreshing streams, they use them. In these things men will not leave a certainty for an uncertainty; but Israel left the ancient paths appointed by the Divine law. They walked not in the highway, in which they might travel safely, but in a way in which they must stumble: such was the way of idolatry, and such is the way of iniquity. This made their land desolate, and themselves miserable. Calamities may be borne, if God smile upon us when under them; but if he is displeased, and refuses his help, we are undone. Multitudes forget the Lord and his Christ, and wander from the ancient paths, to walk in ways of their own devising.

As the east wind, which is generally strong and boisterous, drives the chaff and stubble, and anything that is light, before it, and scatters it here and there; so the Lord threatens to scatter the people of the Jews over the face of the earth, before their enemies, whom they should not be able to withstand. It denotes the power of the enemy God would make use of; the ease with which this should be done; and the utter dispersion of them; and is their present case: <p>I will show them the back, and not the face, in the day of their calamity; that is, will not look upon them in a favourable way, nor with any pity and compassion for them, nor hear their cries; but turn his back upon them, and a deaf ear unto them, and give them no help and relief, or deliver them out of their calamities; but suffer them to continue upon them, and them to sink under them; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-26.htm">Proverbs 1:26</a>; which refers to the same time of calamity as here. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/18.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">I will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy; I will show them the back, and <span class="cverse3">{f}</span> not the face, in the day of their calamity.</span><p>(f) I will show my anger and not my favour toward them.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/18.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">17</span>. <span class="ital">as with an east wind</span>] better, perhaps, <span class="ital">as an east wind</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">look upon … their face</span>] mg. <span class="ital">shew them the back, and not the face</span>, in answer to the people’s own behaviour towards Him.
