We are reminded of the oft-recurring statement in the Gospels that priests and elders “took counsel” against our Lord to “put Him to death” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-14.htm" title="Then the Pharisees went out, and held a council against him, how they might destroy him.">Matthew 12:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-1.htm" title="When the morning was come, all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death:">Matthew 27:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-6.htm" title="And the Pharisees went forth, and straightway took counsel with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.">Mark 3:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-11.htm" title="And they were filled with madness; and communed one with another what they might do to Jesus.">Luke 6:11</a>; <span class= "ital">et al</span>.)<span class= "ital">.</span><p><span class= "bld">For the law shall not perish . . .</span>—The words meant apparently (1) that they had enough guidance in the Law, in the priests, and in the prophets who met their wishes, and (2) that they might trust in the continuance of that guidance in spite of the threatenings of destruction that the prophet had just spoken. The words are suggestive as showing the precise nature of the guidance expected from each. The priests interpret the Law, the wise give the counsel of experience, the prophet speaks what claims to be the word, or message, of the Lord. A striking parallel is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-26.htm" title="Mischief shall come on mischief, and rumor shall be on rumor; then shall they seek a vision of the prophet; but the law shall perish from the priest, and counsel from the ancients.">Ezekiel 7:26</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Come, and let us smite him with the tongue.</span>—We probably find the result of the conspiracy in the measures taken by Pashur in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/20-1.htm" title="Now Pashur the son of Immer the priest, who was also chief governor in the house of the LORD, heard that Jeremiah prophesied these things.">Jeremiah 20:1-3</a>. He had “heard that Jeremiah prophesied these things,” and we may well believe that his informants were some of those who thus announced their intentions.

They had persuaded themselves, that God had intended for them a perpetual establishment; and would accordingly provide them with a constant succession of man, in all departments, to preserve and maintain the general welfare; namely, priests to direct in all matters of law and religion; wise statesmen to manage their civil concerns; and prophets to make known to them the immediate will of God on all important and extraordinary occasions. Upon this presumption they inferred, that Jeremiah, who foretold the contrary, was a false prophet, and, as such, they determined to punish him.” — Blaney. <span class="ital">Let us smite him with the tongue </span>— Let us calumniate and disparage him, traducing him as an enemy to his country. Let us accuse him of crimes against the state, and by that means take away his life; then all his prophecies will die with him. In the margin we read, <span class="ital">for the tongue, </span>which may signify, “Let us punish him for his malignant speeches.” “But I rather think,” says Blaney, “we should render it, <span class="ital">Let us smite him on the tongue, </span>that is, on the offending part; alluding to a very significant mode of inflicting punishment, by directing it to that particular member which had the most immediate share in the offence, although here it may possibly carry this general import only, ‘Let us punish him so as effectually to silence him.’“<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/18.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>18:18-23 When the prophet called to repentance, instead of obeying the call, the people devised devices against him.

Being enraged at the judgments threatened them, they propose to enter into a confederacy and consultation together, to think of ways and means to stop the mouth of the prophet, and even to take away his life; since he had told them that God had devised a device against them, they were for devising devices against him; that so they might walk after their own devices, without being teased and tormented with this prophet: <p>for the law shall not perish from the priest; whose business it is to teach it; we have other priests besides Jeremiah, and we shall seek the law at their mouths, and not at his; and perhaps these are the words of the priests themselves, the men of Anathoth; so Jarchi thinks; pleasing themselves with their character and office, and the perpetuity of it; that, notwithstanding what Jeremiah had said, there would be a constant succession of this order of then; nor should the law ever cease from being aught by them, to whose instruction men ought to listen, and not to such a prophet: <p>nor counsel from the wise; we have wise rulers and governors, counsellors of state, and members of the sanhedrim, and judges of all controversies, and who are capable of giving advice upon any occasion; nor shall we ever want such, to whose prudent counsel we do well to attend, and not to what this babbling man says; does he think to know better than our statesmen and sages, our counsellors in church and state? <p>nor the word from the prophet; we have prophets among us, that prophesy as well as he, and better things; and whose words of prophecy shall be fulfilled, when his will not; who assure us that we shall have peace and prosperity; and therefore let us not regard what this man says, or be intimidated by his threatenings: <p>come, and let us smite him with the tongue; by saying all the evil we can of him: by threatening him with pains and penalties; by loading him with reproaches and calumnies; by taking away his good name, and lessening his character and reputation among the people; and so the Targum, <p>"let us bear false witness against him;'' <p>or, "let us smite him in the tongue" (c); cut it out, as Abarbinel; or stop his mouth, and hinder him from speaking any more in this manner to the people; or, "let us smite him for the tongue" (d); because of the words he says, or the prophecies he delivers out: <p>and let us not give heed to any of his words; or, "to all his words" (e); all which they reckoned his own, and not the words of the Lord. The Septuagint version is, "and we shall hear all his words"; we shall provoke him to say all he has to say, and shall hear and have enough out of his mouth to condemn him; and in all this, and in many other things that follow, Jeremiah was a type of Christ, to whom Jerom applies the whole passage. <p>(c) "in lingua", Montanus, Castalio.

The Jews were but obeying the Deuteronomic Law (on which Jeremiah, as we have seen, laid so much stress) in alluding to the priests. Unhappily, the priests in Jeremiah's time (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-26.htm">Jeremiah 2:26</a>), as in Isaiah's (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-7.htm">Isaiah 28:7</a>), were forgetful of their high mission. <span class="cmt_word">Nor counsel from the wise</span>. The wise men formed an important order in Jewish society, the importance of which in the Divine education of Israel has not been sufficiently recognized. It was their custom to sit in public places, generally in the chambered recess in the city gate, and give advice on questions of moral practice to those who applied for it. But there were wise men and wise men. Some appear, to have "mocked" at the earnest preaching of the prophets (hence the solemn rebukes in the Book of Proverbs), others to have as it were prepared the way for the latter by a more or less distinct recognition of the religious foundation of morality, and of these we have ample monuments in the canonical Proverbs. There may also have been other shades and varieties of wise men, for their characteristic was not a faculty of intuition, but rather of reflectively applying fundamental moral principles. One highly esteemed branch of "wisdom" would, of course, be political, and this would be the most liable to perversion. It is of such (Proverbs 29:14). <span class="cmt_word">Nor the word from the prophet</span>. "The word" is a general term for prophesying. Of course, the speakers take no account of the advance in prophecy from the time, at any rate, of Amos. They are satisfied with the lower order of prophets ("false prophets," as the Septuagint calls them); but still they are afraid of Jeremiah, much as Balak was afraid of Balaam, when that soothsayer was blessing Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-25.htm">Numbers 23:25</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Smite him with the tongue; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> by slanderous accusations</span>.
