Then it had been given when the line of David was in all the freshness of its strength. Now it is uttered when that line seemed on the very point of dying out. The hope of the prophet is, however, inextinguishable. He is certain that the true King will always be of the house of David. It lay almost in the nature of the case that the words of the prophet should find a fulfilment other than that which was present to his thoughts; and that, while he pictured to himself an unbroken succession of sovereigns of David’s line, there was in fact a higher fulfilment in the continuous sovereignty of the Christ as the true Son of David. We have something like an echo of the words in the words of the Angel at the Annunciation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/1-32.htm" title="He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give to him the throne of his father David:">Luke 1:32-33</a>), and it is an echo that interprets them.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/jeremiah/33.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/33-17.htm" title="For thus said the LORD; David shall never want a man to sit on the throne of the house of Israel;...">Jeremiah 33:17-18</a></span>. <span class="ital">For thus saith the Lord, David shall never want a man, </span>&c. — It is very evident that the prophecies in these verses were not fulfilled in the Jews after the Babylonish captivity; for, from that time to the coming of Christ, David was without a successor of his family sitting upon the throne of Judah or Israel. Nor have they been fulfilled in them since, for, from the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans to the present time, they have neither had a king nor a regular priesthood belonging to their nation. There can therefore be no doubt that Jeremiah here foretels the kingdom of the Messiah, and the priesthood, or ministry rather, to be established by him, by which a <span class="ital">pure </span>and spiritual <span class="ital">oblation </span>should be <span class="ital">offered in every place </span>where a church should be formed for him, (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/1-11.htm" title="For from the rising of the sun even to the going down of the same my name shall be great among the Gentiles; and in every place incense shall be offered to my name, and a pure offering: for my name shall be great among the heathen, said the LORD of hosts.">Malachi 1:11</a>,) and not at Jerusalem and in Judea only. “As the Jewish priesthood, in the family of Aaron, is extinct, and hath been exercised neither in Jerusalem nor in any other place for seventeen centuries, it follows,” says Calmet, “that these promises can respect only the eternal priesthood of Jesus Christ, exercised by himself, and by his ministers, in the Christian Church from the beginning, and which shall continue to the end of time.” Nor is it unusual for God in the Old Testament to express promises relating to, and to be fulfilled under, the gospel, by terms proper to the Old Testament. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-19.htm" title="In that day shall there be an altar to the LORD in the middle of the land of Egypt, and a pillar at the border thereof to the LORD.">Isaiah 19:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/56-7.htm" title="Even them will I bring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in my house of prayer: their burnt offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted on my altar; for my house shall be called an house of prayer for all people.">Isaiah 56:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-23.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to another, and from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, said the LORD.">Isaiah 66:23</a>. And as the prophets often describe the Christian worship by representations taken from the temple service, so the apostles prove the rights and privileges belonging to the ministers of the gospel from the prerogatives given to the Jewish priesthood. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-16.htm" title="That I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Ghost.">Romans 15:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/9-13.htm" title="Do you not know that they which minister about holy things live of the things of the temple? and they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar?...">1 Corinthians 9:13-14</a>.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/33.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>33:14-26 To crown the blessings God has in store, here is a promise of the Messiah. He imparts righteousness to his church, for he is made of God to us righteousness; and believers are made the righteousness of God in him. Christ is our Lord God, our righteousness, our sanctification, and our redemption. His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom. But in this world prosperity and adversity succeed each other, as light and darkness, day and night. The covenant of priesthood shall be secured. And all true believers are a holy priesthood, a royal priesthood, they offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God; themselves, in the first place, as living sacrifices. The promises of that covenant shall have full accomplishment in the gospel Israel. In Ga 6:16, all that walk according to the gospel rule, are made to be the Israel of God, on whom shall be peace and mercy. Let us not despise the families which were of old the chosen people of God, though for a time they seem to be cast off.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/33.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Read literally, these verses promise the permanent restoration of the Davidic throne and (of the Levitical priesthood. As a matter of fact Zedekiah was the last king of David's line, and the Levitical priest-hood has long passed away. Both these changes Jeremiah himself foretold <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-30.htm">Jeremiah 22:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-16.htm">Jeremiah 3:16</a>. In what way then is this apparent contradiction (compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-20.htm">Isaiah 66:20-23</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40.htm">Ezekiel 40-48</a>) to be explained? The solution is probably as follows. It was necessary that the Bible should be intelligible to the people at the time when it was written, and in some degree to the writer. The Davidic kingship and the Levitical priest-hood were symbols, which represented to the Jew all that was most dear to his heart in the state of things under which he lived. Their restoration was the restoration of his national and spiritual life. Neither was so restored as to exist permanently. But that was given instead, of which both were types, the Church, whose Head is the true prophet, priest and King. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/33.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17. The promises of perpetuity of the throne of David fulfilled in Messiah, the son of David (2Sa 7:16; 1Ki 2:4; Ps 89:4, 29, 36; compare Lu 1:32, 33).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/33.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This is apparently a promise relating to Christ, for David’s line had failed long since, had it not been continued in Christ, whose kingdom is and shall be an everlasting kingdom. So long as Israel remained a kingdom, those of the line of David ruled over it; when that failed, Christ came in the flesh, who ruleth, and shall rule, over the Israel of God for ever. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/33.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For thus saith the Lord,.... Confirming the above promise concerning the Messiah; giving a reason why his coming may be expected; and why the salvation, justification, and final perseverance of his church and people, are certain things, and to be depended upon: <p>David shall never want a man to sit upon the throne of the house of Israel; or, "there shall not be cut off unto David a man" (a); and this is not to be understood of the temporal kingdom of David, which has been at an end long ago: Jeconiah, that was carried captive into Babylon, was written childless, and left no issue; and Zerubbabel, the only one of David's seed that made any figure after the captivity, was not a king; this is only true of the man Christ Jesus, of the seed of David, and is his son, to whom has been given the throne of his father David; and who reigns over the house of Jacob for ever; and of whose kingdom there is no end, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-32.htm">Luke 1:32</a>; and as long as he is King of saints, which will be for ever, David will not want a man to sit upon his throne. David's earthly kingdom was but a typical and shadowy one; a type of Christ's spiritual kingdom, which has succeeded it, and in which Christ is David's son and successor, and whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom. <p>(a)    "non exscindetur Davidi vir", Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator, Schmidt. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/33.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For thus saith the LORD; David shall never want a man to sit upon the throne of the house of Israel;</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/33.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">17</span>. <span class="ital">David … man</span>] lit. as mg. <span class="ital">There shall not be cut off from David</span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/33.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">David shall never want a man,</span> etc. This is, in fact, a republication of the promise given by Nathan in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>. It agrees in form with the announcements in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-4.htm">1 Kings 2:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-25.htm">1 Kings 8:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-5.htm">1 Kings 9:5</a>. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/33.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In consequence of the renovation of Israel externally and internally, Jerusalem will become to the Lord a name of delight, i.e., a name which affords joy, delight. &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; here signifies, not fame, but a name. But the name, as always in Scripture, is the expression of the essential nature; the meaning therefore is, "she will develope into a city over which men will rejoice, whenever her name is mentioned." On the following words, "for praise and for glory," i.e., for a subject of praise, etc., cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-11.htm">Jeremiah 13:11</a>. &#1500;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1497;, "to all," or "among all nations." How far Jerusalem becomes such is shown by the succeeding clauses: "who shall hear...and tremble and quake because of the good," i.e., not from fear "because they are seized with terror through these proofs of the wonderful power of God in contrast with the helplessness of their idols, and through the feeling of their miserable and destitute condition as contrasted with the happiness and prosperity of the people of Israel" (Graf). Against this usual view of the words, it has already been remarked in the Berleburger Bible, that it does not agree with what precedes, viz., with the statement that Jerusalem shall become a name of joy to all nations. Moreover, &#1508;&#1468;&#1495;&#1491; and &#1512;&#1490;&#1494;, in the sense of fear and terror, are construed with &#1502;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; or &#1502;&#1503;; here, they signify to shake and tremble for joy, like &#1508;&#1468;&#1495;&#1491; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-5.htm">Isaiah 60:5</a>, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/3-5.htm">Hosea 3:5</a>, i.e., as it is expressed in the Berleburger Bible, "not with a slavish fear, but with the filial fear of penitents, which will also draw and drive them to the reconciled God in Christ, with holy fear and trembling." Calvin had previously recognised this Messianic idea, and fitly elucidated the words thus: haec duo inter se conjuncta, nempe pavor et tremor, qui nos humiliet coram Deo, et fiducia quae nos erigat, ut audeamus familiariter ad ipsum accedere. &#1488;&#1493;&#1514;&#1501; may be for &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501;, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-16.htm">Jeremiah 1:16</a>; but probably &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; is construed with a double accusative, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-16.htm">Isaiah 42:16</a>.<p>The prosperity which the Lord designs to procure for His people, is, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-10.htm">Jeremiah 33:10-13</a>, further described in two strophes (<a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-10.htm">Jeremiah 33:10-11</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-12.htm">Jeremiah 33:12-13</a>); in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-10.htm">Jeremiah 33:10</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-11.htm">Jeremiah 33:11</a>, the joyous life of men. In the land now laid waste, gladness and joy shall once more prevail, and God will be praised for this. The description, "it is desolate," etc., does not imply the burning of Jerusalem, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-12.htm">Jeremiah 52:12</a>., but only the desolation which began about the end of the siege. "In this place" means "in this land;" this is apparent from the more detailed statement, "in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem." "The voice of gladness," etc., forms the subject of the verb &#1497;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;. On the expression see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-34.htm">Jeremiah 7:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-9.htm">Jeremiah 16:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-10.htm">Jeremiah 25:10</a>. There is here added: "the voice of those who say, 'Praise the Lord,' " etc. - the usual liturgic formula in thanksgiving to God; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/5-13.htm">2 Chronicles 5:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-3.htm">2 Chronicles 7:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/3-11.htm">Ezra 3:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-1.htm">Psalm 106:1</a>. &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1491;&#1492;, praise and thanks in word and deed; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-26.htm">Jeremiah 17:26</a>. On &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489; &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-44.htm">Jeremiah 32:44</a>. The rendering, "I shall bring back the captives of the land" (here as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-7.htm">Jeremiah 33:7</a>), is both grammatically indefensible, and further, unsuitable: (a) inappropriate, on account of &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1492;, for no previous restoration of captives had taken place; the leading of the people out of Egypt is never represented as a bringing back from captivity. And (b) it is grammatically untenable, because restoration to Canaan is expressed either by &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509;  &#1492;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488;, after <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/30-5.htm">Deuteronomy 30:5</a>; or by &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489;, with the mention of the place (); cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-15.htm">Jeremiah 16:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-6.htm">Jeremiah 24:6</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-37.htm">Jeremiah 32:37</a>, etc. </body></html>
