In “I have promised” we may indeed trace a distinct reference to that passage.

If this passage point at all to Zerubbabel, who was a good man, a descendant of David, and, though not a king, a ruler of the Jews, after their return from Babylon, and who governed with equity and not as Jehoiakim had done; yet it can only refer to him as a type of the Messiah, the <span class="ital">branch </span>out of the stem of Jesse, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-1.htm" title="And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a Branch shall grow out of his roots:">Isaiah 11:1</a>; <span class="ital">the branch of the Lord </span>that was to be <span class="ital">beautiful and glorious, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/4-2.htm" title="In that day shall the branch of the LORD be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and comely for them that are escaped of Israel.">Isaiah 4:2</a>; and the <span class="ital">righteous branch </span>that was to be <span class="ital">raised up unto </span>David, as he is described <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-5.htm" title="Behold, the days come, said the LORD, that I will raise to David a righteous Branch, and a King shall reign and prosper, and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth.">Jeremiah 23:5</a>, a passage exactly similar to this, and undoubtedly meant of the same person. See the notes on these passages. <span class="ital">In those days shall Judah be saved, </span>&c. — If, a temporal salvation be here at all intended, it must be, not that which the Jews enjoyed for a short season under the government of Zerubbabel, a deliverance and protection from, or security against their enemies, which was very imperfect, and frequently interrupted; but that more perfect salvation, peace, and prosperity, which they shall enjoy in the latter days, after their conversion to Christianity, and restoration to their own land, according to the predictions contained in this and the three preceding chapters. But a spiritual and eternal salvation undoubtedly is chiefly intended here, as well as in the parallel passage, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-6.htm" title="In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely: and this is his name whereby he shall be called, THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS.">Jeremiah 23:6</a>. <span class="ital">And this is the name wherewith ye shall be called, The Lord our righteousness</span> — According to this reading it is here foretold, that the name which properly belongs to the Messiah shall be given to Jerusalem, that is, to the church; “to signify,” says Lowth, “that it is in a peculiar manner dedicated to him, he having chosen it for the place of his residence, (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-35.htm" title="It was round about eighteen thousand measures: and the name of the city from that day shall be, The LORD is there.">Ezekiel 48:35</a>,) and that all the righteousness of the faithful, both their justification and sanctification, is derived from him. this seems,” adds he, “to be the genuine sense of the words, as may appear to any that will compare the original phrase here, <span class="greekheb">יקרא לה</span>, with <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/62-4.htm" title="You shall no more be termed Forsaken; neither shall your land any more be termed Desolate: but you shall be called Hephzibah, and your land Beulah: for the LORD delights in you, and your land shall be married.">Isaiah 62:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/62-12.htm" title="And they shall call them, The holy people, The redeemed of the LORD: and you shall be called, Sought out, A city not forsaken.">Isaiah 62:12</a>, where it is said of Zion, <span class="ital">Thou shalt be called Hephzibah, </span>or, <span class="ital">my delight is in her, and sought out, a city not forsaken. </span>Nor is there any greater impropriety in giving the name Jehovah to a city, than in calling an altar <span class="ital">Jehovah-nissi, </span>that is, <span class="ital">Jehovah my banner, </span>(<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/17-15.htm" title="And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it Jehovahnissi:">Exodus 17:15</a>,) and <span class="ital">Jehovah-shalom, Jehovah peace, </span>(<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-24.htm" title="Then Gideon built an altar there to the LORD, and called it Jehovahshalom: to this day it is yet in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.">Jdg 6:24</a>,) in token that the Lord was the author of those mercies of which the said altars were designed to be monuments. So the servants of God are described as having his name written upon their foreheads, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-12.htm" title="Him that overcomes will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go no more out: and I will write on him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, which is new Jerusalem, which comes down out of heaven from my God: and I will write on him my new name.">Revelation 3:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-1.htm" title="And I looked, and, see, a Lamb stood on the mount Sion, and with him an hundred forty and four thousand, having his Father's name written in their foreheads.">Revelation 14:1</a>; but several interpreters, particularly Huetius, and our learned Bishop Pearson, (in his <span class="ital">Exposition of the Creed, </span>p. 165,) render the words thus: <span class="ital">He that shall call her </span>[to be his peculiar people] <span class="ital">is the Lord our righteousness.” </span>Thus also Dr. Waterland and others. But Blaney, who renders the last clause of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-6.htm" title="In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely: and this is his name whereby he shall be called, THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS.">Jeremiah 23:6</a>, <span class="ital">This is the name by which Jehovah shall call him, </span>OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS, translates this, <span class="ital">And this is he whom Jehovah shall call </span>OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS, judging that the <span class="greekheb">ה</span>in <span class="greekheb">לה</span>, rendered <span class="ital">her, </span>is not the feminine pronoun affix, but the masculine, after the Chaldee form.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/33.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>33:14-26 To crown the blessings God has in store, here is a promise of the Messiah. He imparts righteousness to his church, for he is made of God to us righteousness; and believers are made the righteousness of God in him. Christ is our Lord God, our righteousness, our sanctification, and our redemption. His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom. But in this world prosperity and adversity succeed each other, as light and darkness, day and night. The covenant of priesthood shall be secured. And all true believers are a holy priesthood, a royal priesthood, they offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God; themselves, in the first place, as living sacrifices. The promises of that covenant shall have full accomplishment in the gospel Israel. In Ga 6:16, all that walk according to the gospel rule, are made to be the Israel of God, on whom shall be peace and mercy. Let us not despise the families which were of old the chosen people of God, though for a time they seem to be cast off.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/33.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>That good thing - Better, the good word <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-10.htm">Jeremiah 29:10</a>, with reference to the promise already given <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5-6</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/33.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14. perform&#8212;"I will make to rise"; God's promise having for a time seemed to "lie" dead and abortive [Calvin].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/33.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The Lord is not <span class="ital">yea</span> and <span class="ital">nay</span>, he cannot lie nor repent.

Or, "are coming" (t); future times are respected; yet such as would quickly come; five or six hundred years more, and then would be fulfilled what is after promised. This is ushered in with a "behold", as being a matter of importance, and deserving attention, and even as calling for admiration. This is the principal of the great and mighty things the Lord promised to show to the prophet, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-3.htm">Jeremiah 33:3</a>; even the coming of the Messiah, and what concerns his person and office: <p>that I will perform that good thing which I have promised unto the house of Israel and to the house of Judah; or, "that good word" (u); that gracious word concerning Christ and salvation by him; that mercy promised to the fathers; that good thing that came out of Nazareth: the good Shepherd that laid down his life for the sheep, preferable to the shepherds before spoken of: or rather, "that best word" (w); the positive used for the superlative, as frequent in the Hebrew language. Many good words or promises are made before, concerning the spiritual welfare and prosperity of the church; but this is the best of all; this is the better thing provided for saints under the Gospel dispensation, and promised to them, who are meant by the houses of Judah and Israel; for these phrases, as the Jews themselves allow, show that the words belong to the times of the Messiah; and which God, that is true and cannot lie, and who is faithful, that has promised, and is able to perform, will do. <p>(t) "venientes", Montanus, Schmidt.

The Kingly and Priestly Offices shall be re-established.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">14–26</span>. See introd. summary to the section. This portion of the ch. is clearly later than Jeremiah’s time. The expression “Levitical priests” (see on <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-18.htm" title="Neither shall the priests the Levites want a man before me to offer burnt offerings, and to kindle meat offerings, and to do sacrifice continually.">Jeremiah 33:18</a></span>) is not one which he uses elsewhere. Moreover, there is a considerable amount of repetition in the passage (cp. <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/33-14.htm" title="Behold, the days come, said the LORD, that I will perform that good thing which I have promised to the house of Israel and to the house of Judah....">Jeremiah 33:14-16</a></span> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-10.htm" title="For thus said the LORD, That after seventy years be accomplished at Babylon I will visit you, and perform my good word toward you, in causing you to return to this place.">Jeremiah 29:10</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-5.htm" title="Behold, the days come, said the LORD, that I will raise to David a righteous Branch, and a King shall reign and prosper, and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth.">Jeremiah 23:5</a> f., and <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-17.htm" title="For thus said the LORD; David shall never want a man to sit on the throne of the house of Israel;">Jeremiah 33:17</a></span> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-19.htm" title="Therefore thus said the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Jonadab the son of Rechab shall not want a man to stand before me for ever.">Jeremiah 35:19</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/33-20.htm" title="Thus said the LORD; If you can break my covenant of the day, and my covenant of the night, and that there should not be day and night in their season;...">Jeremiah 33:20-26</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-35.htm" title="Thus said the LORD, which gives the sun for a light by day, and the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night, which divides the sea when the waves thereof roar; The LORD of hosts is his name:">Jeremiah 31:35</a> f.). Above all, it is lacking in the LXX. It is very improbable that those translators would have designedly omitted such a proclamation of the Messianic hope, of the permanence of David’s line, and of the importance of the priestly office. The generally hopeful character of the passage also would have appealed to them. Gi., though deciding against the genuineness of the passage, considers that the phrase “Levitical priests” is so suitable to Jeremiah’s time, that here it must be considered as an archaism employed by a later writer. Co. summarily rejects the passage, and substitutes <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-7.htm" title="Therefore, behold, the days come, said the LORD, that they shall no more say, The LORD lives, which brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;">Jeremiah 23:7</a> f., as being most appropriate here, while at least suspicious in 23. in view of its varying position in MT. and LXX.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/33.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 14-26.</span> - These verses are omitted in the Septuagint, and some leading critics think that both the style and the contents point to a different author from our prophet. In particular it is urged that the promise of a multitude of Levites and of descendants of David is isolated among the prophecies of Jeremiah, who elsewhere speaks of a single great representative of David as the object of pious hope, and of the intercourse between Jehovah and his people as being closer and more immediate than under the old Law. A variation in the form of expressing the Messianic hope is, however, not of much importance. Isaiah, for instance, sometimes refers to a single ideal king (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>, etc.); sometimes to a succession of noble, God-fearing kings (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-1.htm">Isaiah 32:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-17.htm">Isaiah 33:17</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That good thing which I have promised;</span> viz. in the parallel passage, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5, 6</a> (which see). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/33.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>This prosperity gains stability and permanence through the people's being cleansed from their sins by their being forgiven, which, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-34.htm">Jeremiah 31:34</a>, will form the basis of the new covenant.
