Promises are given, not to do away, but to quicken and encourage prayer. These promises lead us to the gospel of Christ; and in that God has revealed truth to direct us, and peace to make us easy. All who by sanctifying grace are cleansed from the filth of sin, by pardoning mercy are freed from the guilt. When sinners are thus justified, washed, and sanctified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Holy Spirit, they are enabled to walk before God in peace and purity. Many are led to perceive the real difference between the people of God and the world around them, and to fear the Divine wrath. It is promised that the people who were long in sorrow, shall again be filled with joy. Where the Lord gives righteousness and peace, he will give all needful supplies for temporal wants; and all we have will be comforts, as sanctified by the word and by prayer.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/33.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>At the first - i. e., before their sins had provoked God to anger. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/33.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. cause &#8230; to return&#8212;that is, reverse (Jer 33:11; Jer 32:44).

Mention being made of the return of the captivity of Israel, or the ten tribes, as well as that of Judah, shows that this prophecy does not relate to the return of the Jews from their seventy years' captivity in Babylon; but is to be understood spiritually, of a release of the mystical and spiritual Israel of God from the captivity of sin, Satan, and the law, by the Messiah: <p>and will build them as at the first; in the latter day, as at the beginning or first times of the Gospel; when the temple of the Lord was built by Christ, as the chief master builder, and by his apostles under him, upon himself, the foundation of the apostles and prophets; he being the corner stone of it, whereby it became a habitation for God through the Spirit. Since that time, by means of heretics and false teachers, and especially by the man of sin, the tabernacle of David, or church of Christ, is greatly fallen into ruin, and needs rebuilding and repairing; and this will be done; and then it will be a beautiful structure, as at the first, or as it was in the times of the apostles; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-16.htm">Acts 15:16</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/33.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And I will cause the captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel to return, and will build them, as at the first.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/33.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">7</span>. <span class="ital">as at the first</span>] as in former times (those of the undivided kingdom).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/33.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will cause the captivity...  to return</span> (see on Jeremiah 29:14). <span class="cmt_word">Will build them</span> (see on Jeremiah 31:14). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/33.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>While Jeremiah was still in confinement in the court of the prison belonging to the palace (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-2.htm">Jeremiah 32:2</a>), the word of the Lord came to him the second time. This word of God is attached by &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;&#1514; to the promise of <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32.htm">Jeremiah 32</a>. It followed, too, not long, perhaps, after the other, which it further serves to confirm. - After the command to call on Him, that He might make known to him great and hidden things (<a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-2.htm">Jeremiah 33:2</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-3.htm">Jeremiah 33:3</a>), the Lord announces that, although Jerusalem shall be destroyed by the Chaldeans, He shall yet restore it, bring back the captives of Judah and Israel, purify the city from its iniquities, and make it the glory and praise of all the people of the earth (<a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-4.htm">Jeremiah 33:4-9</a>), so that in it and in the whole land joy will again prevail (<a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-10.htm">Jeremiah 33:10-13</a>). Then the Lord promises the restoration of the kingdom through the righteous sprout of David - of the priesthood, too, and sacrificial worship (<a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-14.htm">Jeremiah 33:14-18</a>); He promises also the everlasting duration of these two ordinances of grace (<a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-19.htm">Jeremiah 33:19-22</a>), because His covenant with the seed of Jacob and David shall be as enduring as the natural ordinance of day and night, and the laws of heaven and earth (<a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-23.htm">Jeremiah 33:23-26</a>). - The promises thus fall into two parts. First, there is proclaimed the restoration of the people and kingdom to a new and glorious state of prosperity (<a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-4.htm">Jeremiah 33:4-13</a>); then the re-establishment of the monarchy and the priesthood to a new and permanent condition (<a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-14.htm">Jeremiah 33:14-26</a>). In the first part, the promise given in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-36.htm">Jeremiah 32:36-44</a> is further carried out; in the second, the future form of the kingdom is more plainly depicted. </body></html>
