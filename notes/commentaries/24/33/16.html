There the title, “The Lord our Righteousness,” is given to the future King, and the passage has accordingly been used as a proof of the full divinity of the Christ, who is that King. Here it is given to the city, and, so given, can only mean that that name will be, as it were, the motto and watchword of her being. She will be a city marked by a righteousness which will be the gift of Jehovah; He will inscribe that name on her banners, and. grave it on her portals. It is obvious that this throws light on the meaning of the title as applied to the King.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/33.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>33:14-26 To crown the blessings God has in store, here is a promise of the Messiah. He imparts righteousness to his church, for he is made of God to us righteousness; and believers are made the righteousness of God in him. Christ is our Lord God, our righteousness, our sanctification, and our redemption. His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom. But in this world prosperity and adversity succeed each other, as light and darkness, day and night. The covenant of priesthood shall be secured. And all true believers are a holy priesthood, a royal priesthood, they offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God; themselves, in the first place, as living sacrifices. The promises of that covenant shall have full accomplishment in the gospel Israel. In Ga 6:16, all that walk according to the gospel rule, are made to be the Israel of God, on whom shall be peace and mercy. Let us not despise the families which were of old the chosen people of God, though for a time they seem to be cast off.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/33.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Compare the marginal reference.

Jerusalem&#8212;In Jer 23:6, instead of this, it is "Israel." "The name" in the Hebrew has here to be supplied from that passage; and for "he" (Messiah, the antitypical "Israel"), the antecedent there (Isa 49:3), we have "she" here, that is, Jerusalem. She is called by the same name as Messiah, "The Lord Our Righteousness," by virtue of the mystical oneness between her (as the literal representative of the spiritual Church) and her Lord and Husband. Thus, whatever belongs to the Head belongs also to the members (Eph 5:30, 32). Hence, the Church is called "Christ" (Ro 16:7; 1Co 12:12). The Church hereby professes to draw all her righteousness from Christ (Isa 45:24, 25). It is for the sake of Jerusalem, literal and spiritual, that God the Father gives this name (Jehovah, Tsidkenu, "The Lord our Righteousness") to Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/33.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">In those days shall Judah be saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell safely:</span> it is the opinion of some that a spiritual salvation and security is promised under these expressions, but the most and best interpreters rather understand it of a temporal salvation as primarily intended, though typical of that spiritual and eternal salvation which is often promised to the true Israel of God; as their rest in Canaan typified that rest which remaineth for the people of God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And this is the name wherewith she shall be called, The Lord our righteousness:</span> our translation of this phrase is something strange, the words in the Hebrew are hl adqy hx wgqa hwxy Pagnine translateth them, <span class="ital">and he who shall call it the Lord our righteousness</span>, supplying the verb substantive, <span class="ital">is</span>: He who shall call it <span class="ital">is the Lord our righteousness</span>. We translate it, <span class="ital">this is the name wherewith it shall be called</span>, &c.; that which causes the difficulty is, that the pronoun hz which signifieth he, is applied both to persons and things, and translated he or it, and the relative dva is of all cases, so may be translated who, or which, or with which; those words which our translators have supplied, is the name, are not in the Hebrew. This hath made a great doubt amongst interpreters, whether <span class="ital">The Lord our righteousness</span> be the name of Christ, or the name of the city. I do incline to their opinion who think that it is here mentioned as the name of Christ. In that sense there is nothing to be understood but the verb substantive, is, which is ordinarily understood; so the words are thus, and <span class="ital">he who shall call it, is, the Lord our righteousness</span>.

The elect of God among the Jews; and all such who are Jews inwardly, who truly believe in Christ, and confess his name, and praise him, and give him the glory or salvation. Judah signifies one that confesses or praises the Lord; such shall be saved from sin, Satan, the law, wrath, hell, and damnation, by the Branch of righteousness, the Messiah; who was raised up and sent to be a Saviour; came into the world for this purpose; has obtained salvation for his people; is the Captain and author of it; nor is it in any other; hence his name is called Jesus; and this salvation is to be had from him at all times; as in those days in which it was first wrought out, so throughout the whole Gospel dispensation: for "now is the day of salvation", <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-2.htm">2 Corinthians 6:2</a>; and indeed this is to be understood, not as exclusive of the Old Testament dispensation, when believers were saved by the same Lord Jesus as we are; only this is expressive of the impetration of this salvation by the incarnate Saviour; and of the more clear discovery and revelation of it; and of the application of it to a greater number of persons; and which is sure to all the spiritual seed of Christ, whether Jews or Gentiles, who "shall be saved" with an everlasting salvation: it is not said they "may" be saved, but they "shall" be saved; not may be saved if they will; or, however, this is not left on such a precarious footing; but they are made willing to be saved by Christ in the day of his power, yea, they are already saved: <p>and Jerusalem shall dwell safely; the inhabitants of it; such who are come to Mount Zion, the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem; these being saved by Christ, are in the utmost safety; they have nothing to fear from the justice of God, that is satisfied; nor from the law, that is fulfilled; nor from their enemies, they are conquered and destroyed; God is pacified towards them; is the God of peace with them; and they have peace with him, and enjoy great serenity and tranquillity of mind; and must needs dwell safely, since Jehovah is around them as the mountains around Jerusalem; Christ is their strong hold, into which they run and are safe; the Holy Spirit within them is greater and mightier than their enemies in the world; angels encamp about them, and salvation is walls and bulwarks to them: <p>and this is the name wherewith she shall be called, the Lord our righteousness; the same with the Messiah's name, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-6.htm">Jeremiah 23:6</a>; he is Jehovah; and he is our righteousness; the author of it, by his obedience, sufferings, and death; and which becomes ours by being wrought out for us, bestowed on us, imputed and applied to us. The Targum renders it here, as in the other place, <p>"this is the name wherewith they shall call him;'' <p>and so the Vulgate Latin version; but this is contrary to the Hebrew text, which has "her", and not "him". R. Joseph Kimchi reads it, "and this who calls her is the Lord our righteousness"; which is followed by some Christian writers (y). Some interpret it, who calls her by his Gospel to the salvation promised and performed; others, who calls her to dwell safely; others render it, "this is the name with which he the Lord shall call him, for her", for the sake of the church, the Lord our righteousness (z); but David Kimchi and Ben Melech take the sense to be this, <p>"the holy blessed God shall call Jerusalem the Lord our righteousness;'' <p>and certain it is that this is the name imposed on the church here meant, as Hephzibah and Beulah, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/62-4.htm">Isaiah 62:4</a>; and why may she not be as well called "Jehovah Tzidhenu", the Lord our righteousness, as "Jehovah Shammah", the Lord is there? <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-35.htm">Ezekiel 48:35</a>. She is called "Jehovah", not as deified by him, but as united to him; and our "righteousness", as justified by him. Christ and his church are one, as head and members are; and therefore are called by the same name: hence the church is called Christ, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12</a>; they are in a marriage relation; Christ is the husband, and the church is his spouse; and as husband and wife bear the same name, so do Christ and his church; moreover, not only Christ is made righteousness to his people, but they are made the righteousness of God in him; his righteousness is put upon them, and imputed to them, so that they are righteous as he is righteous, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-30.htm">1 Corinthians 1:30</a>. <p>(y)      "et iste qui vocabit eam est Dominus nostra justitia", Pagninus, Montanus, Vatablus; "hic est ille qui vocabit eam, ad se, Jehova justitia nostra", Gussetius.

But the name, as always in Scripture, is the expression of the essential nature; the meaning therefore is, "she will develope into a city over which men will rejoice, whenever her name is mentioned." On the following words, "for praise and for glory," i.e., for a subject of praise, etc., cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-11.htm">Jeremiah 13:11</a>. &#1500;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1497;, "to all," or "among all nations." How far Jerusalem becomes such is shown by the succeeding clauses: "who shall hear...and tremble and quake because of the good," i.e., not from fear "because they are seized with terror through these proofs of the wonderful power of God in contrast with the helplessness of their idols, and through the feeling of their miserable and destitute condition as contrasted with the happiness and prosperity of the people of Israel" (Graf). Against this usual view of the words, it has already been remarked in the Berleburger Bible, that it does not agree with what precedes, viz., with the statement that Jerusalem shall become a name of joy to all nations. Moreover, &#1508;&#1468;&#1495;&#1491; and &#1512;&#1490;&#1494;, in the sense of fear and terror, are construed with &#1502;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; or &#1502;&#1503;; here, they signify to shake and tremble for joy, like &#1508;&#1468;&#1495;&#1491; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-5.htm">Isaiah 60:5</a>, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/3-5.htm">Hosea 3:5</a>, i.e., as it is expressed in the Berleburger Bible, "not with a slavish fear, but with the filial fear of penitents, which will also draw and drive them to the reconciled God in Christ, with holy fear and trembling." Calvin had previously recognised this Messianic idea, and fitly elucidated the words thus: haec duo inter se conjuncta, nempe pavor et tremor, qui nos humiliet coram Deo, et fiducia quae nos erigat, ut audeamus familiariter ad ipsum accedere. &#1488;&#1493;&#1514;&#1501; may be for &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501;, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-16.htm">Jeremiah 1:16</a>; but probably &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; is construed with a double accusative, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-16.htm">Isaiah 42:16</a>.<p>The prosperity which the Lord designs to procure for His people, is, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-10.htm">Jeremiah 33:10-13</a>, further described in two strophes (<a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-10.htm">Jeremiah 33:10-11</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-12.htm">Jeremiah 33:12-13</a>); in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-10.htm">Jeremiah 33:10</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-11.htm">Jeremiah 33:11</a>, the joyous life of men. In the land now laid waste, gladness and joy shall once more prevail, and God will be praised for this. The description, "it is desolate," etc., does not imply the burning of Jerusalem, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-12.htm">Jeremiah 52:12</a>., but only the desolation which began about the end of the siege. "In this place" means "in this land;" this is apparent from the more detailed statement, "in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem." "The voice of gladness," etc., forms the subject of the verb &#1497;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;. On the expression see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-34.htm">Jeremiah 7:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-9.htm">Jeremiah 16:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-10.htm">Jeremiah 25:10</a>. There is here added: "the voice of those who say, 'Praise the Lord,' " etc. - the usual liturgic formula in thanksgiving to God; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/5-13.htm">2 Chronicles 5:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-3.htm">2 Chronicles 7:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/3-11.htm">Ezra 3:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-1.htm">Psalm 106:1</a>. &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1491;&#1492;, praise and thanks in word and deed; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-26.htm">Jeremiah 17:26</a>.

The rendering, "I shall bring back the captives of the land" (here as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-7.htm">Jeremiah 33:7</a>), is both grammatically indefensible, and further, unsuitable: (a) inappropriate, on account of &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1492;, for no previous restoration of captives had taken place; the leading of the people out of Egypt is never represented as a bringing back from captivity. And (b) it is grammatically untenable, because restoration to Canaan is expressed either by &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509;  &#1492;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488;, after <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/30-5.htm">Deuteronomy 30:5</a>; or by &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489;, with the mention of the place (); cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-15.htm">Jeremiah 16:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-6.htm">Jeremiah 24:6</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-37.htm">Jeremiah 32:37</a>, etc. </body></html>
