The “streets” are, more strictly, the “open places,” the “bazaars,” or even the “outskirts” of the city, which were deserted during the progress of the siege. Now they were waste and silent.

The sum of this verse is, that those who were carried into captivity should return, and, upon their return, should be in their former state as to civil transactions, marrying and giving in marriage; and, as to religion, should publicly praise the Lord with holy and spiritual joy, as they had been wont to do in the best and most prosperous times of their commonwealth, which was fulfilled, as we see, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/nehemiah/12-27.htm" title="And at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought the Levites out of all their places, to bring them to Jerusalem, to keep the dedication with gladness, both with thanksgivings, and with singing, with cymbals, psalteries, and with harps....">Nehemiah 12:27-40</a>.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/33.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>33:1-13 Those who expect to receive comforts from God, must call upon him. Promises are given, not to do away, but to quicken and encourage prayer. These promises lead us to the gospel of Christ; and in that God has revealed truth to direct us, and peace to make us easy. All who by sanctifying grace are cleansed from the filth of sin, by pardoning mercy are freed from the guilt. When sinners are thus justified, washed, and sanctified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Holy Spirit, they are enabled to walk before God in peace and purity. Many are led to perceive the real difference between the people of God and the world around them, and to fear the Divine wrath. It is promised that the people who were long in sorrow, shall again be filled with joy. Where the Lord gives righteousness and peace, he will give all needful supplies for temporal wants; and all we have will be comforts, as sanctified by the word and by prayer.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/33.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Which ye say shall be desolate - Of which ye say, It is desolate ...

Behold, I will apply a bandage to it and a remedy, and will heal them, and will reveal to them abundance of peace and truth. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-7.htm">Jeremiah 33:7</a>. And I will turn again the captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel, and will build them up as at the first. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-8.htm">Jeremiah 33:8</a>. And I will purify them from all their iniquity by which they have sinned against me, and will pardon all their iniquities, by which they have sinned and have transgressed against me. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-9.htm">Jeremiah 33:9</a>. And it (the city) shall become to me a name of joy, a praise, and an honour among all the people of the earth that shall hear all the good which I do them, and shall tremble and quake because of all the good and because of all the prosperity that I show to it. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-10.htm">Jeremiah 33:10</a>. Thus saith Jahveh: Again shall there be heard in this place-of which ye say, 'It is desolate, without man and without beast,'-in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, which are laid waste, without men, and without inhabitants, and without beasts, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-11.htm">Jeremiah 33:11</a>.

In the cities of the hill-country, in the cities of the plain, and in the cities of the south, in the land of Benjamin, and in the environs of Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, the flock shall yet pass under the hand of one who counts them, saith Jahveh."<p>With <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-4.htm">Jeremiah 33:4</a> begins the statement concerning the great and incomprehensible things which the Lord will make known to His people; it is introduced by &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, which marks the ground or reason - so far as the mere statement of these things gives reason for the promise of them. The word of the Lord does not follow till <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-6.htm">Jeremiah 33:6</a> and onwards. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-4.htm">Jeremiah 33:4</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-5.htm">Jeremiah 33:5</a> are mentioned those whom the word concerns - the houses of Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-4.htm">Jeremiah 33:4</a>), and the people that defend the city (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-5.htm">Jeremiah 33:5</a>). Corresponding to this order, there comes first the promise to the city (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-6.htm">Jeremiah 33:6</a>), and then to the people. Along with the houses of the city are specially named also the houses of the kings of Judah; not, perhaps, as Hitzig thinks, because these, being built of stone, afforded a more suitable material for the declared object - for that these alone were built of stone is an unfounded supposition - but in order to show that no house or palace is spared to defend the city. "Which are broken down" refers to the houses, not only of the kings, but also of the city. They are broken, pulled down, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-10.htm">Isaiah 22:10</a>, in order to fortify the walls of the city against the attacks of the enemy, partly to strengthen them, partly to repair the damage caused by the battering-rams directed against them. This gives the following meaning to the expression &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1505;&#1468;&#1500;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514; &#1493;&#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1495;&#1512;&#1489;: in order to work against the mounds, i.e., the earthworks erected by the enemy, and against the sword. The sword is named as being the chief weapon, instead of all the instruments of war which the enemy employs for reducing the city; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/26-9.htm">Ezekiel 26:9</a>. It is against the laws of grammar to understand &#1504;&#1514;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; as referring to the destruction of the enemy by the siege material; for, on such a supposition, &#1488;&#1500;&#1470; would require to designate the efficient cause, i.e., to stand for &#1502;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-26.htm">Jeremiah 4:26</a>), but neither &#1488;&#1500;&#1470; nor &#1506;&#1500; can mean this. - The first half of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-5.htm">Jeremiah 33:5</a> is difficult, especially &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501;, which the lxx have omitted, and which Movers and Hitzig would expunge, with the absurd remark, that it has come here from <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-38.htm">Jeremiah 31:38</a>; this is an easy and frivolous method of setting aside difficulties. All other ancient translations have read &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501;, and have attempted to point out how its genuineness is ascertained on critical grounds.<p>(Note: The different attempts to solve the difficulty by conjectures are of such a nature as scarcely to deserve mention. Ewald would change &#1492;&#1495;&#1512;&#1489; &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501; into &#1492;&#1495;&#1512;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501; otni , "that are broken down opposite the earthworks and the cannons." But the plural of &#1495;&#1512;&#1489; is &#1495;&#1512;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/26-21.htm">Ezekiel 26:21</a>, and cannot possibly mean cannons. E. Meier would read &#1492;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1489; &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501;, "and for the destruction of those who are pressing in." Then &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501; must be the enemy who are pressing in; but how does this agree with what follows, "in order to fight with the Chaldeans"? Lastly, Ngelsbach would change &#1488;&#1514;&#1470; &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;into &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, to obtain the idea that the earthworks and the sword come for the purpose of contending against Jerusalem (!).)<p>To connect &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501; closely with what precedes is impossible; and to understand it as referring to the houses, quae dirutae adhibentur ad dimicandum cum Chaldaeis (C. B. Michaelis), is incompatible with the idea contained in &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1488;. Still more inadmissible is the view of L. de Dieu, Venema, Schnurrer, Dahler, and Rosenmller: venientibus ad oppugnandum cum Chaldaeis; according to this view, &#1488;&#1468;&#1514;&#1470;&#1499;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; must be the nominative or subject to &#1500;&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1495;&#1501; &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501; can only signify, "to contend with the Chaldeans" (against them); cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-5.htm">Jeremiah 32:5</a>. According to this view, only the Jews can be the subject of &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501;. "They come to make war with the Chaldeans, and to fill them (the houses) with the dead bodies of men, whom I((the Lord) slay in my wrath." The subject is not named, since it is evident from the whole scope of the sentence what is meant. We take the verse as a predication regarding the issues of the conflict - but without a copula; or, as a statement added parenthetically, so that the participle may be rendered, "while they come," or, "get ready, to fight." &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1488;, used of the approach of an enemy (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/1-1.htm">Daniel 1:1</a>), is here employed with regard to the advance of the Jews to battle against the besiegers of the city. The second infinitival clause, "to fill them," represents the issue of the struggle as contemplated by the Jews, in order to express most strongly its utter fruitlessness; while the relative clauses, "whom I have slain," etc., bring out the reasons for the evil consequences. Substantially, the statement in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-5.htm">Jeremiah 33:5</a> is parallel to that in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-4.htm">Jeremiah 33:4</a>, so that we might supply the preposition &#1506;&#1500; (&#1493;&#1506;&#1500;): "and concerning those who come to fight," etc. Through the attachment of this second predication to the first by means of the participle, the expression has become obscured. In the last clause, &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; is to be connected with &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1512;&#1506;&#1514;&#1501;.<p>In view of the destruction of Jerusalem now beginning, the Lord promises, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-6.htm">Jeremiah 33:6</a>, "I will apply to it (the city) a bandage (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-17.htm">Jeremiah 30:17</a>) and a remedy," i.e., a bandage which brings healing, "and heal them" (the inhabitants); for, although the suffix in &#1512;&#1508;&#1488;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501; might be referred to the houses, yet the following clause shows that it points to the inhabitants. Hitzig takes &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497; in the meaning of &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1500;, "I roll to them like a stream," and appeals to <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-24.htm">Amos 5:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-18.htm">Isaiah 48:18</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-12.htm">Isaiah 66:12</a>, where the fulness of prosperity is compared to a stream, and the waves of the sea; but this use of &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492; is as uncertain here as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-20.htm">Jeremiah 11:20</a>. We keep, then, to the well-established sense of revealing, making known (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/98-2.htm">Psalm 98:2</a>, where it is parallel with &#1492;&#1493;&#1491;&#1497;&#1506;), without any reference to the figure of sealed treasure-chambers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-12.htm">Deuteronomy 28:12</a>), but with the accessory notion of the unfolding of the prosperity before all nations (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-9.htm">Jeremiah 33:9</a>), as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/98-2.htm">Psalm 98:2</a>. &#1506;&#1514;&#1512;&#1514; is here to be taken as a noun, "fulness, wealth," from &#1506;&#1514;&#1512;, an Aramaizing form for &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, to be rich (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-13.htm">Ezekiel 35:13</a>). &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1501; &#1493;&#1488;&#1502;&#1514; does not mean "prosperity and stability," but "peace and truth;" but this is not to be toned down to "true peace," i.e., real, enduring happiness (Ngelsbach). &#1488;&#1502;&#1514; is the truth of God, i.e., His faithfulness in His promises and covenants, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/85-11.htm">Psalm 85:11-12</a>, where mercy and truth, righteousness and peace, are specified as the gracious benefits with which the Lord blesses His people. </body></html>
