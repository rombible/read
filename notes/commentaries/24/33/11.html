The Courts of the Temple, now hushed in silence, should once again re-echo with the Hallelujahs of the Priests and Levites. The “sacrifice of praise” (the same phrase as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-26.htm" title="And they shall come from the cities of Judah, and from the places about Jerusalem, and from the land of Benjamin, and from the plain, and from the mountains, and from the south, bringing burnt offerings, and sacrifices, and meat offerings, and incense, and bringing sacrifices of praise, to the house of the LORD.">Jeremiah 17:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/56-12.htm" title="Your vows are on me, O God: I will render praises to you.">Psalm 56:12</a>) may be either “the sacrifice which consists in praise,” or the “sacrifices of thanksgiving” of <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-12.htm" title="If he offer it for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer with the sacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mingled with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and cakes mingled with oil, of fine flour, fried.">Leviticus 7:12</a>, which were offered in acknowledgment of special blessings. The ground of the thanksgiving in either case would be that the Lord had “turned again the captivity” of Jacob. The phrase was a familiar one, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/14-7.htm" title="Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! when the LORD brings back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.">Psalm 14:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/53-6.htm" title="Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion!

Promises are given, not to do away, but to quicken and encourage prayer. These promises lead us to the gospel of Christ; and in that God has revealed truth to direct us, and peace to make us easy. All who by sanctifying grace are cleansed from the filth of sin, by pardoning mercy are freed from the guilt. When sinners are thus justified, washed, and sanctified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Holy Spirit, they are enabled to walk before God in peace and purity. Many are led to perceive the real difference between the people of God and the world around them, and to fear the Divine wrath. It is promised that the people who were long in sorrow, shall again be filled with joy. Where the Lord gives righteousness and peace, he will give all needful supplies for temporal wants; and all we have will be comforts, as sanctified by the word and by prayer.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/33.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Praise the Lord ... - The customary formula of thanksgiving in many of the later Psalms, and from its occurrence in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/5-13.htm">2 Chronicles 5:13</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-3.htm">2 Chronicles 7:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-6.htm">2 Chronicles 7:6</a> ff probably a regular part of the liturgical service of the temple.<p>Shall say ... shall bring the sacrifice of praise - Or, say ... as they bring praise, i. e., a thank-offering (see the marginal reference) into the house of the Lord<p>At the first - Before the captivity, and when still unpolluted by the sins which have brought upon it so heavy a chastisement. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/33.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11.

Such is the voice of the Gospel to all sensible sinners; whose eyes are opened to see their lost estate; whose ears are opened to hear the joyful sound: whose hearts are opened to attend to the things spoken in it; who are humble and contrite, wounded and broken in spirit, and have a spiritual understanding of things given them: to these the Gospel preached is glad tidings of great joy; since it contains in it the doctrines of peace and pardon through the blood of Christ; of justification through his righteousness; of rest in him, and salvation by him. It is a voice of joy and gladness to all believers in Christ; since hereby they hear of Christ whom they love; they hear of the love of God in him, and of the love of him to them; it is food to their souls; and when found, under the hearing of it, it is the joy and rejoicing of their hearts; and whereas they are continually sinning in thought, word, or deed, the doctrine of pardon must be joyful to them. Moreover, this may be meant of the voice of those that come to the church of God, with songs of joy and gladness, for electing, redeeming, calling, pardoning, and justifying grace; the voice of young converts, and of all them that rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/35-10.htm">Isaiah 35:10</a>; and why may not the ordinance of singing psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, be included? since those are enjoined to be sung, and are sung in Gospel churches, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-19.htm">Ephesians 5:19</a>; <p>the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride; which, literally understood, is expressive of great joy and happiness; as the contrary signifies great calamity and distress; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-34.htm">Jeremiah 7:34</a>. It may be understood of such who are in such a natural relation to one another; and yet their voice may intend their joining together in spiritual praise to God. Moreover, by the "bridegroom" may be meant Christ, who has espoused his people to himself, and is their husband, and behaves as such towards them, in all tenderness, care, love, and affection; and his voice was heard in Judea's land as the bridegroom; John heard it, and rejoiced at it, and so did many others; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/9-15.htm">Matthew 9:15</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-29.htm">John 3:29</a>; and the Gospel indeed is no other than his voice; and a soul quickening, soul comforting, and soul alluring, and charming voice it is. And by the "bride" may be meant the church, who is the bride, the Lamb's wife, being married to him; whose voice of prayer and praise to Christ, and of encouragement to sensible sinners, is heard in Zion, and is very desirable, Sol 2:14; <p>the voice of them that shall say, praise the Lord of hosts; the husband of his church, and Redeemer of his people, and who is the sovereign Lord of all; the voice of such is heard, who stir up others to this work and service, and enforce it by the reasons following: <p>for the Lord is good; originally and essentially in himself, and the fountain of goodness to others; the good Head and Husband of his church; the good Samaritan: the good Shepherd of his sheep, and Saviour of his people: <p>for his mercy endureth for ever; it is from everlasting to everlasting; in his love and pity he has redeemed his church; and this is seen in his tender care of her, and will endure to eternal life: these words seem to be taken out of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-1.htm">Psalm 106:1</a>; and were used by the Jews at the laying of the foundation of the second temple, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/3-11.htm">Ezra 3:11</a>; <p>and of them that shall bring the sacrifice of praise into the house of the Lord; the church of the living God, the materials of which are lively stones, or true believers in Christ; into which none should enter without an offering; and this should be a spiritual one, the sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving; which God has enjoined as well pleasing to him, because it glorifies him. This shows that this prophecy belongs to Gospel times; since no other sacrifice is mentioned as brought into the house of God but the sacrifice of praise. And remarkable is the note of Kimchi on this passage; <p>"he does not say a sin offering, or a trespass offering, because at this time there will be no ungodly persons and sinners among them, for they shall all know the Lord. And so our Rabbins of blessed memory say, all offerings shall cease in time to come (the times of the Messiah) but the sacrifice of praise;'' <p>for I will cause to return the captivity of the land as at the first,  <p>saith the Lord: a release from spiritual captivity, or redemption by Christ; being the foundation of all solid joy, praise, and thanksgiving. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/33.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The voice of joy, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the voice of them that shall say, <span class="cverse3">{i}</span> Praise the LORD of hosts: for the LORD <i>is</i> good; for his mercy <i>endureth</i> for ever: <i>and</i> of them that shall bring the sacrifice of praise into the house of the LORD.

The word of the Lord does not follow till <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-6.htm">Jeremiah 33:6</a> and onwards. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-4.htm">Jeremiah 33:4</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-5.htm">Jeremiah 33:5</a> are mentioned those whom the word concerns - the houses of Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-4.htm">Jeremiah 33:4</a>), and the people that defend the city (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-5.htm">Jeremiah 33:5</a>). Corresponding to this order, there comes first the promise to the city (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-6.htm">Jeremiah 33:6</a>), and then to the people. Along with the houses of the city are specially named also the houses of the kings of Judah; not, perhaps, as Hitzig thinks, because these, being built of stone, afforded a more suitable material for the declared object - for that these alone were built of stone is an unfounded supposition - but in order to show that no house or palace is spared to defend the city. "Which are broken down" refers to the houses, not only of the kings, but also of the city. They are broken, pulled down, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-10.htm">Isaiah 22:10</a>, in order to fortify the walls of the city against the attacks of the enemy, partly to strengthen them, partly to repair the damage caused by the battering-rams directed against them. This gives the following meaning to the expression &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1505;&#1468;&#1500;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514; &#1493;&#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1495;&#1512;&#1489;: in order to work against the mounds, i.e., the earthworks erected by the enemy, and against the sword. The sword is named as being the chief weapon, instead of all the instruments of war which the enemy employs for reducing the city; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/26-9.htm">Ezekiel 26:9</a>. It is against the laws of grammar to understand &#1504;&#1514;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; as referring to the destruction of the enemy by the siege material; for, on such a supposition, &#1488;&#1500;&#1470; would require to designate the efficient cause, i.e., to stand for &#1502;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-26.htm">Jeremiah 4:26</a>), but neither &#1488;&#1500;&#1470; nor &#1506;&#1500; can mean this. - The first half of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-5.htm">Jeremiah 33:5</a> is difficult, especially &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501;, which the lxx have omitted, and which Movers and Hitzig would expunge, with the absurd remark, that it has come here from <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-38.htm">Jeremiah 31:38</a>; this is an easy and frivolous method of setting aside difficulties. All other ancient translations have read &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501;, and have attempted to point out how its genuineness is ascertained on critical grounds.<p>(Note: The different attempts to solve the difficulty by conjectures are of such a nature as scarcely to deserve mention. Ewald would change &#1492;&#1495;&#1512;&#1489; &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501; into &#1492;&#1495;&#1512;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501; otni , "that are broken down opposite the earthworks and the cannons." But the plural of &#1495;&#1512;&#1489; is &#1495;&#1512;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/26-21.htm">Ezekiel 26:21</a>, and cannot possibly mean cannons. E. Meier would read &#1492;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1489; &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501;, "and for the destruction of those who are pressing in." Then &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501; must be the enemy who are pressing in; but how does this agree with what follows, "in order to fight with the Chaldeans"? Lastly, Ngelsbach would change &#1488;&#1514;&#1470; &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;into &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, to obtain the idea that the earthworks and the sword come for the purpose of contending against Jerusalem (!).)<p>To connect &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501; closely with what precedes is impossible; and to understand it as referring to the houses, quae dirutae adhibentur ad dimicandum cum Chaldaeis (C. B. Michaelis), is incompatible with the idea contained in &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1488;. Still more inadmissible is the view of L. de Dieu, Venema, Schnurrer, Dahler, and Rosenmller: venientibus ad oppugnandum cum Chaldaeis; according to this view, &#1488;&#1468;&#1514;&#1470;&#1499;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; must be the nominative or subject to &#1500;&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1495;&#1501; &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501; can only signify, "to contend with the Chaldeans" (against them); cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-5.htm">Jeremiah 32:5</a>. According to this view, only the Jews can be the subject of &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501;. "They come to make war with the Chaldeans, and to fill them (the houses) with the dead bodies of men, whom I((the Lord) slay in my wrath." The subject is not named, since it is evident from the whole scope of the sentence what is meant. We take the verse as a predication regarding the issues of the conflict - but without a copula; or, as a statement added parenthetically, so that the participle may be rendered, "while they come," or, "get ready, to fight." &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1488;, used of the approach of an enemy (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/1-1.htm">Daniel 1:1</a>), is here employed with regard to the advance of the Jews to battle against the besiegers of the city. The second infinitival clause, "to fill them," represents the issue of the struggle as contemplated by the Jews, in order to express most strongly its utter fruitlessness; while the relative clauses, "whom I have slain," etc., bring out the reasons for the evil consequences. Substantially, the statement in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-5.htm">Jeremiah 33:5</a> is parallel to that in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-4.htm">Jeremiah 33:4</a>, so that we might supply the preposition &#1506;&#1500; (&#1493;&#1506;&#1500;): "and concerning those who come to fight," etc. Through the attachment of this second predication to the first by means of the participle, the expression has become obscured. In the last clause, &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; is to be connected with &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1512;&#1506;&#1514;&#1501;.<p>In view of the destruction of Jerusalem now beginning, the Lord promises, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-6.htm">Jeremiah 33:6</a>, "I will apply to it (the city) a bandage (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-17.htm">Jeremiah 30:17</a>) and a remedy," i.e., a bandage which brings healing, "and heal them" (the inhabitants); for, although the suffix in &#1512;&#1508;&#1488;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501; might be referred to the houses, yet the following clause shows that it points to the inhabitants. Hitzig takes &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497; in the meaning of &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1500;, "I roll to them like a stream," and appeals to <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-24.htm">Amos 5:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-18.htm">Isaiah 48:18</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-12.htm">Isaiah 66:12</a>, where the fulness of prosperity is compared to a stream, and the waves of the sea; but this use of &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492; is as uncertain here as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-20.htm">Jeremiah 11:20</a>. We keep, then, to the well-established sense of revealing, making known (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/98-2.htm">Psalm 98:2</a>, where it is parallel with &#1492;&#1493;&#1491;&#1497;&#1506;), without any reference to the figure of sealed treasure-chambers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-12.htm">Deuteronomy 28:12</a>), but with the accessory notion of the unfolding of the prosperity before all nations (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-9.htm">Jeremiah 33:9</a>), as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/98-2.htm">Psalm 98:2</a>. &#1506;&#1514;&#1512;&#1514; is here to be taken as a noun, "fulness, wealth," from &#1506;&#1514;&#1512;, an Aramaizing form for &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, to be rich (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-13.htm">Ezekiel 35:13</a>). &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1501; &#1493;&#1488;&#1502;&#1514; does not mean "prosperity and stability," but "peace and truth;" but this is not to be toned down to "true peace," i.e., real, enduring happiness (Ngelsbach). &#1488;&#1502;&#1514; is the truth of God, i.e., His faithfulness in His promises and covenants, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/85-11.htm">Psalm 85:11-12</a>, where mercy and truth, righteousness and peace, are specified as the gracious benefits with which the Lord blesses His people. </body></html>
