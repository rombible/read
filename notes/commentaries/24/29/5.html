It counselled a patient acceptance of the present state of things. It announced, as the next verse does yet more emphatically, that their exile would last for at least two generations. It indicates, also, the comparative leniency with which the exiles were treated. They were allowed to become possessors both of lands and houses. The favour shown to Daniel and his friends would, of course, tend to make their condition more tolerable.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/29.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>29:1-7 The written word of God is as truly given by inspiration of God as his spoken word. The zealous servant of the Lord will use every means to profit those who are far off, as well as those who are near him. The art of writing is very profitable for this end; and by the art of printing it is rendered most beneficial for circulating the knowledge of the word of God. God's sending to the captives by this letter would show that he had not forsaken them, though he was displeased, and corrected them. If they live in the fear of God, they may live comfortably in Babylon. In all conditions of life, it is our wisdom and duty not to throw away the comfort of what we may have, because we have not all we would have. They are directed to seek the good of the country where they were captives. While the king of Babylon protected them, they must live quiet and peaceable lives under him, in all godliness and honesty; patiently leaving it to God to work deliverance for them in due time.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/29.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>As the exile was God's doing for their good, they were to make the best of their position, and acquire wealth and influence; whereas if they were always restlessly looking out for the opportunity of returning home, they would rapidly fall into poverty and dwindle away.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/29.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5.

Intimating hereby that they must not expect a return into their own land in any short time, but that they should continue many years where they were; suggesting also, that as they had ability, so they should have liberty, of building themselves houses; nor should they be interrupted by their enemies; nor would their houses be taken from them, when built; but they should dwell peaceably and quietly in them, as their own; which they might assure themselves of from the Lord, who gives these, and the following directions: <p>and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them; and live as comfortably as you can in a foreign country; plant your gardens with vines and pomegranates, and all sorts of fruitful trees the country produces; and fear not the fruit being taken away from you; depend upon it, you shall eat the fruit of your own labour, and not be deprived of it. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/29.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Build ye houses, and dwell in them; and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them;</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/28.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Lord's testimony against Hananiah. - Apparently not long after Jeremiah had departed, he received from the Lord the commission to go to Hananiah and to say to him: <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/28-13.htm">Jeremiah 28:13</a>. "Thus saith Jahveh: Yokes of wood hast thou broken, but hast made in place of them yokes of iron. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/28-14.htm">Jeremiah 28:14</a>. For thus saith Jahveh of hosts, the God of Israel: A yoke of iron I lay upon the neck of all these nations, that they may serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and they shall serve him; and the beasts of the field also have I given him." - When the prophet says: Yokes of wood hast thou broken, etc., we are not to understand him as speaking of the breaking of the wooden yoke Jeremiah had been wearing; he gives the deeper meaning of that occurrence. By breaking Jeremiah's wooden yoke, Hananiah has only signified that the yoke Nebuchadnezzar lays on the nations will not be so easily broken as a wooden one, but is of iron, i.e., not to be broken. The plural "yokes" is to be explained by the emblematical import of the words, and is not here to be identified, as it sometimes may be, with the singular, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/28-10.htm">Jeremiah 28:10</a>. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/28-14.htm">Jeremiah 28:14</a> shows in what sense Hananiah put an iron yoke in the place of the wooden one: Jahveh will lay iron yokes on all nations, that they may serve the king of Babel. Hananiah's breaking the wooden yoke does not alter the divine decree, but is made to contribute to its fuller revelation. With the last clause of <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/28-14.htm">Jeremiah 28:14</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-6.htm">Jeremiah 27:6</a>. - Hereupon Jeremiah forewarns the false prophets what is to be God's punishment on them for their false and audacious declarations. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/28-15.htm">Jeremiah 28:15</a>. "Hear now, Hananiah: Jahveh hath not sent thee, and thou hast made this people to believe a lie. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/28-16.htm">Jeremiah 28:16</a>. Therefore thus saith Jahveh: Behold, I cast thee from off the face of the earth; this year shalt thou die, for thou hast spoken rebellion against Jahveh." "The year"  equals  this year, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-30.htm">Isaiah 37:30</a>. The words "for thou hast spoken," etc., recall <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/13-6.htm">Deuteronomy 13:6</a>. They involve an application to Hananiah's case of the command there given to put such a prophet to death, and show how it can with justice be said that the Lord will cast him from off the face of the earth. The verb &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1495;&#1498; is chosen for the sake of the play on &#1500;&#1488; &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495;&#1498;. God has not sent him as prophet to His people, but will send him away from off the earth, i.e., cause him to die. - In <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/28-17.htm">Jeremiah 28:17</a> it is recorded that this saying was soon fulfilled. Hananiah died in the seventh month of that year, i.e., two months after his controversy with Jeremiah (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/28-1.htm">Jeremiah 28:1</a>). </body></html>
