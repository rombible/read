The English word “villainy” is used definitely with this meaning by Bishop Hall (<span class= "ital">Sat. i.</span> 9).<p><span class= "bld">Even I know, and am a witness, saith the Lord.</span>—The words find an echo in <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-5.htm" title="And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against false swearers, and against those that oppress the hireling in his wages, the widow, and the fatherless, and that turn aside the stranger from his right, and fear not me, said the LORD of hosts.">Malachi 3:5</a>. We are left to conjecture whether the prophet refers his own knowledge of the facts to a direct supernatural source, or had received private information from his friends at Babylon. The special stress laid on the Lord’s knowledge of their guilt suggests the thought that the false prophets with their restricted ideas of God had persuaded themselves that Jehovah the God of Israel hardly exercised his attributes of power in a distant place like Babylon. There they might sin without fear of detection or of punishment. They thought of him as a God not nigh at hand, but far off (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-23.htm" title="Am I a God at hand, said the LORD, and not a God afar off?">Jeremiah 23:23</a>).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/29.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>29:20-32 Jeremiah foretells judgments upon the false prophets, who deceived the Jews in Babylon. Lying was bad; lying to the people of the Lord, to delude them into a false hope, was worse; but pretending to rest their own lies upon the God of truth, was worst of all. They flattered others in their sins, because they could not reprove them without condemning themselves. The most secret sins are known to God; and there is a day coming when he will bring to light all the hidden works of darkness. Shemaiah urges the priests to persecute Jeremiah. Their hearts are wretchedly hardened who justify doing mischief by having power to do it. They were in a miserable thraldom for mocking the messengers of the Lord, and misusing his prophets; yet in their distress they trespass still more against the Lord. Afflictions will not of themselves cure men of their sins, unless the grace of God works with them. Those who slight the blessings, deserve to lose the benefit of God's word, like Shemaiah. The accusations against many active Christians in all ages, amount to no more than this, that they earnestly counsel men to attend to their true interest and duties, and to wait for the performance of God's promises in his appointed way.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/29.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Villany - Elsewhere folly, in the sense of lewdness <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/20-6.htm">Judges 20:6</a>, unchastity. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/29.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>23. villainy&#8212;literally, "sinful folly" (Isa 32:6).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/29.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The reason here given must not be understood as the reason of the king of Babylon’s punishment of them, but why God gave them up into his hands, because they had committed <span class="bld">villany</span> or <span class="ital">folly</span> in Israel; which is expounded by the next words, they had <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">committed adultery with their neighbours’ wives.</span> All sin is <span class="ital">folly</span>, and so called in Scripture, uncleanness particularly, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/34-7.htm" title="And the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard it: and the men were grieved, and they were very wroth, because he had worked folly in Israel in lying with Jacob's daughter: which thing ought not to be done.">Genesis 34:7</a></span>; here it is called villany, to denote the heinousness of it, especially in those whose office it was to teach others that they ought not to do it, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-22.htm" title="You that say a man should not commit adultery, do you commit adultery? you that abhor idols, do you commit sacrilege?">Romans 2:22</a></span>.

Or "folly" (f); as the sins of adultery, and prophesying falsely, are afterwards mentioned. This was not the reason why the king of Babylon put them to death; though the Jews (g) have a tradition that they attempted the chastity of Nebuchadnezzar's daughter, for which reason he case them into a furnace; but rather it was on account of their prophesying immediate destruction to Babylon; and telling the captives that they should be delivered in a short time; and stirring them up to prepare to go to their own land; but the reasons here given are those which moved the Lord to deliver them into the hands of the king of Babylon for their destruction: <p>and have committed adultery with their neighbours' wives; which was a piece of villany, as well as folly; and which abundantly showed that these men were not the prophets of the Lord, or were sent by him, being such impure wretches: <p>and have spoken lying words in my name, which I have not commanded them; as that the people should return to their own land in a short time; this was another part of their villany and folly, and for which they were given up into the hands of the king of Babylon, to be punished: <p>even I know, and am a witness, saith the Lord; for though their adulteries might be very secretly committed, and their lying prophecies were not seen to be such by the people in common; yet God, who is omniscient, saw all their impurity, and knew all their lies and falsehood, and was, and would be, a swift witness against them, here and hereafter.

"If ye say: Jahveh hath raised us up prophets in Babylon - <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-16.htm">Jeremiah 29:16</a>. Yea, thus saith Jahveh of the king that sitteth upon the throne of David, and of all the people that dwelleth in this city, your brethren that are not gone forth with you into captivity, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-17.htm">Jeremiah 29:17</a>. Thus saith Jahveh of hosts: Behold, I send amongst them the sword, famine, and pestilence, and make them like horrible figs, that cannot be eaten for badness, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-18.htm">Jeremiah 29:18</a>. And hunt after them with the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, and give them to be abused to all the kingdoms of the earth, to be a curse, and an astonishment, and a hissing, and a reproach among all the peoples whither I have driven them; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-19.htm">Jeremiah 29:19</a>. Inasmuch as they have not hearkened to my words, saith Jahveh, wherewith I sent to them my servants the prophets, from early morning on sending them, and ye have not hearkened, saith Jahveh. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-20.htm">Jeremiah 29:20</a>. But ye, hear the word of Jahveh, all ye captives whom I have sent from Jerusalem to Babylon." - The design with which Jeremiah tells the captives of this judgment may be gathered from the terms of <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-15.htm">Jeremiah 29:15</a>, with which this prophecy is introduced: God had raised up to us prophets in Babel (&#1489;&#1468;&#1489;&#1500;&#1492;, lit., as far as Babel, i.e., extending His agency so far beyond the bounds of Judah). Hence it is clear that the announcement of judgment to come on those left in the land is in direct opposition to the predictions of the prophets that had appeared in Babylon. these prophesied a swift end to Chaldean domination and an immediate return of the exiles to their fatherland. So long as one of David's posterity sat on his throne in Jerusalem, and so long as the kingdom of Judah was maintained, the partial captivity of the people and removal of the plundered treasures of the temple would appear as a calamity which might soon be repaired. The false prophets in Babylon laid, therefore, great stress on the continued existence of the kingdom, with its capital and the temple, in their efforts to obtain belief amongst the exiles. As Ng. justly remarks, it was to take this ground from beneath their feet that Jeremiah predicted expulsion and destruction against the people of Jerusalem. The prophecy does indeed bear upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, "but not in the first reference; its immediate purpose was to overthrow the foundations on which the false prophets of the exile stood" (Ng.). Taken thus, these verses form and integral part of the message sent by Jeremiah to the exiles, which was of no small weight for quieting the excitement, nourished by the false prophets, which reigned amongst them. One is struck by the want of connection between <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-15.htm">Jeremiah 29:15</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-16.htm">Jeremiah 29:16</a>. The beginning of <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-16.htm">Jeremiah 29:16</a>, "Yea, thus saith," comes directly after the end of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-15.htm">Jeremiah 29:15</a> without any joining link. Ng. holds the &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; to be the pleonastic &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; which often introduces a saying. But its position before the "thus saith" makes this impossible. Here it serves to strengthen the asseveration: yea, thus fitly introducing what Jahveh says to the contrary; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-15.htm">Jeremiah 29:15</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-16.htm">Jeremiah 29:16</a> are, tersely and immediately, set over against one another. "If ye say" means: as regards your saying that Jahveh hath raised you up prophets in Babylon, the answer is: Thus hath Jahveh said. This is the connection of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-16.htm">Jeremiah 29:16</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-15.htm">Jeremiah 29:15</a>.<p>(Note: By the above exposition of the connection and progress of the thought, are disposed of all the objections that have been brought by Houb., Lud. Capp., Ven., etc., against the genuineness of these verses, or, at least, against the true position for them. The fact of their being wanting in the lxx, on which Hitz. mainly grounds his charge of spuriousness, proves nothing more than that these translators were unable to understand the train of thought in the verses, especially seeing that the substance of them has several times been expressed by Jeremiah, particularly <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-17.htm">Jeremiah 29:17</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-18.htm">Jeremiah 29:18</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-9.htm">Jeremiah 24:9-10</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-4.htm">Jeremiah 15:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-8.htm">Jeremiah 19:8</a>; with <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-19.htm">Jeremiah 29:19</a> cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-13.htm">Jeremiah 7:13</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-25.htm">Jeremiah 7:25</a>. Against the attempts to alter the text, Graf's remarks are admirable: "It is much easier to explain how the passage was omitted as out of place by the lxx than to show how it could have been introduced as an interpolation. It is too long for a mere marginal gloss that had at a later time found its way into the text; and why it should have been placed here, would remain all the more incomprehensible if it were so wholly unconnected with the body of the text. We cannot admit that it is merely an erroneous displacement of b. 15, which originally stood before <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-21.htm">Jeremiah 29:21</a>; since it is less likely that <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-16.htm">Jeremiah 29:16</a> could have come directly after <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-14.htm">Jeremiah 29:14</a>. In respect of form, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-16.htm">Jeremiah 29:16-20</a> is connected with and forms a continuation of what precedes. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-20.htm">Jeremiah 29:20</a> implies the presence of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-16.htm">Jeremiah 29:16</a> as an antithesis, and at the same time completes again the connection that had been interrupted with <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-15.htm">Jeremiah 29:15</a>, and leads on to <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-21.htm">Jeremiah 29:21</a>. Connection in thought seems to be wanting only because <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-16.htm">Jeremiah 29:16</a> does not express the connecting idea, and because the contrast is so abrupt." - The other arguments adduced by Hitz. to throw suspicion on the passage, we can afford to pass over as wholly without force.)<p>"Your brethren that," etc., is co-ordinate with "all the people." The words: "I make them like horrible figs," make allusion to the vision in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-2.htm">Jeremiah 24:2</a>., but do not imply that this vision was known to the exiles, for they are quite intelligible to him who knows nothing of <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-1.htm">Jeremiah 24:1-10</a> (Ng.). The adject. &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512; is found only here, from &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512;, shudder; horrible, that on tasting which one shudders. With <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-18.htm">Jeremiah 29:18</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-9.htm">Jeremiah 24:9</a>. "Wherewith I sent my servants," i.e., commissioned them. This verb construed with double accus. as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-22.htm">2 Samuel 11:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>. "Ye have not hearkened," the 2nd pers. instead of the 3rd, is hardly to be explained by the fact that the prophet here cites in full an often quoted saying (Hitz., Ng., etc.). The reason is that the prophet is thinking of the exiles also as having been equal to their brethren remaining in Judah in the matter of not hearkening. Thus the way is prepared for the summons: But ye, hear, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-20.htm">Jeremiah 29:20</a>. </body></html>
