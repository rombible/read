They would seem to have been the leaders of the party of revolt, and to have been conspicuous, like their brethren at Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-14.htm" title="I have seen also in the prophets of Jerusalem an horrible thing: they commit adultery, and walk in lies: they strengthen also the hands of evildoers, that none does return from his wickedness; they are all of them to me as Sodom, and the inhabitants thereof as Gomorrah.">Jeremiah 23:14</a>), for base and profligate lives. The record of the prediction of their fate implies its fulfilment. They were punished by the Chaldæan king as traitors and rebels, and were burnt alive. The history of the “three children” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/3-6.htm" title="And whoever falls not down and worships shall the same hour be cast into the middle of a burning fiery furnace.">Daniel 3:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/3-20.htm" title="And he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace.">Daniel 3:20</a>, shows that this was a sufficiently familiar punishment. A strange legend in the Targum of Rabbi Joseph on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-3.htm" title="Moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and burnt his children in the fire, after the abominations of the heathen whom the LORD had cast out before the children of Israel.">2Chronicles 28:3</a> records that the future high-priest Joshua, the son of Jozedek, was thrown into the furnace with them, and came out uninjured (Smith’s <span class= "ital">Dict, of the Bible, </span>Art. “Zedekiah”). We may, perhaps, trace the source of the legend in the figurative language of <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/3-2.htm" title="And the LORD said to Satan, The LORD rebuke you, O Satan; even the LORD that has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you: is not this a brand plucked out of the fire?">Zechariah 3:2</a>, “Is not this a brand plucked out of the fire?” The name Kolaiah (which admits of being derived from a verb meaning “roasting”) possibly suggested the cruel mockery of a punishment which turned it into an omen of the false prophet’s fate.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/29.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>29:20-32 Jeremiah foretells judgments upon the false prophets, who deceived the Jews in Babylon. Lying was bad; lying to the people of the Lord, to delude them into a false hope, was worse; but pretending to rest their own lies upon the God of truth, was worst of all. They flattered others in their sins, because they could not reprove them without condemning themselves. The most secret sins are known to God; and there is a day coming when he will bring to light all the hidden works of darkness. Shemaiah urges the priests to persecute Jeremiah. Their hearts are wretchedly hardened who justify doing mischief by having power to do it. They were in a miserable thraldom for mocking the messengers of the Lord, and misusing his prophets; yet in their distress they trespass still more against the Lord. Afflictions will not of themselves cure men of their sins, unless the grace of God works with them. Those who slight the blessings, deserve to lose the benefit of God's word, like Shemaiah. The accusations against many active Christians in all ages, amount to no more than this, that they earnestly counsel men to attend to their true interest and duties, and to wait for the performance of God's promises in his appointed way.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/29.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Vile - The word does not occur elsewhere, but comes from a root signifying to shudder, and thus has an intense meaning. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/29.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21.

What the falsehoods they published were is not expressed, but it is most probable they were some of those that pretended that God had revealed to them, that within two years, or a short time, the captives carried away with Jehoiakim should return out of Babylon. God here tells those that were of the captivity, that those two wretches should themselves be slain by the king of Babylon. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/29.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel,....

Of these two prophets nothing further is known. The LXX omit the fathers’ names, and the words “which prophesy … name.” Co. denies, while Du. and Gi. admit, the historical accuracy of the story, Du. pointing out that, had the prediction not been fulfilled, the passage would not have appeared in the Book.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Kolaiah, curse</span> (kĕlâlâh) and <span class="ital">roasted</span> (kâlâh) are three such similar words that a play on them as used in these verses seems intended.

The name is into-resting; it shows that this prophet belonged to a family which took pleasure in the thought of Jehovah and his righteousness. Doubtless, too, he did so himself; but he under-estimated the demands of that righteousness, which extended to the heart as well as to the outward conduct. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/29.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Jeremiah informs the captives of the judgments that is to gall on such as are still left in the land. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-15.htm">Jeremiah 29:15</a>. "If ye say: Jahveh hath raised us up prophets in Babylon - <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-16.htm">Jeremiah 29:16</a>. Yea, thus saith Jahveh of the king that sitteth upon the throne of David, and of all the people that dwelleth in this city, your brethren that are not gone forth with you into captivity, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-17.htm">Jeremiah 29:17</a>. Thus saith Jahveh of hosts: Behold, I send amongst them the sword, famine, and pestilence, and make them like horrible figs, that cannot be eaten for badness, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-18.htm">Jeremiah 29:18</a>. And hunt after them with the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, and give them to be abused to all the kingdoms of the earth, to be a curse, and an astonishment, and a hissing, and a reproach among all the peoples whither I have driven them; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-19.htm">Jeremiah 29:19</a>. Inasmuch as they have not hearkened to my words, saith Jahveh, wherewith I sent to them my servants the prophets, from early morning on sending them, and ye have not hearkened, saith Jahveh. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-20.htm">Jeremiah 29:20</a>. But ye, hear the word of Jahveh, all ye captives whom I have sent from Jerusalem to Babylon." - The design with which Jeremiah tells the captives of this judgment may be gathered from the terms of <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-15.htm">Jeremiah 29:15</a>, with which this prophecy is introduced: God had raised up to us prophets in Babel (&#1489;&#1468;&#1489;&#1500;&#1492;, lit., as far as Babel, i.e., extending His agency so far beyond the bounds of Judah). Hence it is clear that the announcement of judgment to come on those left in the land is in direct opposition to the predictions of the prophets that had appeared in Babylon. these prophesied a swift end to Chaldean domination and an immediate return of the exiles to their fatherland. So long as one of David's posterity sat on his throne in Jerusalem, and so long as the kingdom of Judah was maintained, the partial captivity of the people and removal of the plundered treasures of the temple would appear as a calamity which might soon be repaired. The false prophets in Babylon laid, therefore, great stress on the continued existence of the kingdom, with its capital and the temple, in their efforts to obtain belief amongst the exiles. As Ng. justly remarks, it was to take this ground from beneath their feet that Jeremiah predicted expulsion and destruction against the people of Jerusalem. The prophecy does indeed bear upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, "but not in the first reference; its immediate purpose was to overthrow the foundations on which the false prophets of the exile stood" (Ng.). Taken thus, these verses form and integral part of the message sent by Jeremiah to the exiles, which was of no small weight for quieting the excitement, nourished by the false prophets, which reigned amongst them. One is struck by the want of connection between <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-15.htm">Jeremiah 29:15</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-16.htm">Jeremiah 29:16</a>. The beginning of <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-16.htm">Jeremiah 29:16</a>, "Yea, thus saith," comes directly after the end of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-15.htm">Jeremiah 29:15</a> without any joining link. Ng. holds the &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; to be the pleonastic &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; which often introduces a saying. But its position before the "thus saith" makes this impossible. Here it serves to strengthen the asseveration: yea, thus fitly introducing what Jahveh says to the contrary; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-15.htm">Jeremiah 29:15</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-16.htm">Jeremiah 29:16</a> are, tersely and immediately, set over against one another. "If ye say" means: as regards your saying that Jahveh hath raised you up prophets in Babylon, the answer is: Thus hath Jahveh said. This is the connection of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-16.htm">Jeremiah 29:16</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-15.htm">Jeremiah 29:15</a>.<p>(Note: By the above exposition of the connection and progress of the thought, are disposed of all the objections that have been brought by Houb., Lud. Capp., Ven., etc., against the genuineness of these verses, or, at least, against the true position for them. The fact of their being wanting in the lxx, on which Hitz. mainly grounds his charge of spuriousness, proves nothing more than that these translators were unable to understand the train of thought in the verses, especially seeing that the substance of them has several times been expressed by Jeremiah, particularly <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-17.htm">Jeremiah 29:17</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-18.htm">Jeremiah 29:18</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-9.htm">Jeremiah 24:9-10</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-4.htm">Jeremiah 15:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-8.htm">Jeremiah 19:8</a>; with <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-19.htm">Jeremiah 29:19</a> cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-13.htm">Jeremiah 7:13</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-25.htm">Jeremiah 7:25</a>. Against the attempts to alter the text, Graf's remarks are admirable: "It is much easier to explain how the passage was omitted as out of place by the lxx than to show how it could have been introduced as an interpolation. It is too long for a mere marginal gloss that had at a later time found its way into the text; and why it should have been placed here, would remain all the more incomprehensible if it were so wholly unconnected with the body of the text. We cannot admit that it is merely an erroneous displacement of b. 15, which originally stood before <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-21.htm">Jeremiah 29:21</a>; since it is less likely that <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-16.htm">Jeremiah 29:16</a> could have come directly after <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-14.htm">Jeremiah 29:14</a>. In respect of form, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-16.htm">Jeremiah 29:16-20</a> is connected with and forms a continuation of what precedes. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-20.htm">Jeremiah 29:20</a> implies the presence of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-16.htm">Jeremiah 29:16</a> as an antithesis, and at the same time completes again the connection that had been interrupted with <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-15.htm">Jeremiah 29:15</a>, and leads on to <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-21.htm">Jeremiah 29:21</a>. Connection in thought seems to be wanting only because <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-16.htm">Jeremiah 29:16</a> does not express the connecting idea, and because the contrast is so abrupt." - The other arguments adduced by Hitz. to throw suspicion on the passage, we can afford to pass over as wholly without force.)<p>"Your brethren that," etc., is co-ordinate with "all the people." The words: "I make them like horrible figs," make allusion to the vision in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-2.htm">Jeremiah 24:2</a>., but do not imply that this vision was known to the exiles, for they are quite intelligible to him who knows nothing of <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-1.htm">Jeremiah 24:1-10</a> (Ng.). The adject. &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512; is found only here, from &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512;, shudder; horrible, that on tasting which one shudders. With <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-18.htm">Jeremiah 29:18</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-9.htm">Jeremiah 24:9</a>. "Wherewith I sent my servants," i.e., commissioned them. This verb construed with double accus. as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-22.htm">2 Samuel 11:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>. "Ye have not hearkened," the 2nd pers. instead of the 3rd, is hardly to be explained by the fact that the prophet here cites in full an often quoted saying (Hitz., Ng., etc.). The reason is that the prophet is thinking of the exiles also as having been equal to their brethren remaining in Judah in the matter of not hearkening. Thus the way is prepared for the summons: But ye, hear, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-20.htm">Jeremiah 29:20</a>. </body></html>
