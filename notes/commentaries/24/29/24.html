It gives, in fact (as <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-28.htm" title="For therefore he sent to us in Babylon, saying, This captivity is long: build you houses, and dwell in them; and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them.">Jeremiah 29:28</a> shows), the sequence of events, and so far stands in the same relation to it as the Second Epistle to the Corinthians does to the First. Jeremiah’s letter had naturally roused the indignation of the rival prophets at Babylon, and they organised a movement, of which Shemaiah was the chief instigator, for his destruction. Of Shemaiah himself we know nothing more than is here recorded. The description “Nehelamite” gives us no information, as the name Nehelam does not appear as belonging to any person or place in the Old Testament. It is just possible, as in the marginal reading, that there may be a play upon the Hebrew word (<span class= "ital">Halam</span>) for “dreamer.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/jeremiah/29.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/29-24.htm" title="Thus shall you also speak to Shemaiah the Nehelamite, saying,...">Jeremiah 29:24-28</a></span>. <span class="ital">Thus shalt thou speak to Shemaiah the Nehelamite </span>— Or, <span class="ital">the dreamer, </span>as the word <span class="greekheb">הנחלמי</span>, is rendered in the margin: see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-8.htm" title="For thus said the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Let not your prophets and your diviners, that be in the middle of you, deceive you, neither listen to your dreams which you cause to be dreamed.">Jeremiah 29:8</a>. The termination, however, rather shows it to be a word expressing Shemaiah’s family or country, and we find such a place as <span class="ital">Helam </span>mentioned, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_samuel/10-16.htm" title="And Hadarezer sent, and brought out the Syrians that were beyond the river: and they came to Helam; and Shobach the captain of the host of Hadarezer went before them....">2 Samuel 10:16-17</a>. The prophet, it seems, was commanded to send this message to Shemaiah after the messengers who delivered the forementioned writing to the captives at Babylon were returned home, who brought along with them Shemaiah’s letter, mentioned in the following verse. <span class="ital">Because thou hast sent letters to Zephaniah, </span>(see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-1.htm" title="The word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD, when king Zedekiah sent to him Pashur the son of Melchiah, and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, saying,">Jeremiah 21:1</a>,) <span class="ital">saying, The Lord hath made thee priest </span>— Shemaiah directs his letter to Zephaniah in the first place, as being next in order to the high-priest, and therefore called the <span class="ital">second priest, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-24.htm" title="And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door:">Jeremiah 52:24</a>, and tells him that God has appointed him to supply the place of the high- priest, being probably absent at that time, who was either Azariah, or Seraiah his son. But who then, it may be asked, was Jehoiada? “Perhaps,” says Blaney, “he was one that had been superseded in his office of second priest, for being remiss in his duty; and therefore Zephaniah may have been here reminded of him, by way of intimation that, as they had been both appointed for the same purposes, so Zephaniah might expect the same fate as his predecessor, if he copied the example of his negligence. The second priest officiated as substitute of the high-priest, in case of absence or indisposition, and perhaps was always invested with subordinate authority.” <span class="ital">That ye should be officers, &c., for every man that is mad, </span>&c. — The prophets and inspired persons were often accused of madness, or of being possessed with an evil spirit, by their enemies.

Lying was bad; lying to the people of the Lord, to delude them into a false hope, was worse; but pretending to rest their own lies upon the God of truth, was worst of all. They flattered others in their sins, because they could not reprove them without condemning themselves. The most secret sins are known to God; and there is a day coming when he will bring to light all the hidden works of darkness. Shemaiah urges the priests to persecute Jeremiah. Their hearts are wretchedly hardened who justify doing mischief by having power to do it. They were in a miserable thraldom for mocking the messengers of the Lord, and misusing his prophets; yet in their distress they trespass still more against the Lord. Afflictions will not of themselves cure men of their sins, unless the grace of God works with them. Those who slight the blessings, deserve to lose the benefit of God's word, like Shemaiah. The accusations against many active Christians in all ages, amount to no more than this, that they earnestly counsel men to attend to their true interest and duties, and to wait for the performance of God's promises in his appointed way.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/29.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A narrative showing the effects of Jeremiah's letter.

This suggestion, however, Zephaniah is so far from following that he shews the letter to the prophet, who writes again to Babylon, this time for the purpose of condemning Shemaiah’s conduct in the severest terms, and announcing its penalty.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The narrative forms an interesting supplement to the earlier part of the ch. Its form, it is true, leaves much to be desired, and Du. in fact describes it as exhibiting utter confusion, resulting from successive modifications. It is clearly one of the additions made by Baruch or by later hands. The charge brought by Jeremiah is introduced by the “Because” of <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-25.htm" title="Thus speaks the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, Because you have sent letters in your name to all the people that are at Jerusalem, and to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, and to all the priests, saying,">Jeremiah 29:25</a></span>, and continuing to the end of <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-28.htm" title="For therefore he sent to us in Babylon, saying, This captivity is long: build you houses, and dwell in them; and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them.">Jeremiah 29:28</a></span>, remains incomplete.

Great excitement had been caused among the so-called prophets in Babylon by the emphatic language of Jeremiah. Accordingly one of them, named Shemaiah, wrote letters to the Jews at home, and especially to a high official called Zephaniah (see on ver. 26) to put a stop to Jeremiah's bold agitation. Zephaniah, however, was not the man for whom Shemaiah took him, and read the letter to the intended victim. Upon this, Jeremiah received a special revelation, announcing dire punishment to Shemaiah and his family (according to the principle of the Divine government described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To Shemaiah</span>; or, <span class="accented">of</span>, <span class="accented">concerning</span> (as the same preposition is rendered in vers. 16, 21, 31). The oracle itself speaks of Shemaiah in the third person (vers. 31, 32). The Authorized Version, however, can be defended by its accordance with ver. 25. <span class="cmt_word">The Nehelamite</span>. This is evidently a patronymic, but whether of the family or the locality of the bearer cannot be decided. The analogy of "Jeremiah of Anathoth" (ver. 27), however, favors the view that it is local. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/29.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Jeremiah informs the captives of the judgments that is to gall on such as are still left in the land. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-15.htm">Jeremiah 29:15</a>. "If ye say: Jahveh hath raised us up prophets in Babylon - <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-16.htm">Jeremiah 29:16</a>. Yea, thus saith Jahveh of the king that sitteth upon the throne of David, and of all the people that dwelleth in this city, your brethren that are not gone forth with you into captivity, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-17.htm">Jeremiah 29:17</a>. Thus saith Jahveh of hosts: Behold, I send amongst them the sword, famine, and pestilence, and make them like horrible figs, that cannot be eaten for badness, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-18.htm">Jeremiah 29:18</a>. And hunt after them with the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, and give them to be abused to all the kingdoms of the earth, to be a curse, and an astonishment, and a hissing, and a reproach among all the peoples whither I have driven them; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-19.htm">Jeremiah 29:19</a>. Inasmuch as they have not hearkened to my words, saith Jahveh, wherewith I sent to them my servants the prophets, from early morning on sending them, and ye have not hearkened, saith Jahveh. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-20.htm">Jeremiah 29:20</a>. But ye, hear the word of Jahveh, all ye captives whom I have sent from Jerusalem to Babylon." - The design with which Jeremiah tells the captives of this judgment may be gathered from the terms of <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-15.htm">Jeremiah 29:15</a>, with which this prophecy is introduced: God had raised up to us prophets in Babel (&#1489;&#1468;&#1489;&#1500;&#1492;, lit., as far as Babel, i.e., extending His agency so far beyond the bounds of Judah). Hence it is clear that the announcement of judgment to come on those left in the land is in direct opposition to the predictions of the prophets that had appeared in Babylon. these prophesied a swift end to Chaldean domination and an immediate return of the exiles to their fatherland. So long as one of David's posterity sat on his throne in Jerusalem, and so long as the kingdom of Judah was maintained, the partial captivity of the people and removal of the plundered treasures of the temple would appear as a calamity which might soon be repaired. The false prophets in Babylon laid, therefore, great stress on the continued existence of the kingdom, with its capital and the temple, in their efforts to obtain belief amongst the exiles. As Ng. justly remarks, it was to take this ground from beneath their feet that Jeremiah predicted expulsion and destruction against the people of Jerusalem. The prophecy does indeed bear upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, "but not in the first reference; its immediate purpose was to overthrow the foundations on which the false prophets of the exile stood" (Ng.). Taken thus, these verses form and integral part of the message sent by Jeremiah to the exiles, which was of no small weight for quieting the excitement, nourished by the false prophets, which reigned amongst them. One is struck by the want of connection between <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-15.htm">Jeremiah 29:15</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-16.htm">Jeremiah 29:16</a>. The beginning of <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-16.htm">Jeremiah 29:16</a>, "Yea, thus saith," comes directly after the end of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-15.htm">Jeremiah 29:15</a> without any joining link. Ng. holds the &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; to be the pleonastic &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; which often introduces a saying. But its position before the "thus saith" makes this impossible. Here it serves to strengthen the asseveration: yea, thus fitly introducing what Jahveh says to the contrary; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-15.htm">Jeremiah 29:15</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-16.htm">Jeremiah 29:16</a> are, tersely and immediately, set over against one another. "If ye say" means: as regards your saying that Jahveh hath raised you up prophets in Babylon, the answer is: Thus hath Jahveh said. This is the connection of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-16.htm">Jeremiah 29:16</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-15.htm">Jeremiah 29:15</a>.<p>(Note: By the above exposition of the connection and progress of the thought, are disposed of all the objections that have been brought by Houb., Lud. Capp., Ven., etc., against the genuineness of these verses, or, at least, against the true position for them. The fact of their being wanting in the lxx, on which Hitz. mainly grounds his charge of spuriousness, proves nothing more than that these translators were unable to understand the train of thought in the verses, especially seeing that the substance of them has several times been expressed by Jeremiah, particularly <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-17.htm">Jeremiah 29:17</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-18.htm">Jeremiah 29:18</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-9.htm">Jeremiah 24:9-10</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-4.htm">Jeremiah 15:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-8.htm">Jeremiah 19:8</a>; with <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-19.htm">Jeremiah 29:19</a> cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-13.htm">Jeremiah 7:13</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-25.htm">Jeremiah 7:25</a>. Against the attempts to alter the text, Graf's remarks are admirable: "It is much easier to explain how the passage was omitted as out of place by the lxx than to show how it could have been introduced as an interpolation. It is too long for a mere marginal gloss that had at a later time found its way into the text; and why it should have been placed here, would remain all the more incomprehensible if it were so wholly unconnected with the body of the text. We cannot admit that it is merely an erroneous displacement of b. 15, which originally stood before <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-21.htm">Jeremiah 29:21</a>; since it is less likely that <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-16.htm">Jeremiah 29:16</a> could have come directly after <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-14.htm">Jeremiah 29:14</a>. In respect of form, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-16.htm">Jeremiah 29:16-20</a> is connected with and forms a continuation of what precedes. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-20.htm">Jeremiah 29:20</a> implies the presence of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-16.htm">Jeremiah 29:16</a> as an antithesis, and at the same time completes again the connection that had been interrupted with <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-15.htm">Jeremiah 29:15</a>, and leads on to <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-21.htm">Jeremiah 29:21</a>. Connection in thought seems to be wanting only because <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-16.htm">Jeremiah 29:16</a> does not express the connecting idea, and because the contrast is so abrupt." - The other arguments adduced by Hitz. to throw suspicion on the passage, we can afford to pass over as wholly without force.)<p>"Your brethren that," etc., is co-ordinate with "all the people." The words: "I make them like horrible figs," make allusion to the vision in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-2.htm">Jeremiah 24:2</a>., but do not imply that this vision was known to the exiles, for they are quite intelligible to him who knows nothing of <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-1.htm">Jeremiah 24:1-10</a> (Ng.). The adject. &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512; is found only here, from &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512;, shudder; horrible, that on tasting which one shudders. With <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-18.htm">Jeremiah 29:18</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-9.htm">Jeremiah 24:9</a>. "Wherewith I sent my servants," i.e., commissioned them. This verb construed with double accus. as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-22.htm">2 Samuel 11:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>. "Ye have not hearkened," the 2nd pers. instead of the 3rd, is hardly to be explained by the fact that the prophet here cites in full an often quoted saying (Hitz., Ng., etc.). The reason is that the prophet is thinking of the exiles also as having been equal to their brethren remaining in Judah in the matter of not hearkening. Thus the way is prepared for the summons: But ye, hear, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-20.htm">Jeremiah 29:20</a>. </body></html>
