Lying was bad; lying to the people of the Lord, to delude them into a false hope, was worse; but pretending to rest their own lies upon the God of truth, was worst of all. They flattered others in their sins, because they could not reprove them without condemning themselves. The most secret sins are known to God; and there is a day coming when he will bring to light all the hidden works of darkness. Shemaiah urges the priests to persecute Jeremiah. Their hearts are wretchedly hardened who justify doing mischief by having power to do it. They were in a miserable thraldom for mocking the messengers of the Lord, and misusing his prophets; yet in their distress they trespass still more against the Lord. Afflictions will not of themselves cure men of their sins, unless the grace of God works with them. Those who slight the blessings, deserve to lose the benefit of God's word, like Shemaiah. The accusations against many active Christians in all ages, amount to no more than this, that they earnestly counsel men to attend to their true interest and duties, and to wait for the performance of God's promises in his appointed way.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/29.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Officers - Deputy high priests who had the oversight of the temple.<p>Mad - See <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-11.htm">2 Kings 9:11</a> note.

"Thus saith Jahveh, the God of hosts, of Ahab the son of Kolaiah, and of Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah, who prophesy to you in my name falsely: Behold, I give them into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, that he may smite them before your eyes. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-22.htm">Jeremiah 29:22</a>. And of them shall be taken up a curse by all the exiles of Judah that are in Babylon, saying: Jahveh make thee like Zedekiah and like Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-23.htm">Jeremiah 29:23</a>. Because they have done folly in Israel, and have committed adultery with their neighbours' wives, and have spoken in my name lying words which I have not commanded them. But I know it and am witness, saith Jahveh." - Beyond what is here told, we know nothing of these two pseudo-prophets. The name &#1488;&#1495;&#1488;&#1489; is written in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-20.htm">Jeremiah 29:20</a> without &#1488;; thus the Kametz comes to be under the &#1495;, and in consequence of this the Pathach is changed into a Seghol "Smite," i.e., slay. The manner of their death is called, probably with allusion to the name Kolaiah, &#1511;&#1500;&#1492;, roast, burn in a heated furnace; a mode of execution usual in Babylon, acc. to <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/3-6.htm">Daniel 3:6</a>. This punishment is to fall on them because of two kinds of sin: 1. Because they have done folly in Israel, namely, committed adultery with their neighbours' wives; 2. Because they have prophesied falsely in the name of Jahveh. Except in <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/7-15.htm">Joshua 7:15</a>, the phrase: commit folly in Israel, is always used of the grosser sins of uncleanness; see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/34-7.htm">Genesis 34:7</a>. So here also. - The Chet. &#1492;&#1493;&#1497;&#1491;&#1506; is expounded in the Keri by &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1491;&#1506;, according to which there has been a transposition of the letters &#1493; and &#1497;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-25.htm">Jeremiah 2:25</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-6.htm">Jeremiah 8:6</a>, etc. Still the article here is extraordinary, since &#1506;&#1491; has none. Therefore J. D. Mich., Ew., Hitz., Graf suppose we should read &#1492;&#1493;&#1468; &#1497;&#1491;&#1506;, the &#1488; having been dropped from &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; in scriptio continua, as it often is, especially after &#1497;, in &#1492;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488; and other words, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-15.htm">Jeremiah 19:15</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-16.htm">Jeremiah 39:16</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-29.htm">1 Kings 21:29</a>, etc. &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; is then the copula between subject and predicate, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-25.htm">Isaiah 43:25</a>; cf. Ew. 297, b. </body></html>
