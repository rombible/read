The order of scribes, which became so dominant during the exile, was already rising into notice. Shaphan, to whom Hilkiah gave the re-found Book of the Law, belonged to it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-15.htm" title="And Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD.

Already, as in other things, so here, in his protest against the teaching of the scribes, with their traditional and misleading casuistry, Jeremiah appears as foreshadowing the prophet of Nazareth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/5-20.htm" title="For I say to you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.">Matthew 5:20-48</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/23-2.htm" title="Saying The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat:">Matthew 23:2-26</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/jeremiah/8.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-8.htm" title="How do you say, We are wise, and the law of the LORD is with us?

The people would not attend to reason; they would not act in the affairs of their souls with common prudence. Sin is backsliding; it is going back from the way that leads to life, to that which leads to destruction. 2. They would not attend to the warning of conscience. They did not take the first step towards repentance: true repentance begins in serious inquiry as to what we have done, from conviction that we have done amiss. 3. They would not attend to the ways of providence, nor understand the voice of God in them, ver. 7. They know not how to improve the seasons of grace, which God affords. Many boast of their religious knowledge, yet, unless taught by the Spirit of God, the instinct of brutes is a more sure guide than their supposed wisdom. 4. They would not attend to the written word. Many enjoy abundance of the means of grace, have Bibles and ministers, but they have them in vain. They will soon be ashamed of their devices. The pretenders to wisdom were the priests and the false prophets. They flattered people in sin, and so flattered them into destruction, silencing their fears and complaints with, All is well.

The mention of "scribes" in this place is a crucial point in the argument whether or not the Pentateuch or Torah is the old law-book of the Jews, or a fabrication which gradually grew up, but was not received as authoritative until after the return from the captivity. It is not until the time of Josiah <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-13.htm">2 Chronicles 34:13</a> that "scribes" are mentioned except as political officers; here, however, they are students of the Torah. The Torah must have existed in writing before there could have been an order of men whose special business it was to study it; and therefore to explain this verse by saying that perhaps the scribes were writers of false prophecies written in imitation of the true, is to lose the whole gist of the passage. What the scribes turned into a lie was that Law of which they had just boasted that they were the possessors. Moreover, the scribes undeniably became possessed of preponderating influence during the exile: and on the return from Babylon were powerful enough to prevent the restoration of the kingly office. That there should be along with the priests and Levites men who devoted themselves to the study of the written Law, and who in the time of Josiah had acquired such influence as to be recognized as a distinct class - is just what we should expect from the rapid progress of learning, which began with Elisha's active management of the schools of the prophets, and culminated in the days of Hezekiah. Jeremiah's whole argument depends upon the fact that there were in his days men who claimed to be "wise" or "learned" men because of their study of the Pentateuch, and is entirely inconsistent with the assumptions that Jeremiah wrote the book of Deuteronomy, and that Ezra wrote parts of Exodus and the whole of Leviticus. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. law &#8230; with us&#8212;(Ro 2:17).

Jeremiah has been thought by Du., Co. and others (not so Gi.) to refer here to the newly-discovered book supposed to be in a large degree identical with Deuteronomy as we now have it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-8.htm" title="And Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD. And Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan, and he read it.">2 Kings 22:8</a>). We may indeed well believe that the prophet laid but little stress on the ritual portions of the law, there set forth (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-22.htm" title="For I spoke not to your fathers, nor commanded them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt offerings or sacrifices:">Jeremiah 7:22</a> with notes), as compared with the rest of the Book. But with the moral tone of that Book he was in full sympathy, as is shewn by his frequent use of its words and phrases, and persistent enforcement of its general teaching. See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-1.htm" title="The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD saying,">Jeremiah 11:1</a>, etc. Thus it is far more likely that he here refers to the traditional directions, already committed to writing, which the priesthood claimed to possess for guidance in ritual. These had been perverted in some way to us unknown, so as to sanction iniquitous observances. This was “a peril specially likely to arise, when but few copies of ‘the law’ existed, and when the authority of the written law was not fully recognised,” Ryle, <span class="ital">Canon of the O.T</span>., p. 67.

Jeremiah is evidently addressing the priests and the prophets, whom he so constantly described as among the chief causes of Judah's ruin (comp. Ver. 10; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-8.htm">Jeremiah 2:8, 26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-9.htm">Jeremiah 4:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-31.htm">Jeremiah 5:31</a>), and who, in Isaiah's day, regarded it as an unwarrantable assumption on the part of that prophet to pretend to instruct them in their duty (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-9.htm">Isaiah 28:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The law of the Lord is with us</span>. "With us;" <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. in our hands and mouths. (comp. Psalm 1:16). The word <span class="accented">torah</span>, commonly rendered" Law," is ambiguous, and a difference of opinion as to the meaning of this verse is inevitable. Some think these self-styled "wise" men reject Jeremiah's counsels on the ground that they already have the divinely given Law in a written form (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-17.htm">Romans 2:17-20</a>), and that the Divine revelation is complete. Others that <span class="accented">torah</span> here, as often elsewhere in the prophets (e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-10.htm">Isaiah 1:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-16.htm">Isaiah 8:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-4.htm">Isaiah 42:4</a>), simply means "instruction," or "direction," and describes the authoritative counsel given orally by the priests (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-11.htm">Deuteronomy 17:11</a>) and prophets to those who consulted them on points of ritual and practice respectively. The usage of Jeremiah himself favors the latter view (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-8.htm">Jeremiah 2:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-18.htm">Jeremiah 18:18</a>; and especially Jeremiah 26:4, 5, where "to walk in my <span class="accented">Torah"</span> is parallel to "to hearken to the words of my servants the prophets." The context equally points in this direction. The most natural interpretation, then, is this: The opponents of Jeremiah bade him keep his exhortations to himself, seeing that they themselves were wise and the divinely appointed teachers of the people. To this Jeremiah replies, not (as the Authorized Version renders) <span class="cmt_word">Lo, certainly in vain made he it</span>, etc.; but, <span class="accented">Yea</span>, <span class="accented">behold I for a lie hath it wrought - the lying pen of the scribes</span> (so Authorized Version, margin). <span class="accented">Soferim</span> (scribes) is the term proper to all those who practiced the art of writing (<span class="accented">sefer</span>); it included, therefore, presumably at least, most, if not all, of the priests and prophets of whom Jeremiah speaks. There are indications enough that the Hebrew literature was not entirely confined to those whom we look up to as the inspired writers, and it is perfectly credible that the formalist priests and false prophets should have availed themselves of the pen as a means of giving greater currency to their teaching. Jeremiah warns his hearers to distrust a literature which is in the set-vice of false religious principles - a warning which prophets in the wider sense of the term ('The Liberty of Prophesyings') still have but too much occasion to repeat, tit is right, however, to mention another grammatically possible rendering, which is adopted by those who suppose <span class="accented">torah</span> in the preceding clause to mean the Mosaic Law: "Yea, behold, the lying pen of the scribes hath made (it) into a lie;" <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the professional interpreters of the Scriptures called scribes have, by their groundless comments and inferences, made the Scriptures (especially the noblest part, the Law) into a lie, so that it has ceased to represent the Divine will and teaching. The objections to this are: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the necessity of supplying an object to the verb - the object would hardly have been omitted where its emission renders the meaning of the clause so doubtful; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that this view attributes to the word <span class="accented">soferim</span> a meaning which only became prevalent in the time of Ezra (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/7-6.htm">Ezra 7:6, 11</a>).] <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>But even then the judgment has not come to a height. Even sinners long dead must yet bear the shame of their sins. "At that time" points back to "days come" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-32.htm">Jeremiah 7:32</a>. The Masoretes wished to have the &#1493; before &#1497;&#1493;&#1510;&#1497;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; deleted, apparently because they took it for &#1493; consec.

They will take the bones of the kings, princes, priests, and prophets, the rulers and leaders of the people (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-26.htm">Jeremiah 2:26</a>), and the bones of the other inhabitants of Jerusalem, out of their graves, and spread them out before the sun, the moon, and the stars, i.e., expose them under the open sky to the influence of the heavenly bodies, so that they shall rot away, become "dung on the face of the earth." The worst dishonour that could be done to the dead, a just return in kind for their worship of sun, moon, and stars: cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-18.htm">Exodus 7:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-5.htm">2 Kings 21:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-11.htm">2 Kings 23:11</a>. This worship the prophet describes in its various stages: "Inclination of the heart, the act of devoting and dedicating themselves to the service, the frequenting of gods' sanctuary in order to worship and to obtain oracles; while he strives to bring out in strong relief the contrast between the zeal of their service and the reward they get by it" (Hitz.). They shall not be gathered, i.e., for burial: cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-13.htm">2 Samuel 21:13</a>.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/31-13.htm">1 Samuel 31:13</a>. The dead shall suffer this at the hands of enemies despoiling the land. The reason for so doing was, as Jerome observes, the practice of burying ornaments and articles of value along with the dead. Seeking for such things, enemies will turn up the graves (cf. acts of this kind the case of Ibn Chaldun, in Sylv. de Sacy, Abdollat. p. 561), and, in their hatred and insolence, scatter the bones of the dead all about. </body></html>
