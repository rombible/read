Taking the words as spoken after a pause, they come as a cry of sorrow following the proclamation of the judgment of Jehovah, <span class= "ital">Ah, my comfort against sorrow! </span>(mourning for it as dead and gone); <span class= "ital">my heart is sick within me. </span>The latter phrase is the same as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-5.htm" title="Why should you be stricken any more? you will revolt more and more: the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.">Isaiah 1:5</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/jeremiah/8.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/8-18.htm" title="When I would comfort myself against sorrow, my heart is faint in me....">Jeremiah 8:18-19</a></span>. <span class="ital">When I would comfort myself, </span>&c. — “When I would apply comfort to myself, my heart misgives me: I find great reason for my fears, and none for my hopes.” Blaney translates the verse, <span class="ital">sorrow is upon me past my remedying; my heart within me is faint. </span>They seem to be the words of the prophet, who had endeavoured to comfort himself in his trouble by acquiescing in the will of God; but the miseries coming on his countrymen continually occurring to his mind in all their horrors and aggravations, deprived him of all comfort, and rendered him inconsolable. <span class="ital">Behold the voice of the cry </span>— The bitter cries and lamentations, which methinks I hear; <span class="ital">of the daughter of my people </span>— To whose welfare I cannot be indifferent; <span class="ital">because of them that dwell in a far country </span>— Namely, their enemies the Chaldeans, who were coming against them. But the words may be rendered more agreeably to the Hebrew thus, <span class="ital">The voice</span> <span class="ital">of the cry of the daughter of my people from a land afar off. </span>Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-17.htm" title="Your eyes shall see the king in his beauty: they shall behold the land that is very far off.">Isaiah 33:17</a>, where the phrase in the original, <span class="greekheb">ארצ מרחקים</span>, is the same. Thus interpreted, the words express the doleful complaints of the Jews in their state of captivity, as if God had quite forsaken and disowned them. In this light many commentators understand the prophet. He “anticipates,” says Blaney, “in his imagination, the captivity of his countrymen in Babylon, <span class="ital">a far country; </span>and represents them there as asking, with a mixture of grief and astonishment, if there was no such being as JEHOVAH, who presided in Zion, that he so neglected his people, and suffered them to continue in such a wretched plight. Upon this complaint of theirs, God justly breaks in with a question on his part, and demands why, if they acknowledged such a protector as himself, they had deserted his service, and by going over to idols, with which they had no natural connection, had forfeited all title to his favour.” <span class="ital">Why have they provoked me to anger? </span>— Some translators, to render the sense more evident, supply here the words, <span class="ital">saith God; </span>for it is evident that it is God, and not the prophet, who speaks here, telling them that their sins were the cause of his forsaking them; and that as they provoked him to anger by their idolatries, so he would no longer defend them.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:14-22 At length they begin to see the hand of God lifted up. And when God appears against us, every thing that is against us appears formidable. As salvation only can be found in the Lord, so the present moment should be seized. Is there no medicine proper for a sick and dying kingdom? Is there no skilful, faithful hand to apply the medicine? Yes, God is able to help and to heal them. If sinners die of their wounds, their blood is upon their own heads. The blood of Christ is balm in Gilead, his Spirit is the Physician there, all-sufficient; so that the people may be healed, but will not. Thus men die unpardoned and unchanged, for they will not come to Christ to be saved.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Rather, "O my comfort in sorrow: my heart faints for me." The word translated "comfort" is by some supposed to be corrupt. With these mournful ejaculations a new strophe begins, ending with <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-1.htm">Jeremiah 9:1</a>, in which the prophet mourns over the miserable fate of his countrymen, among whom he had been earnestly laboring, but all in vain. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18.

But more probably the prophet now seems to speak his own resentments, how greatly the calamity of his people did affect him; the like <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-4.htm" title="Therefore said I, Look away from me; I will weep bitterly, labor not to comfort me, because of the spoiling of the daughter of my people.">Isaiah 22:4</a></span>: when he would sometimes refresh himself with the comfortable refreshments of nature, the thoughts of his people’s misery do so afflict him, that his heart is ready to faint, to sink within him. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/8.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>When I would comfort myself against terror,....

Ewald and Graf suppose an ellipsis, and render, "(Oh for) my enlivening [<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. an enlivening for me] in trouble!" Hitzig more naturally renders in the vocative, "My enlivener in trouble" which he supposes to be in apposition to <span class="cmt_word">my heart</span>. Do Dieu (1648) wavers between this and the view that it is an address to his wife, "Quae marito solatio est."

When the great calamity comes on the sin-hardened people, they shall be confounded and overwhelmed in ruin (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-11.htm">Jeremiah 6:11</a>). They spurn at the word of Jahveh; whose wisdom then have they? None; for the word of the Lord alone is Israel's wisdom and understanding, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-6.htm">Deuteronomy 4:6</a>.<p>The threatening in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-10.htm">Jeremiah 8:10</a> includes not only the wise ones, but the whole people. "Therefore" attaches to the central truth of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-5.htm">Jeremiah 8:5</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-6.htm">Jeremiah 8:6</a>, which has been elucidated in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-7.htm">Jeremiah 8:7-9</a>. The first half of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-10.htm">Jeremiah 8:10</a> corresponds, in shorter compass, to what has been said in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-12.htm">Jeremiah 6:12</a>, and is here continued in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-10.htm">Jeremiah 8:10-12</a> in the same words as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-13.htm">Jeremiah 6:13-15</a>. &#1497;&#1493;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; are those who take possession, make themselves masters of a thing, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-2.htm">Jeremiah 49:2</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-15.htm">Micah 1:15</a>. This repetition of the three verses is not given in the lxx, and Hitz. therefore proposes to delete them as a supplementary interpolation, holding that they are not only superfluous, but that they interrupt the sense. For he thinks <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-13.htm">Jeremiah 8:13</a> connects remarkably well with <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-10.htm">Jeremiah 8:10</a>, but, taken out of its connection with what precedes as we have it, begins baldly enough. To this Graf has made fitting answer: This passage is in no respect more superfluous or awkward than <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-13.htm">Jeremiah 6:13</a>.; nor is the connection of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-13.htm">Jeremiah 8:13</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-10.htm">Jeremiah 8:10</a> at all closer than with <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-12.htm">Jeremiah 8:12</a>. And Hitz., in order to defend the immediate connection between <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-13.htm">Jeremiah 8:13</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-10.htm">Jeremiah 8:10</a>, sees himself compelled, for the restoration of equilibrium, to delete the middle part of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-13.htm">Jeremiah 8:13</a> (from "no grapes" to "withered") as spurious; for which proceeding there is not the smallest reason, since this passage has neither the character of an explanatory gloss, nor is it a repetition from any place whatever, nor is it awanting in the lxx. Just as little ground is there to argue against the genuineness of the two passages from the variations found in them. Here in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-10.htm">Jeremiah 8:10</a> we have &#1502;&#1511;&#1468;&#1496;&#1503;  &#1493;&#1506;&#1491;&#1470;&#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1493;&#1500; instead of the  &#1502;&#1511;&#1468;&#1496;&#1504;&#1468;&#1501;of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-13.htm">Jeremiah 6:13</a>; but the suffix, which in the latter case pointed to the preceding "inhabitants of the land," was unnecessary here, where there is no such reference. In like manner, the forms &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1501; for &#1492;&#1499;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, and &#1506;&#1514; &#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1514;&#1501; for &#1506;&#1514;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1491;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, are but the more usual forms used by Jeremiah elsewhere. So the omission of the &#1488; in &#1497;&#1512;&#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; for &#1497;&#1512;&#1508;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;, as coming either from the writer or the copyist, clearly does not make against the genuineness of the verses. And there is the less reason for making any difficulty about the passage, seeing that such repetitions are amongst the peculiarities of Jeremiah's style: cf. e.g., <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-31.htm">Jeremiah 7:31-33</a> with <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-5.htm">Jeremiah 19:5-7</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-12.htm">Jeremiah 10:12-16</a> with <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-15.htm">Jeremiah 51:15-19</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-13.htm">Jeremiah 15:13-14</a>, with <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-3.htm">Jeremiah 17:3-4</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-14.htm">Jeremiah 16:14-15</a>, with <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-7.htm">Jeremiah 23:7-8</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5-6</a>, with <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-15.htm">Jeremiah 33:15-16</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-19.htm">Jeremiah 23:19-20</a>, with <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-23.htm">Jeremiah 30:23-24</a>, and other shorter repetitions. </body></html>
