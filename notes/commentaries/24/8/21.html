He is <span class= "ital">crushed </span>in that <span class= "ital">crushing </span>of his people. His face is <span class= "ital">darkened, </span>as one that mourns. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-6.htm" title="I am troubled; I am bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the day long.">Psalm 38:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/5-11.htm" title="And they did eat of the old corn of the land on the morrow after the passover, unleavened cakes, and parched corn in the selfsame day.">Joshua 5:11</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/jeremiah/8.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/8-21.htm" title="For the hurt of the daughter of my people am I hurt; I am black; astonishment has taken hold on me....">Jeremiah 8:21-22</a></span>. <span class="ital">For the hurt of the daughter of my people am I hurt, </span>&c. — These are the words of the prophet, lamenting the miserable condition of his country. The Hebrew is more literally rendered, <span class="ital">For the breach of the daughter of my people am I broken, </span>that is, <span class="ital">heart-broken: </span>or, as Houbigant renders it, <span class="ital">I am wounded with the wound of my people. I am black </span>— I look ghastly, as those who are dying. <span class="ital">Astonishment hath taken hold on me </span>— I am so stupified that I know not what to do, or which way to turn. <span class="ital">Is there no balm in Gilead — Balm, </span>or <span class="ital">balsam, </span>is used with us as a common name for many of those oily, resinous substances, which flow spontaneously, or by incision, from certain trees or plants, and are of considerable use in medicine and surgery, being good, as physicians inform us, to soften, assuage, warm, dissolve, cleanse, dry up, and purge. The Hebrew word here used, <span class="greekheb">צרי</span>, is rendered by the LXX., <span class="greekheb">ρητινη</span>, and interpreted <span class="ital">resin </span>by the ancients in general. For this <span class="ital">balm, resin, </span>or <span class="ital">turpentine, </span>as the word might be rendered, Gilead was famous from very ancient times. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/37-25.htm" title="And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a company of Ishmeelites came from Gilead with their camels bearing spices and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt.">Genesis 37:25</a>, where we find Joseph was sold to Ishmaelite merchants, who came from Gilead, and carried it, with sweet spices, into Egypt. This made many physicians and surgeons to resort to Gilead. The prophet applies this metaphorically to the state of the Jews, which was all over corrupted, (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-6.htm" title="From the sole of the foot even to the head there is no soundness in it; but wounds, and bruises, and putrefying sores: they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with ointment.">Isaiah 1:6</a>,) and represents God as asking whether there have been no methods used to heal these mortal wounds and distempers? or, if there have, how it comes to pass they should have so little success? As if he had said, Whence comes it that the wounds of my people have not been healed and closed? Have means of healing been wanting? Spiritual medicines or physicians? Have I not sent you prophets, who have admonished, warned, and instructed you? Have I not given you time, and furnished you with helps sufficient to enable you to return to your duty? Why then are not your spiritual disorders cured? Doubtless it is your own fault: it is because you would not make use of the remedies provided, nor follow the prescriptions of the physicians. Thus we may apply the words spoken concerning Babylon, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-9.htm" title="We would have healed Babylon, but she is not healed: forsake her, and let us go every one into his own country: for her judgment reaches to heaven, and is lifted up even to the skies.">Jeremiah 51:9</a>, to the present case: <span class="ital">we would have healed Babylon, but she is not, </span>or rather, <span class="ital">she would not, be healed. </span>The words may likewise be understood of a temporal deliverance. As if he had said, Is this people so forsaken both of God and men, that there is no remedy left to effect their deliverance? Are there no salutary means within reach, or no persons that know how to apply them, for the relief of my country from those miseries with which it is afflicted? Observe, reader, if sinners die of their wounds, their blood is upon their own heads. The blood of Christ is balm in Gilead, his Spirit is the physician there: both are sufficient, all-sufficient, to effect a perfect cure; so that they might have been healed, but would not. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:14-22 At length they begin to see the hand of God lifted up. And when God appears against us, every thing that is against us appears formidable. As salvation only can be found in the Lord, so the present moment should be seized. Is there no medicine proper for a sick and dying kingdom? Is there no skilful, faithful hand to apply the medicine? Yes, God is able to help and to heal them. If sinners die of their wounds, their blood is upon their own heads. The blood of Christ is balm in Gilead, his Spirit is the Physician there, all-sufficient; so that the people may be healed, but will not. Thus men die unpardoned and unchanged, for they will not come to Christ to be saved.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For the hurt ... hurt - literally, "Because of the breaking ... broken."
