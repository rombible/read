With them marriage, and the hopes which it involved, was not only a happiness but a duty, and to be cut off from it was to renounce both, because the evil that was coming on the nation was such as to turn both into a curse. We may compare cur Lord’s words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-19.htm" title="And woe to them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days!">Matthew 24:19</a> and those spoken to the daughters of Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-29.htm" title="For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bore, and the breasts which never gave suck.">Luke 23:29</a>), and what, in part at least, entered into St. Paul’s motives for a like abstinence on account of “the present distress” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-26.htm" title="I suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress, I say, that it is good for a man so to be.">1Corinthians 7:26</a>).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/16.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>16:1-9 The prophet must conduct himself as one who expected to see his country ruined very shortly. In the prospect of sad times, he is to abstain from marriage, mourning for the dead, and pleasure. Those who would convince others of the truths of God, must make it appear by their self-denial, that they believe it themselves. Peace, inward and outward, family and public, is wholly the work of God, and from his loving-kindness and mercy. When He takes his peace from any people, distress must follow. There may be times when it is proper to avoid things otherwise our duty; and we should always sit loose to the pleasures and concerns of this life.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>As marriage was obligatory upon the Jews, the prohibition of it to Jeremiah was a sign that the impending calamity was so great as to override all ordinary duties. Jeremiah was unmarried, but the force of the sign lay in its being an exception to the ordinary practice of the prophets.<p>In this place - The whole of Judaea. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. in this place&#8212;in Judea. The direction to remain single was (whether literally obeyed, or only in prophetic vision) to symbolize the coming calamities of the Jews (Eze 24:15-27) as so severe that the single state would be then (contrary to the ordinary course of things) preferable to the married (compare 1Co 7:8, 26, 29; Mt 24:19; Lu 23:29).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/16.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> It is uncertain whether what we have in this chapter be a new revelation, or a continuance of his former prophecy. God commandeth the prophet in it under certain types to foretell their utter ruin and destruction. First he commandeth him to marry no wife, nor have sons or daughters. He expoundeth this command <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-3.htm" title="For thus said the LORD concerning the sons and concerning the daughters that are born in this place, and concerning their mothers that bore them, and concerning their fathers that begat them in this land;">Jeremiah 16:3</a>,4</span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/16.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Thou shall not take thee a wife,.... Not because it was unlawful; for it was lawful for prophets to marry, and they did; but because it was not advisable, on account of the calamities and distresses which were coming upon the nation; which would be more bearable by him alone, than if he had a wife, which would increase his care, concern, and sorrow. <p>Neither shall thou have sons nor daughters in this place; in Anathoth, says Kimchi; but it is most likely that Jerusalem in particular is meant, though the whole land of Judea in general may be designed; and though nothing is more desirable than to have children to build up the family, and bear and continue a man's name for futurity, yet in times of public calamity these do but add to the affliction. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/16.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Thou shalt not take <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> thee a wife, neither shalt thou have sons nor daughters in this place.</span><p>(a) Meaning that the affliction would be so horrible in Jerusalem that a wife and children would only increase his sorrow.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/16.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">2</span>. <span class="ital">Thou shall not take thee a wife</span>] Marriage was a state of life in special favour with the Jews. By his act of self-denial therefore Jeremiah was to shew his full submission to the will of God, while it would at the same time be a forcible mode of conveying the message of coming woes which he was charged to deliver to the people.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt not take thee a wife</span>. So St. Paul, "I think therefore that this is good by reason of the present distress, namely, that it is good for a man to be as he is (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-26.htm">1 Corinthians 7:26</a>, Revised Version); and Hosea has already drawn an awful picture of "Ephraim bringing forth his children to the murderer" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-9.htm">Hosea 9:9</a>). In ordinary times it was a kind of unwritten law among the Israelites to marry and beget children.

The sadness of what he had to publish filled his heart with the deepest grief, and constrained him to keep far from all cheery good fellowship.</body></html>
