We are entering upon another region of funeral customs, reminding us of some of the practices connected with the “wakes” of old English life. After the first burst of sorrow and of fasting, as the sign of sorrow (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-12.htm" title="And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the LORD, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword.">2Samuel 1:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-35.htm" title="And when all the people came to cause David to eat meat while it was yet day, David swore, saying, So do God to me, and more also, if I taste bread, or ought else, till the sun be down.">2Samuel 3:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_samuel/12-16.htm" title="David therefore sought God for the child; and David fasted, and went in, and lay all night on the earth.">2Samuel 12:16-17</a>), friends came to the mourner to comfort him. A feast was prepared for them, consisting of “the bread of mourners” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-4.htm" title="They shall not offer wine offerings to the LORD, neither shall they be pleasing to him: their sacrifices shall be to them as the bread of mourners; all that eat thereof shall be polluted: for their bread for their soul shall not come into the house of the LORD.">Hosea 9:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-17.htm" title="Forbear to cry, make no mourning for the dead, bind the tire of your head on you, and put on your shoes on your feet, and cover not your lips, and eat not the bread of men.">Ezekiel 24:17</a>) and the “cup of consolation,” as for those of a heavy heart (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-6.htm" title="Give strong drink to him that is ready to perish, and wine to those that be of heavy hearts.">Proverbs 31:6</a>). It is probable that some reference to this practice was implied in our Lord’s solemn benediction of the bread and of the cup at the Last Supper. As His body had been “anointed for the burial” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-12.htm" title="For in that she has poured this ointment on my body, she did it for my burial.">Matthew 26:12</a>), so, in giving the symbols of His death, He was, as it were, keeping with His disciples His own funeral feast. The thought of the dead lying unburied, or buried without honour, is contemplated in all its horrors.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/jeremiah/16.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-7.htm" title="Neither shall men tear themselves for them in mourning, to comfort them for the dead; neither shall men give them the cup of consolation to drink for their father or for their mother.">Jeremiah 16:7</a></span>. <span class="ital">Neither shall men tear themselves for them </span>— According to this translation the phrase alludes to another expression of immoderate grief, which consisted in tearing their flesh with their nails. But according to the marginal reading, the sense is, <span class="ital">Neither shall men break bread for them; </span>alluding to the mourning-feast, mentioned <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-5.htm" title="For thus said the LORD, Enter not into the house of mourning, neither go to lament nor bemoan them: for I have taken away my peace from this people, said the LORD, even loving kindness and mercies.">Jeremiah 16:5</a>. So the LXX., <span class="greekheb">ου μη κλασθη αρτος εν πενθει αυτων εις παρακλησιν επι τεθνηκοτι</span>, “bread shall by no means be broken in their mourning, for consolation concerning the dead.” So also the Vulgate. As to the custom alluded to, Jerome informs us, in his commentary on this place, that “it was usual to carry provisions to mourners, and to make an entertainment, which sort of feasts the Greeks call <span class="greekheb">περιδειπνα</span>, and the Latins <span class="ital">parentalia.” </span>The origin of which custom undoubtedly was, that the friends of the mourner, who came to comfort him, (which they often did in great numbers, as we learn from <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-19.htm" title="And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother.">John 11:19</a>,) easily concluding, that a person so far swallowed up of grief, as even to forget his own bread could hardly attend to the entertainment of so many guests, each sent in his proportion of meat and drink, in hopes to prevail upon the mourner, by their example and persuasions, to partake of such refreshment as might tend to recruit both his bodily strength and his spirits. To this custom Tobit is thought to refer when, among other exhortations to his son, he directs him to <span class="ital">pour out his</span> <span class="ital">bread on the burial of the just. </span>See Blaney. It must be observed, that among the Hebrews all things eaten were called bread. <span class="ital">Neither shall men give them the cup of consolation for their father, </span>&c. — They were also wont, on these occasions, to send wine, or some other cheering liquor to drink, that they might forget their sorrows. This is called here <span class="ital">the cup of consolation. </span>Sir John Chardin, in one of his MSS. tells us, that “the oriental Christians still make banquets of the same kind, by a custom derived from the Jews; and that the provisions spoken of in this verse were such as were wont to be sent to the house of the deceased, where healths were also drunk to the survivers of the family.” God here tells the Jews by his prophet, that the time should come when so many should die, and so fast, and the rest should be so much upon the brink of the grave, that they should have neither leisure nor heart for using these ceremonies.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/16.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>16:1-9 The prophet must conduct himself as one who expected to see his country ruined very shortly. In the prospect of sad times, he is to abstain from marriage, mourning for the dead, and pleasure. Those who would convince others of the truths of God, must make it appear by their self-denial, that they believe it themselves. Peace, inward and outward, family and public, is wholly the work of God, and from his loving-kindness and mercy. When He takes his peace from any people, distress must follow. There may be times when it is proper to avoid things otherwise our duty; and we should always sit loose to the pleasures and concerns of this life.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Tear themselves - Better as in the margin; "break broad for them."

But the truth is, the word hath but two significations, and we have here given it what doth worst suit this text. It signifies to <span class="ital">divide</span>, and <span class="ital">to tear</span>, or <span class="ital">rend</span>. Both in <span class="ital">kal</span> the first conjugation, and in <span class="ital">pihel</span> the third conjugation, it is used to signify <span class="ital">dividing</span>: in the former, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-7.htm" title="Is it not to deal your bread to the hungry, and that you bring the poor that are cast out to your house? when you see the naked, that you cover him; and that you hide not yourself from your own flesh?">Isaiah 58:7</a></span>, where we interpret it <span class="ital">deal</span>; to deal, that is, <span class="ital">divide</span> thy bread to the hungry; which is the only text (excepting this) where it is used in this conjugation. In the ether conjugation it is so used in many texts, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-4.htm" title="Nevertheless these shall you not eat of them that chew the cud, or of them that divide the hoof: as the camel, because he chews the cud, but divides not the hoof; he is unclean to you.">Leviticus 11:4</a>,5</span> &c.; <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-7.htm" title="Nevertheless these you shall not eat of them that chew the cud, or of them that divide the cloven hoof; as the camel, and the hare, and the coney: for they chew the cud, but divide not the hoof; therefore they are unclean to you.">Deu 14:7</a></span>; so certainly it ought to have been translated here, <span class="ital">Neither shall men deal out bread for them in mourning, to comfort them for the dead</span>, and seemeth to hint to us a custom in use amongst them, when they had any friend that had lost his or her relations, to send them some meat or victuals, (for amongst the Hebrews all things that they ate were called <span class="ital">bread</span>,) and then to go and dine or sup with them, to have opportunity to speak comfortably to them. This doubtless is the sense of the words, and so it is plain enough, and this is confirmed by the next phrase. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Neither shall men give them the cup of consolation to drink for their father or for their mother; </span> neither shall men drink the cup of consolation for their father, &c.; as in such cases they were wont to have something to eat, so they were also wont to send bottles of wine, or other cheering liquor, to drink, that they might forget their sorrows; this is called <span class="ital">the cup of consolation</span>, from the end for which the sending and drinking of it was intended. God tells them that the time should come that so many should die, and so fast, and the rest should be so much upon the brink of the grave, that they should have no leisure for or heart to these ceremonies. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/16.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Neither shall men tear themselves,.... Either their flesh, or their clothes: or, "stretch out" (y); that is, their hands, and clap them together, and wring them, as persons in great distress do: or "divide", or "break", or "deal unto them" (z); that is, bread, as at their funeral feasts. Thus the Septuagint version, neither shall bread be broken in their mourning; and to the same sense the Targum; so the word is used in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-7.htm">Isaiah 63:7</a>, a practice that obtained among the Heathens; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-14.htm">Deuteronomy 26:14</a> and now with the Jews, as it seems: which they did <p>for them in mourning, to comfort them for the dead; they used to carry or send food to the surviving relations, and went and ate with them, in order to comfort them for the loss of their friends; but this now would not be done, not because an Heathenish custom, but because they would have no heart nor leisure for it: see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-17.htm">Ezekiel 24:17</a>. <p>Neither shall men give them the cup of consolation to drink for their father or for their mother: not give them a cup of good liquor to comfort and cheer their spirits, overwhelmed with sorrow, on account of the death of a father or mother; which was wont to be done, but now should be omitted; the calamity would be so great, and so universal, that there would be none to do such offices as these; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-6.htm">Proverbs 31:6</a>. <p>(y)  "et non expandent, sub. manus suas", Vatablus, Montanus; "extendent", Pagninus, Calvin.

There the word for bread (<span class="ital">leḥem</span>) stands in MT., and a very slight change here would convert “for them” (Heb. <span class="ital">lahem</span>) into the same word. If on the other hand we keep <span class="ital">lahem</span>, <span class="ital">leḥem</span> must have dropped out after it. The reference is to the custom for mourners to fast (cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-35.htm" title="And when all the people came to cause David to eat meat while it was yet day, David swore, saying, So do God to me, and more also, if I taste bread, or ought else, till the sun be down.">2 Samuel 3:35</a>), whereupon their sympathetic friends brought them bread and wine to console them.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the cup of consolation</span>] on the principle stated <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-6.htm" title="Give strong drink to him that is ready to perish, and wine to those that be of heavy hearts.">Proverbs 31:6</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Tear themselves for them</span>. The verb is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-7.htm">Isaiah 58:7</a> of breaking bread (the accusative is there expressed), and there is no doubt that this is the meaning here. The only question is whether <span class="accented">lahem</span>, for them, should not rather be <span class="accented">lekhem</span>, bread (this was read by the Septuagint, Peshito, Vulgate, Targnm). St. Jerome sees here an allusion to the funeral feasts (comp. the <span class="accented">parentalia</span>), and surely he is right. The Jews had a conception of the nature of the life of the other world only less distinct than that of their Egyptian neighbors. The funeral feast was not merely for the living, but for the dead. Indeed, it was primarily intended for the spiritual nourish-merit of those who had gone before to the unseen world (comp. Bonwick, 'Egyptian Belief and Modern Thought,' p. 48). Chardin, the old traveler, asserts that "the Oriental Christians still make banquets of this kind by a custom derived from the Jews." <span class="cmt_word">The cup of consolation</span>. It would seem as if the funeral feasts had dwindled among the Jews into little more than a refection for the benefit of the mourners. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/16.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The course to be pursued by the prophet with reference to the approaching judgment. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-1.htm">Jeremiah 16:1</a>. "And the word of Jahveh cam to me, saying: <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-2.htm">Jeremiah 16:2</a>. Thou shalt not take thee a wife, neither shalt thou have sons or daughters in this place. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-3.htm">Jeremiah 16:3</a>.

By deadly suffering shall they die, be neither lamented or buried; dung upon the field shall they become; and by sword and by famine shall they be consumed, and their carcases shall be meat for the fowls of the heavens and the beasts of the field. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-5.htm">Jeremiah 16:5</a>. For thus hath Jahveh said: Come not into the house of mourning, and go not to lament, and bemoan them not; for I have taken away my peace from this people, saith Jahveh, grace and mercies. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-6.htm">Jeremiah 16:6</a>. And great and small shall die in this land, not be buried; they shall not lament them, nor cut themselves, nor make themselves bald for them. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-7.htm">Jeremiah 16:7</a>. And they shall not break bread for them in their mourning, to comfort one for the dead; nor shall they give to any the cup of comfort for his father and his mother. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-8.htm">Jeremiah 16:8</a>. And into the house of feasting go not, to sit by them, to eat and to drink. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-9.htm">Jeremiah 16:9</a>. For thus hath spoken Jahveh of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I cause to cease out of this place before your eyes, and in your days, the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride."<p>What the prophet is here bidden to do and to forbear is closely bound up with the proclamation enjoined on him of judgment to come on sinful Judah. This connection is brought prominently forward in the reasons given for these commands. He is neither to take a wife nor to beget children, because all the inhabitants of the land, sons and daughters, mothers and fathers, are to perish by sickness, the sword, and famine (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-3.htm">Jeremiah 16:3</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-4.htm">Jeremiah 16:4</a>). He is both to abstain from the customary usages of mourning for the dead, and to keep away from mirthful feasts, in order to give the people to understand that, by reason of the multitude of the dead, customary mourning will have to be given up, and that all opportunity for merry-making will disappear (<a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-5.htm">Jeremiah 16:5-9</a>). Adapting thus his actions to help to convey his message, he will approve himself to be the mouth of the Lord, and then the promised divine protection will not fail. Thus closely is this passage connected with the preceding complaint and reproof of the prophet (<a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-10.htm">Jeremiah 15:10-21</a>), while it at the same time further continues the threatening of judgment in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-1.htm">Jeremiah 15:1-9</a>. - With the prohibition to take a wife, cf. the apostle's counsel, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-26.htm">1 Corinthians 7:26</a>.
