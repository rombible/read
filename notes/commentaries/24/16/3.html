In the prospect of sad times, he is to abstain from marriage, mourning for the dead, and pleasure. Those who would convince others of the truths of God, must make it appear by their self-denial, that they believe it themselves. Peace, inward and outward, family and public, is wholly the work of God, and from his loving-kindness and mercy. When He takes his peace from any people, distress must follow. There may be times when it is proper to avoid things otherwise our duty; and we should always sit loose to the pleasures and concerns of this life.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The times were such that for "the present distress" it was wise for all to abstain from marriage <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-26.htm">1 Corinthians 7:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-19.htm">Matthew 24:19</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. in this place&#8212;in Judea. The direction to remain single was (whether literally obeyed, or only in prophetic vision) to symbolize the coming calamities of the Jews (Eze 24:15-27) as so severe that the single state would be then (contrary to the ordinary course of things) preferable to the married (compare 1Co 7:8, 26, 29; Mt 24:19; Lu 23:29).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/16.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/16.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For thus saith the Lord concerning the sons and concerning the daughters that are born in this place,.....
