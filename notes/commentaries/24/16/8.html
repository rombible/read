This prohibition follows <span class= "ital">à fortiori </span>from the other. If it was unmeet for the prophet to enter into the house of mourning, much more was he to hold himself aloof from mirth. He was to stand apart, in the awful consciousness of his solitary mission. The words of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-2.htm" title="It is better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the house of feasting: for that is the end of all men; and the living will lay it to his heart.">Ecclesiastes 7:2</a> come to our thoughts as teaching that it was better even so.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/jeremiah/16.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/16-8.htm" title="You shall not also go into the house of feasting, to sit with them to eat and to drink....">Jeremiah 16:8-9</a></span>. <span class="ital">Thou shalt not also go into the house of feasting </span>— God not only forbade his prophet to go into houses of mourning, but forbade him also to go into houses where people were wont to eat and drink on joyful occasions, because it would be unseasonable, and would not agree with the afflictive dispensations of Providence that were coming on the land and nation. God called aloud for <span class="ital">weeping, mourning, </span>and <span class="ital">fasting, </span>because he was coming forth against them in his judgments, and it was time for them to humble themselves before him. And it well became the prophet, who gave them the warning, to give them an example of taking the warning himself, and complying with it; and so to make it appear that he did himself believe what he declared to them. <span class="ital">For, behold I will cause to cease the voice of mirth, </span>&c. — In the approaching time of general desolation, all the solemn seasons of mirth and gladness shall cease, as well public as private.

In the prospect of sad times, he is to abstain from marriage, mourning for the dead, and pleasure. Those who would convince others of the truths of God, must make it appear by their self-denial, that they believe it themselves. Peace, inward and outward, family and public, is wholly the work of God, and from his loving-kindness and mercy. When He takes his peace from any people, distress must follow. There may be times when it is proper to avoid things otherwise our duty; and we should always sit loose to the pleasures and concerns of this life.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Tear themselves - Better as in the margin; "break broad for them."

"And the word of Jahveh cam to me, saying: <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-2.htm">Jeremiah 16:2</a>. Thou shalt not take thee a wife, neither shalt thou have sons or daughters in this place. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-3.htm">Jeremiah 16:3</a>. For thus hath Jahveh said concerning the sons and the daughters that are born in this place, and concerning their mothers that bear them, and concerning their fathers that beget them in this land: <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-4.htm">Jeremiah 16:4</a>. By deadly suffering shall they die, be neither lamented or buried; dung upon the field shall they become; and by sword and by famine shall they be consumed, and their carcases shall be meat for the fowls of the heavens and the beasts of the field. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-5.htm">Jeremiah 16:5</a>. For thus hath Jahveh said: Come not into the house of mourning, and go not to lament, and bemoan them not; for I have taken away my peace from this people, saith Jahveh, grace and mercies. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-6.htm">Jeremiah 16:6</a>. And great and small shall die in this land, not be buried; they shall not lament them, nor cut themselves, nor make themselves bald for them. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-7.htm">Jeremiah 16:7</a>. And they shall not break bread for them in their mourning, to comfort one for the dead; nor shall they give to any the cup of comfort for his father and his mother. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-8.htm">Jeremiah 16:8</a>. And into the house of feasting go not, to sit by them, to eat and to drink. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-9.htm">Jeremiah 16:9</a>. For thus hath spoken Jahveh of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I cause to cease out of this place before your eyes, and in your days, the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride."<p>What the prophet is here bidden to do and to forbear is closely bound up with the proclamation enjoined on him of judgment to come on sinful Judah. This connection is brought prominently forward in the reasons given for these commands. He is neither to take a wife nor to beget children, because all the inhabitants of the land, sons and daughters, mothers and fathers, are to perish by sickness, the sword, and famine (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-3.htm">Jeremiah 16:3</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-4.htm">Jeremiah 16:4</a>). He is both to abstain from the customary usages of mourning for the dead, and to keep away from mirthful feasts, in order to give the people to understand that, by reason of the multitude of the dead, customary mourning will have to be given up, and that all opportunity for merry-making will disappear (<a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-5.htm">Jeremiah 16:5-9</a>). Adapting thus his actions to help to convey his message, he will approve himself to be the mouth of the Lord, and then the promised divine protection will not fail. Thus closely is this passage connected with the preceding complaint and reproof of the prophet (<a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-10.htm">Jeremiah 15:10-21</a>), while it at the same time further continues the threatening of judgment in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-1.htm">Jeremiah 15:1-9</a>. - With the prohibition to take a wife, cf. the apostle's counsel, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-26.htm">1 Corinthians 7:26</a>.
