A plain and full answer is given. They were more obstinate in sin than their fathers, walking every one after the devices of his heart. Since they will not hearken, they shall be hurried away into a far country, a land they know not. If they had God's favour, that would make even the land of their captivity pleasant.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Imaginations - Read stubbornness. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. ye&#8212;emphatic: so far from avoiding your fathers' bad example, ye have done worse (Jer 7:26; 1Ki 14:9).<p>imagination&#8212;rather, "stubborn perversity."<p>that they may not hearken&#8212;rather, connected with "ye"; "ye have walked &#8230; so as not to hearken to Me."<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/16.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Ye</span> in latter ages, in the time of Manasseh, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">have done worse than your fathers did, </span> and now in the time of Jehoiakim you run on much in the same course of idolatry and superstition, which in this is worse in you, because for thirty years together you had the better example of good Josiah the father of your present king, together with what his authority could do to reduce you; he hath not been gone now above five years, and you are returned to your old vomit, and are all of you serving me according to your own fancies, so stubborn are you, and resolved against obedience to me. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/16.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And ye have done worse than your fathers,....
