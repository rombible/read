He will find out and raise up instruments of his wrath, that shall destroy the Jews, by fraud like fishers, by force like hunters. The prophet, rejoicing at the hope of mercy to come, addressed the Lord as his strength and refuge.

These are the words of the prophet, rising out of the temptation which beset him; casting off his impatience, diffidence, and unbelief; calling upon God, and exercising faith in him; having received the promise of the restoration of his people to their land, and a view of the future conversion of the Gentiles; which were a means of recovering his spiritual strength, of invigorating grace in him, and of encouraging him to exercise it in a lively manner; to go on in his duty constantly, and to bear affliction cheerfully and patiently; "strength" to do which he had from the Lord; and to whom he ascribes it; and whom he calls his "fortress", or strong hold; and such the Lord is to his people, a strong hold to prisoners of hope, and a strong tower or place of defence to all his saints: <p>and my refuge in the day of affliction; in which he now was, or saw was coming upon him, when he should be carried captive into Babylon; but God was his refuge, shelter, and protection, and to him he betook himself, where he was safe; and which was infinitely better to him than the mountains, hills, and holes of rocks, others would fly unto, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-16.htm">Jeremiah 16:16</a>. <p>The Gentiles shall come unto thee from the ends of the earth; not the Jews, who were like to the Gentiles for their idolatries, and other wicked practices, and therefore so called, who should return from the several distant countries where they had been scattered, to their own land, and to the worship of God in it; but such who were really Gentiles, that should be converted, either at the time of the Babylonish captivity, and should come along with the Jews when they returned, and worship the Lord with them; or rather in Gospel times. And so Kimchi says this belongs to the times of the Messiah; when the Gospel was to be, and was preached among them, even to the ends of the earth; and many savingly came to Christ for righteousness and strength, for peace, pardon, salvation, and eternal life; and turned to him as to a strong hold, and fled to him for refuge, and laid hold on him, the hope set before them. <p>And shall say, surely our fathers have inherited lies, vanities, and things wherein there is no profit; meaning their idols, which did not give what their priests, and the abettors of them, promised; and so deceived their votaries, and disappointed them of their expectations, which became vain, and so were of no profit and advantage to them; a poor inheritance this, which they had possessed and enjoyed for many generations, which their children, now being convinced of, relinquish; for a false religion is not to be retained on this score, because the religion of ancestors, and of long possession with them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/16.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">O LORD, my <span class="cverse3">{i}</span> strength, and my fortress, and my refuge in the day of affliction, the Gentiles shall come to thee from the ends of the earth, and shall say, Surely our fathers have inherited <span class="cverse3">{k}</span> lies, vanity, and <i>things</i> in which <i>there is</i> no profit.</span><p>(i) He wonders at the great mercy of God in this deliverance which will not only extend to the Jews but also to the Gentiles.<p>(k) Our fathers were most vile idolaters therefore it comes only of God's mercy that he performs his promise and has not utterly cast us off.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/16.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">19</span>. <span class="ital">my strength, and my strong hold</span>] The two Hebrew substantives are derivatives of the same root.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">vanity … no profit</span>] See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-5.htm" title="Thus said the LORD, What iniquity have your fathers found in me, that they are gone far from me, and have walked after vanity, and are become vain?">Jeremiah 2:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-8.htm" title="The priests said not, Where is the LORD? and they that handle the law knew me not: the pastors also transgressed against me, and the prophets prophesied by Baal, and walked after things that do not profit.">Jeremiah 2:8</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">19–21</span>.

The apodosis begins with "therefore I cast you out."

The article in &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509;, Graf quite unnecessarily insists on having cancelled, as out of place. It is explained sufficiently by the fact, that the land, of which mention has so often been made, is looked on as a specific one, and is characterized by the following relative clause, as one unknown to the people. Besides, the "ye know not" is not meant of geographical ignorance, but, as is often the case with &#1497;&#1491;&#1506;, the knowledge is that obtained by direct experience. They know not the land, because they have never been there. "There ye may serve them," Ros. justly characterizes as concessio cum ironia: there ye may serve, as long as ye will, the gods whom ye have so longed after. The irony is especially marked in the "day and night." Here Jeremiah has in mind <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-28.htm">Deuteronomy 4:28</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-36.htm">Deuteronomy 28:36</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-63.htm">Deuteronomy 28:63</a>. &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; is causal, giving the grounds of the threat, "I cast you out." The form &#1495;&#1504;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492; is hap leg . - In <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-14.htm">Jeremiah 16:14</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-15.htm">Jeremiah 16:15</a> the prophet opens to the people a view of ultimate redemption from the affliction amidst the heathen, into which, for their sin, they will be cast. By and by men will swear no more by Jahveh who redeemed them out of Egypt, but by Jahveh who has brought them again from the land of the north and the other lands into which they have been thrust forth. In this is implied that this second deliverance will be a blessing which shall outshine the former blessing of redemption from Egypt. But just as this deliverance will excel the earlier one, so much the greater will the affliction of Israel in the northern land be than the Egyptian bondage had been. On this point Ros. throws especial weight, remarking that the aim of these verses is not so much to give promise of coming salvation, as to announce instare illis atrocius malum, quam illud Aegyptiacum, eamque quam mox sint subituri servitutem multo fore duriorem, quam olim Aegyptiaca fuerit. But though this idea does lie implicite in the words, yet we must not fail to be sure that the prospect held out of a future deliverance of Israel from the lands into which it is soon to be scattered, and of its restoration again to the land of its fathers, has, in the first and foremost place, a comforting import, and that it is intended to preserve the godly from despair under the catastrophe which is now awaiting them.<p>(Note: Calvin has excellently brought out both moments, and has thus expounded the thought of the passage: "Scitis unde patres vestri exierint, nempe e fornace aenea, quemadmodum alibi loquitur (xi. 4) et quasi ex profunda morte; itaque redemptio illa debuit esse memorabilis usque ad finem mundi. Sed jam Deus conjiciet vos in abyssum, quae longe profundior erit illa Aegypti tyrannide, e qua erepti sunt patres vestri; nam si inde vos redimat, erit miraculum longe excellentius ad posteros, ut fere exstinguat vel saltem obscuret memoriam prioris illius redemptionis.")<p>&#1500;&#1499;&#1503; is not nevertheless, but, as universally, therefore; and the train of thought is as follows: Because the Lord will, for their idolatry, cast forth His people into the lands of the heathen, just for that very reason will their redemption from exile not fail to follow, and this deliverance surpass in gloriousness the greatest of all former deeds of blessing, the rescue of Israel from Egypt. The prospect of future redemption given amidst announcements of judgment cannot be surprising in Jeremiah, who elsewhere also interweaves the like happy forecastings with his most solemn threatenings; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-27.htm">Jeremiah 4:27</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-10.htm">Jeremiah 5:10</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-18.htm">Jeremiah 5:18</a>, with <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-14.htm">Jeremiah 3:14</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-3.htm">Jeremiah 23:3</a>., etc. "This ray of light, falling suddenly into the darkness, does not take us more by surprise than 'I will not make a full end,' <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-27.htm">Jeremiah 4:27</a>. There is therefore no reason for regarding these two verses as interpolations from <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-7.htm">Jeremiah 23:7-8</a>" (Graf). </body></html>
