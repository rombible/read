The “fishers,” as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/4-2.htm" title="The Lord GOD has sworn by his holiness, that, see, the days shall come on you, that he will take you away with hooks, and your posterity with fishhooks.">Amos 4:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-15.htm" title="They take up all of them with the angle, they catch them in their net, and gather them in their drag: therefore they rejoice and are glad.">Habakkuk 1:15</a>, are the invading nations, surrounding Judah and Jerusalem as with a drag-net, and allowing none to escape. The process is described under this very name of “drag-netting” the country by Herodotus (iii. 149, 6:31), as applied by the army of Xerxes to Samos, Chios, Tenedos, and other islands. The application of the words either to the gathering of the people after their dispersion or to the later work of the preachers of the Gospel is an after-thought, having its source in our Lord’s words, “I will make you fishers of men” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-19.htm" title="And he said to them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.">Matthew 4:19</a>). It is, of course, possible enough that those words may have been suggested by Jeremiah’s, the same image being used, as in the parable of <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-47.htm" title="Again, the kingdom of heaven is like to a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind:">Matthew 13:47</a>, to describe the blessing which had before presented its darker aspect of punishment.<p><span class= "bld">Hunters.</span>—Another aspect of the same thought, pointing, so far as we can trace the distinction between the two, to the work of the irregular skirmisher as the former image did to that of the main body of the army: men might take refuge, as hunted beasts might do, in the caves of the rocks, but they should be driven forth even from these.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/jeremiah/16.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/16-16.htm" title="Behold, I will send for many fishers, said the LORD, and they shall fish them; and after will I send for many hunters, and they shall hunt them from every mountain, and from every hill, and out of the holes of the rocks....">Jeremiah 16:16-18</a></span>. <span class="ital">Behold, I will send, </span>&c. — This may be better rendered, <span class="ital">But now I will send, </span>&c. — Because here the prophet returns to denounce threatenings; <span class="ital">many fishers, and they shall fish them — </span>“It is common with the sacred writers to represent enemies and oppressors under the metaphors of <span class="ital">fishers </span>and <span class="ital">hunters, </span>because they use all the methods of open force and secret stratagem to make men their prey.” By these two characters the same enemies are probably meant, namely, the Chaldeans, who should take different methods, one after another, to destroy them; besieging them in their cities, and taking them like fish, enclosed in a net; and afterward pursuing the scattered parties from place to place, till they got them into their hands; so that one way or other, few, if any, would be suffered to escape. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/24-17.htm" title="Fear, and the pit, and the snare, are on you, O inhabitant of the earth....">Isaiah 24:17-18</a>, where it is in like manner foretold, that those who escaped from one danger should fall by another.

But none of the sins of sinners can be hidden from God, or shall be overlooked by him. He will find out and raise up instruments of his wrath, that shall destroy the Jews, by fraud like fishers, by force like hunters. The prophet, rejoicing at the hope of mercy to come, addressed the Lord as his strength and refuge. The deliverance out of captivity shall be a figure of the great salvation to be wrought by the Messiah. The nations have often known the power of Jehovah in his wrath; but they shall know him as the strength of his people, and their refuge in time of trouble.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The scattering of the people is to be like that of hunted animals, of which but few escape, the ancient method of hunting being to enclose a large space with beaters and nets, and so drive everything within it to some place where it was destroyed. The destruction of the whole male population was one of the horrible customs of ancient warfare, and the process is called in Herodotus "sweeping the country with a drag-net." The same authority tells us that this method could only be effectually carried out on an island. Literally, understood, the fishers are the main armies who, in the towns and fortresses, capture the people in crowds as in a net, while the hunters are the light-armed troops, who pursue the fugitives over the whole country, and drive them out of their hiding places as hunters track out their game. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16. send for&#8212;translate, "I will send many"; "I will give the commission to many" (2Ch 17:7).<p>fishers &#8230; hunters&#8212;successive invaders of Judea (Am 4:2; Hab 1:14, 15). So "net" (Eze 12:13). As to "hunters," see Ge 10:9; Mic 7:2. The Chaldees were famous in hunting, as the Egyptians, the other enemy of Judea, were in fishing. "Fishers" expresses the ease of their victory over the Jews as that of the angler over fishes; "hunters," the keenness of their pursuit of them into every cave and nook. It is remarkable, the same image is used in a good sense of the Jews' restoration, implying that just as their enemies were employed by God to take them in hand for destruction, so the same shall be employed for their restoration (Eze 47:9, 10). So spiritually, those once enemies by nature (fishermen many of them literally) were employed by God to be heralds of salvation, "catching men" for life (Mt 4:19; Lu 5:10; Ac 2:41; 4:4); compare here Jer 16:19, "the Gentiles shall come unto thee" (2Co 12:16).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/16.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Though some interpreters make these words a promise, either of God’s restoration of this people, and making use of Cyrus, who, as a <span class="ital">fisherman or huntsman</span>, by his proclamation fetched the Jews out of all parts of his dominions, to return to Jerusalem; or of the calling of God’s elect by the apostles, who were God’s fishermen, and went up and down preaching the gospel in all places; yet the next verse rather guideth us to interpret it as a threatening, and by these fishermen and huntsmen to understand all those enemies whom God made use of to destroy these Jews, hunting them out of all holes and coverts wheresoever they should fly and take sanctuary. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/16.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Behold, I will send for many fishers, saith the Lord, and they shall fish them,....

The apodosis begins with "therefore I cast you out." On this head cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-15.htm">Jeremiah 7:15</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-15.htm">Jeremiah 9:15</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-26.htm">Jeremiah 22:26</a>. The article in &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509;, Graf quite unnecessarily insists on having cancelled, as out of place. It is explained sufficiently by the fact, that the land, of which mention has so often been made, is looked on as a specific one, and is characterized by the following relative clause, as one unknown to the people. Besides, the "ye know not" is not meant of geographical ignorance, but, as is often the case with &#1497;&#1491;&#1506;, the knowledge is that obtained by direct experience. They know not the land, because they have never been there. "There ye may serve them," Ros. justly characterizes as concessio cum ironia: there ye may serve, as long as ye will, the gods whom ye have so longed after. The irony is especially marked in the "day and night." Here Jeremiah has in mind <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-28.htm">Deuteronomy 4:28</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-36.htm">Deuteronomy 28:36</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-63.htm">Deuteronomy 28:63</a>. &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; is causal, giving the grounds of the threat, "I cast you out." The form &#1495;&#1504;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492; is hap leg . - In <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-14.htm">Jeremiah 16:14</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-15.htm">Jeremiah 16:15</a> the prophet opens to the people a view of ultimate redemption from the affliction amidst the heathen, into which, for their sin, they will be cast. By and by men will swear no more by Jahveh who redeemed them out of Egypt, but by Jahveh who has brought them again from the land of the north and the other lands into which they have been thrust forth. In this is implied that this second deliverance will be a blessing which shall outshine the former blessing of redemption from Egypt. But just as this deliverance will excel the earlier one, so much the greater will the affliction of Israel in the northern land be than the Egyptian bondage had been. On this point Ros. throws especial weight, remarking that the aim of these verses is not so much to give promise of coming salvation, as to announce instare illis atrocius malum, quam illud Aegyptiacum, eamque quam mox sint subituri servitutem multo fore duriorem, quam olim Aegyptiaca fuerit. But though this idea does lie implicite in the words, yet we must not fail to be sure that the prospect held out of a future deliverance of Israel from the lands into which it is soon to be scattered, and of its restoration again to the land of its fathers, has, in the first and foremost place, a comforting import, and that it is intended to preserve the godly from despair under the catastrophe which is now awaiting them.<p>(Note: Calvin has excellently brought out both moments, and has thus expounded the thought of the passage: "Scitis unde patres vestri exierint, nempe e fornace aenea, quemadmodum alibi loquitur (xi. 4) et quasi ex profunda morte; itaque redemptio illa debuit esse memorabilis usque ad finem mundi. Sed jam Deus conjiciet vos in abyssum, quae longe profundior erit illa Aegypti tyrannide, e qua erepti sunt patres vestri; nam si inde vos redimat, erit miraculum longe excellentius ad posteros, ut fere exstinguat vel saltem obscuret memoriam prioris illius redemptionis.")<p>&#1500;&#1499;&#1503; is not nevertheless, but, as universally, therefore; and the train of thought is as follows: Because the Lord will, for their idolatry, cast forth His people into the lands of the heathen, just for that very reason will their redemption from exile not fail to follow, and this deliverance surpass in gloriousness the greatest of all former deeds of blessing, the rescue of Israel from Egypt. The prospect of future redemption given amidst announcements of judgment cannot be surprising in Jeremiah, who elsewhere also interweaves the like happy forecastings with his most solemn threatenings; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-27.htm">Jeremiah 4:27</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-10.htm">Jeremiah 5:10</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-18.htm">Jeremiah 5:18</a>, with <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-14.htm">Jeremiah 3:14</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-3.htm">Jeremiah 23:3</a>., etc. "This ray of light, falling suddenly into the darkness, does not take us more by surprise than 'I will not make a full end,' <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-27.htm">Jeremiah 4:27</a>. There is therefore no reason for regarding these two verses as interpolations from <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-7.htm">Jeremiah 23:7-8</a>" (Graf). </body></html>
