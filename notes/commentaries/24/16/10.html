In what are we worse than our fathers, or than other nations?” All prophets had more or less to encounter the same hardness. It reaches its highest form in the reiterated questions of the same type in Malachi 1, 2.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/16.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>16:10-13 Here seems to be the language of those who quarrel at the word of God, and instead of humbling and condemning themselves, justify themselves, as though God did them wrong. A plain and full answer is given. They were more obstinate in sin than their fathers, walking every one after the devices of his heart. Since they will not hearken, they shall be hurried away into a far country, a land they know not.

"And the word of Jahveh cam to me, saying: <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-2.htm">Jeremiah 16:2</a>. Thou shalt not take thee a wife, neither shalt thou have sons or daughters in this place. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-3.htm">Jeremiah 16:3</a>. For thus hath Jahveh said concerning the sons and the daughters that are born in this place, and concerning their mothers that bear them, and concerning their fathers that beget them in this land: <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-4.htm">Jeremiah 16:4</a>. By deadly suffering shall they die, be neither lamented or buried; dung upon the field shall they become; and by sword and by famine shall they be consumed, and their carcases shall be meat for the fowls of the heavens and the beasts of the field. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-5.htm">Jeremiah 16:5</a>. For thus hath Jahveh said: Come not into the house of mourning, and go not to lament, and bemoan them not; for I have taken away my peace from this people, saith Jahveh, grace and mercies. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-6.htm">Jeremiah 16:6</a>. And great and small shall die in this land, not be buried; they shall not lament them, nor cut themselves, nor make themselves bald for them. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-7.htm">Jeremiah 16:7</a>. And they shall not break bread for them in their mourning, to comfort one for the dead; nor shall they give to any the cup of comfort for his father and his mother. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-8.htm">Jeremiah 16:8</a>. And into the house of feasting go not, to sit by them, to eat and to drink. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-9.htm">Jeremiah 16:9</a>. For thus hath spoken Jahveh of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I cause to cease out of this place before your eyes, and in your days, the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride."<p>What the prophet is here bidden to do and to forbear is closely bound up with the proclamation enjoined on him of judgment to come on sinful Judah. This connection is brought prominently forward in the reasons given for these commands. He is neither to take a wife nor to beget children, because all the inhabitants of the land, sons and daughters, mothers and fathers, are to perish by sickness, the sword, and famine (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-3.htm">Jeremiah 16:3</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-4.htm">Jeremiah 16:4</a>). He is both to abstain from the customary usages of mourning for the dead, and to keep away from mirthful feasts, in order to give the people to understand that, by reason of the multitude of the dead, customary mourning will have to be given up, and that all opportunity for merry-making will disappear (<a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-5.htm">Jeremiah 16:5-9</a>). Adapting thus his actions to help to convey his message, he will approve himself to be the mouth of the Lord, and then the promised divine protection will not fail. Thus closely is this passage connected with the preceding complaint and reproof of the prophet (<a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-10.htm">Jeremiah 15:10-21</a>), while it at the same time further continues the threatening of judgment in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-1.htm">Jeremiah 15:1-9</a>. - With the prohibition to take a wife, cf. the apostle's counsel, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-26.htm">1 Corinthians 7:26</a>. "This place" alternates with "this land," and so must not be limited to Jerusalem, but bears on Judah at large. &#1497;&#1500;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501;, adject. verbale, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/1-32.htm">Exodus 1:32</a>. The form &#1502;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497; is found, besides here, only in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-8.htm">Ezekiel 28:8</a>, where it takes the place of &#1502;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-10.htm">Jeremiah 16:10</a>. &#1514;&#1495;&#1500;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501;  &#1502;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;, lit., deaths of sicknesses or sufferings, i.e., deaths by all kinds of sufferings, since &#1514;&#1495;&#1500;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501; is not to be confined to disease, but in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-18.htm">Jeremiah 14:18</a> is used of pining away by famine. With "they shall not be lamented," cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-33.htm">Jeremiah 25:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-2.htm">Jeremiah 8:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-16.htm">Jeremiah 14:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-33.htm">Jeremiah 7:33</a>.</body></html>
