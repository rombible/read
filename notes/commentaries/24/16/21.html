He will find out and raise up instruments of his wrath, that shall destroy the Jews, by fraud like fishers, by force like hunters. The prophet, rejoicing at the hope of mercy to come, addressed the Lord as his strength and refuge. The deliverance out of captivity shall be a figure of the great salvation to be wrought by the Messiah.

With <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-11.htm">Jeremiah 16:11</a> cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-8.htm">Jeremiah 11:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-10.htm">Jeremiah 11:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-24.htm">Jeremiah 7:24</a>; with "ye did yet worse," etc., cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-9.htm">1 Kings 14:9</a>; and on "after the stubbornness," cf. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-17.htm">1 Kings 3:17</a>. The apodosis begins with "therefore I cast you out." On this head cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-15.htm">Jeremiah 7:15</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-15.htm">Jeremiah 9:15</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-26.htm">Jeremiah 22:26</a>. The article in &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509;, Graf quite unnecessarily insists on having cancelled, as out of place. It is explained sufficiently by the fact, that the land, of which mention has so often been made, is looked on as a specific one, and is characterized by the following relative clause, as one unknown to the people. Besides, the "ye know not" is not meant of geographical ignorance, but, as is often the case with &#1497;&#1491;&#1506;, the knowledge is that obtained by direct experience. They know not the land, because they have never been there. "There ye may serve them," Ros. justly characterizes as concessio cum ironia: there ye may serve, as long as ye will, the gods whom ye have so longed after. The irony is especially marked in the "day and night." Here Jeremiah has in mind <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-28.htm">Deuteronomy 4:28</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-36.htm">Deuteronomy 28:36</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-63.htm">Deuteronomy 28:63</a>. &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; is causal, giving the grounds of the threat, "I cast you out." The form &#1495;&#1504;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492; is hap leg . - In <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-14.htm">Jeremiah 16:14</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-15.htm">Jeremiah 16:15</a> the prophet opens to the people a view of ultimate redemption from the affliction amidst the heathen, into which, for their sin, they will be cast. By and by men will swear no more by Jahveh who redeemed them out of Egypt, but by Jahveh who has brought them again from the land of the north and the other lands into which they have been thrust forth. In this is implied that this second deliverance will be a blessing which shall outshine the former blessing of redemption from Egypt. But just as this deliverance will excel the earlier one, so much the greater will the affliction of Israel in the northern land be than the Egyptian bondage had been. On this point Ros. throws especial weight, remarking that the aim of these verses is not so much to give promise of coming salvation, as to announce instare illis atrocius malum, quam illud Aegyptiacum, eamque quam mox sint subituri servitutem multo fore duriorem, quam olim Aegyptiaca fuerit. But though this idea does lie implicite in the words, yet we must not fail to be sure that the prospect held out of a future deliverance of Israel from the lands into which it is soon to be scattered, and of its restoration again to the land of its fathers, has, in the first and foremost place, a comforting import, and that it is intended to preserve the godly from despair under the catastrophe which is now awaiting them.<p>(Note: Calvin has excellently brought out both moments, and has thus expounded the thought of the passage: "Scitis unde patres vestri exierint, nempe e fornace aenea, quemadmodum alibi loquitur (xi. 4) et quasi ex profunda morte; itaque redemptio illa debuit esse memorabilis usque ad finem mundi. Sed jam Deus conjiciet vos in abyssum, quae longe profundior erit illa Aegypti tyrannide, e qua erepti sunt patres vestri; nam si inde vos redimat, erit miraculum longe excellentius ad posteros, ut fere exstinguat vel saltem obscuret memoriam prioris illius redemptionis.")<p>&#1500;&#1499;&#1503; is not nevertheless, but, as universally, therefore; and the train of thought is as follows: Because the Lord will, for their idolatry, cast forth His people into the lands of the heathen, just for that very reason will their redemption from exile not fail to follow, and this deliverance surpass in gloriousness the greatest of all former deeds of blessing, the rescue of Israel from Egypt. The prospect of future redemption given amidst announcements of judgment cannot be surprising in Jeremiah, who elsewhere also interweaves the like happy forecastings with his most solemn threatenings; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-27.htm">Jeremiah 4:27</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-10.htm">Jeremiah 5:10</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-18.htm">Jeremiah 5:18</a>, with <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-14.htm">Jeremiah 3:14</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-3.htm">Jeremiah 23:3</a>., etc. "This ray of light, falling suddenly into the darkness, does not take us more by surprise than 'I will not make a full end,' <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-27.htm">Jeremiah 4:27</a>. There is therefore no reason for regarding these two verses as interpolations from <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-7.htm">Jeremiah 23:7-8</a>" (Graf). </body></html>
