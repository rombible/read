With Jeremiah it was probably more indefinite, and in the intense consciousness of his own weakness he would naturally use a word below the actual standard of his age; and there is accordingly nothing against assuming any age within the third hebdomad of life. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/34-19.htm" title="And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had delight in Jacob's daughter: and he was more honorable than all the house of his father.">Genesis 34:19</a> it is used of a young man old enough for marriage. The words are memorable as striking a note common to the lives of many prophets; common, also, we may add, to most men as they feel themselves called to any great work. So Moses draws back: “I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-10.htm" title="And Moses said to the LORD, O my LORD, I am not eloquent, neither heretofore, nor since you have spoken to your servant: but I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue.">Exodus 4:10</a>). So Isaiah cries, “Woe is me! for . . . I am a man of unclean lips” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-5.htm" title="Then said I, Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the middle of a people of unclean lips: for my eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts.">Isaiah 6:5</a>); and Peter, “Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/5-8.htm" title="When Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord.">Luke 5:8</a>). Something of the same shrinking is implied in St. Paul’s command to Timothy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-12.htm" title="Let no man despise your youth; but be you an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.">1Timothy 4:12</a>). In tracing the whole course of Jeremiah’s work, we must never forget the divine constraint by which he entered on them. A necessity was laid upon him, as afterwards on St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-16.htm" title="For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for necessity is laid on me; yes, woe is to me, if I preach not the gospel!">1Corinthians 9:16</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/jeremiah/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-6.htm" title="Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! behold, I cannot speak: for I am a child.">Jeremiah 1:6</a></span>. <span class="ital">Then said I, Ah, Lord God, </span>&c. — He modestly excuses himself from a consideration of the weight of the work, and the tenderness of his age, as in the next expression. <span class="ital">Behold, I cannot speak; for I am a child </span>— We cannot infer from this, that Jeremiah was within the years of what is properly called childhood. For he might call himself a child by way of extenuating his abilities; as Solomon calls himself a little child, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-7.htm" title="And he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest: and they following Adonijah helped him.">1 Kings 1:7</a>, although at that time he was married, and must have been at least twenty years of age. And the word <span class="ital">child, </span>or <span class="ital">youth, </span>is elsewhere used of those who were arrived at the first years of manhood.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:1-10 Jeremiah's early call to the work and office of a prophet is stated. He was to be a prophet, not to the Jews only, but to the neighbouring nations. He is still a prophet to the whole world, and it would be well if they would attend to these warnings. The Lord who formed us, knows for what particular services and purposes he intended us. But unless he sanctify us by his new-creating Spirit, we shall neither be fit for his holy service on earth, nor his holy happiness in heaven. It becomes us to have low thoughts of ourselves. Those who are young, should consider that they are so, and not venture beyond their powers. But though a sense of our own weakness and insufficiency should make us go humbly about our work, it should not make us draw back when God calls us. Those who have messages to deliver from God, must not fear the face of man. The Lord, by a sign, gave Jeremiah such a gift as was necessary. God's message should be delivered in his own words. Whatever wordly wise men or politicians may think, the safety of kingdoms is decided according to the purpose and word of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>There is no resistance on Jeremiah's part, but he shrinks back alarmed.<p>I cannot speak - i. e., "I cannot prophesy," I have not those powers of oratory necessary for success. The prophets of Israel were the national preachers in religious matters, and their orators in political.<p>I am a child - This implies nothing very definite about Jeremiah's age. Still the long duration of his prophetic mission makes it probable that he was very young when called to the office, as also were Isaiah, Hosea, Zechariah, and others. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. From the long duration of his office (Jer 1:2, 3; Jer 40:1, &c.; Jer 43:8, &c.), it is supposed that he was at the time of his call under twenty-five years of age.<p>child&#8212;the same word is translated, "young man" (2Sa 18:5). The reluctance often shown by inspired ministers of God (Ex 4:10; 6:12, 30; Jon 1:3) to accept the call, shows that they did not assume the office under the impulse of self-deceiving fanaticism, as false prophets often did.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Ah!</span> an introductory interjection, making way for his excuse in a way of grief and complaint, endeavouring with all reverence to clear himself of undertaking such a work rashly, it being properly the sigh of one that hath too great a weight upon his shoulders. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I cannot speak; </span> not dumb, as Zacharias, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-20.htm" title="And, behold, you shall be dumb, and not able to speak, until the day that these things shall be performed, because you believe not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their season.">Luke 1:20</a>,22</span>, nor stammering, as Moses, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-10.htm" title="And Moses said to the LORD, O my LORD, I am not eloquent, neither heretofore, nor since you have spoken to your servant: but I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue.">Exodus 4:10</a>,14</span>; but not with that becoming gravity and commanding majesty as is suitable to a prophet; he modestly excuseth himself, from a consideration of the weight of the work, and the tenderness of his age, as in the next expression. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I am a child; </span> either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

The word  "Ah", or "Ahah", is used in distress and grief, as Kimchi observes; and is expressive of mourning and complaint, as Jarchi notes; and shows that the prophet was troubled and uneasy at his call, and would gladly have been excused on the following account: <p>behold, I cannot speak; or, "I know not how to speak" (r); properly and pertinently, politely and eloquently, especially before great personages, kings and princes, and the citizens of Jerusalem, being brought up in a rustic manner in the country. A like excuse Moses made, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-10.htm">Exodus 4:10</a>. The Targum is, "I know not to prophesy: for I am a child"; meaning either in knowledge and understanding, or in years; not a mere child, but a "junior", as the Septuagint version renders the word; or a "young man", as the Arabic version; so Samuel and Zechariah were young men, when they first ministered in their office, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-1.htm">1 Samuel 3:1</a>. Abarbinel supposes that Jeremiah was now twelve or fifteen years of age; but it should seem rather that he was more, perhaps twenty years of age; since he seems to have prophesied to the men of Anathoth before he was sent to Jerusalem, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-21.htm">Jeremiah 11:21</a>. <p>(r)   "uescio loqui", V.

Jeremiah shews that the prophetic office was not one of his own seeking.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Ah</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">Alas</span>! The word in the Hebrew expresses not so much an entreaty that things should be arranged otherwise, as a lament that they are as they are; cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/7-7.htm" title="And Joshua said, Alas, O LORD God, why have you at all brought this people over Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us? would to God we had been content, and dwelled on the other side Jordan!">Joshua 7:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-10.htm" title="And the king of Israel said, Alas! that the LORD has called these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Moab!">2 Kings 3:10</a>. Jeremiah’s position is thus different from that of Moses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-10.htm" title="And Moses said to the LORD, O my LORD, I am not eloquent, neither heretofore, nor since you have spoken to your servant: but I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue.">Exodus 4:10</a>). The latter pleaded inability, “Oh Lord, I am not eloquent,” while the former acquiesces in the appointment, now announced to have been made so long before, deploring only youth and inexperience (cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-5.htm" title="Then said I, Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the middle of a people of unclean lips: for my eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts.">Isaiah 6:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-15.htm" title="Then I came to them of the captivity at Telabib, that dwelled by the river of Chebar, and I sat where they sat, and remained there astonished among them seven days.">Ezekiel 3:15</a> ff.), and replies to the Almighty in the same spirit as Solomon at the beginning of his reign (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-7.htm" title="And now, O LORD my God, you have made your servant king instead of David my father: and I am but a little child: I know not how to go out or come in.">1 Kings 3:7</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Lord God</span>] lit. Lord Yahweh (Jehovah). When the Hebrew word <span class="ital">Adônai</span> (Lord), which was ordinarily used in reading as a substitute for Yahweh, immediately (as here) precedes that word, the latter was read as God (<span class="ital">Elôhîm</span>), and in such cases is printed in E.VV. in capitals.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">I cannot speak</span>] meaning, I have not the powers necessary to win a hearing. For the prophet of those days eloquence, natural or acquired, was as necessary as it is for one who would be a popular preacher or prominent statesman now.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">I am a child</span>] meaning, a very young man. The length of Jeremiah’s ministry shews that he was very youthful at its commencement. So Isaiah must have been still a young man when he began to prophesy.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ah, Lord God</span>! rather, Alas, O <span class="accented">Lord Jehovah!</span> It is a cry of alarm and pain, and recurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-10.htm">Jeremiah 4:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-13.htm">Jeremiah 14:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-17.htm">Jeremiah 32:17</a>. <span class="cmt_word">I am a child</span>.

"And they go out and look at the corpses of the men that have rebelled against me, for their worm will not die and their fire will not be quenched, and they become an abomination to all flesh." They perfects are perf. cons. regulated by the foregoing &#1497;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488;. &#1493;&#1497;&#1510;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; (accented with pashta in our editions, but more correctly with munach) refers to their going out of the holy city. The prophet had predicted in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-18.htm">Isaiah 66:18</a>, that in the last times the whole multitude of the enemies of Jerusalem would be crowded together against it, in the hope of getting possession of it. This accounts for the fact that the neighbourhood of Jerusalem becomes such a scene of divine judgment. &#1489;&#1468; &#1512;&#1488;&#1492; always denotes a fixed, lingering look directed to any object; here it is connected with the grateful feeling of satisfaction at the righteous acts of God and their own gracious deliverance. &#1491;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1503;, which only occurs again in <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/12-2.htm">Daniel 12:2</a>, is the strongest word for "abomination." It is very difficult to imagine the picture which floated before the prophet's mind. How is it possible that all flesh, i.e., all men of all nations, should find room in Jerusalem and the temple? Even if the city and temple should be enlarged, as Ezekiel and Zechariah predict, the thing itself still remains inconceivable. And again, how can corpses be eaten by worms at the same time as they are being burned, or how can they be the endless prey of worms and fire without disappearing altogether from the sight of man? It is perfectly obvious, that the thing itself, as here described, must appear monstrous and inconceivable, however we may suppose it to be realized. The prophet, by the very mode of description adopted by him, precludes the possibility of our conceiving of the thing here set forth as realized in any material form in this present state. He is speaking of the future state, but in figures drawn from the present world. The object of his prediction is no other than the new Jerusalem of the world to come, and the eternal torment of the damned; but the way in which he pictures it, forces us to translate it out of the figures drawn from this life into the realities of the life to come; as has already been done in the apocryphal books of Judith (16:17) and Wisdom (7:17), as well as in the New Testament, e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/9-43.htm">Mark 9:43</a>., with evident reference to this passage. This is just the distinction between the Old Testament and the New, that the Old Testament brings down the life to come to the level of this life, whilst the New Testament lifts up this life to the level of the life to come; that the Old Testament depicts both this life and the life to come as an endless extension of this life, whilst the New Testament depicts is as a continuous line in two halves, the last point in this finite state being the first point of the infinite state beyond; that the Old Testament preserves the continuity of this life and the life to come by transferring the outer side, the form, the appearance of this life to the life to come, the New Testament by making the inner side, the nature, the reality of the life to come, the &#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3bc;&#x3b5; &#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, immanent in this life. The new Jerusalem of our prophet has indeed a new heaven above it and a new earth under it, but it is only the old Jerusalem of earth lifted up to its highest glory and happiness; whereas the new Jerusalem of the Apocalypse comes down from heaven, and is therefore of heavenly nature. In the former dwells the Israel that has been brought back from captivity; in the latter, the risen church of those who are written in the book of life. And whilst our prophet transfers the place in which the rebellious are judged to the neighbourhood of Jerusalem itself; in the Apocalypse, the lake of fire in which the life of the ungodly is consumed, and the abode of God with men, are for ever separated. The Hinnom-valley outside Jerusalem has become Gehenna, and this is no longer within the precincts of the new Jerusalem, because there is no need of any such example to the righteous who are for ever perfect. <p>In the lessons prepared for the synagogue <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-23.htm">Isaiah 66:23</a> is repeated after <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-24.htm">Isaiah 66:24</a>, on account of the terrible character of the latter, "so as to close with words of consolation."<p>(Note: Isaiah is therefore regarded as an exception to the rule, that the prophets close their orations &#1493;&#1514;&#1504;&#1495;&#1493;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; &#1513;&#1489;&#1495; &#1489;&#1491;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497; (b. Berachoth 31a), although, on the other hand, this exception is denied by some, on the ground that the words "they shall be an abhorring" apply to the Gentiles (j. Berachoth c. V. Anf. Midras Tillim on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/4-8.htm">Psalm 4:8</a>).)<p>But the prophet, who has sealed the first two sections of these prophetic orations with the words, "there is no peace to the wicked," intentionally closes the third section with this terrible picture of their want of peace. The promises have gradually soared into the clear light of the eternal glory, to the new creation in eternity; and the threatenings have sunk down to the depth of eternal torment, which is the eternal foil of the eternal light. More than this we could not expect from our prophet. His threefold book is now concluded. It consists of twenty-seven orations. The central one of the whole, i.e., the fourteenth, is <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-13.htm">Isaiah 52:13-53:12</a>; so that the cross forms the centre of this prophetic trilogy. Per crucem ad lucem is its watchword. The self-sacrifice of the Servant of Jehovah lays the foundation for a new Israel, a new human race, a new heaven and a new earth. </body></html>
