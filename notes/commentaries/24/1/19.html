Even in its lower sense, “Immanuel,” God with us (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-14.htm" title="Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.">Isaiah 7:14</a>), was the watchword of every true combatant in God’s great army.<p><span class= "bld"><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:11-19 God gave Jeremiah a view of the destruction of Judah and Jerusalem by the Chaldeans. The almond-tree, which is more forward in the spring than any other, represented the speedy approach of judgments. God also showed whence the intended ruin should arise. Jeremiah saw a seething-pot boiling, representing Jerusalem and Judah in great commotion. The mouth or face of the furnace or hearth, was toward the north; from whence the fire and fuel were to come. The northern powers shall unite. The cause of these judgments was the sin of Judah. The whole counsel of God must be declared. The fear of God is the best remedy against the fear of man. Better to have all men our enemies than God our enemy; those who are sure they have God with them, need not, ought not to fear, whoever is against them.

"And there came to me the word of Jahveh for the second time, saying, What seest thou? And I:said: I see a seething-pot; and it looketh hither from the north. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-14.htm">Jeremiah 1:14</a>. Then said Jahveh to me: From the north will trouble break forth upon all inhabitants of the land. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-15.htm">Jeremiah 1:15</a>. For, behold, I call to all families of the kingdoms towards the north, saith Jahveh; that they come and set each his throne before the gates of Jerusalem, and against all her walls round about, and against all cities of Judah. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-16.htm">Jeremiah 1:16</a>. And I will pronounce judgment against them for all their wickedness, in that they have forsaken me, and have offered odours to other gods, and worshipped the work of their hands." &#1505;&#1497;&#1512; is a large pot or caldron in which can be cooked vegetables or meat for many persons at once; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-38.htm">2 Kings 4:38</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-3.htm">Ezekiel 24:3</a>. &#1504;&#1508;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;, fanned, blown upon, used of fire, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-36.htm">Ezekiel 21:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-20.htm">Ezekiel 22:20</a>.; then by transference, seething, steaming, since the caldron under which fire is fanned steams, its contents boil; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/41-12.htm">Job 41:12</a>. The &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; of the pot is the side turned to the spectator (the prophet), the side towards the front. This is turned from the north this way, i.e., set so that its contents will run thence this way. &#1510;&#1508;&#1493;&#1504;&#1492;, properly: towards the north; then, that which lies towards the north, or the northerly direction. In the interpretation of this symbol in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-14.htm">Jeremiah 1:14</a>, &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1495;, assonant to &#1504;&#1508;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;, is introduced, just as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-2.htm">Amos 8:2</a> &#1511;&#1497;&#1509;  is explained by &#1511;&#1509;; so that there was no occasion for the conjecture of Houbig. and Graf: &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1495;, it is fanned up; and against this we have Hitzig's objection that the Hophal of &#1504;&#1508;&#1495; never occurs. Equally uncalled for is Hitzig's own conjecture, xaw%pt@f, it will steam, fume, be kindled; while against this we have the fact, that as to xpanf no evidence can be given for the meaning be kindled, and that we have no cases of such a mode of speaking as: the trouble is fuming, steaming up. The Arabian poetical saying: their pot steams or boils, i.e., a war is being prepared by them, is not sufficient to justify such a figure. We hold then &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1495; for the correct reading, and decline to be led astray by the paraphrastic &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; of the lxx, since &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1495; gives a suitable sense. It is true, indeed, that &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1495; usually means open; but an opening of the caldron by the removal of the lid is not (with Graf) to be thought of. But, again, &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1495; has the derived sig. let loose, let off (cf. ,&#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1495; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-17.htm">Isaiah 14:17</a>), from which there can be no difficulty in inferring for the Niph. the sig. be let loose, and in the case of trouble, calamity: break forth. That which is in the pot runs over as the heat increases, and pours itself on the hearth or ground. If the seething contents of the pot represent disaster, their running over will point to its being let loose, its breaking out.  are the inhabitants of the land of Judah, as the interpretation in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-15.htm">Jeremiah 1:15</a> shows. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-15.htm">Jeremiah 1:15</a> reference to the figure is given up, and the further meaning is given in direct statement. The Lord will call to all families of the kingdoms of the north, and they will come ( equals  that they are to come). The kingdoms of the north are not merely the kingdoms of Syria, but in general those of Upper Asia; since all armies marching from the Euphrates towards Palestine entered the land from the north. &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514;, families, are the separate races of nations, hence often used in parallelism with &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501;; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-25.htm">Jeremiah 10:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/3-4.htm">Nahum 3:4</a>. We must not conclude from this explanation of the vision seen that the seething pot symbolizes the Chaldeans themselves or the kingdom of Nebuchadnezzar; such a figure would be too unnatural. The seething pot, whose contents boil over, symbolizes the disaster and ruin which the families of the kingdoms of the north will pour out on Judah. </body></html>
