The almond-tree, which is more forward in the spring than any other, represented the speedy approach of judgments. God also showed whence the intended ruin should arise. Jeremiah saw a seething-pot boiling, representing Jerusalem and Judah in great commotion. The mouth or face of the furnace or hearth, was toward the north; from whence the fire and fuel were to come. The northern powers shall unite. The cause of these judgments was the sin of Judah. The whole counsel of God must be declared. The fear of God is the best remedy against the fear of man. Better to have all men our enemies than God our enemy; those who are sure they have God with them, need not, ought not to fear, whoever is against them. Let us pray that we may be willing to give up personal interests, and that nothing may move us from our duty.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Hasten - Rather, I watch over "my word to perform it." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. hasten&#8212;rather, "I will be wakeful as to My word," &c.; alluding to Jer 1:11, "the wakeful tree" [Maurer].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Thou hast well seen; </span> or, Thou hast seen and judged right; or, as the Hebrew, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Thou hast done well to see, </span> i.e. in seeing so. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I will hasten; </span> word for word, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I will almond-tree it, </span> i.e. I will be upon them speedily, in a short time, and suddenly, ere they are aware; or, I will watch, and be ready to accomplish this in due time. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">My word, </span> i.e. my word of threatening against Judah and its inhabitants. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then said the Lord unto me, thou hast well seen,.... The thing seen is a very proper emblem of what I am about to do, and the quick dispatch that will be made therein: <p>for l will hasten my word to perform it; the words , "shoked ani", "I will hasten", or "I am hastening", are in allusion to  "shoked", the name of the almond tree in Hebrew; which is so called because it is quick and early, and, as it were, hastens to bring forth its flowers, leaves, and fruit; in like manner the Lord says he would hasten to perform what he had said or should say by him concerning the destruction of Jerusalem, and the captivity of the people, and every thing else he should give him in commission to say. Jarchi and Abendana make mention of an ancient Midrash, or exposition, to this sense; that from the time of the almond tree's putting forth, until its fruit is ripe, are one and twenty days, according to the number of days which were between the seventeenth of Tammuz, in which the city was broken up, and the ninth of Ab, in which the temple was burnt; but though the almond tree is the first of trees, and is very early in putting forth, yet there is a greater time than this between its putting forth and its fruit being ripe; for Pliny (s) says, that the almond tree first of all flowers in January, and its fruit is ripe in March. <p>(s) Nat.

Moses was not ready of speech, he lacked the gift of utterance; Jeremiah, on the other hand, only thinks himself not yet equal to the task by reason of his youth and want of experience. </body></html>
