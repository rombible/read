This was as strong a contrast as possible to the vernal beauty of the almond-bough, and told too plainly the terrors which were to be expected from the regions that lay to the north of the land of Israel, Assyria and Chaldæa. The flood of water at the boiling point went beyond the “waters of the great river” of Israel’s symbolism (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-7.htm" title="Now therefore, behold, the Lord brings up on them the waters of the river, strong and many, even the king of Assyria, and all his glory: and he shall come up over all his channels, and go over all his banks:">Isaiah 8:7</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/jeremiah/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-13.htm" title="And the word of the LORD came to me the second time, saying, What see you?

According to this interpretation, the pot denoted the empire of the Chaldeans, lying to the north of Judea, and pouring forth its multitudes like a thick vapour.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:11-19 God gave Jeremiah a view of the destruction of Judah and Jerusalem by the Chaldeans. The almond-tree, which is more forward in the spring than any other, represented the speedy approach of judgments. God also showed whence the intended ruin should arise. Jeremiah saw a seething-pot boiling, representing Jerusalem and Judah in great commotion. The mouth or face of the furnace or hearth, was toward the north; from whence the fire and fuel were to come. The northern powers shall unite. The cause of these judgments was the sin of Judah. The whole counsel of God must be declared. The fear of God is the best remedy against the fear of man. Better to have all men our enemies than God our enemy; those who are sure they have God with them, need not, ought not to fear, whoever is against them.

He was to be the bearer of tidings of a great national calamity about to break forth item the north. He sees a caldron. It was a vessel of metal <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-11.htm">Ezekiel 24:11</a>, large enough to prepare the meal of a numerous community <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-38.htm">2 Kings 4:38</a>, and broad at the top, as it was also used for washing purposes <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/60-8.htm">Psalm 60:8</a>. This caldron was boiling furiously.<p>The face ... - More correctly the margin, i. e toward the south. We must suppose this caldron set upon a pile of inflammable materials. As they consume it settles down unevenly, with the highest side toward the north, so that its face is turned the other way and looks southward. Should it still continue so to settle, the time must finally come when it will be overturned, and will pour the whole mass of its boiling contents upon the south. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13.

The pot in the north rested on one side, its mouth being about to pour forth its contents southwards, namely, on Judea. Babylon, though east of Judea, was regarded by the Hebrews as north, because they appropriated the term "east" to Arabia-Deserta, stretching from Palestine to the Euphrates; or rather [Bochart], the reference here is not to the site, but to the route of the Babylonians; not being able to cross the desert, they must enter the Holy Land by the northern frontier, through Riblah in Hamath (Jer 39:5; 52:9).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> After the smaller punishment from the Lord follows this of the boiling pot, by which understand Judea and Jerusalem, as may appear by the application that they themselves make of it in a way of scorn and derision, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-3.htm" title="Which say, It is not near; let us build houses: this city is the caldron, and we be the flesh.">Ezekiel 11:3</a>,7</span>.

The symbol of the caldron<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">13</span>. <span class="ital">a seething caldron</span>] An ordinary sight in daily life conveys a message to the prophet. In this second symbol the character of the future in store for the nation is more clearly brought out. The word <span class="ital">sîr</span>, here rendered caldron, denotes a large vessel, as it could be used in preparing pottage for a considerable number (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-38.htm" title="And Elisha came again to Gilgal: and there was a dearth in the land; and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him: and he said to his servant, Set on the great pot, and seethe pottage for the sons of the prophets.">2 Kings 4:38</a>). It was also used for washing (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/60-8.htm" title="Moab is my wash pot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe: Philistia, triumph you because of me.">Psalm 60:8</a>). The word rendered “seething” (boiling) is lit. blown, i.e. well heated, and so boiling.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the face thereof is from the north</span>] The expression is an awkward one, and the symbol has been explained in two ways. Either (<span class="ital">a</span>) the spectator in the south sees the contents of the caldron ready to boil over in his direction, or, perhaps better (with a slight change in the Hebrew), (<span class="ital">b</span>) the caldron is thought of as supported by stones on three of its sides, while the fourth, i.e. the north side, is open and is being fed with fuel from that side. If we accept (<span class="ital">a</span>), the people in Judaea will receive the boiling contents, if (<span class="ital">b</span>), the point will be that the fuel is supplied from the north and employed with hostile intent against the Jews, now themselves figuring as the contents of the vessel. Whichever view we take, an attack from the north is plainly indicated. For the application, as referring to a threatened invasion of Scythian hordes, see Intr. i. § 3. Later, the danger from the north came to be the Empire of Babylon and the symbol would be equally suggestive. In earlier days, Assyrians had come from the north and carried the ten tribes captive. It was thus a region whose associations inspired dread.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A seething pot</span>. There is a variety of Hebrew words for "pot." The word here used suggests a vessel of large size, since pottage for a whole company of prophets could be cooked in such. a pot or caldron (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-38.htm">2 Kings 4:38</a>). From <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-11.htm">Ezekiel 24:11</a> we may infer that it was of metal. A "seething pot" in ancient Arabic poetry is a figure for war. The same symbol occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-3.htm">Ezekiel 24:3-12</a>, but with a different application. <span class="cmt_word">The face thereof is toward the north</span>; rather, <span class="accented">toward the south</span>; literally, <span class="accented">from the face of the north</span>.
