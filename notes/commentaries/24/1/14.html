The almond-tree, which is more forward in the spring than any other, represented the speedy approach of judgments. God also showed whence the intended ruin should arise. Jeremiah saw a seething-pot boiling, representing Jerusalem and Judah in great commotion. The mouth or face of the furnace or hearth, was toward the north; from whence the fire and fuel were to come. The northern powers shall unite. The cause of these judgments was the sin of Judah. The whole counsel of God must be declared. The fear of God is the best remedy against the fear of man. Better to have all men our enemies than God our enemy; those who are sure they have God with them, need not, ought not to fear, whoever is against them. Let us pray that we may be willing to give up personal interests, and that nothing may move us from our duty.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Out of the north ... - The caldron represents the great military empires upon the Euphrates. In Hezekiah's time, Nineveh was at their head; but stormed by the armies of Cyaxares and Nabopalassar it is itself now the victim whose limbs are seething in the caldron, and the seat of empire has been transferred to Babylon.

At present the caldron is fiercely boiling upon the Euphrates.

Previously to the battle of Carchemish, the Babylonians are only mentioned vaguely as a northern people (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-6.htm">Jeremiah 4:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-1.htm">Jeremiah 6:1, 22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-22.htm">Jeremiah 10:22</a>). Strictly speaking, they were an eastern people from the point of view of Palestine; but the caravan-road which the Chaldaean armies had to take entered Palestine at Dan (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-15.htm">Jeremiah 4:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-16.htm">Jeremiah 8:16</a>), and then proceeded southward.

Yet God does not let the matter cease with this pledge; but, further, He consecrates him to his calling. </body></html>
