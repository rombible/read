But afterward, it seems, the king of Babylon released him and made him a tributary king. After three years’ obedience, however, Jehoiakim rebelled, in confidence of assistance from Egypt. Soon after which Nebuchadnezzar’s army overran Judea, besieged Jerusalem, and probably took Jehoiakim prisoner in some sally that he made upon them, and killed him, and then cast out his dead body into the highway, denying him the common rites of burial: see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/24-1.htm" title="In his days Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up, and Jehoiakim became his servant three years: then he turned and rebelled against him....">2 Kings 24:1-6</a>.

Josiah was prevented from seeing the evil to come in this world, and removed to see the good to come in the other world; therefore, weep not for him, but for his son Shallum, who is likely to live and die a wretched captive. Dying saints may be justly envied, while living sinners are justly pitied. Here also is the doom of Jehoiakim. No doubt it is lawful for princes and great men to build, beautify, and furnish houses; but those who enlarge their houses, and make them sumptuous, need carefully to watch against the workings of vain-glory. He built his houses by unrighteousness, with money gotten unjustly. And he defrauded his workmen of their wages. God notices the wrong done by the greatest to poor servants and labourers, and will repay those in justice, who will not, in justice, pay those whom they employ. The greatest of men must look upon the meanest as their neighbours, and be just to them accordingly. Jehoiakim was unjust, and made no conscience of shedding innocent blood. Covetousness, which is the root of all evil, was at the bottom of all. The children who despise their parents' old fashions, commonly come short of their real excellences. Jehoiakim knew that his father found the way of duty to be the way of comfort, yet he would not tread in his steps. He shall die unlamented, hateful for oppression and cruelty.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Boldly by name is the judgment at length pronounced upon Jehoiakim.

Ah my brother! &#8230; sister!&#8212;addressing him with such titles of affection as one would address to a deceased friend beloved as a brother or sister (compare 1Ki 13:30). This expresses, They shall not lament him with the lamentation of private individuals [Vatablus], or of blood relatives [Grotius]: as "Ah! lord," expresses public lamentation in the case of a king [Vatablus], or that of subjects [Grotius]. Henderson thinks, "Ah! sister," refers to Jehoiakim's queen, who, though taken to Babylon and not left unburied on the way, as Jehoiakim, yet was not honored at her death with royal lamentations, such as would have been poured forth over her at Jerusalem. He notices the beauty of Jeremiah's manner in his prophecy against Jehoiakim. In Jer 22:13, 14 he describes him in general terms; then, in Jer 22:15-17, he directly addresses him without naming him; at last, in Jer 22:18, he names him, but in the third person, to imply that God puts him to a distance from Him. The boldness of the Hebrew prophets proves their divine mission; were it not so, their reproofs to the Hebrew kings, who held the throne by divine authority, would have been treason.<p>Ah his glory!&#8212;"Alas! his majesty."<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/22.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah; </span> a very bad son of a good father, whose name was Eliakim, by Pharaoh-nechoh turned to Jehoiakim, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-34.htm" title="And Pharaohnechoh made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in the room of Josiah his father, and turned his name to Jehoiakim, and took Jehoahaz away: and he came to Egypt, and died there.">2 Kings 23:34</a></span>, and by him set up.

This shows who is before spoken of and described; Jehoiakim, the then reigning king in Judah, whose name was Eliakim, but was changed by Pharaoh king of Egypt, when he deposed his brother Jehoahaz or Shallum, and set him on the throne, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-34.htm">2 Kings 23:34</a>; <p>the son of Josiah king of Judah; and who seems to have been his eldest son, though his brother Jehoahaz reigned before him; for he was but twenty three years of age when he began his reign, and he reigned but three months; and Jehoiakim was twenty five years old when he succeeded him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-31.htm">2 Kings 23:31</a>; his relation to Josiah is mentioned, not so much for his honour, but rather to his disgrace, and as an aggravation of his wickedness, that having so religious a parent, and such a religious education, and the advantage of such an example, and yet did so sadly degenerate: and it also suggests that this would be no security to him from the divine vengeance; but rather provoke it, to deal more severely with him; <p>they shall not lament for him; that is, his people, his subjects, shall not lament for him when dead, as they did for his father Josiah; so far from having any real grief or inward sorrow on account of his death, that they should not so much as outwardly express any, or use the common form at meeting together: <p>saying, ah my brother! or, ah sister! a woman meeting her brother would not say to him, O my brother, what bad news is this! we have lost our king! nor he reply to her, O sister, it is so, the loss is great indeed! for this is not to be understood of the funeral "lessus" at the interment of a king or queen; lamenting them under these appellations of brother or sister, which is denied of this prince. Kimchi thinks it has reference to his relations, as that they should not mourn for him, and say, "ah my brother!" nor for his wife, who died at the same time, though not mentioned, ah sister! both should die unlamented, as by their subjects, so by their nearest friends and relations; <p>they shall not lament for him, saying, ah lord! or, ah his glory! O our liege lord and sovereign, he is gone! where are his glory and majesty now? where are his crown, his sceptre, his robes, and other ensigns of royalty? So the Targum, <p>"woe, or alas, for the king; alas, for his kingdom;'' <p>a heavy stroke, a sorrowful melancholy providence this! but nothing of this kind should be said; as he lived not beloved, because of his oppression and violence, so he died without any lamentation for him. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/22.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah; They shall not lament for <span class="cverse3">{l}</span> him, <i>saying</i>, Ah my brother! or, Ah sister! they shall not lament for him, <i>saying</i>, Ah lord! or, Ah his glory!</span><p>(l) For everyone will have enough to lament for himself.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/22.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">18</span>. <span class="ital">Ah my brother! or, Ah sister!</span>] given as the usual formulae in lamenting a death (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-30.htm" title="And he laid his carcass in his own grave; and they mourned over him, saying, Alas, my brother!">1 Kings 13:30</a>).

The prediction was doubtless fulfilled, or it would not have been included in Jeremiah’s prophecies as edited. It is true that we read <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-6.htm" title="So Jehoiakim slept with his fathers: and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead.">2 Kings 24:6</a> that Jehoiakim “slept with his fathers,” but mention of his burial is significantly omitted.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - Josiah had been bitterly missed and universally lamented (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-25.htm">2 Chronicles 35:25</a>); and so, only perhaps with less heartiness in most cases, Jehoiakim's other predecessors (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-5.htm">Jeremiah 34:5</a>). The Babylonian kings, too, received the honors of public mourning, e.g. even the last of his race, who surrendered to Cyrus, according to the British Museum inscription translated by Mr. Pinches. <span class="cmt_word">Ah my brother! or, Ah sister!</span> The Septuagint omits the latter part of this phrase, apparently because it seemed inappropriate to the death of Jehoiakim; but the parallelism requires a two-membered clause. According to Movers, the funeral procession is to be conceived of as formed of two parts, condoling with each other on having to share the same fate ('Die Phonizier,' 2. 248). Or perhaps mythology may supply a reason; it is possible that the formulae of public mourning were derived from the ceremonies of the Adonia; Adonis was an androgynous deity (Lenormant, 'Lettres assyriologiques,' 2:209), and might be lamented by his devotees as at once "brother" and "sister." (For another view, see Sayco's edition of G. Smith's 'Chaldean Genesis,' p. 267). Ezekiel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-13.htm">Ezekiel 8:13</a>) testifies to the worship of Tammuz, or Adonis, and the highest compliment a king could receive might be to be lamented in the same terms as the sun-god. Jeremiah does not approve this; he merely describes the popular custom. The recognition of the deeply rooted heathenism of the Jews before the Exile involves no disparagement to Old Testament religion; rather it increases the cogency of the argument for its supernatural origin. For how great was the contrast between Jeremiah and his semi-heathen countrymen! And yet Jeremiah's religion is the seed of the faith which overcame the world. <span class="cmt_word">Ah lord! or, Ah his glory!</span> Lord is in the Hebrew <span class="accented">adon</span> (comp. Adonis and see above). <span class="accented">His glory</span> is against the parallelism; we should expect "lady" or "queen." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/22.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>On Jehoahaz. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-10.htm">Jeremiah 22:10</a>. "Weep not for the dead, neither bemoan him; weep rather for him that is gone away, for he shall no more return and see the land of his birth. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-11.htm">Jeremiah 22:11</a>. For thus saith Jahveh concerning Shallum, the son of Josiah king of Judah, who became king in his father Josiah's stead, and who went forth from this place: He shall not return thither more; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-12.htm">Jeremiah 22:12</a>. but in the place whither they have carried hi captive, there shall he die and see this land no more." The clause: weep not for the dead, with which the prophecy on Shallum is begun, shows that the mourning for King Josiah was kept up and was still heartily felt amongst the people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-24.htm">2 Chronicles 35:24</a>.), and that the circumstances of his death were still fresh in their memory. &#1500;&#1502;&#1514; without the article, although Josiah, slain in battle at Megiddo, is meant, because there was no design particularly to define the person. Him that goes or is gone away. He, again, is defined and called Shallum. This Shallum, who became king in his father Josiah's place, can be none other than Josiah's successor, who is called Joahaz in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-30.htm">2 Kings 23:30</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-1.htm">2 Chronicles 36:1</a>; as was seen by Chrysost. and Aben-Ezra, and, since Grotius, by most commentators. The only question is, why he should here be called Shallum. According to Frc. Junius, Hitz., and Graf, Jeremiah compares Joahaz on account of his short reign with Shallum in Israel, who reigned but one month (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-13.htm">2 Kings 15:13</a>), and ironically calls him Shallum, as Jezebel called Jehu, Zimri murderer of his lord, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-31.htm">2 Kings 9:31</a>. This explanation is unquestionably erroneous, since irony of such a sort is inconsistent with what Jeremiah says of Shallum. More plausible seems Hgstb.'s opinion, Christ. ii. p. 401, that Jeremiah gives Joahaz the name Shallum, i.e., the requited (cf. &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1501;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-13.htm">1 Chronicles 6:13</a>,  equals  &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1501;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-11.htm">1 Chronicles 9:11</a>), as nomen reale, to mark him out as the man the Lord had punished for the evil of his doings. But this conjecture too is overthrown by the fact, that in the genealogy of the kings of Judah, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-15.htm">1 Chronicles 3:15</a>, we find among the four sons of Josiah the name &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; instead of Joahaz. Now this name cannot have come there from the present passage, for the genealogies of Chronicles are derived from old family registers. That this is so in the case of Josiah's sons, appears from the mention there of a fourth, Johanan, over and above the three known to history, of whom we hear nothing more. In the genealogical tables persons are universally mentioned by their own proper names, not according to "renamings" or surnames, except in the case that these have received the currency and value of historical names, as e.g., Israel for Jacob. On the ground of the genealogical table <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3.htm">1 Chronicles 3</a> we must accordingly hold that Joahaz was properly called Shallum, and that probably at his accession he assumed the name &#1497;&#1493;&#1488;&#1495;&#1494;, "Jahveh sustains, holds." But Jeremiah might still have used the name Shallum in preference to the assumed Joahaz, because the former had verified itself in that king's fate. With <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-11.htm">Jeremiah 22:11</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-12.htm">Jeremiah 22:12</a>, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-33.htm">2 Kings 23:33-35</a>. - The brief saying in regard to Joahaz forms the transition from the general censure of the wicked rulers of Judah who brought on the ruin of the kingdom, to the special predictions concerning the ungodly kings Jehoiakim and Jehoiachin, in whose time the judgment burst forth. In counselling not to weep for the dead king (Josiah), but for the departed one (Joahaz), Jeremiah does not mean merely to bewail the lot of the king carried prisoner to Egypt, but to foreshadow the misery that awaits the whole people. From this point of view Calv. well says: si lugenda est urbis hujus clades, potius lugendi sunt qui manebunt superstites quam qui morientur. Mors enim erit quasi requies, erit portus ad finienda omnia mala: Vita autem longior nihil aliud erit quam continua miseriarum series; and further, that in the words: he shall no more return and see the land of his birth, Jeremiah shows: exilium fore quasi tabem, quae paulatim consumat miseros Judaeos. Ita mors fuisset illis dulcior longe, quam sic diu cruciari et nihil habere relaxationis. In the lot of the two kings the people had to recognise what was in store for itself. </body></html>
