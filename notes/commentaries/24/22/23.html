Very haughty in a day of peace and safety. Very fearful on alarm of trouble. Very much cast down under pressure of trouble. Many never are ashamed of their sins till brought by them to the last extremity. The king shall close his days in bondage. Those that think themselves as signets on God's right hand, must not be secure, but fear lest they should be plucked thence. The Jewish king and his family shall be carried to Babylon. We know where we were born, but where we shall die we know not; it is enough that our God knows. Let it be our care that we die in Christ, then it will be well with us wherever we die, thought it may be in a far country. The Jewish king shall be despised. Time was when he was delighted in; but all those in whom God has no pleasure, some time or other, will be so lowered, that men will have no pleasure in them. Whoever are childless, it is the Lord that writes them so; and those who take no care to do good in their days, cannot expect to prosper. How little is earthly grandeur to be depended upon, or flourishing families to be rejoiced in!

Jerusalem is meant, and the inhabitants of it, so called, because they lived near Lebanon, or in that land in which Lebanon was; or rather because they dwelt in houses made of the wood of Lebanon; and which stood as thick as the trees in the forest of Lebanon; and where they thought themselves safe and secure, according to the next clause; not but that there were inhabitants of the mountain of Lebanon, called Druses; and there were towns and villages on it, inhabited by people, as there are to this day. After four hours and a half travelling up the ascent, from the foot of the mountain, there is, as travellers (z) inform us, a small pretty village, called Eden; and besides that, at some distance from it, another called Canobine, where there is a convent of the Maronites, and is the seat of their patriarch; and near it a valley of that name, full of hermitages, cells and monasteries; but the former are here meant; <p>that makest thy nests in the cedars; in towns, palaces, and houses, covered, ceiled, raftered, and wainscotted with cedars; here they lived at ease and security, as birds in a nest. The Targum is, <p>"who dwellest in the house of the sanctuary, and among kings? nourishing thy children;'' <p>how gracious shalt thou be when pangs come upon thee, the pain as of a woman in travail? that is, either thou wilt seek grace and favour at the hand of God, and make supplication to him; thou wilt then be an humble supplicant, when in distress, though now proud and haughty (a): or what favour wilt thou then find among those that come to waste and destroy thee?

The reproachful question &#1492;&#1514;&#1502;&#1500;&#1498; has not the meaning: wilt thou reign long? or wilt thou consolidate thy dominion? but: dost thou suppose thyself to be a king, to show thyself a king, if thy aim and endeavour is solely fixed on the building of a stately palace? "Viest," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-5.htm">Jeremiah 12:5</a>. &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;&#1494;, not: with the cedar, for &#1514;&#1495;&#1512;&#1492; is construed with the accus. of that with which one vies, but: in cedar, i.e., in the building of cedar palaces. It was not necessary to say with whom he vied, since the thought of Solomon's edifices would suggest itself. The lxx have changed &#1489;&#1488;&#1512;&#1494; by a pointless quid pro quo into &#1489;&#1488;&#1495;&#1494;, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd;  &#787;&#769;&#x391;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;, for which Cod. Alex. and Arabs have &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd;  &#787;&#x391;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b2;. The fact that Ahab had built a palace veneered with ivory (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-39.htm">1 Kings 22:39</a>) is not sufficient to approve this reading, which Ew. prefers. Still less cause is there to delete &#1489;&#1488;&#1512;&#1494; as a gloss (Hitz.) in order to obtain the rendering, justified neither by grammar nor in fact, "if thou contendest with thy father." To confirm what he has said, the prophet sets before the worthless king the example of his godly father Josiah. "Thy father, did not he eat and drink," i.e., enjoy life (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-24.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:13</a>)? yet at the same time he administered right and justice, like his forefather David; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-15.htm">2 Samuel 8:15</a>. Then went it well with him and the kingdom. &#1488;&#1494;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-16.htm">Jeremiah 22:16</a>, is wider than &#1488;&#1494; &#1496;&#1493;: in respect that he did justice to the poor and wretched, things went well, were well managed in the kingdom at large. In so doing consists "the knowing of me." The knowledge of Jahveh is the practical recognition of God which is displayed in the fear of God and a pious life. The infinitive nomin. &#1491;&#1468;&#1506;&#1514; has the article because a special emphasis lies on the word (cf. Ew. 277, c), the true knowledge of God required to have stress laid on it. - But Jehoiakim is the reverse of his father. This thought, lying in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-16.htm">Jeremiah 22:16</a>, is illustrated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-17.htm">Jeremiah 22:17</a>. For thine eyes are set upon nothing but gain. &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1506;, gain with the suggestion of unrighteousness about it, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-13.htm">Jeremiah 6:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-10.htm">Jeremiah 8:10</a>. His whole endeavour was after wealth and splendour. The means of attaining this aim was injustice, since he not only withheld their wages from his workers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-13.htm">Jeremiah 22:13</a>), but caused the innocent to be condemned in the judgment that he might grasp their goods to himself, as e.g., Ahab had done with Naboth. He also put to death the prophets who rebuked his unrighteousness, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-23.htm">Jeremiah 26:23</a>, and used every kind of lawless violence. "Oppression" is amplified by &#1492;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1510;&#1492; (from &#1512;&#1510;&#1509;, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-33.htm">Deuteronomy 28:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-3.htm">1 Samuel 12:3</a>), crushing, "what we call flaying people" (Hitz.); cf. on this subject, <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/3-3.htm">Micah 3:3</a>. </body></html>
