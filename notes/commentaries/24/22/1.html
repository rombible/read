Exhortation to Repentance; Judgment on Shallum, Jehoiakim, and Coniah.<p>Belonging to an earlier period than the twenty-first chapter, namely, the reigns of Shallum or Jehoahaz, Jehoiakim, and Jeconiah (Jer 22:10, 13, 20). Jeremiah often groups his prophecies, not by chronological order, but by similarity of subjects; thus Jer 22:3 corresponds to Jer 21:12. Grotius thinks that Jeremiah here repeats to Zedekiah what he had announced to that king's predecessors formerly (namely, his brother and brother's son), of a similar bearing, and which had since come to pass; a warning to Zedekiah. Probably, in arranging his prophecies they were grouped for the first time in the present order, designed by the Holy Spirit to set forth the series of kings of Judah, all four alike, failing in "righteousness," followed at last by the "King," a righteous Branch raised unto David, in the house of Judah, "the Lord our righteousness" (Jer 23:6). The unrighteousness of Zedekiah suggested the review of his predecessors' failure in the same respects, and consequent punishment, which ought to have warned him, but did not.<p>1.

To the palace of Jehoiakim, who was now the reigning king; the prophet is bid to go down to it, because, as Kimchi thinks, he was now upon the mountain of the house, or in the temple, from whence to the king's house there was a descent: <p>and speak there this word; of prophecy, relating to the several kings hereafter mentioned. This prophecy was delivered some years before that in the preceding chapter, though it stands here. It is indeed by some thought to be repeated here on occasion of what is before said, and for the confirmation of it, putting in mind of what he had prophesied in former times: and they render the words, with which it begins, "thus hath the Lord said" (x); so he said to me years ago; which agrees with what is now delivered. <p>(x)  "haec dixit", Grotius; "sic dixit", Schmidt. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/22.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Thus saith the LORD; Go down to the house of the king of Judah, and speak there this word,</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/22.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">1</span>. <span class="ital">Go down</span>] from the Temple on the eastern hill of Jerusalem to the king’s house, which was S. of it on lower ground.

"And unto the people thou shalt say: Thus hath Jahveh said: Behold, I set before you the way of life and the way of death. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-9.htm">Jeremiah 21:9</a>. He that abideth in this city shall die by sword, by famine, and by pestilence; but he that goeth out and falleth to the Chaldeans that besiege you, he shall live, and have his soul for a prey. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-10.htm">Jeremiah 21:10</a>. For I have set my face on this city for evil and not for good, saith Jahveh; into the hand of the king of Babylon shall it be given, who shall burn it with fire. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-11.htm">Jeremiah 21:11</a>. And to the house of the king of Judah: Hear the word of Jahveh: <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-12.htm">Jeremiah 21:12</a>. House of David! thus hath Jahveh said: Hold judgment every morning, and save the despoiled out of the hand of the oppressor, lest my fury break forth as fire, and burn unquenchably, because of the evil of your doings." What the prophet is here to say to the people and the royal house is not directly addressed to the king's envoy, but is closely connected with the answer he was to give to the latter, and serves to strengthen the same. We need not be hampered by the assumption that Jeremiah, immediately after that answer, communicated this advice, so that it might be made known to the people and to the royal house. The counsel given in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-8.htm">Jeremiah 21:8-12</a> to the people was during the siege repeatedly given by Jeremiah both to the king and to the people, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-1.htm">Jeremiah 38:1</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-17.htm">Jeremiah 38:17</a>., and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-11.htm">Jeremiah 27:11</a>., and many of the people acted by his advice, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-19.htm">Jeremiah 38:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-9.htm">Jeremiah 39:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-15.htm">Jeremiah 52:15</a>. But the defenders of the city, the authorities, saw therein treason, or at least a highly dangerous discouragement to those who were fighting, and accused the prophet as a traitor, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-4.htm">Jeremiah 38:4</a>., cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-13.htm">Jeremiah 37:13</a>. Still Jeremiah, holding his duty higher than his life, remained in the city, and gave as his opinion, under conviction attained to only by divine revelation, that all resistance is useless, since God has irrevocably decreed the destruction of Jerusalem as a punishment for their sins. The idea of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-7.htm">Jeremiah 21:7</a> is clothed in words taken from <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/30-15.htm">Deuteronomy 30:15</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-26.htm">Deuteronomy 11:26</a>. &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489; , <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-9.htm">Jeremiah 21:9</a>, as opposed to &#1497;&#1510;&#1488;, does not mean: to dwell, but: to sit still, abide. To fall to the Chaldeans, i.e., to go over to them, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-14.htm">Jeremiah 37:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-9.htm">Jeremiah 39:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-11.htm">2 Kings 25:11</a>; &#1506;&#1500; is interchanged with &#1488;&#1500;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-13.htm">Jeremiah 37:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-19.htm">Jeremiah 38:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-15.htm">Jeremiah 52:15</a>. The Chet. &#1497;&#1495;&#1497;&#1492; is right, corresponding to &#1497;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;; the Keri &#1493;&#1495;&#1497;&#1492; is wrong. His life shall be to him for a prey, i.e., he shall carry it thence as a prey, i.e., preserve it. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-10.htm">Jeremiah 21:10</a> gives the reason for the advice given. For I have set my face, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-11.htm">Jeremiah 44:11</a>, recalls <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/9-4.htm">Amos 9:4</a>, only there we have &#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497; for &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-6.htm">Jeremiah 24:6</a>. To set the face or eye on one means: to pay special heed to him, in good (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-12.htm">Jeremiah 39:12</a>) or in evil sense; hence the addition, "for evil," etc.</body></html>
