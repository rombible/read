Such changes were common at the time, as in the case of Jehoiakim and Zedekiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-34.htm" title="And Pharaohnechoh made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in the room of Josiah his father, and turned his name to Jehoiakim, and took Jehoahaz away: and he came to Egypt, and died there.">2Kings 23:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-17.htm" title="And the king of Babylon made Mattaniah his father's brother king in his stead, and changed his name to Zedekiah.">2Kings 24:17</a>). Shallum (= retribution) might probably have seemed a name of evil augury. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-15.htm" title="And the sons of Josiah were, the firstborn Johanan, the second Jehoiakim, the third Zedekiah, the fourth Shallum.">1Chronicles 3:15</a> a Shallum appears as the fourth son of Josiah, Jehoiakim being the second, and one otherwise unknown, Johanan, the eldest. This may have been the same as the one now referred to (the order of the last two names being in some way inverted), or there may have been two brothers bearing the same name. The short and disastrous reign of Shallum, and the meaning of the word probably account for the prophet’s using the private rather than the kingly name. The fact that the name had been borne by one of the later kings of Israel whose reign lasted but for a single month (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-13.htm" title="Shallum the son of Jabesh began to reign in the nine and thirtieth year of Uzziah king of Judah; and he reigned a full month in Samaria.">2Kings 15:13</a>) may have given a further point to its use, as being full of disastrous memories that made it ominous of evil. The title “king of Judah” belongs grammatically to Shallum, not to Josiah.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/22.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>22:10-19 Here is a sentence of death upon two kings, the wicked sons of a very pious father. Josiah was prevented from seeing the evil to come in this world, and removed to see the good to come in the other world; therefore, weep not for him, but for his son Shallum, who is likely to live and die a wretched captive. Dying saints may be justly envied, while living sinners are justly pitied. Here also is the doom of Jehoiakim. No doubt it is lawful for princes and great men to build, beautify, and furnish houses; but those who enlarge their houses, and make them sumptuous, need carefully to watch against the workings of vain-glory. He built his houses by unrighteousness, with money gotten unjustly. And he defrauded his workmen of their wages. God notices the wrong done by the greatest to poor servants and labourers, and will repay those in justice, who will not, in justice, pay those whom they employ. The greatest of men must look upon the meanest as their neighbours, and be just to them accordingly. Jehoiakim was unjust, and made no conscience of shedding innocent blood. Covetousness, which is the root of all evil, was at the bottom of all. The children who despise their parents' old fashions, commonly come short of their real excellences. Jehoiakim knew that his father found the way of duty to be the way of comfort, yet he would not tread in his steps. He shall die unlamented, hateful for oppression and cruelty.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In the two foregoing prophecies Jeremiah stated the general principle on which depend the rise and downfall of kings and nations.

Weep &#8230; not for&#8212;that is, not so much for Josiah, who was taken away by death from the evil to come (2Ki 22:20; Isa 57:1); as for Shallum or Jehoahaz, his son (2Ki 23:30), who, after a three months' reign, was carried off by Pharaoh-necho into Egypt, never to see his native land again (2Ki 23:31-34). Dying saints are justly to be envied, while living sinners are to be pitied. The allusion is to the great weeping of the people at the death of Josiah, and on each anniversary of it, in which Jeremiah himself took a prominent part (2Ch 35:24, 25). The name "Shallum" is here given in irony to Jehoahaz, who reigned but three months; as if he were a second Shallum, son of Jabesh, who reigned only one month in Samaria (2Ki 15:13; 2Ch 36:1-4). Shallum means "retribution," a name of no good omen to him [Grotius]; originally the people called him Shallom, indicative of peace and prosperity. But Jeremiah applies it in irony. 1Ch 3:15, calls Shallum the fourth son of Josiah. The people raised him to the throne before his brother Eliakim or Jehoiakim, though the latter was the older (2Ki 23:31, 36; 2Ch 36:1); perhaps on account of Jehoiakim's extravagance (Jer 22:13, 15). Jehoiakim was put in Shallum's (Jehoahaz') stead by Pharaoh-necho. Jeconiah, his son, succeeded. Zedekiah (Mattaniah), uncle of Jeconiah, and brother of Jehoiakim and Jehoahaz, was last of all raised to the throne by Nebuchadnezzar.<p>He shall not return&#8212;The people perhaps entertained hopes of Shallum's return from Egypt, in which case they would replace him on the throne, and thereby free themselves from the oppressive taxes imposed by Jehoiakim.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/22.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Who this <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Shallum</span> was is a little doubted.

Shallum was probably the name which he bore before his accession. Other hypotheses to account for the name being here given to Jehoahaz are unlikely, e.g. (i) that it had reference to the shortness of his reign, as alluding to Shallum king of Israel, who was king for one month (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-13.htm" title="Shallum the son of Jabesh began to reign in the nine and thirtieth year of Uzziah king of Judah; and he reigned a full month in Samaria.">2 Kings 15:13</a>), or (ii) that it means the requited one (from the sense of the Hebrew root), him whom God had marked out for punishment.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Jehoahaz had represented the anti-Egyptian policy, which Jeremiah had always urged.

Not only the king is to hear the word of the Lord, but his servants too, and the people, who go in by these gates, the gates of the royal castle. The exhortation: to do right and justice, etc., is only an expansion of the brief counsel at <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-12.htm">Jeremiah 21:12</a>, and that brought home to the heart of the whole people in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-6.htm">Jeremiah 7:6</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-6.htm">Ezekiel 22:6</a>.

"This house" is the royal palace. &#1500;&#1495;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492; as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-34.htm">Jeremiah 7:34</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-17.htm">Jeremiah 27:17</a>. The threatening is illustrated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-6.htm">Jeremiah 22:6</a> by further description of the destruction of the palace. The royal castle is addressed, and, in respect of its lofty situation and magnificence, is called a Gilead and a head of Lebanon. It lay on the north-eastern eminence of Mount Zion (see on <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-12.htm">1 Kings 7:12</a>, note 1), and contained the so-called forest-house of Lebanon (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-2.htm">1 Kings 7:2-5</a>) and various other buildings built of cedar, or, at least, faced with cedar planks (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-14.htm">Jeremiah 22:14</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-23.htm">Jeremiah 22:23</a>); so that the entire building might be compared to a forest of cedars on the summit of Lebanon. In the comparison to Gilead, Gilead can hardly be adduced in respect of its great fertility as a pasturing land (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-1.htm">Numbers 32:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/7-14.htm">Micah 7:14</a>), but in virtue of the thickly wooded covering of the hill-country of Gilead on both sides of the Jabbok. This is still in great measure clothed with oak thickets and, according to Buckingham, the most beautiful forest tracts that can be imagined; cf. C. v. Raumer, Pal. S. 82.<p>(Note: In 1834 Eli Smith travelled through it, and thus writes: "Jebel 'Ajlun presents the most charming rural scenery that I have seen in Syria. A continued forest of noble trees, chiefly the evergreen oak, covers a large part of it, while the ground beneath is clothed with luxuriant grass and decked with a rich variety of wild flowers. As we went from el-Husn to 'Ajlun our path lay along the summit of the mountain; and we often overlooked a large part of Palestine on one side and the whole of Haurn." - Rob. Phys. Geog. p. 54.)<p>&#1488;&#1501; &#1500;&#1488; is a particle of asseveration. This glorious forest of cedar buildings is to become a &#1502;&#1491;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;, a treeless steppe, cities uninhabited. "Cities" refers to the thing compared, not to the emblem; and the plural, as being the form for indefinite generality, presents no difficulty. And the attachment thereto of a singular predicate has many analogies in its support, cf. Ew. 317, a. The Keri &#1504;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468; is an uncalled for emendation of the Chet. &#1504;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1492;, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-5.htm">Jeremiah 6:5</a>. - "I consecrate," in respect that the destroyers are warriors whom God sends as the executors of His will, see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-4.htm">Jeremiah 6:4</a>. With "a man and his weapons," cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/9-2.htm">Ezekiel 9:2</a>. In keeping with the figure of a forest, the destruction is represented as the hewing down of the choicest cedars; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-34.htm">Isaiah 10:34</a>. - Thus is to be accomplished in Jerusalem what Moses threatened, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-23.htm">Deuteronomy 29:23</a>; the destroyed city will become a monument of God's wrath against the transgressors of His covenant. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-8.htm">Jeremiah 22:8</a> is modelled upon <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-23.htm">Deuteronomy 29:23</a>., cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-8.htm">1 Kings 9:8</a>., and made to bear upon Jerusalem, since, along with the palace, the city too is destroyed by the enemy.<p>From <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-10.htm">Jeremiah 22:10</a> onwards the exhortation to the evil shepherds becomes a prophecy concerning the kings of that time, who by their godless courses hurried on the threatened destruction. The prophecy begins with King Jehoahaz, who, after a reign of three months, had bee discrowned by Pharaoh Necho and carried captive to Egypt; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-30.htm">2 Kings 23:30-35</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-1.htm">2 Chronicles 36:1-4</a>. </body></html>
