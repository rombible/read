The body of the king was “to be cast out in the day to the heat, and in the night to the frost.” We have no direct record of its fulfilment, but its reproduction shows that the prophet’s word had not failed. The king was dragged in chains with the other captives, who were being carried off to Babylon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-6.htm" title="Against him came up Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and bound him in fetters, to carry him to Babylon.">2Chronicles 36:6</a>), and probably died on the journey, his corpse left behind unburied as the army marched. The phrase “he slept with his fathers” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-6.htm" title="So Jehoiakim slept with his fathers: and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead.">2Kings 24:6</a> cannot be pressed as meaning more than the mere fact of death. So Ahab, who died in battle, “slept with his fathers” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-40.htm" title="So Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead.">1Kings 22:40</a>).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/22.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>22:10-19 Here is a sentence of death upon two kings, the wicked sons of a very pious father. Josiah was prevented from seeing the evil to come in this world, and removed to see the good to come in the other world; therefore, weep not for him, but for his son Shallum, who is likely to live and die a wretched captive. Dying saints may be justly envied, while living sinners are justly pitied. Here also is the doom of Jehoiakim. No doubt it is lawful for princes and great men to build, beautify, and furnish houses; but those who enlarge their houses, and make them sumptuous, need carefully to watch against the workings of vain-glory. He built his houses by unrighteousness, with money gotten unjustly. And he defrauded his workmen of their wages. God notices the wrong done by the greatest to poor servants and labourers, and will repay those in justice, who will not, in justice, pay those whom they employ. The greatest of men must look upon the meanest as their neighbours, and be just to them accordingly. Jehoiakim was unjust, and made no conscience of shedding innocent blood. Covetousness, which is the root of all evil, was at the bottom of all. The children who despise their parents' old fashions, commonly come short of their real excellences. Jehoiakim knew that his father found the way of duty to be the way of comfort, yet he would not tread in his steps. He shall die unlamented, hateful for oppression and cruelty.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The burial of an ass - i. e., he shall merely be dragged out of the way, and left to decay unheeded.

This is not formally narrated. But 2Ch 36:6 states that "Nebuchadnezzar bound him in fetters to carry him to Babylon"; his treatment there is nowhere mentioned. The prophecy here, and in Jer 36:30, harmonizes these two facts. He was slain by Nebuchadnezzar, who changed his purpose of taking him to Babylon, on the way thither, and left him unburied outside Jerusalem. 2Ki 24:6, "Jehoiakim slept with his fathers," does not contradict this; it simply expresses his being gathered to his fathers by death, not his being buried with his fathers (Ps 49:19). The two phrases are found together, as expressing two distinct ideas (2Ki 15:38; 16:20).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/22.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">He shall be buried with the burial of an ass; </span> that is, he shall not be buried at all, or he shall be buried in an indecent and contemptible manner, none attending him to his grave, none mourning for him. The last words of this verse incline some to think that Jehoiakim was buried near to Jerusalem; but the Scripture, which mentioneth his being carried into Babylon, saith nothing of his being brought back; nor is that very probable which some say, that the king of Babylon thought to have carried him to Babylon, but upon second thoughts altered his purposes, and caused him to be slain at Jerusalem, and his body to be ignominiously dragged out of the gates. The Scripture saith expressly he was carried to Babylon, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-15.htm" title="And he carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon, and the king's mother, and the king's wives, and his officers, and the mighty of the land, those carried he into captivity from Jerusalem to Babylon.">2 Kings 24:15</a></span>; and if he died there, yet this text remaineth true, the scope of which seemeth to be to show the vanity of this prince in his great and stately buildings, which he was not like long to enjoy, nor to be buried nigh to them, nor in any degree of honour proportionate to the splendour of them. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/22.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>He shall be buried with the burial of an ass,.... Have no burial at all, or no other than what any brute creature has; which, when it dies, is cast into a ditch, and becomes the food of dogs, and the fowls of the air. The "ass" is mentioned, as being a sordid stupid creature; and such an one was this king; <p>drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem; as the carcass of a beast is dragged about by dogs; or as a malefactor, when executed, is dragged and cast into a ditch: this perhaps was done by the Chaldeans, who, when he was slain, dragged him along, and cast him beyond the gates of Jerusalem. So Josephus (w) says, that when Nebuchadnezzar entered Jerusalem, he slew the most robust and beautiful with Jehoiakim their king, and ordered him to be cast without the walls unburied; and so, though he is said to "sleep with his fathers", yet not to be buried with them, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-6.htm">2 Kings 24:6</a>. Kimchi says that he died without Jerusalem, as they were carrying him into captivity a second time; and the Chaldeans would not suffer him to be buried. Jerom reports, from the Hebrew history, that he was killed by the robbers and thieves of the Chaldeans, Syrians, Ammonites, and Moabites. Some think, that as he was bound in chains, in order to be carried to Babylon, that he was had there, and there died, and after his death used in this ignominious manner: and the words will bear to be rendered, "cast forth far beyond the gates of Jerusalem" (x); even as far as Babylon; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-6.htm">2 Chronicles 36:6</a>. <p>(w) Antiqu. l. 10. c. 6. sect. 3.((x)    "et projiciendo procul ultra portas Hierosolymae", Schmidt.

The prediction is repeated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-30.htm">Jeremiah 36:30</a>, where the statement is made in plain language. At first sight it appears to conflict with <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-6.htm">2 Kings 24:6</a>, "So Jehoiakim slept with his fathers: and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead;" but it is only appearance, and when we remember that the complete formula for describing the natural death of a king of Judah is, "slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-31.htm">1 Kings 14:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-24.htm">1 Kings 15:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-50.htm">1 Kings 22:50</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-24.htm">2 Kings 8:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-7.htm">2 Kings 15:7, 38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-20.htm">2 Kings 16:20</a>), and that the phrase, "slept with his fathers," is used of Ahab, who fell on the field of battle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-40.htm">1 Kings 22:40</a>), we are naturally led to the conjecture that Jehoiakim did not die a natural death, but fell in battle in some sally made by the besieged. <span class="cmt_word">Buried with the burial of an ass</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> cast out unburied. <span class="cmt_word">Beyond the gates;</span> rather, <span class="accented">far from the gates</span>. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/22.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The woe uttered upon Jehoiakim. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-13.htm">Jeremiah 22:13</a>.

He did justice to the poor and wretched, then it was well. Is not this to know me? saith Jahveh. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-17.htm">Jeremiah 22:17</a>. For on nothing are thine eyes and thy heart set but on gain and on the blood of the innocent, to shed it, and on oppression and violence, to do them. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-18.htm">Jeremiah 22:18</a>. Therefore thus saith Jahveh concerning Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah: They shall not mourn for him, saying: Alas, my brother! and alas, sister! they shall not mourn for him: Alas, lord! and alas for his glory! <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-19.htm">Jeremiah 22:19</a>. An ass's burial shall his burial be, dragged and cast far away from the gates of Jerusalem."<p>The prediction as to Jehoiakim begins with a woe upon the unjust oppression of the people. The oppression consisted in his building a magnificent palace with the sweat and blood of his subjects, whom he compelled to do forced labour without giving the labourers wages. The people must have felt this burden all the more severely that Jehoiakim, to obtain the throne, had bound himself to pay to Pharaoh a large tribute, the gold and silver for which he raised from the population according to Pharaoh's own valuation, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-33.htm">2 Kings 23:33</a>. With "Woe to him that buildeth," etc., cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-12.htm">Habakkuk 2:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/3-10.htm">Micah 3:10</a>. "That maketh his fellow labour," lit., through his neighbour he works, i.e., he causes the work to be done by his neighbour (fellow-man) for nought, without giving him wages, forces him to unpaid statute-labour. &#1506;&#1489;&#1491; &#1489;&#1468; as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-39.htm">Leviticus 25:39</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-46.htm">Leviticus 25:46</a>. &#1508;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;, labour, work, gain, then wages, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-2.htm">Job 7:2</a>. Jehoiakim sought to increase the splendour of his kingship by palace-building. To this the speech points, put in his mouth at <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-14.htm">Jeremiah 22:14</a> : I will build me &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; &#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;, a house of extensions, i.e., a palace in the grand style, with spacious halls, vast chambers. &#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; from &#1512;&#1493;&#1495;, to find vent, cheer up, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-23.htm">1 Samuel 16:23</a>; not airy, but spacious, for quite a modest house might have airy chambers. &#1493;&#1511;&#1512;&#1506; is a continuation of the participle; literally: and he cuts himself out windows, makes huge openings in the walls for windows. This verb is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-30.htm">Jeremiah 4:30</a> of opening up the eyes with paint. &#1495;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497; presents some difficulty, seeing that the suffix of the first person makes no sense. It has therefore been held to be a contracted plural form (Gesen. Lehrgeb. S. 523) or for a dual (Ew. 177, a), but without any proof of the existence of such formations, since &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1489;&#1497;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/7-1.htm">Amos 7:1</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/nahum/3-17.htm">Nahum 3:17</a>, is to be otherwise explained (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/7-1.htm">Amos 7:1</a>). Following on the back of J. D. Mich., Hitz., Graf, and Bttcher (ausf. Gramm. 414) propose to connect the &#1493; before &#1505;&#1508;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503; with this word and to read &#1495;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493;: and tears open for himself his windows; in support of which it is alleged that one cod. so reads. But this one cod. can decide nothing, and the suffix his is superfluous, even unsuitable, seeing that there can be no thought of another person's building; whereas the copula cannot well be omitted before &#1505;&#1508;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;. For the rule adduced for this, that the manner of the principal action is frequently explained by appending infinitives absoll. (Ew. 280, a), does not meet the present case; the covering with cedar, etc., does not refer to the windows, and so cannot be an explanation of the cutting out for himself. We therefore hold, with Bttcher (Proben, S. 40), that &#1495;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497; is an adjective formation, with the force of: abundant in windows, since this formation is completely accredited by &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497; and &#1495;&#1512;&#1497; (cf. Ew. 164, c); and the objection alleged against this by Graf, that then no object is specified for "cutteth out," is not of much weight, it being easy to supply the object from the preceding "house:" and he cuts it out for himself abounding in windows. There needs be no change of &#1493;&#1505;&#1508;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503; into &#1493;&#1505;&#1508;&#1493;&#1503;. For although the infin. absol. would be quite in place as continuation of the verb. fin. (cf. Ew. 351, c), yet it is not necessary. The word is attached in zeugma to &#1493;&#1511;&#1512;&#1506; or &#1495;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;: and he covers with cedar, to: faces or overlays, for this verb does not mean to plank or floor, for which &#1510;&#1508;&#1468;&#1492; is the usual word, but hide, cover, and is used <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-9.htm">1 Kings 6:9</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-3.htm">1 Kings 7:3</a>, for roofing. The last statement is given in infin. absol.: &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1495; :.los, and besmears it, paints it (the building) with &#1513;&#1473;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, red ochre, a brilliant colour (lxx &#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, i.e., acc. to Kimchi, red lead; see Gesen. thess s.v.). </body></html>
