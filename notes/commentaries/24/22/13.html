The feelings of the people, already suffering from the miseries of foreign invasion, were outraged by the revival of the forced labour of the days of Solomon, pressing in this instance not on the “strangers” of alien blood (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_kings/5-13.htm" title="And king Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levy was thirty thousand men.">1Kings 5:13-15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_chronicles/2-17.htm" title="And Solomon numbered all the strangers that were in the land of Israel, after the numbering with which David his father had numbered them; and they were found an hundred and fifty thousand and three thousand and six hundred.">2Chronicles 2:17-18</a>), but on the Israelites themselves. We are reminded of the general characteristics of Eastern, and perhaps of all other, despotism. Like the modern rulers of Constantinople, Jehoiakim went on building palaces when his kingdom was on the verge of ruin, and his subjects were groaning under their burdens.<p><span class= "bld">His chambers.</span>—Strictly speaking, the upper storeys of the house.

Did he not live in sufficient plenty, and in a state suitable to his character, and yet strictly observed justice, both in his private and public capacity, and not betake himself to such sordid methods of injustice and oppression for the support of his grandeur? He did no wrong to any of his subjects, never oppressed them, or put any hardship upon them, but was careful to preserve to all their just rights and properties. Nay, he not only did not abuse his power for the support of wrong, but used it for the maintaining of right; <span class="ital">he judged the cause of the poor and needy </span>— Was ready to hear the cause of the meanest of his subjects, and do them justice; <span class="ital">and then it was well with him </span>— The blessing of God was upon him as the reward of his justice and integrity.

Josiah was prevented from seeing the evil to come in this world, and removed to see the good to come in the other world; therefore, weep not for him, but for his son Shallum, who is likely to live and die a wretched captive. Dying saints may be justly envied, while living sinners are justly pitied. Here also is the doom of Jehoiakim. No doubt it is lawful for princes and great men to build, beautify, and furnish houses; but those who enlarge their houses, and make them sumptuous, need carefully to watch against the workings of vain-glory. He built his houses by unrighteousness, with money gotten unjustly. And he defrauded his workmen of their wages. God notices the wrong done by the greatest to poor servants and labourers, and will repay those in justice, who will not, in justice, pay those whom they employ. The greatest of men must look upon the meanest as their neighbours, and be just to them accordingly. Jehoiakim was unjust, and made no conscience of shedding innocent blood. Covetousness, which is the root of all evil, was at the bottom of all. The children who despise their parents' old fashions, commonly come short of their real excellences. Jehoiakim knew that his father found the way of duty to be the way of comfort, yet he would not tread in his steps. He shall die unlamented, hateful for oppression and cruelty.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Far worse is the second example.

An evident demonstration of God’s love to mankind, securing by his law just dealings between man and man, and revenging acts of injustice, and particularly where men take advantage of their greatness above and superiority over others, to trample them under their feet, and to withhold their just rights from them: though such persons may be out of the reach of human justice, yet God hath denounced a woe against them. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/22.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Woe unto him that buildeth his house by righteousness, and his chambers by wrong,....

He "had, besides, a passion for building splendid and costly houses; and as he esteemed his own position secure under the protection of a superior power, he did not scruple severely to oppress his helpless subjects, and wring from them as much money as possible" (Ewald, 'History of Israel,' 4:252; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-33.htm">2 Kings 23:33-35</a>). The building mania, to which Oriental sovereigns have always been prone, had seized upon Jehoiakim.

Not only the king is to hear the word of the Lord, but his servants too, and the people, who go in by these gates, the gates of the royal castle. The exhortation: to do right and justice, etc., is only an expansion of the brief counsel at <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-12.htm">Jeremiah 21:12</a>, and that brought home to the heart of the whole people in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-6.htm">Jeremiah 7:6</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-6.htm">Ezekiel 22:6</a>.

The threatening is illustrated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-6.htm">Jeremiah 22:6</a> by further description of the destruction of the palace. The royal castle is addressed, and, in respect of its lofty situation and magnificence, is called a Gilead and a head of Lebanon. It lay on the north-eastern eminence of Mount Zion (see on <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-12.htm">1 Kings 7:12</a>, note 1), and contained the so-called forest-house of Lebanon (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-2.htm">1 Kings 7:2-5</a>) and various other buildings built of cedar, or, at least, faced with cedar planks (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-14.htm">Jeremiah 22:14</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-23.htm">Jeremiah 22:23</a>); so that the entire building might be compared to a forest of cedars on the summit of Lebanon. In the comparison to Gilead, Gilead can hardly be adduced in respect of its great fertility as a pasturing land (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-1.htm">Numbers 32:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/7-14.htm">Micah 7:14</a>), but in virtue of the thickly wooded covering of the hill-country of Gilead on both sides of the Jabbok. This is still in great measure clothed with oak thickets and, according to Buckingham, the most beautiful forest tracts that can be imagined; cf. C. v. Raumer, Pal. S. 82.<p>(Note: In 1834 Eli Smith travelled through it, and thus writes: "Jebel 'Ajlun presents the most charming rural scenery that I have seen in Syria. A continued forest of noble trees, chiefly the evergreen oak, covers a large part of it, while the ground beneath is clothed with luxuriant grass and decked with a rich variety of wild flowers. As we went from el-Husn to 'Ajlun our path lay along the summit of the mountain; and we often overlooked a large part of Palestine on one side and the whole of Haurn." - Rob. Phys. Geog. p. 54.)<p>&#1488;&#1501; &#1500;&#1488; is a particle of asseveration. This glorious forest of cedar buildings is to become a &#1502;&#1491;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;, a treeless steppe, cities uninhabited. "Cities" refers to the thing compared, not to the emblem; and the plural, as being the form for indefinite generality, presents no difficulty. And the attachment thereto of a singular predicate has many analogies in its support, cf. Ew. 317, a. The Keri &#1504;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468; is an uncalled for emendation of the Chet. &#1504;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1492;, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-5.htm">Jeremiah 6:5</a>. - "I consecrate," in respect that the destroyers are warriors whom God sends as the executors of His will, see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-4.htm">Jeremiah 6:4</a>. With "a man and his weapons," cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/9-2.htm">Ezekiel 9:2</a>. In keeping with the figure of a forest, the destruction is represented as the hewing down of the choicest cedars; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-34.htm">Isaiah 10:34</a>. - Thus is to be accomplished in Jerusalem what Moses threatened, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-23.htm">Deuteronomy 29:23</a>; the destroyed city will become a monument of God's wrath against the transgressors of His covenant. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-8.htm">Jeremiah 22:8</a> is modelled upon <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-23.htm">Deuteronomy 29:23</a>., cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-8.htm">1 Kings 9:8</a>., and made to bear upon Jerusalem, since, along with the palace, the city too is destroyed by the enemy.<p>From <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-10.htm">Jeremiah 22:10</a> onwards the exhortation to the evil shepherds becomes a prophecy concerning the kings of that time, who by their godless courses hurried on the threatened destruction. The prophecy begins with King Jehoahaz, who, after a reign of three months, had bee discrowned by Pharaoh Necho and carried captive to Egypt; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-30.htm">2 Kings 23:30-35</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-1.htm">2 Chronicles 36:1-4</a>. </body></html>
