The prophet’s amanuensis had become his leader, and was making use of him as a tool for the furtherance of his own designs, and those designs were to court the favour of the conqueror by delivering the remnant of the people into his hands. The warning of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/45-5.htm" title="And seek you great things for yourself? seek them not: for, behold, I will bring evil on all flesh, said the LORD: but your life will I give to you for a prey in all places where you go.">Jeremiah 45:5</a> may perhaps be taken as an indication that there was a certain ambition and love of eminence in Baruch’s character which gave a colour to the suspicion. Baruch himself has not appeared on the scene since the days of Jehoiakim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-32.htm" title="Then took Jeremiah another roll, and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah; who wrote therein from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire: and there were added besides to them many like words.">Jeremiah 36:32</a>), but it lies in the nature of the case that he would be known as advocating, like Jeremiah, the policy of submission to Nebuchadnezzar. The apocryphal Book of Baruch (<a href="http://apocrypha.org/baruch/1-1.htm" title="And these are the words of the book, which Baruch the son of Nerias, the son of Maasias, the son of Sedecias, the son of Asadias, the son of Chelcias, wrote in Babylon,">Baruch 1:1</a>) represents him as being actually at Babylon at the time of the capture of Jerusalem, and this was in itself probable enough. On this assumption Jeremiah was perhaps suspected of actually receiving instructions from the Babylonian Court through Baruch, who in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/43-6.htm" title="Even men, and women, and children, and the king's daughters, and every person that Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had left with Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Jeremiah the prophet, and Baruch the son of Neriah.">Jeremiah 43:6</a> suddenly re-appears as the prophet’s companion. Prophet and scribe were apparently seized and carried off by force, to prevent their carrying out the schemes of which they were suspected. The “remnant of Judah returned from all nations” refers to the fugitives from Moab, Ammon, or Edom, mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/40-11.htm" title="Likewise when all the Jews that were in Moab, and among the Ammonites, and in Edom, and that were in all the countries, heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah, and that he had set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan;">Jeremiah 40:11</a>. As the emigration included all who had gathered together under the protection of Gedaliah, it must have left the lands of Judah almost entirely depopulated, and the fear of this result may well have been among the reasons that determined Jeremiah’s counsels.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/43.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>43:1-7 Only by pride comes contention, both with God and man. They preferred their own wisdom to the revealed will of God. Men deny the Scriptures to be the word of God, because they are resolved not to conform themselves to Scripture rules. When men will persist in sin, they charge the best actions to bad motives. These Jews deserted their own land, and threw themselves out of God's protection. It is the folly of men, that they often ruin themselves by wrong endeavours to mend their situation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/43.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>These captains belonged to the party who had all along resisted Jeremiah's counsels, and had led Zedekiah astray.

Baruch&#8212;He being the younger spake out the revelations which he received from Jeremiah more vehemently. From this cause, and from their knowing that he was in favor with the Chaldeans, arose their suspicion of him. Their perverse fickleness was astonishing. In the forty-second chapter they acknowledged the trustworthiness of Jeremiah, of which they had for so long so many proofs; yet here they accuse him of a lie. The mind of the unregenerate man is full of deceits.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/43.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Baruch</span> was but a clerk or secretary to Jeremiah, so not very probable to overrule the prophet to a falsifying of his trust, and a betraying of his countrymen into the hands of their enemies; but so fond are wicked men of their lusts, that they will say any thing in justification of them, rather than deny themselves in them, and become obedient to the will of God. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/43.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But Baruch the son of Neriah setteth thee on against us,.... First they charge the prophet with a lie, and deny his mission from the Lord; and now to lessen the prophet's crime they charged him with, they lay the blame on Baruch, as if he, out of ill will to them, had instigated the prophet to deliver such a message; which is not at all likely, that he should be prevailed upon by a younger person, and his secretary, to take such a step: nor can it be thought that Baruch should have any interest to serve by it; and, besides, both he and the prophet were too good men, the one to instigate, and the other to be instigated, to declare a falsehood in the name of the Lord. The end proposed, they suggest, was <p>for to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans, that they might put us to death, and carry us away captives into Babylon; either that he or the prophet might deliver them into the hands of the Chaldeans, to be put to death by them, or be carried captive; which is not at all probable, it being inconsistent with that piety and humanity which were conspicuous in them both, and with their conduct, who chose rather to abide in their own land, with this small and despicable handful of people, than to go and live in the court of Babylon, where good care would have been taken of them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/43.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But Baruch the son of Neriah <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> setteth thee on against us, to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans, that they may put us to death, and carry us away captives into Babylon.</span><p>(e) Thus the wicked not only contemn and hurt the messengers of God, but slander and speak wickedly of all them that support or favour the godly.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/43.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Baruch the son of Neriah setteth thee on.</span> A singular supposition - Jeremiah leaving the initiative to his secretary! It may be conjectured that Baruch had somehow made himself specially unpopular; he may have been a more practical man (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/45-5.htm">Jeremiah 45:5</a>) than Jeremiah. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/42.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>&#1493;&#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468;, used instead of the impersonal &#1493;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492;, is referred to the following subject by a rather unusual kind of attraction; cf. Ewald, 345, b. All the men who set their faces, i.e., intend, to go to Egypt shall perish; not a single one shall escape the evil; for the same judgment of wrath which has befallen Jerusalem shall also come on those who flee to Egypt; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-20.htm">Jeremiah 7:20</a>. On the expression "ye shall become a curse," etc., cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-9.htm">Jeremiah 24:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-18.htm">Jeremiah 25:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-18.htm">Jeremiah 29:18</a>.<p>Taking for granted that the leaders of the people will not obey, Jeremiah appends to the word of the Lord an earnest address, in which several points are specially insisted on, viz., that the Lord had spoken to them, that He had forbidden them to go to Egypt, and that he (the prophet), by proclaiming the word of the Lord, had warned them (&#1492;&#1506;&#1497;&#1491; &#1489;&#1468;, to testify, bear witness against a person, i.e., warn him of something, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-7.htm">Jeremiah 11:7</a>). Thus he discloses to them the dangerous mistake they are in, when they first desire some expression of the mind of the Lord regarding their intentions, and, in the hope that He will accede to their request, promise unconditional obedience to whatever He may direct, but afterwards, when they have received a message from the Lord, will not obey it, because it is contrary to what they wish. The Kethib &#1492;&#1514;&#1506;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501; has been incorrectly written for &#1492;&#1514;&#1506;&#1497;&#1497;&#1501;, the Hiphil from &#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1492;, to err; here, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-17.htm">Proverbs 10:17</a>, it means to make a mistake. &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501;, not, "you mislead your own selves," decepistis animas vestras (Vulg.), nor "in your souls," - meaning, in your thoughts and intentions (Ngelsbach), - but "at the risk of your souls," your life; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-21.htm">Jeremiah 17:21</a>. &#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1499;&#1500; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/42-21.htm">Jeremiah 42:21</a>), "and that in regard to all that for which Jahveh has sent me to you," points back to their promise, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/42-5.htm">Jeremiah 42:5</a>, that they would do "according to all the word."
