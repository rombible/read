Here is a various reading: the "Cetib", or textual writing, is, "when it cometh, it shall smite"; which Kimchi rightly interprets of the camp or army of Nebuchadnezzar; and the "Keri", or marginal reading, which we follow, is, "when he cometh, he shall smite"; that is, the king of Babylon; both are to be received: when Nebuchadnezzar should come with his army to Tahpanhes, he would not only take that, but go through the land of Egypt, and subdue and destroy the inhabitants of it, all that dwelt in it, sojourners as well as natives; and so the Jews that were come hither to dwell, against the express command of God, to whom this prophecy was delivered, and to whom it has a particular respect: <p>and deliver such as are for death to death; who are appointed to death, either by pestilence or famine; that is, he shall oblige them to flee to, or block them up in, places where they shall perish by one or other of these: <p>and such as are for captivity to captivity: such as are designed to be carried captive, these shall be taken by him, and carried captive into Babylon, and the provinces of it: <p>and such as are for the sword to the sword; who are destined to fall by the sword, these should be slain by the sword of Nebuchadnezzar, and his soldiers; so that, what by one way or another, a general destruction should be made. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/43.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And when he cometh, he shall smite the land of Egypt, <i>and deliver</i> <span class="cverse3">{l}</span> such <i>as are</i> for death to death; and such <i>as are</i> for captivity to captivity; and such <i>as are</i> for the sword to the sword.</span><p>(l) Everyone will be slain by the means that God has appointed, Jer 15:2.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/43.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">11</span>. <span class="ital">to death</span>] See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-2.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, if they say to you, Where shall we go forth? then you shall tell them, Thus said the LORD; Such as are for death, to death; and such as are for the sword, to the sword; and such as are for the famine, to the famine; and such as are for the captivity, to the captivity.">Jeremiah 15:2</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/43.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He shall smite the land of Egypt.</span> On the invasion of Egypt by Nebuchadnezzar, wrongly controverted by some, see note on Jeremiah 46:13. <span class="cmt_word">Such</span> as are <span class="cmt_word">for death.</span> Such as are destined for death (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> pestilence, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-2.htm">Jeremiah 15:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-21.htm">Jeremiah 18:21</a>).

In this enumeration of those who were conducted to Egypt, Hitzig, Graf, and others distinguish two classes: (1) the men, women, children, etc., who had been in Mizpah with Gedaliah, and had been led to Gibeon, after the murder of the latter, by Ishmael, but had afterwards been brought to Bethlehem by Johanan and the other captains (<a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/43-6.htm">Jeremiah 43:6</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/40-7.htm">Jeremiah 40:7</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/41-10.htm">Jeremiah 41:10</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/41-16.htm">Jeremiah 41:16</a>); (2) those who had returned from the foreign countries whither they had fled, but who had hitherto lived in the country, scattered here and there, and who must have joined the company led by Johanan to Bethlehem during the ten days of halt at that resting-place (<a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/43-5.htm">Jeremiah 43:5</a>, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/40-11.htm">Jeremiah 40:11-12</a>). There is no foundation, however, for this distinction. Neither in the present chapter is there anything mentioned of those who had been dispersed through the land joining those who had marched to Bethlehem; nor are the Jews who had returned from Moab, Ammon, Edom, and other countries to their own home distinguished, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/40.htm">Jeremiah 40</a> and 41, as a different class from those who had been with Gedaliah in Mizpah; but on the other hand, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/40-12.htm">Jeremiah 40:12</a>, these returned Jews also came to Gedaliah at Mizpah, and gathered grapes and fruit. Besides, in these verses the distinction can only be made after the insertion into the text of the conjunction &#1493; before &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;. To "all the remnant of Judah who had returned from the nations" belong the men, women, children, etc., whom Nebuzaradan had committed to the care of Gedaliah. The enumeration in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/43-6.htm">Jeremiah 43:6</a> gives only one specification of the "whole remnant of Judah," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/41-16.htm">Jeremiah 41:16</a>. "And all the souls;" as if it were said, "and whoever else was still left alive;" cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-28.htm">Joshua 10:28</a>. Tahpanhes was a frontier town of Egypt on the Pelusian branch of the Nile, and named &#x394;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; by the Greeks; see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-16.htm">Jeremiah 2:16</a>. Here, on the borders of Egypt, a halt was made, for the purpose of coming to further resolutions regarding their residence in that country. Here, too, Jeremiah received a revelation from God regarding the fate now impending on Egypt. </body></html>
