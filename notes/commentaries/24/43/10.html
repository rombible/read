The English Version, as before, follows Luther in taking it for the awning or canopy which was stretched over the throne when the king sat in state as judge. Others (<span class= "ital">e.g., </span>Hitzig) find in it the leather covering which was placed over the pavement on which the throne was set, upon which the criminal knelt as on a scaffold to receive the death-stroke of the executioner. So taken, the prediction assumes a more definite and terrible aspect. The king was to sit upon the stones which Jeremiah had hidden, not merely in his regal pomp, but in the character of an avenger executing the wrath of Jehovah against the rebellious.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/jeremiah/43.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/43-10.htm" title="And say to them, Thus said the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will send and take Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will set his throne on these stones that I have hid; and he shall spread his royal pavilion over them....">Jeremiah 43:10-11</a></span>. <span class="ital">And say, Thus saith the Lord, I will send Nebuchadrezzar,</span> &c. — God now commands his prophet to expound to the Jews the design of the order given him in the preceding verse. The stones hid in the clay, at the entry of Pharaoh’s house, were intended to be a sign that the king of Babylon should make himself master of that royal city, and set his throne in that very place. This minute circumstance is particularly foretold, that, when it was accomplished, they might be put in mind of the prophecy, and confirmed in their belief of the extent and certainty of the divine prescience; to which the smallest and most contingent events are evident. God calls Nebuchadnezzar his <span class="ital">servant, </span>because in this instance he should execute God’s will, accomplish his purposes, and be instrumental in carrying on his designs. <span class="ital">And when he cometh, he shall smite the land of Egypt </span>— Though Egypt has always been a warlike nation, it shall not be able to withstand the king of Babylon; but whom he will he shall slay, and in what way he pleases; <span class="ital">and deliver such as are for death to death </span>— See note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-2.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, if they say to you, Where shall we go forth? then you shall tell them, Thus said the LORD; Such as are for death, to death; and such as are for the sword, to the sword; and such as are for the famine, to the famine; and such as are for the captivity, to the captivity.">Jeremiah 15:2</a>.

In this enumeration of those who were conducted to Egypt, Hitzig, Graf, and others distinguish two classes: (1) the men, women, children, etc., who had been in Mizpah with Gedaliah, and had been led to Gibeon, after the murder of the latter, by Ishmael, but had afterwards been brought to Bethlehem by Johanan and the other captains (<a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/43-6.htm">Jeremiah 43:6</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/40-7.htm">Jeremiah 40:7</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/41-10.htm">Jeremiah 41:10</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/41-16.htm">Jeremiah 41:16</a>); (2) those who had returned from the foreign countries whither they had fled, but who had hitherto lived in the country, scattered here and there, and who must have joined the company led by Johanan to Bethlehem during the ten days of halt at that resting-place (<a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/43-5.htm">Jeremiah 43:5</a>, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/40-11.htm">Jeremiah 40:11-12</a>). There is no foundation, however, for this distinction. Neither in the present chapter is there anything mentioned of those who had been dispersed through the land joining those who had marched to Bethlehem; nor are the Jews who had returned from Moab, Ammon, Edom, and other countries to their own home distinguished, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/40.htm">Jeremiah 40</a> and 41, as a different class from those who had been with Gedaliah in Mizpah; but on the other hand, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/40-12.htm">Jeremiah 40:12</a>, these returned Jews also came to Gedaliah at Mizpah, and gathered grapes and fruit. Besides, in these verses the distinction can only be made after the insertion into the text of the conjunction &#1493; before &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;. To "all the remnant of Judah who had returned from the nations" belong the men, women, children, etc., whom Nebuzaradan had committed to the care of Gedaliah. The enumeration in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/43-6.htm">Jeremiah 43:6</a> gives only one specification of the "whole remnant of Judah," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/41-16.htm">Jeremiah 41:16</a>. "And all the souls;" as if it were said, "and whoever else was still left alive;" cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-28.htm">Joshua 10:28</a>. Tahpanhes was a frontier town of Egypt on the Pelusian branch of the Nile, and named &#x394;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; by the Greeks; see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-16.htm">Jeremiah 2:16</a>. Here, on the borders of Egypt, a halt was made, for the purpose of coming to further resolutions regarding their residence in that country. Here, too, Jeremiah received a revelation from God regarding the fate now impending on Egypt. </body></html>
