To take possession of the whole country will be as quick and light a matter as when the shepherd takes up his garment at night and wraps it round him. Possibly (as Hitzig suggests) there may be a reference to the fact that when the shepherd so wraps himself he turns the fleecy coat which he wears inside out (the “<span class= "ital">pellibus inversis” o</span>f Juvenal, <span class= "ital">Sat. xiv.</span> 136). So, the prophet may suggest, shall the conqueror turn the whole land upside down.

God here speaks of himself as the prime mover, or principal agent in this business, no doubt with a design to inculcate this necessary and important lesson, that in the punishing of idolatrous or ungodly nations both the plan is his, and the power of carrying it into execution, whatever instruments he may choose to employ as the subordinate ministers of his providence. <span class="ital">And he shall array himself with the land of Egypt </span>— That is, he shall clothe, or enrich himself and his army with the spoils and plunder of the country: or he shall add Egypt to his dominions, and possess himself of the riches of it, with as much ease as the shepherd puts on his garment.

Not only men should not be spared, but their gods also, and their temples should be burnt, as was usually done when cities were taken and destroyed: this is ascribed to God, to his wrath and vengeance; idolatry being a sin highly displeasing to him; though the Chaldeans were the instruments of it, yet it being done by the order, direction, and providence of God, it is rightly attributed to him: <p>and he shall burn them, and carry them away captives; that is, Nebuchadnezzar shall do this; he shall burn their temples, and carry away their idols of gold and silver; so Kimchi, who adds, or the sense is, he shall carry captive their worshippers; but rather the meaning is, he shall burn their idols, such as are made of wood, or any base matter, not worth saving; and he shall carry away with him their idols, such as are made of gold and silver, or any precious matter: <p>and he shall array himself with the land of Egypt, as a shepherd putteth on his garment. The Targum is, <p>"he shall spoil the land of Egypt.'' <p>The meaning is, that he shall load and cover himself and his army with the spoil of the land of Egypt, as a shepherd covers himself with his garment; and he shall do it as easily as a shepherd puts on his coat; and as completely he shall roll up all the spoil, wealth, and riches of the land, and carry it off, even as a shepherd rolls up the covering of his tent; and, as Kimchi's father observes, as well as puts on his garment, and leaves nothing behind him, when he removes from place to place; and as he is unmindful of his clothes, or what he wears in the heat of the day; but at night, when he returns home from keeping his sheep, puts on his clothes, the best he has; so should the king of Babylon and his army return richly laden with the spoil of Egypt, when he should leave it. Or the sense rather is, he shall cover the land of Egypt with his forces, as a shepherd is covered and wrapped up in his garment against the inclemency of the weather; or else, as Bochart (k) suggests, the destruction of Egypt may be compared to an old worn out garment, or such a mean and sordid garment as shepherds wear: <p>and he shall go forth from thence in peace: there shall be none to molest and disturb him, to stop him and take away the spoil from him, or hinder his return to his own country; whither he should go in safety, and with great booty. <p>(k) Hierozoic. par. 1. l. 2. c. 44. col. 456. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/43.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And I will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt; and he shall burn them, and carry them away captives: and he shall array himself with the land of Egypt, as a <span class="cverse3">{m}</span> shepherd putteth on his garment; and he shall go forth from there in peace.</span><p>(m) Meaning most easily and suddenly will he carry the Egyptians away.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/43.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">12</span>. <span class="ital">I will kindle</span>] LXX (better) <span class="ital">he will kindle</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">array himself … garment</span>] The Heb. verb means to roll up, or to wrap round, as a garment, but interpretations of the figure here used differ: viz. (<span class="ital">a</span>) Nebuchadnezzar shall have no more difficulty in carrying off the spoil of Egypt than the shepherd has in <span class="ital">rolling up</span> his possessions in his garment and carrying them off (so Erbt); (<span class="ital">b</span>) the king of Babylon will take possession of the land itself, as easily as the shepherd <span class="ital">wraps himself</span> in his garment (so apparently R.V.), a figure, however, which is too violent to be probable. The LXX reading (so Co.), however unacceptable to modern taste, has a good deal to be said for its likelihood as expressive of the prophet’s attitude towards Babylon and Egypt respectively; i.e. for Nebuchadnezzar the utter devastation of the land of Egypt will be as easy a matter as it is for the shepherd to cleanse his garment by removing one by one the vermin which infest it.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/43.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Burn them;</span> viz. the temples. Egypt was full of gorgeous and imposing temples, which could not, however, always be burned, nor were the conquerors of Egypt anxious to display hostility to Egyptian religion. <span class="cmt_word">Carry them away captives;</span> viz. the idol gods (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-7.htm">Jeremiah 48:7</a>, "Chemosh  shall no forth into captivity:" and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/46-2.htm">Isaiah 46:2</a>, "Their soul [or, 'personality'] hath gone into captivity"). The prophet speaks from the point of view of a believer in the idol gods. <span class="cmt_word">He shall array himself with the land of Egypt,</span> etc. (For "array himself with" and "putteth on,"<span class="accented">read wrap himself in</span> and <span class="accented">wrappeth himself in.</span>) Ewald well explains this figure. "As easily as the shepherd in the open field wraps himself in the cool night in his mantle, will he be able to grasp Egypt with his hand and fling it round him like an easily managed garment, in order then to leave the land as an absolute conqueror, clothed in this attire of booty, in peace, without an enemy." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/43.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Thereupon Johanan and the other captains took "all the remnant of Judah, that had returned from all the nations whither they had been driven, to dwell in the land of Judah-the men and women and children, the king's daughters, and all the souls whom Nebuzaradan, chief of the body-guard, had committed to Gedaliah...and Jeremiah the prophet, and Baruch the son of Neriah, - and went to the land of Egypt - for they did not hearken to the voice of Jahveh - and came to Tahpanhes." In this enumeration of those who were conducted to Egypt, Hitzig, Graf, and others distinguish two classes: (1) the men, women, children, etc., who had been in Mizpah with Gedaliah, and had been led to Gibeon, after the murder of the latter, by Ishmael, but had afterwards been brought to Bethlehem by Johanan and the other captains (<a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/43-6.htm">Jeremiah 43:6</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/40-7.htm">Jeremiah 40:7</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/41-10.htm">Jeremiah 41:10</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/41-16.htm">Jeremiah 41:16</a>); (2) those who had returned from the foreign countries whither they had fled, but who had hitherto lived in the country, scattered here and there, and who must have joined the company led by Johanan to Bethlehem during the ten days of halt at that resting-place (<a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/43-5.htm">Jeremiah 43:5</a>, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/40-11.htm">Jeremiah 40:11-12</a>). There is no foundation, however, for this distinction. Neither in the present chapter is there anything mentioned of those who had been dispersed through the land joining those who had marched to Bethlehem; nor are the Jews who had returned from Moab, Ammon, Edom, and other countries to their own home distinguished, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/40.htm">Jeremiah 40</a> and 41, as a different class from those who had been with Gedaliah in Mizpah; but on the other hand, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/40-12.htm">Jeremiah 40:12</a>, these returned Jews also came to Gedaliah at Mizpah, and gathered grapes and fruit. Besides, in these verses the distinction can only be made after the insertion into the text of the conjunction &#1493; before &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;. To "all the remnant of Judah who had returned from the nations" belong the men, women, children, etc., whom Nebuzaradan had committed to the care of Gedaliah. The enumeration in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/43-6.htm">Jeremiah 43:6</a> gives only one specification of the "whole remnant of Judah," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/41-16.htm">Jeremiah 41:16</a>. "And all the souls;" as if it were said, "and whoever else was still left alive;" cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-28.htm">Joshua 10:28</a>. Tahpanhes was a frontier town of Egypt on the Pelusian branch of the Nile, and named &#x394;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; by the Greeks; see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-16.htm">Jeremiah 2:16</a>. Here, on the borders of Egypt, a halt was made, for the purpose of coming to further resolutions regarding their residence in that country. Here, too, Jeremiah received a revelation from God regarding the fate now impending on Egypt. </body></html>
