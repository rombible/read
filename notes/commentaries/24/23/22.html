Are the people better or worse for the prophet’s work? What are the fruits of his teaching? (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-20.htm" title="Why by their fruits you shall know them.">Matthew 7:20</a>.) The question meets us, Is this always a test? Was Jeremiah’s own work successful in this sense? Must not the true teacher speak “whether they [men] will hear, or whether they will forbear?” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/2-5.htm" title="And they, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, (for they are a rebellious house,) yet shall know that there has been a prophet among them.">Ezekiel 2:5</a>.) The answer is found (1) in the fact that true teaching seldom fails altogether of its work; (2) that where it seems to fail it satisfies the other test, and at least stirs and rouses men from lethargy, even if it stirs them to antagonism. It is never satisfied with speaking smooth things and acquiescing in the evil that surrounds it.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/23.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>23:9-22 The false prophets of Samaria had deluded the Israelites into idolatries; yet the Lord considered the false prophets of Jerusalem as guilty of more horrible wickedness, by which the people were made bold in sin. These false teachers would be compelled to suffer the most bitter part of the Lord's indignation. They made themselves believe that there was no harm in sin, and practised accordingly; then they made others believe so. Those who are resolved to go on in evil ways, will justly be given up to believe strong delusions. But which of them had received any revelation of God, or understood any thing of his word? There was a time coming when they would reflect on their folly and unbelief with remorse. The teaching and example of the true prophets led men to repentance, faith, and righteousness. The false prophets led men to rest in forms and notions, and to be quiet in their sins. Let us take heed that we do not follow unrighteousness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They should have turned them ... - The work of the true prophet, which is to turn men from evil unto good. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/23.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22. stood in &#8230; counsel&#8212;(Jer 23:18).<p>they should have turned them from their evil way&#8212;They would have given such counsels to the people as would have turned them from their sins (Jer 25:5; Isa 55:11), and so would have averted punishment. Their not teaching the law in which God's counsel is set forth proves they are not His prophets, though they boast of being so (Mt 7:15-20).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/23.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> These false prophets did not prophesy without the approbation of the rulers of the ecclesiastical state amongst the Jews in their corrupt state, but so they might, and yet not be sent of God. The judgment of a Divine mission for the revelation of God’s mind unto people must not be merely from their external mission, (which yet they ought to have in a church that is in order,) but from the faithful discharge of their ministry. Those whom God sends, and who are truly acquainted with his counsels, will cause his people to hear, not their own conceits and inventions, but the word of the Lord. God sendeth none upon any other errand but to reveal his will and tell his mind unto people. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Then, </span> saith the prophet, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">they should have turned them from their evil way; </span> that is, they would have made this their scope, business, and end, to turn sinners from their sinful ways; and though possibly their labours would not have had so good an effect upon all, yet they would have had an effect upon some to turn them from their evil doings. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/23.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But if they had stood in my counsel,....

They deceive you; a vision of their heart they speak, not out of the mouth of Jahveh. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-17.htm">Jeremiah 23:17</a>. They say still unto my despisers: 'Jahveh hath spoken: Peace shall ye have;' and unto every one that walketh in the stubbornness of his heart they say: 'There shall no evil come upon you.' <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-18.htm">Jeremiah 23:18</a>.

But if they had stood in my counsel, they would publish my words to my people and bring them back from their evil way and from the evil of their doings."<p>The warning against these prophets is founded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-16.htm">Jeremiah 23:16</a> on the fact that they give out the thoughts of their own hearts to be divine revelation, and promise peace and prosperity to all stiff-necked sinners. &#1502;&#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, lit., they make you vain, i.e., make you to yield yourselves to vain delusion, seduce you to false confidence. This they do by their speaking visions, i.e., revelations of their heart, not what God has spoken, revealed to them. As an illustration of this, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-17.htm">Jeremiah 23:17</a> tells that they prophesy continued peace or well-being to the despisers of God. The infin. abs. &#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1512; after the verb. fin. intimates the duration or repetition of the thing. &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; are words of the false prophets, with which they give out that their prophesyings are God's word. Since we nowhere else find sayings of Jahveh introduced by &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;, but usually by '&#1499;&#1468;&#1492; &#1488;&#1502;&#1512; &#1497;, the lxx have taken offence at that formula, and, reading &#1491;&#1489;&#1512;, join the words with &#1500;&#1502;&#1504;&#1488;&#1510;&#1497;: &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;. To this reading Hitz. and Gr. give the preference over the Masoretic; but they have not noticed that they thus get an unsuitable sense. For &#1491;&#1489;&#1512; &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; in prophetic language never denotes the Mosaic law or the "moral law" (Hitz.), but the word of God published by the prophets. By their view of "word of Jahveh" they would here obtain the self-inconsistent thought: to the despisers of divine revelation they proclaim as revelation. The Masoretic reading is clearly right; and Jeremiah chose the unusual introductory formula to distinguish the language of the pseudo-prophets from that of the true prophets of the Lord. &#1493;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1500;&#1498; &#1489;' is prefixed absolutely: and as concerning every one that walks...they say, for: and to every one...they say. On the "stubbornness of their heart," see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-17.htm">Jeremiah 3:17</a>. With the speech of the false prophets, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-13.htm">Jeremiah 14:13</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-14.htm">Jeremiah 6:14</a>. - In <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-18.htm">Jeremiah 23:18</a> a more comprehensive reason is given to show that these prophets are not publishing God's decrees. The question: Who hath stood? has negative force  equals  None hath stood. By this Jeremiah does not deny the possibility of this universally, but only of the false prophets (Hitz.). This limitation of the words is suggested by the context. To the true prophets the Lord reveals His &#1505;&#1493;&#1491;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>. &#1493;&#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506; are not to be taken jussively: let him see and hear (Hitz.), for the foregoing interrogation is not a conditional clause introducing a command. The imperfects with &#1493; are clauses of consequence or design, and after a preceding perfect should be rendered in English by the conditional of the pluperfect. Seeing the word of God refers to prophetic vision. The second question is appended without at all conveying any inference from what precedes; and in it the second verb (with &#1493; consec.) is simply a strengthening of the first: who hath hearkened to my word and heard it? The Masoretes have quite unnecessarily changed the Chet. &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497; .tehC  into &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1493;. In the graphic representation of the prophets, the transition to the direct speech of God, and conversely, is no unusual thing. The change of &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506; into &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;, unnecessary and even improper as it is, is preferred by Graf and Ng., inasmuch as they take the interrogative &#1502;&#1497; in both clauses in the sense of quisquis and understand the verse thus: He who has but stood in the counsel of the Lord, let him see and hear His word (i.e., he must see and hear His word); and he that hath marked my word, let him publish it (i.e., he must publish it). This exposition becomes only then necessary, if we leave the context out of view and regard the question as being to the effect that no one has stood in God's counsel - which Jeremiah could not mean. Not to speak of the change of the text necessary for carrying it through, this view does not even give a suitable sense. If the clause: He that has stood in the counsel of the Lord, he must proclaim His word, is to be regarded as having a demonstrative force, then the principal idea must be supplied, thus namely: "and it is impossible that it should be favourable to those who despise it." In <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-19.htm">Jeremiah 23:19</a> Jeremiah publishes a real word of the Lord, which sounds very differently from the words of the false prophets. A tempest from Jahveh will burst over the heads of the evil-doers, and the wrath of God will not cease until it has accomplished the divine decree. "A tempest from Jahveh" is defined by "fury" in apposition as being a manifestation of God's wrath; and the whole first clause is further expanded in the second part of the verse. The tempest from Jahveh goes forth, i.e., breaks out, and as whirling tornado or eddying whirlwind bursts over the head of the wicked. &#1497;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500; is to be taken in accordance with &#1502;&#1514;&#1495;&#1493;&#1500;&#1500;: twist, whirl, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-29.htm">2 Samuel 3:29</a>. "The thoughts of His heart" must not be limited to what God has decreed de interitu populi (Calv.); it comprehends God's whole redemptive plan in His people's regard-not merely the overthrow of the kingdom of Judah, but also the purification of the people by means of judgments and the final glorification of His kingdom. To this future the next clause points: at the end of the days ye shall have clear knowledge of this. "The end of the days" is not merely the completion of the period in which we now are (Hitz., Gr. Ng., etc.), but, as universally, the end of the times, i.e., the Messianic future, the last period of the world's history which opens at the close of the present aeon; see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-1.htm">Genesis 49:1</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/24-14.htm">Numbers 24:14</a>, etc. &#1492;&#1514;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1504;&#1503; is strengthened by &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492; yb dene: attain to insight, come to clearer knowledge.</body></html>
