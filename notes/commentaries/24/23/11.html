It seems probable, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-34.htm" title="But they set their abominations in the house, which is called by my name, to defile it.">Jeremiah 32:34</a>, that the sins of Ahaz and Manasseh had been repeated under Jehoiakim, and that the worship of other gods had been carried on side by side with that of Jehovah. With this, almost as its natural accompaniment, there may have been sins of another kind—shameless greed or yet more shameless profligacy—like those of the sons of Eli (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-22.htm" title="Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did to all Israel; and how they lay with the women that assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.">1Samuel 2:22</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/jeremiah/23.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/23-11.htm" title="For both prophet and priest are profane; yes, in my house have I found their wickedness, said the LORD....">Jeremiah 23:11-12</a></span>. <span class="ital">For both the prophet and the priest are profane </span>— The priests, by their formality and hypocrisy, profaned the ordinances of God which they were appointed to administer; and the prophets, by their lies, false doctrine, and corrupt practice, profaned the word of God, which they pretended to deliver. <span class="ital">Yea, in my house have I found their wickedness: saith the Lord </span>— Even in my temple, where they assemble under a pretence to worship and do me honour, they say and do many things contrary to my law, and are guilty of various acts of profaneness and immorality.

These false teachers would be compelled to suffer the most bitter part of the Lord's indignation. They made themselves believe that there was no harm in sin, and practised accordingly; then they made others believe so. Those who are resolved to go on in evil ways, will justly be given up to believe strong delusions. But which of them had received any revelation of God, or understood any thing of his word? There was a time coming when they would reflect on their folly and unbelief with remorse. The teaching and example of the true prophets led men to repentance, faith, and righteousness. The false prophets led men to rest in forms and notions, and to be quiet in their sins.

The figurative expressions are founded on the idea that the sheep, when they are neglected by the shepherds, are torn and devoured by wild beasts; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-8.htm">Ezekiel 34:8</a>. They shall not be lacking; cf. for &#1504;&#1508;&#1511;&#1491; with this force, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-7.htm">1 Samuel 25:7</a>; in substance  equals  not be lost. &#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468; is chosen with a view to &#1500;&#1488; &#1508;&#1511;&#1491;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501; &#1488;&#1514;&#1501; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-2.htm">Jeremiah 23:2</a>): because the shepherds did not take charge of the sheep, therefore the sheep are scattered and lost. Hereafter this shall happen no more. The question as to how this promise is to be accomplished is answered by <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-6.htm">Jeremiah 23:6</a>. The substance of these verses is indeed introduced by the phrase: behold, days come, as something new and important, but not as something not to happen till after the things foretold in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-4.htm">Jeremiah 23:4</a>. According to Jeremiah's usage throughout, that phrase does not indicate any progress in time as compared with what precedes, but draws attention to the weightiness of what is to be announced. There is also a suggestion of "the contrast between the hope and the existing condition of affairs, which does not itself justify that hope. However gloomy the present is, yet there is a time coming" (Hgstb.). The promise: I make to arise (raise up) to David a righteous branch, rests upon the promise, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-12.htm">1 Chronicles 17:12</a> : I raise up thy seed after thee, which shall be of thy sons-which the Lord will hereafter fulfil to David. Graf tries to show by many, but not tenable arguments, that &#1510;&#1502;&#1495; has here a collective force. That he is wrong, we may see from the passages <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/3-8.htm">Zechariah 3:8</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/6-12.htm">Zechariah 6:12</a>, where the same "branch" foretold by Jeremiah is called the man whose name is &#1510;&#1502;&#1495;; and even without this we may discover the same from the context of the present passage, both from "He shall reign as king," and still more from: they shall call his name Jahveh Tsidkenu. Neither of these sayings can be spoken of a series of kings. Besides, we have the passages <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-9.htm">Jeremiah 30:9</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-23.htm">Ezekiel 34:23</a>., <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-24.htm">Ezekiel 37:24</a>, where the servant to be raised up to David by Jahveh is called "my servant David." Although then &#1510;&#1502;&#1495; has a collective force when it means a plant of the field, it by no means follows that "it has always a collective force" in its transferred spiritual signification. And the passage, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-17.htm">Jeremiah 33:17</a>, where the promise is explained by: David shall never want a man to sit upon the throne of Israel (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-21.htm">Jeremiah 33:21</a>), does not prove that the branch of David is a collective grouping together of all David's future posterity, but only that this one branch of David shall possess the throne for ever, and not, like mortal men, for a series of years only; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>. &#1510;&#1502;&#1495; denotes the Messiah, and this title is formed from &#1510;&#1502;&#1495;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/4-2.htm">Isaiah 4:2</a> (see Del. on this passage). Nor does the mention of shepherds in the plural, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-4.htm">Jeremiah 23:4</a>, at all oppose this. An untenable rendering of the sense is: first I will raise up unto you shepherds, then the Messiah; or: better shepherds, inprimis unum, Messiam (Chr. B. Mich.). The two promises are not so to be joined. First we have the raising up of good shepherds, in contrast to the evil shepherds that have destroyed the people; then the promise is further explained to the effect that these good shepherds shall be raised up to David in the "righteous branch," i.e., in the promised "seed" of his sons. The good shepherds are contrasted with the evil shepherds, but are then summed up in the person of the Messiah, as being comprised therein. The relation of the good shepherds to the righteous branch is not so, that the latter is the most pre-eminent of the former, but that in that one branch of David the people should have given to them all the good shepherds needed for their deliverance. The Messiah does not correspond to the series of David's earthly posterity that sit upon his throne, in that He too, as second David, will also have a long series of descendants upon His throne; but in that His kingdom, His dominion, lasts for ever. In the parallel passage, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-15.htm">Jeremiah 33:15</a>, where the contrast to the evil shepherds is omitted, we therefore hear only of the one branch of David; so in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34.htm">Ezekiel 34</a>, where only the one good shepherd, the servant of the Lord, David, stands in contrast to the evil shepherds (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-23.htm">Jeremiah 23:23</a>). Hence neither must we seek the fulfilment of our prophecy in the elevation of the Maccabees, who were not even of the race of David, nor understand, as Grot., Zerubbabel to be the righteous branch, but the Messiah, as was rightly understood by the Chald. He is &#1510;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1511; in contrast to the then reigning members of the house of David, and as He who will do right and justice in His realm; cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-15.htm">Jeremiah 22:15</a>, where the same is said of Josiah as contrasted with his ungodly son Jehoiakim. &#1502;&#1500;&#1498; is subjoined to &#1502;&#1500;&#1498; to bespeak His rule as kingship in the fullest sense of the word. Regnabit rex, i.e., magnifice regnabit, ut non tantum appareant aliquae reliquiae pristinae dignitatis, sed ut rex floreat et vigeat et obtineat perfectionem, qualis fuit sub Davide et Salomone ac multo praestantior (Calv.). &#1492;&#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;, deal prudently, rule wisely, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-15.htm">Jeremiah 3:15</a>, not: be fortunate, prosperous. Here the context demands the former rendering, the only one justified by usage, since the doing of right and justice is mentioned as the fruit and result of the &#1492;&#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1497;&#1500;. These words, too, point back to David, of whom it is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-15.htm">2 Samuel 8:15</a> said, that he as king did right and justice to all his people. </body></html>
