The land is said to <span class="ital">mourn </span>when it is afflicted with drought, barrenness, or any other uncommon calamity. And the swearing here spoken of is represented by the prophet as one of those crying sins for which God had visited the nation with these and other severe judgments. And the sins here mentioned, which abounded so much among the people, were in a great measure owing to the bad example and corrupt doctrine of the priests and prophets. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/23-11.htm" title="For both prophet and priest are profane; yes, in my house have I found their wickedness, said the LORD....">Jeremiah 23:11-15</a>. <span class="ital">The pleasant places, </span>or <span class="ital">the pastures, of the wilderness </span>— Or, <span class="ital">of the plain, </span>as the words may be properly rendered; <span class="ital">are dried up — </span>The wrath of God is extended to all places, whether more or less inhabited.

These false teachers would be compelled to suffer the most bitter part of the Lord's indignation. They made themselves believe that there was no harm in sin, and practised accordingly; then they made others believe so. Those who are resolved to go on in evil ways, will justly be given up to believe strong delusions. But which of them had received any revelation of God, or understood any thing of his word? There was a time coming when they would reflect on their folly and unbelief with remorse. The teaching and example of the true prophets led men to repentance, faith, and righteousness.

Of such as were guilty of corporeal adultery, and of spiritual adultery, which is idolatry. Now, though in this, and in the following verses, the prophet describes the men of his generation, both ecclesiastics and laics; yet also so as to have regard to the Jews in the times of Christ, to which this prophecy has respect; between whom there was a great resemblance; adulteries were so frequent in Christ's time, that the Jews left off the use of the bitter waters (n); and our Lord sometimes calls the generation in which he lived an adulterous one, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-39.htm">Matthew 12:39</a>; <p>for because of swearing the land mourneth; because of false swearing and cursing; because of the oaths and imprecations of men; or because of the curse of God, for the sins of men, the land was desert or desolate, as the Targum; it became barren and unfruitful, the land of Judea; just as the earth was cursed for the sin of man originally; though it seems rather to signify perjury or false swearing, which, and adultery, were the reigning vices of the age; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-33.htm">Matthew 5:33</a>; <p>the pleasant places of the wilderness are dried up; or the pastures of the wilderness, where cattle used to feed, were dried up for want of rain, and so were unfruitful, and produced no grass for the beasts of the field: <p>and yet their course is evil; the course of their ministry or prophesying was bad; and the course of their lives and conversations was one continued series of iniquity; the race they ran, both prophet and people, was a wicked one; they ran and made haste to commit sin; though a professing people, their conversation was according to "the course of this world", <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-2.htm">Ephesians 2:2</a>; and not according to the rule of God's word: <p>and their force is not right; or, "is not so" (o); as it ought to be, or employed in the manner it should: the power and authority of the prophets over the people was not used, as it might have been, for the preserving of the people from sin; nor their courage and valour shown for truth, as it ought to have been; and they used their power to hurt and oppress, and not to relieve and help: so the Pharisees in Christ's time laid heavy burdens on others, but would not move them themselves; and, through a pretence of devotion, devoured widows' houses, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-4.htm">Matthew 23:4</a>. So some render the words here, "and their violence is not right" (p); their rapine and oppression were very unjust; so that, besides adultery and swearing, they are charged with violence in particular, and with a wicked course of life in general. <p>(n) Misn.

The figurative expressions are founded on the idea that the sheep, when they are neglected by the shepherds, are torn and devoured by wild beasts; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-8.htm">Ezekiel 34:8</a>. They shall not be lacking; cf. for &#1504;&#1508;&#1511;&#1491; with this force, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-7.htm">1 Samuel 25:7</a>; in substance  equals  not be lost. &#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468; is chosen with a view to &#1500;&#1488; &#1508;&#1511;&#1491;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501; &#1488;&#1514;&#1501; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-2.htm">Jeremiah 23:2</a>): because the shepherds did not take charge of the sheep, therefore the sheep are scattered and lost. Hereafter this shall happen no more. The question as to how this promise is to be accomplished is answered by <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-6.htm">Jeremiah 23:6</a>. The substance of these verses is indeed introduced by the phrase: behold, days come, as something new and important, but not as something not to happen till after the things foretold in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-4.htm">Jeremiah 23:4</a>. According to Jeremiah's usage throughout, that phrase does not indicate any progress in time as compared with what precedes, but draws attention to the weightiness of what is to be announced. There is also a suggestion of "the contrast between the hope and the existing condition of affairs, which does not itself justify that hope. However gloomy the present is, yet there is a time coming" (Hgstb.). The promise: I make to arise (raise up) to David a righteous branch, rests upon the promise, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-12.htm">1 Chronicles 17:12</a> : I raise up thy seed after thee, which shall be of thy sons-which the Lord will hereafter fulfil to David. Graf tries to show by many, but not tenable arguments, that &#1510;&#1502;&#1495; has here a collective force. That he is wrong, we may see from the passages <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/3-8.htm">Zechariah 3:8</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/6-12.htm">Zechariah 6:12</a>, where the same "branch" foretold by Jeremiah is called the man whose name is &#1510;&#1502;&#1495;; and even without this we may discover the same from the context of the present passage, both from "He shall reign as king," and still more from: they shall call his name Jahveh Tsidkenu. Neither of these sayings can be spoken of a series of kings. Besides, we have the passages <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-9.htm">Jeremiah 30:9</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-23.htm">Ezekiel 34:23</a>., <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-24.htm">Ezekiel 37:24</a>, where the servant to be raised up to David by Jahveh is called "my servant David." Although then &#1510;&#1502;&#1495; has a collective force when it means a plant of the field, it by no means follows that "it has always a collective force" in its transferred spiritual signification. And the passage, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-17.htm">Jeremiah 33:17</a>, where the promise is explained by: David shall never want a man to sit upon the throne of Israel (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-21.htm">Jeremiah 33:21</a>), does not prove that the branch of David is a collective grouping together of all David's future posterity, but only that this one branch of David shall possess the throne for ever, and not, like mortal men, for a series of years only; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>. &#1510;&#1502;&#1495; denotes the Messiah, and this title is formed from &#1510;&#1502;&#1495;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/4-2.htm">Isaiah 4:2</a> (see Del. on this passage). Nor does the mention of shepherds in the plural, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-4.htm">Jeremiah 23:4</a>, at all oppose this. An untenable rendering of the sense is: first I will raise up unto you shepherds, then the Messiah; or: better shepherds, inprimis unum, Messiam (Chr. B. Mich.). The two promises are not so to be joined. First we have the raising up of good shepherds, in contrast to the evil shepherds that have destroyed the people; then the promise is further explained to the effect that these good shepherds shall be raised up to David in the "righteous branch," i.e., in the promised "seed" of his sons. The good shepherds are contrasted with the evil shepherds, but are then summed up in the person of the Messiah, as being comprised therein. The relation of the good shepherds to the righteous branch is not so, that the latter is the most pre-eminent of the former, but that in that one branch of David the people should have given to them all the good shepherds needed for their deliverance. The Messiah does not correspond to the series of David's earthly posterity that sit upon his throne, in that He too, as second David, will also have a long series of descendants upon His throne; but in that His kingdom, His dominion, lasts for ever. In the parallel passage, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-15.htm">Jeremiah 33:15</a>, where the contrast to the evil shepherds is omitted, we therefore hear only of the one branch of David; so in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34.htm">Ezekiel 34</a>, where only the one good shepherd, the servant of the Lord, David, stands in contrast to the evil shepherds (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-23.htm">Jeremiah 23:23</a>). Hence neither must we seek the fulfilment of our prophecy in the elevation of the Maccabees, who were not even of the race of David, nor understand, as Grot., Zerubbabel to be the righteous branch, but the Messiah, as was rightly understood by the Chald. He is &#1510;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1511; in contrast to the then reigning members of the house of David, and as He who will do right and justice in His realm; cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-15.htm">Jeremiah 22:15</a>, where the same is said of Josiah as contrasted with his ungodly son Jehoiakim. &#1502;&#1500;&#1498; is subjoined to &#1502;&#1500;&#1498; to bespeak His rule as kingship in the fullest sense of the word. Regnabit rex, i.e., magnifice regnabit, ut non tantum appareant aliquae reliquiae pristinae dignitatis, sed ut rex floreat et vigeat et obtineat perfectionem, qualis fuit sub Davide et Salomone ac multo praestantior (Calv.). &#1492;&#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;, deal prudently, rule wisely, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-15.htm">Jeremiah 3:15</a>, not: be fortunate, prosperous. Here the context demands the former rendering, the only one justified by usage, since the doing of right and justice is mentioned as the fruit and result of the &#1492;&#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1497;&#1500;. These words, too, point back to David, of whom it is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-15.htm">2 Samuel 8:15</a> said, that he as king did right and justice to all his people. </body></html>
