The false prophets acted as if God were far away out of their sight (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/10-11.htm" title="He has said in his heart, God has forgotten: he hides his face; he will never see it.">Psalm 10:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-11.htm" title="And they say, How does God know? and is there knowledge in the most High?">Psalm 73:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/94-7.htm" title="Yet they say, The LORD shall not see, neither shall the God of Jacob regard it.">Psalm 94:7</a>), not knowing or caring what men did, as if their affairs, as it has been epigrammatically said, came under a “colonial department.” The true prophet feels that He is equally near, equally God, in all places alike. Familiar as the word omnipresence is to us—so familiar as almost to have lost its power—the fact, when we realise it, is as awful now as it was when it presented itself to the souls of Patriarch, Psalmist, or Prophet. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/16-13.htm" title="And she called the name of the LORD that spoke to her, You God see me: for she said, Have I also here looked after him that sees me?">Genesis 16:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/32-6.htm" title="For this shall every one that is godly pray to you in a time when you may be found: surely in the floods of great waters they shall not come near to him.">Psalm 32:6-7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/73-23.htm" title="Nevertheless I am continually with you: you have held me by my right hand.">Psalm 73:23-26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/139-7.htm" title="Where shall I go from your spirit? or where shall I flee from your presence?">Psalm 139:7-12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/amos/9-2.htm" title="Though they dig into hell, there shall my hand take them; though they climb up to heaven, there will I bring them down:">Amos 9:2-4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/11-8.htm" title="It is as high as heaven; what can you do? deeper than hell; what can you know?">Job 11:8-9</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/jeremiah/23.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/23-23.htm" title="Am I a God at hand, said the LORD, and not a God afar off?...">Jeremiah 23:23-24</a></span>. <span class="ital">Am I a God at hand and not a God afar off? </span>— Do these false prophets imagine that I am only a God in some particular places, and that I cannot see or know things done privately, or at a distance from the place where they suppose me to be? Do they think to impose upon me, or vent their own dreams in my name, and I not discover them? As if either distance or secrecy could place any thing out of the reach of my power and knowledge. Atheism, or ignorance of God, is generally the foundation of a wicked life. Men think God does not see, or does not regard them and their actions, and will not call them to an account for them, and therefore they go on in their trespasses. By a God <span class="ital">at hand, </span>some understand, <span class="ital">in heaven: </span>as if he had said, Do you think my eyes are limited like yours, so that I cannot see men’s practices though at a distance from the place of my peculiar and glorious residence?

Am not I the Ancient of days? the eternal God, of whose majesty, omniscience, and omnipresence you ought to have been sensible? <span class="ital">Can any hide himself in secret places </span>— Can any man hide his projects or intentions, his thoughts or desires, his words or works, that I shall not see them? Surely not. No arts or concealments can hide any man’s practices or even the counsels of his heart from the eye of God, nor in any respect deceive his judgment of them. Do not I fill heaven and earth, namely, by my essential presence, as well as by my universal providence? Am I not continually present, and continually active through all parts of the universe?

Let them not call their foolish dreams Divine oracles. The promises of peace these prophets make are no more to be compared to God's promises than chaff to wheat. The unhumbled heart of man is like a rock; if not melted by the word of God as a fire, it will be broken to pieces by it as a hammer. How can they be long safe, or at all easy, who have a God of almighty power against them? The word of God is no smooth, lulling, deceitful message.

Or "near" (f); that is, in heaven; and only sees, and hears, and observes persons and things there, being near unto him: <p>and not a God afar off? that sees, and hears, and takes notice of persons and things at a distance, even on earth. The meaning is, that he certainly was; and that persons and things on earth were as much under his cognizance and notice, as persons and things in heaven; which was quite contrary to the notions of these atheistical prophets and people; who, like Heathens, thought that God did not concern himself about persons and things on earth. The Septuagint and Arabic versions render it, without the interrogative, "I am a God near, saith the Lord, and not afar off". The meaning is, that God is alike near in one place as in another; which is a very great truth; and a very comfortable one it is to the people of God, to whom he is near in all places, and at all times; he is a present help in time of trouble; he is near them, to hear their cries, and grant their requests; he is near to give them assistance in a time of need, and to deliver them out of all their troubles; to afford them his gracious presence, and to indulge them with communion with himself; to communicate all good things to them; to speak comfortably to them; to take them by the hand, and lead them in the way everlasting: he is at their right hand to uphold them with his, and to strengthen them with strength in their souls; to advise and counsel, and direct them; to rebuke their enemies, and save them from them that condemn them; and indeed there are no people like them, who have God so nigh unto them, in all things they call upon him for, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-7.htm">Deuteronomy 4:7</a>; and though he may seem at times to be afar off, and stand at a distance from them; when he hides his face; withdraws his gracious influences; does not appear at once for their relief in distress; but suffers them to he afflicted in one way or another; yet in reality he is not; but is nigh unto them when they call upon him: and this truth is as uncomfortable and dreadful to wicked men, who cannot go from his spirit, or flee from his presence; which is everywhere, in heaven and hell, in the earth and seas, even in the uttermost parts of them; there his eye is upon them, and his right hand can reach them: he is omnipresent, omniscient, and omnipotent. The Targum is, <p>"I God have created the world from the beginning, saith the Lord; and I God will renew the world for the righteous;'' <p>see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-13.htm">2 Peter 3:13</a>; and some interpret the words of time, as well as of place; as if the sense was this, am I a God of late date, as the gods of the Heathens are? no, I am not: am I not a God from eternity who was before the world was, and the Creator of it, which they are not? verily I:am: but the former sense is best, and most agreeable with the context, and what follows. <p>(f) "e propinquo", Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator; "vel propinquus", Schmidt. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/jeremiah/23.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><i>Am</i> I a God at hand, saith the LORD, and not a God <span class="cverse3">{s}</span> afar off?</span><p>(s) Do I not see your falsehood, however you cloak it, and wherever you commit it?</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/jeremiah/23.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">23, 24</span>. The connexion of thought has been variously explained. (i) The LXX make <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-23.htm" title="Am I a God at hand, said the LORD, and not a God afar off?">Jeremiah 23:23</a></span> an affirmation, not a question. God, as universally present, can never be at a distance, and this agrees with <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-24.htm" title="Can any hide himself in secret places that I shall not see him? said the LORD. Do not I fill heaven and earth? said the LORD.">Jeremiah 23:24</a></span>. Afterwards, the <span class="ital">v</span>. was made interrogative to meet the difficulty connected with the later Jewish conception, viz. that God dwelt wholly apart from men. So Gi. The connexion, however, is still somewhat obscure. (ii) Jehovah is not accessible to the first person who rashly, like you, claims intimacy, but only to one known and consecrated from his birth, “a chosen vessel” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-15.htm" title="But the Lord said to him, Go your way: for he is a chosen vessel to me, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Israel:">Acts 9:15</a>). But if one <span class="ital">is</span> thus chosen, he must accept the office. He cannot hide himself. So Co. The contrast thus made between <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/23-23.htm" title="Am I a God at hand, said the LORD, and not a God afar off?...">Jeremiah 23:23-24</a></span> is the weak point here. (iii) These false prophets cannot hide themselves. God is omnipresent and sees through their deceptive claims. We can hardly say more than that this is perhaps the least unsatisfying of the interpretations.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 23-32.</span> - Jehovah has observed and will punish the false pretensions of the prophets. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 23, 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Am I a God at hand</span>, etc.? ("At hand" equivalent to "near.") Eliphaz may again assist us with an illustration. "And thou sayest " - he is expostulating with Job - "What doth God know? can he judge through the dark cloud? thick clouds are a covering to him, that he seeth not; yea, he walketh upon the vault of heaven" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-13.htm">Job 22:13, 14</a>). It might seem, from the preponderance of the false prophets ever the true, as if Jehovah were unaware of the mischief. Not so; Jehovah is omnipresent. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/23.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Warning against the lying prophecies of the prophets. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-16.htm">Jeremiah 23:16</a>. "Thus saith Jahveh of hosts: Hearken not unto the words of the prophets that prophesy unto you!

But if they had stood in my counsel, they would publish my words to my people and bring them back from their evil way and from the evil of their doings."<p>The warning against these prophets is founded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-16.htm">Jeremiah 23:16</a> on the fact that they give out the thoughts of their own hearts to be divine revelation, and promise peace and prosperity to all stiff-necked sinners. &#1502;&#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, lit., they make you vain, i.e., make you to yield yourselves to vain delusion, seduce you to false confidence. This they do by their speaking visions, i.e., revelations of their heart, not what God has spoken, revealed to them. As an illustration of this, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-17.htm">Jeremiah 23:17</a> tells that they prophesy continued peace or well-being to the despisers of God. The infin. abs. &#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1512; after the verb. fin. intimates the duration or repetition of the thing. &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; are words of the false prophets, with which they give out that their prophesyings are God's word. Since we nowhere else find sayings of Jahveh introduced by &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;, but usually by '&#1499;&#1468;&#1492; &#1488;&#1502;&#1512; &#1497;, the lxx have taken offence at that formula, and, reading &#1491;&#1489;&#1512;, join the words with &#1500;&#1502;&#1504;&#1488;&#1510;&#1497;: &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;. To this reading Hitz. and Gr. give the preference over the Masoretic; but they have not noticed that they thus get an unsuitable sense. For &#1491;&#1489;&#1512; &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; in prophetic language never denotes the Mosaic law or the "moral law" (Hitz.), but the word of God published by the prophets. By their view of "word of Jahveh" they would here obtain the self-inconsistent thought: to the despisers of divine revelation they proclaim as revelation. The Masoretic reading is clearly right; and Jeremiah chose the unusual introductory formula to distinguish the language of the pseudo-prophets from that of the true prophets of the Lord. &#1493;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1500;&#1498; &#1489;' is prefixed absolutely: and as concerning every one that walks...they say, for: and to every one...they say. On the "stubbornness of their heart," see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-17.htm">Jeremiah 3:17</a>. With the speech of the false prophets, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-13.htm">Jeremiah 14:13</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-14.htm">Jeremiah 6:14</a>. - In <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-18.htm">Jeremiah 23:18</a> a more comprehensive reason is given to show that these prophets are not publishing God's decrees. The question: Who hath stood? has negative force  equals  None hath stood. By this Jeremiah does not deny the possibility of this universally, but only of the false prophets (Hitz.). This limitation of the words is suggested by the context. To the true prophets the Lord reveals His &#1505;&#1493;&#1491;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>. &#1493;&#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506; are not to be taken jussively: let him see and hear (Hitz.), for the foregoing interrogation is not a conditional clause introducing a command. The imperfects with &#1493; are clauses of consequence or design, and after a preceding perfect should be rendered in English by the conditional of the pluperfect. Seeing the word of God refers to prophetic vision. The second question is appended without at all conveying any inference from what precedes; and in it the second verb (with &#1493; consec.) is simply a strengthening of the first: who hath hearkened to my word and heard it? The Masoretes have quite unnecessarily changed the Chet. &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497; .tehC  into &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1493;. In the graphic representation of the prophets, the transition to the direct speech of God, and conversely, is no unusual thing. The change of &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506; into &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;, unnecessary and even improper as it is, is preferred by Graf and Ng., inasmuch as they take the interrogative &#1502;&#1497; in both clauses in the sense of quisquis and understand the verse thus: He who has but stood in the counsel of the Lord, let him see and hear His word (i.e., he must see and hear His word); and he that hath marked my word, let him publish it (i.e., he must publish it). This exposition becomes only then necessary, if we leave the context out of view and regard the question as being to the effect that no one has stood in God's counsel - which Jeremiah could not mean. Not to speak of the change of the text necessary for carrying it through, this view does not even give a suitable sense. If the clause: He that has stood in the counsel of the Lord, he must proclaim His word, is to be regarded as having a demonstrative force, then the principal idea must be supplied, thus namely: "and it is impossible that it should be favourable to those who despise it." In <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-19.htm">Jeremiah 23:19</a> Jeremiah publishes a real word of the Lord, which sounds very differently from the words of the false prophets. A tempest from Jahveh will burst over the heads of the evil-doers, and the wrath of God will not cease until it has accomplished the divine decree. "A tempest from Jahveh" is defined by "fury" in apposition as being a manifestation of God's wrath; and the whole first clause is further expanded in the second part of the verse. The tempest from Jahveh goes forth, i.e., breaks out, and as whirling tornado or eddying whirlwind bursts over the head of the wicked. &#1497;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500; is to be taken in accordance with &#1502;&#1514;&#1495;&#1493;&#1500;&#1500;: twist, whirl, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-29.htm">2 Samuel 3:29</a>. "The thoughts of His heart" must not be limited to what God has decreed de interitu populi (Calv.); it comprehends God's whole redemptive plan in His people's regard-not merely the overthrow of the kingdom of Judah, but also the purification of the people by means of judgments and the final glorification of His kingdom. To this future the next clause points: at the end of the days ye shall have clear knowledge of this. "The end of the days" is not merely the completion of the period in which we now are (Hitz., Gr. Ng., etc.), but, as universally, the end of the times, i.e., the Messianic future, the last period of the world's history which opens at the close of the present aeon; see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-1.htm">Genesis 49:1</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/24-14.htm">Numbers 24:14</a>, etc. &#1492;&#1514;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1504;&#1503; is strengthened by &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492; yb dene: attain to insight, come to clearer knowledge.</body></html>
