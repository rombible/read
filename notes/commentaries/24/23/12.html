These false teachers would be compelled to suffer the most bitter part of the Lord's indignation. They made themselves believe that there was no harm in sin, and practised accordingly; then they made others believe so. Those who are resolved to go on in evil ways, will justly be given up to believe strong delusions. But which of them had received any revelation of God, or understood any thing of his word? There was a time coming when they would reflect on their folly and unbelief with remorse. The teaching and example of the true prophets led men to repentance, faith, and righteousness. The false prophets led men to rest in forms and notions, and to be quiet in their sins.

The passage has a manifest affinity with <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-6.htm">Psalm 35:6</a> (in one of the Jeremiahizing psalms; see on Jeremiah 18:19, 20). <span class="cmt_word">They shall be driven on</span>; or, as Ewald, taking over the last word of the preceding clause, <span class="accented">they shall be thrust into the darkness</span>.

If we ask who "thrusts" them, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-5.htm">Psalm 35:5</a> supplies the answer - it is not merely external circumstances, but "the Angel of Jehovah," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Jehovah himself.

Judah shall be blessed with welfare (&#1504;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;), and Israel dwell safely; that blessing will come into fulfilment which Moses set before the people's view in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-28.htm">Deuteronomy 33:28</a>. &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1492; as the totality of the inhabitants is construed as feminine, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-7.htm">Jeremiah 3:7</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-2.htm">Jeremiah 14:2</a>, etc. Israel denotes the ten tribes. Under the just sceptre of the Messiah, all Israel will reach the destiny designed for it by the Lord, will, as God's people, attain to full dignity and glory.<p>This is the name by which they shall call Him, the branch of David: Jahveh our Righteousness. The suffix in &#1497;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493; refers to "righteous branch." Instead of the 3 pers. sing. &#1497;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488; with the suffix &#1493;, some codd. have the plur. &#1497;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;. This some polemical authors, such as Raim., Martini, Galatin, hold to be the true reading; and they affirmed the other had proceeded from the Jews, with the design of explaining away the deity of the Messiah. The Jews translated, they said: This is the name whereby Jahveh will call him: Our Righteousness; which is indeed the rendering of R. Saad. Gaon apud Aben Ezra, and of Menasse ben Israel. But this rendering is rejected by most Jewish comm. as being at variance with the accents, so that the impugned reading could not well have been invented by the Jews for polemical purposes. &#1497;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493; is attested by most codd., and is rendered by the lxx, so that the sense can be none other than: they will call the righteous branch of David "Jahveh our Righteousness." Most comm., including even Hitz., admit that the suffix refers to &#1510;&#1502;&#1495;, the principal person in both verses. Only Ew., Graf, and Ng. seek to refer it to Israel, because in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-16.htm">Jeremiah 33:16</a> the same name is given to Jerusalem. But the passage cited does not prove the case. To call any one by a name universally denotes in the prophetic usage: to set him forth as that which the name expresses; so here: the branch of David will manifest Himself to the people of Israel as Jahve Tsidkenu. This name is variously expounded. The older Christian comm. understand that the Messiah is here called Jehovah, and must therefore be true God, and that He is called our righteousness, inasmuch as He justifies us by His merit.<p>(Note: Thus the Vulg. renders: Dominus justus noster; and even Calv. says: Quicunque sine contentione et amarulentia judicant, facile vident, idem nomen competer in Christum, quatenus est Deus, sicuti nomen filii Davidis respectu humanae naturae ei tribuitur. - Omnibus aequis et moderatis hoc constabit, Christum hic insigniri duplici elogio, ut in eo nobis commendet propheta tam deitatis gloriam, quam veritatem humanae naturae; and by the righteousness he understands justification by the merits of Christ.)<p>But the rabbinical interpreters, headed by the Chald., take the name to be an abbreviation of a sentence; so e.g., Kimchi: Israel vocabit Messiam hoc nomine, quia ejus temporibus Domini justitia nobis firma, jugis et non recedet. They appeal to <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-17.htm">Jeremiah 33:17</a> and to other passages, such as <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/17-15.htm">Exodus 17:15</a>, where Moses calls the altar "Jahveh my Banner," and <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/33-20.htm">Genesis 33:20</a>, where Jacob gives to the altar built by him the name El elohe Jisrael. Hgstb. has rightly pronounced for this interpretation. The passages cited show who in such names an entire sentence is conveyed. "Jahveh my Banner" is as much as to say: This altar is dedicated to Jahveh my banner, or to the Almighty, the God of Israel. So all names compounded of Jahveh; e.g., Jehoshua  equals  Jahveh salvation, brief for: he to whom Jahveh vouchsafes salvation. So Tsidkijahu  equals  Jahve's righteousness, for: he to whom Jahveh deals righteousness. To this corresponds Jahveh Tsidkenu: he by whom Jahveh deals righteousness. We are bound to take the name thus by the parallel passage, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-16.htm">Jeremiah 33:16</a>, where the same name is given to Jerusalem, to convey the thought, that by the Messiah the Lord will make Jerusalem the city of Righteousness, will give His righteousness to it, will adorn and glorify it therewith.<p>&#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; is not to be referred, as it is by the ancient Church comm., to justification through the forgiveness of sins. With this we have not here to do, but with personal righteousness, which consists in deliverance from all unrighteousness, and which is bound up with blessedness. Actual righteousness has indeed the forgiveness of sins for its foundation, and in this respect justification is not to be wholly excluded; but this latter is here subordinate to actual righteousness, which the Messiah secures for Israel by the righteousness of His reign. The unrighteousness of the former kings has brought Israel and Judah to corruption and ruin; the righteousness of the branch to be hereafter raised up to David will remove all the ruin and mischief from Judah, and procure for them the righteousness and blessedness which is of God. - "What Jeremiah," as is well remarked by Hgstb., "sums up in the name Jehovah Tsidkenu, Ezekiel expands at length in the parallel <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-25.htm">Ezekiel 34:25-31</a> : the Lord concludes with them a covenant of peace; rich blessings fall to their lot; He breaks their yoke, frees them from bondage; they do not become the heathen's prey." These divine blessings are also to be conferred upon the people by means of the righteous branch. What the ancient Church comm. found in the name was true as to the substance. For as no man is perfectly righteous, so no mere earthly king can impart to the people the righteousness of Jahveh in the full sense of the term; only He who is endowed with the righteousness of God. In so far the Godhead of this King is contained implicite in the name; only we must not understand that he that bore the name is called Jahveh. But that righteousness, as the sum of all blessing, is set before the people's view, we may gather from the context, especially from <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-7.htm">Jeremiah 23:7</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-8.htm">Jeremiah 23:8</a>, where it is said that the blessings to be conferred will outshine all former manifestations of God's grace. This is the sense of both verses, which, save in the matter of a trifling change in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-8.htm">Jeremiah 23:8</a>, are verbally repeated from <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-14.htm">Jeremiah 16:14</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-15.htm">Jeremiah 16:15</a>, where they have already been expounded.<p>(Note: The lxx have omitted both these verses here, and have placed them at the end of the chapter, after <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-40.htm">Jeremiah 23:40</a>; but by their contents they do not at all belong to that, whereas after <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-6.htm">Jeremiah 23:6</a> they are very much in place, as even Hitz. admits. In the text of the lxx handed down, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-6.htm">Jeremiah 23:6</a> ends with the words:  &#787;&#x399;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768;&#x3ba; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;; and  &#787;&#x399;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768;&#x3ba;  may be said to correspond to &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, and &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;  to &#1500;&#1504;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-9.htm">Jeremiah 23:9</a>. Hitz. and Gr. therefore infer that <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-7.htm">Jeremiah 23:7</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-8.htm">Jeremiah 23:8</a> were wanting also in the Heb. text used by the translator, and that they must have been added by way of supplement, most probably from another MS. This inference is thought to find support in the assumption that, because the Greek MSS have no point between  &#787;&#x399;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768;&#x3ba; and &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, therefore the Alexandrian translator must have joined these words together so as to make one - meaningless - sentence. A thoroughly uncritical conclusion, which could be defended only if the Alex. translators had punctuated their Greek text as we have it punctuated in our printed editions. And if a later reader of the lxx had added the verses from the Hebrew text, then he would certainly have intercalated them at the spot where they stood in the original, i.e., between <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-6.htm">Jeremiah 23:6</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-9.htm">Jeremiah 23:9</a>. Their displacement to a position after <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-40.htm">Jeremiah 23:40</a> is to be explained from the fact that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-14.htm">Jeremiah 16:14</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-15.htm">Jeremiah 16:15</a> they immediately follow a threatening: and is manifestly the work of the translator himself, who omitted them after <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-6.htm">Jeremiah 23:6</a>, understanding them as of threatening import, because a threatening seemed to him to be out of place after <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-6.htm">Jeremiah 23:6</a>.) </body></html>
