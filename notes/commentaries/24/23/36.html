If men continued to apply it to the words of their own heart, they would find it a “burden” in another sense (the prophet plays once more on the etymology of the word) too heavy to be borne. This would be the righteous punishment of the reckless levity with which they had treated the sacred Name which Jeremiah reproduces in all the amplitude of its grandeur. They had never realised the awfulness of speaking in the name “of the living God, the Lord of Sabaoth.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/jeremiah/23.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-36.htm" title="And the burden of the LORD shall you mention no more: for every man's word shall be his burden; for you have perverted the words of the living God, of the LORD of hosts our God.">Jeremiah 23:36</a></span>. <span class="ital">For every man’s word shall be his burden </span>— You shall be made severely to account for your loose and profane speeches, wherewith you deride and pervert the words and messages of God himself.

For the words of God were delivered with a salutary tendency, to warn sinners of the danger of their situation, and to call them to repentance. Those, therefore, who made a right use of them would have no cause to complain. But those who despised and rejected them perverted that which should have been for their wealth into an occasion of falling.” — Blaney.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/23.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>23:33-40 Those are miserable indeed who are forsaken and forgotten of God; and men's jesting at God's judgments will not baffle them.

The practice of these prophets is characterized in three ways, yet without marking out three classes of unworthy men. One habit of theirs is that of stealing the word of God one from another. Not inspired of God themselves, they tried to appropriate words of God from other prophets in order to give their own utterances the character of divine oracles. Another is: they take their tongues and say, God's word, i.e., they use their tongues to speak pretended words from God. The verb &#1497;&#1504;&#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468; occurs only here; elsewhere only the participle &#1504;&#1488;&#1501;, and that almost always joined with &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; in the sig. effatum Domini; here without it, but in the same sense. The root meaning of &#1504;&#1488;&#1501; is disputed. Connected etymologically with &#1504;&#1492;&#1501;, &#1492;&#1502;&#1492;, it doubtlessly denotes originally, that which is whispered, Jahveh's secret confidential communication; but it is constantly used, not for the word of God as silently inspired by God, but as softly uttered by the prophet. The meaning is not: their prophesying is "mere wagging of the tongue, talk according to their own caprice" (Graf); but: they give out their sayings for God's, whereas God speaks neither to nor by them. Finally, their third way of doing consists in feigning revelations by means of dreams, which are but deceptive dreams. At this point the discourse falls back on the description in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-26.htm">Jeremiah 23:26</a>. The words "and lead my people astray" refer to all their three ways of acting before characterized. &#1508;&#1468;&#1495;&#1494;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; is their boasting of revelations from God.
