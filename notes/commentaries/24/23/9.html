In the Hebrew order and punctuation of the words this is shown still more clearly—<span class= "ital">Concerning the prophets: My heart is broken within me</span>—the first words being the superscription and title of what follows. The four clauses describe the varied phenomena of horror and amazement, and then comes the cause of the horror—the contrast between the words of Jehovah and His holiness on the one side, and the wickedness of priests and prophets on the other. The whole section is the complement of that which denounced the wickedness of the pastors—<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>of the civil rulers—in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/23-1.htm" title="Woe be to the pastors that destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture! said the LORD.">Jeremiah 23:1-4</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/jeremiah/23.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-9.htm" title="My heart within me is broken because of the prophets; all my bones shake; I am like a drunken man, and like a man whom wine has overcome, because of the LORD, and because of the words of his holiness.">Jeremiah 23:9</a></span>. <span class="ital">My heart within me is broken </span>— This seems to be the beginning of a new discourse against the false prophets, with whom afterward the priests are joined. The first word of it in the Hebrew, <span class="greekheb">לנבאים</span>, is rendered by the Vulgate, <span class="ital">Ad prophetas, </span>To the prophets, as if it were the title of the following prophecy. In this Jeremiah describes the terror and concern which were upon him when he considered the horrible sin of these prophets in pretending a divine mission when they had received none, and in uttering as messages from God what were really their own inventions, and in direct opposition to every thing God had spoken. And he declares that, upon a view of their guilt, and of the evils they were bringing on themselves and their country, he was in trouble and agitation, like that of a man who had lost his reason through intoxication.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/23.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>23:9-22 The false prophets of Samaria had deluded the Israelites into idolatries; yet the Lord considered the false prophets of Jerusalem as guilty of more horrible wickedness, by which the people were made bold in sin. These false teachers would be compelled to suffer the most bitter part of the Lord's indignation. They made themselves believe that there was no harm in sin, and practised accordingly; then they made others believe so. Those who are resolved to go on in evil ways, will justly be given up to believe strong delusions. But which of them had received any revelation of God, or understood any thing of his word? There was a time coming when they would reflect on their folly and unbelief with remorse. The teaching and example of the true prophets led men to repentance, faith, and righteousness. The false prophets led men to rest in forms and notions, and to be quiet in their sins.

But Vulgate, Septuagint, &c., make this the inscription of the prophecy, Concerning the Prophets: as in Jer 46:2; 48:1; 49:1. Jeremiah expresses his horror at the so-called "prophets" not warning the people, though iniquity so fearfully abounded, soon to be followed by awful judgments.<p>bones shake&#8212;(Hab 3:16).<p>drunken&#8212;God's judgments are represented as stupefying like wine. The effects of the Holy Spirit also are compared to those of wine (Ac 2:17). In both cases ecstasy was produced. This accounts for the denial of wine to those likely to be inspired, Nazarites, &c. (Lu 1:15). It was necessary to put it out of men's power to ascribe inspired ecstasy to the effects of wine.<p>because of &#8230; words of &#8230; holiness&#8212;because of Jehovah's holy words, wherewith He threatened severe penalties, soon to be inflicted, against the breakers of His law.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/23.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The prophet having denounced the wrath of God against the wicked rulers of Judah under the notion of pastors, cometh here to discharge the like trust with reference to those orders of persons amongst the Jews, whose office it was, or at least who took upon them, to reveal the mind and will of God to people, and who were upon that account called <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">prophets:</span> for these he declares a great passion and trouble; either for their sake, in prospect of that vengeance of God which he saw was like to be poured out upon them; or for the people’s sake, who had been deceived by their unfaithful revelations of the Divine will, and led into wickedness by their vile examples. For this he saith his <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">heart</span> was broken, his bones shaked. And he was even astonished and stupified, and like a drunken man he knew not what he did; he was so stricken at the apprehensions of the wrath of the Lord ready to be revealed against them; and to consider what words the holy God had put into his mouth to speak against them. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/23.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Mine heart within me is broken because of the prophets,.... The false prophets, as the Targum rightly interprets it. The Vulgate Latin version renders it, "to the prophets"; and makes a stop there; which agrees with the original (l); so that it may be considered as the title of what follows; it being directed to them by the prophet, to let them know his concern for them; to expose their sin, and reclaim them; who was so affected with their case, that his "heart" within him was "broken" with grief and sorrow, because of their false doctrines and wicked lives; and because of the mischief they did the people, and the ruin they brought upon them, and themselves also: <p>all my bones shake; with dread and horror at the iniquities committed and the judgments approaching. The word, as Jarchi says, signifies such a fluttering motion as is made by the wings of a bird hovering over its nest. The same word is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a>; which Ben Melech refers to here. The prophet shuddered at their dreadful impiety, and at the thoughts of what was coming upon them on that account: <p>I am like a drunken man; that can neither speak nor stand; that knows not what to say, or which way to go; so confused and astonished was the prophet at what he saw was doing by them, and was likely to befall them: <p>and like a man whom wine hath overcome; or, "has passed over" (m); like waves and billows, so that he is drowned in it, and mastered by it: <p>because of the Lord, and because of the words of his holiness: because of the dishonour done to his holy name, and holy truths; because of the profanation of both in the mouths of these false prophets; they pretending to come in the name of the Lord, and to speak his words; and because of the dreadful judgments which he, the prophet, was sent to denounce against them from the Lord. <p>(l) "ad prophetas", V.

Condemnation of the prophets<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Following on the prophecies relating to successive kings of Judah, we have a section dealing with the iniquities of a class who also grievously misled the nation. The passage doubtless contains much that is genuine, but, from the diffuseness of style, especially in the latter part, it may be safely inferred that additional matter has been inserted. Commentators, however, are by no means agreed as to the amount of the latter. Du. omits all after <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-15.htm" title="Therefore thus said the LORD of hosts concerning the prophets; Behold, I will feed them with wormwood, and make them drink the water of gall: for from the prophets of Jerusalem is profaneness gone forth into all the land.">Jeremiah 23:15</a></span>, Co. nearly all after <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-24.htm" title="Can any hide himself in secret places that I shall not see him? said the LORD.

Elsewhere metre is for the most part irregular or absent. The collection of utterances, so far as genuine, may have probably belonged to the last part of Zedekiah’s reign.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The section may be thus subdivided. (i) <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/23-9.htm" title="My heart within me is broken because of the prophets; all my bones shake; I am like a drunken man, and like a man whom wine has overcome, because of the LORD, and because of the words of his holiness....">Jeremiah 23:9-15</a></span>. Jeremiah is undone and nerveless because of the Lord’s message to a land whose profligacy has brought on it a curse. The Temple itself is polluted by the iniquities of prophets and priests. They shall be as men driven in the dark along slippery ways till they fall. The prophets of Samaria led the people astray by alleged prophecies of their false deity, while the prophets of Jerusalem shock Jehovah still more by immorality, lying, and the encouragement of others in permanent evil-doing. They have reached the infamy of the cities of the plain. They have infected all the land; therefore shall wormwood and gall be their food. (ii) <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/23-16.htm" title="Thus said the LORD of hosts, Listen not to the words of the prophets that prophesy to you: they make you vain: they speak a vision of their own heart, and not out of the mouth of the LORD....">Jeremiah 23:16-18</a></span>. It is from the prophets’ own imaginations and not from Jehovah that their pleasing promises of immunity from evil come. Who is there who has visited His heavenly abode, there to learn His purposes? (iii) <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/23-19.htm" title="Behold, a whirlwind of the LORD is gone forth in fury, even a grievous whirlwind: it shall fall grievously on the head of the wicked....">Jeremiah 23:19-20</a></span>. Jehovah’s wrath shall break, like a storm, on the head of the wicked, and shall not be recalled till His purpose is fully achieved. (iv) <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/23-21.htm" title="I have not sent these prophets, yet they ran: I have not spoken to them, yet they prophesied....">Jeremiah 23:21-24</a></span>. Those prophets were not commissioned nor inspired by the Lord; else they would have delivered His rebuke of the people’s sins. He is omnipresent. They cannot escape His observation. (v) <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/23-25.htm" title="I have heard what the prophets said, that prophesy lies in my name, saying, I have dreamed, I have dreamed....">Jeremiah 23:25-29</a></span>. How long shall they adduce dreams, dreams forsooth, in support of their lying predictions, making the real character of Jehovah to be forgotten by the people, even as their fathers thought of Him as though He were no better than one of the Baals? Let the dream be told, and let Jehovah’s message be told as well; but let the utterances which embody the two be sharply distinguished, as stubble from wheat. Jehovah’s word is as fire, and as a hammer which breaketh the rocks. (vi) <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/23-30.htm" title="Therefore, behold, I am against the prophets, said the LORD, that steal my words every one from his neighbor....">Jeremiah 23:30-32</a></span>. He is against the prophets who steal their announcements from the true prophets, and with ready tongue claim that they are from Him, who lead His people astray with delusive dreams and claims to Divine authority. They have not His commission, and so are without value. (vii) <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/23-33.htm" title="And when this people, or the prophet, or a priest, shall ask you, saying, What is the burden of the LORD? you shall then say to them, What burden? I will even forsake you, said the LORD....">Jeremiah 23:33-40</a></span>. When asked, What is the Lord’s burden, Jeremiah will answer, It is ye, and He will rid Himself of you as such. All who use the word “burden” shall be punished. The message shall be expressed in the simplest language, and your use of the word “burden” shall recoil upon yourselves. If ye nevertheless persist in its use, ye shall be banished for ever in disgrace from this ancestral city and from Jehovah’s presence.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9-40.</span> - These verses form a complete prophecy, the title of which Jeremiah himself supplies in the words, "Concerning the (false) prophets" (see below); comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-2.htm">Jeremiah 46:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-1.htm">Jeremiah 48:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-1.htm">Jeremiah 49:1, 7, 23, 28</a>.

But it is not probable that two entirely different causes should be given for the prophet's deep emotion (see the latter part of the verse). Besides, "breaking of the heart" is nowhere a sign of anger (as Authorized Version would suggest), but either of grief (see on Jeremiah 8:20, or, as the context implies here, physical disturbance at the solemn message of Jehovah (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-11.htm">Jeremiah 6:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-9.htm">Jeremiah 20:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">All my bones shake</span>.

But: By the life of Jahveh who brought up and led forth the seed of the house of Israel out of the land towards midnight, and out of all the lands whither I had driven them, and they shall dwell in their own land."<p>This portion is the conclusion of the prophecy concerning the shepherds of Israel, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22.htm">Jeremiah 22</a>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-1.htm">Jeremiah 23:1</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-2.htm">Jeremiah 23:2</a> what has been foretold concerning the last kings of Judah is condensed into one general sentence, so as thus to form a point of connection for the declaration of salvation which follows at <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-3.htm">Jeremiah 23:3</a>, consisting in the gathering again of the people, neglected and scattered by the evil shepherds, by means of the righteous branch of David. The Lord cries woe upon the shepherds. &#1512;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; without article, because the matter concerns all evil shepherds, and is not applied till <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-2.htm">Jeremiah 23:2</a> to the evil rulers of Judah. Venema rightly says: Generale vae pastoribus malis praemittitur, quod mox ad pastores Judae applicatur. It is so clear from the context as to have been generally admitted by recent comm., that by shepherds are meant not merely the false prophets and priests, nor even these along with the kings; cf. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-15.htm">Jeremiah 3:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-34.htm">Jeremiah 25:34</a>., and <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34.htm">Ezekiel 34</a>. The flock of my pasturing, in other words, the flock, which I feed; for &#1502;&#1512;&#1506;&#1497;&#1514; sig. both the feeding (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/13-6.htm">Hosea 13:6</a>) and the place where the flock feeds, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-36.htm">Jeremiah 25:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/74-1.htm">Psalm 74:1</a>. Israel is called the flock of Jahveh's pasturing inasmuch as He exerts a special care over it. The flock bad shepherds, the ungodly monarchs on the throne of David, have brought to ruin and scattered. The scattering is in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-2.htm">Jeremiah 23:2</a>, cf. with <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-3.htm">Jeremiah 23:3</a>, called a driving out into the lands; but the "destroying" must be discovered from the train of thought, for the clause: ye have not visited them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-2.htm">Jeremiah 23:2</a>), intimates merely their neglect of the sheep committed to their charge. What the "destroying" more especially is, we may gather from the conduct of King Jehoiakim, described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-13.htm">Jeremiah 22:13</a>.; it consists in oppression, violence, and the shedding of innocent blood; cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-2.htm">Ezekiel 34:2-3</a>. With &#1500;&#1499;&#1503;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-2.htm">Jeremiah 23:2</a>, is made the application of the general sentence, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-1.htm">Jeremiah 23:1</a>, to the shepherds of Israel. Because they are such as have scattered, driven away, and not visited the flock of the Lord, therefore He will punish in them the wickedness of their doings. In the &#1500;&#1488; &#1508;&#1511;&#1491;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501; &#1488;&#1514;&#1501; is summed up all that the rulers have omitted to do for the flock committed to their care; cf. the specification of what they have not done, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-4.htm">Ezekiel 34:4</a>. It was their duty, as Ven. truly says, to see ut vera religio, pabulum populi spiritual, recte et rite exerceretur. Instead of this, they have, by introducing idolatry, directly encouraged ungodliness, and the immorality which flows therefrom. Here in "ye have not visited them" we have the negative moment made prominent, so that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-3.htm">Jeremiah 23:3</a> may follow what the Lord will do for His scattered flock. Cf. the further expansion of this promise in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-12.htm">Ezekiel 34:12</a>. We must note "I have driven them," since in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-2.htm">Jeremiah 23:2</a> it was said that the bad shepherds had driven the flock away. The one does not exclude the other. By their corrupting the people, the wicked shepherds had occasioned the driving out; and this God has inflicted on the people as punishment. But the people, too, had their share in the guilt; but to this attention is not here directed, since the question deals only with the shepherds. </body></html>
