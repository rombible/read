In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-22.htm" title="And Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, was for song: he instructed about the song, because he was skillful.">1Chronicles 15:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-27.htm" title="And David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, and all the Levites that bore the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah the master of the song with the singers: David also had on him an ephod of linen.">1Chronicles 15:27</a> it is applied to the chanted music of the Temple. Isaiah had brought it into use (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-1.htm" title="The burden of Babylon, which Isaiah the son of Amoz did see.">Isaiah 13:1</a>), and employs it twelve times as the title of special prophecies. Jeremiah never uses it of his own messages, probably, as this verse indicates, because it had become a favourite formula with the false prophets. This seems a more rational view than that which assumes that the false prophets applied the words in mockery to his utterances as being “burdens” in the ordinary sense of the word, oppressive and intolerable.<p><span class= "bld">What burden?</span>—The false prophets had come, not without a supercilious scorn, asking, with affected grandeur, what burden, what oracle Jeremiah had from Jehovah. He repeats their question with a deeper scorn, and tells them that for them the “burden” tells of exile and shame. A different division of the words of the prophet’s answer (which presents some exceptional grammatical difficulties) gives a rendering adopted by the LXX. and Vulgate, “Ye are the burden”—<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>it is about you and for you.<p><span class= "bld">I will even forsake you.</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">I will cast you off, </span>with a play upon the literal sense of the word “burden.” They have made themselves too grievous to be borne.

The prophets were accustomed to apply the term <span class="accented">massa</span> to their prophetic declarations in the sense of "oracle," or "utterance" - a sense derived from the use of the cognate verb for "to lift up the voice," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to pronounce clearly and distinctly. But the word <span class="accented">massa</span> was also in common use for "load, burden," and hence the "false prophets" applied the term derisively to Jeremiah's discourses. "Rightly does he call his word a <span class="accented">massa</span>; it is not merely a solemn utterance, but a heavy burden; as De Wette puts it, not merely a <span class="accented">Weissagung</span>, but a <span class="accented">Wehsagung</span>. The passage is important as indicating the sense in which the true prophets understood the term. It should be added that the term mused is prefixed to at least four Biblical passages which, not being of threatening import, do not admit of being entitled "burdens" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/9-1.htm">Zechariah 9:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-1.htm">Zechariah 12:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-1.htm">Proverbs 30:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-1.htm">Proverbs 31:1</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-14.htm">Lamentations 2:14</a>). How remarkable is the line adopted by <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1.htm">Jeremiah 1</a> He simply abandons the use Of the term <span class="accented">massa</span>, consecrated as it was by the practice of inspired men!

It is just possible to explain, with Ewald, "As to this question, What is the burden? the true meaning of the word is that," etc. But how harsh and artificial!

Behold, I am against the prophets that prophesy lying dreams, saith Jahve, and tell them, and lead my people astray with their lies and their boasting, whom yet I have not sent nor commanded them, and they bring no good to this people, saith Jahveh."<p>The force of the question: Am I a God at hand, not afar off? is seen from what follows. Far and near are here in their local, not their temporal signification. A god near at hand is one whose domain and whose knowledge do not extend far; a God afar off, one who sees and works into the far distance. The question, which has an affirmative force, is explained by the statement of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-24.htm">Jeremiah 23:24</a> : I fill heaven and earth. Hitz. insists on understanding "near at hand" of temporal nearness, after <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-17.htm">Deuteronomy 32:17</a> : a God who is not far hence, a newly appeared God; and he supposes that, since in the east, from of old, knowledge is that which is known by experience, therefore the greatness of one's knowledge depends on one's advancement in years (<a href="http://biblehub.com/job/15-7.htm">Job 15:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-10.htm">Job 15:10</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/12-12.htm">Job 12:12</a>, etc.); and God, he says, is the Ancient of days, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-9.htm">Daniel 7:9</a>. But this line of thought is wholly foreign to the present passage. It is not wealth of knowledge as the result of long life or old age that God claims for Himself in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-24.htm">Jeremiah 23:24</a>, but the power of seeing into that which is hidden so that none can conceal himself from Him, or omniscience. The design with which God here dwells on His omniscience and omnipresence too (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-27.htm">1 Kings 8:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-1.htm">Isaiah 66:1</a>) is shown in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-25.htm">Jeremiah 23:25</a>. The false prophets went so far with their lying predictions, that it might appear as if God did not hear or see their words and deeds. The Lord exposes this delusion by calling His omniscience to mind in the words: I have heard how they prophesy falsehood in my name and say, I have dreamed, i.e., a dream sent by God, have had a revelation in dreams, whereas according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-26.htm">Jeremiah 23:26</a> the dream was the deceit of their heart - "spun out of their own heart" (Hitz.). <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-26.htm">Jeremiah 23:26</a> is variously interpreted. Hitz. supposes that the interrogative &#1492; (in &#1492;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;) is made subordinate in the clause, and that the question is expressed with a double interrogative. He translates: How long still is there anything left in the heart of the prophets? as much as to say: how long have they materials for this? But there is a total want of illustrations in point for this subordination and doubling of the interrogative; and the force given to the &#1497;&#1513;&#1473; is quite arbitrary, since we should have had some intimation of what it was that was present in their hearts. Even the repetition of the interrogative particles is unexplained, and the connecting of &#1497;&#1513;&#1473; with a participle, instead of with the infinitive with &#1500;, cannot be defended by means of passages where &#1492;&#1495;&#1500; is joined with an adjective and the idea "to be" has to be supplied. L. de Dieu, followed by Seb. Schmidt, Chr. B. Mich., Ros., Maur., Umbr., Graf, was right in taking "How long" by itself as an aposiopesis: how long, sc. shall this go on? and in beginning a new question with &#1492;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, a question continued and completed by the further question: "Do they think," etc., <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-27.htm">Jeremiah 23:27</a>. Is it in the heart of the prophets, i.e., have the prophets a mind to prophesy falsehood? do they mean to make men forget my name? Against holding <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-27.htm">Jeremiah 23:27</a> as a resumption of the question there is no well-founded objection. Ng. affirms that after &#1492;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501; we must in that case have here &#1492;&#1501; as recapitulation of the subject; but that is rendered unnecessary by the subject's being contained in the immediately preceding words. The conjecture propounded by Ng., to change &#1492;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; into &#1492;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;: how long still is the fire in the heart of the prophets? needs no refutation. To make to forget the name of the Lord is: so to banish the Lord, as seen in His government and works, from the people's heart, that He is no longer feared and honoured. By their dreams which they relate one to the other, i.e., not one prophet to the other, but the prophet to his fellow-man amongst the people. &#1489;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;, because of the Baal, whom their fathers made their god, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-7.htm">Judges 3:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-9.htm">1 Samuel 12:9</a>. - These lies the prophets ought to cease. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-28.htm">Jeremiah 23:28</a>. Each is to speak what he has, what is given him. He that has a dream is to tell the dream, and he that has God's word should tell it. Dream as opposed to word of the Lord is an ordinary dream, the fiction of one's own heart; not a dream-revelation given by God, which the pseudo-prophets represented their dreams to be. These dreams are as different from God's word as straw is from corn. This clause is supported, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-29.htm">Jeremiah 23:29</a>, by a statement of the nature of God's word. It is thus (&#1499;&#1468;&#1492;), namely, as fire and as a hammer that smashes the rocks. The sense of these words is not this: the word of God is strong enough by itself, needs no human addition, or: it will burn as fire the straw of the man's word mixed with it. There is here no question of the mixing of God's word with man's word. The false prophets did not mingle the two, but gave out their man's word for God's. Nor, by laying stress on the indwelling power of the word of God, does Jeremiah merely give his hearers a characteristic by which they may distinguish genuine prophecy; he seeks besides to make them know that the word of the Lord which he proclaims will make an end of the lying prophets' work. Thus understood, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-29.htm">Jeremiah 23:29</a> forms a stepping-stone to the threatenings uttered in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-30.htm">Jeremiah 23:30-32</a> against the lying prophets. The comparison to fire does not refer to the reflex influence which the word exerts on the speaker, so as that we should with Rashi and Ros. cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-9.htm">Jeremiah 20:9</a>; the fire comes before us as that which consumes all man's work that will not stand the test; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-12.htm">1 Corinthians 3:12</a>. The comparison to a hammer which smashes the rock shows the power of God, which overcomes all that is earthly, even what is firmest and hardest; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>. Its effect and accomplishment nothing can hinder.</body></html>
