Here is a word of comfort to the neglected sheep. Though only a remnant of God's flock is left, he will find them out, and they shall be brought to their former habitations. Christ is spoken of as a branch from David's family. He is righteous himself, and through him all his people are made righteous. Christ shall break the usurped power of Satan. All the spiritual seed of believing Abraham and praying Jacob shall be protected, and shall be saved from the guilt and dominion of sin. In the days of Christ's government in the soul, the soul dwells at ease. He is here spoken of as the Lord our Righteousness. He is so our Righteousness as no creature could be. His obedience unto death is the justifying righteousness of believers, and their title to heavenly happiness. And their sanctification, as the source of all their personal obedience is the effect of their union with him, and of the supply of this Spirit. By this name every true believer shall call him, and call upon him. We have nothing to plead but this, Christ has died, yea, rather is risen again; and we have taken him for our Lord. This righteousness which he has wrought out to the satisfaction of law and justice, becomes ours; being a free gift given to us, through the Spirit of God, who puts it upon us, clothes us with it, enables us to lay hold upon it, and claim an interest in it. The Lord our Righteousness is a sweet name to a convinced sinner; to one that has felt the guilt of sin in his conscience; seen his need of that righteousness, and the worth of it. This great salvation is far more glorious than all former deliverances of his church. May our souls be gathered to Him, and be found in him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>While there is no promise of restoration for the kings, there is for the people (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-27.htm">Jeremiah 4:27</a>), because they had been led astray by their rulers.<p>Have driven them - The evil shepherds drove the people into exile by leading them into sin: and God by inflicting punishment.<p>Their folds - Or, their pastures. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/23.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3, 4.

The names Jeconjahu and abbreviated Jeconjah are equivalent to Jojachin and Jehojachin, i.e., Jahveh will establish. Jeconjah was doubtless his original name, and so stands in the family register, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-16.htm">1 Chronicles 3:16</a>, but was at his accession to the throne changed into Jehojachin or Jojachin, to make it liker his father's name. The abbreviation of Jeconjahu into Conjahu is held by Hgstb. Christol. ii. p. 402, to be a change made by Jeremiah in order by cutting off the y (will establish) to cut off the hope expressed by the name, to make "a Jeconiah without the J, a 'God will establish' without the will." For two reasons we cannot adopt this as the true view: 1. The general reason, that if Jeremiah had wished to adumbrate the fate of the three kings (Jehoahaz, Jehoiakim, and Jehoiachin) by making changes in their names, he would then have changed the name of Jehoiakim in like manner as he did that of Jehoahaz into Shallum, and that of Jehoiachin into Conjahu. The argument by which Hgstb. seeks to justify the exception in the one case will not hold its own. Had Jeremiah thought it unseemly to practise a kind of conceit, for however solemn a purpose, on the name of the then reigning monarch, then neither could he have ventured on the like in the case of Jehoiachin; for the present prediction was not, as Hgstb. assumed, uttered before his accession, but, as may be seen from the title king of Judah, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-24.htm">Jeremiah 22:24</a>, after he had ascended the throne, was actually king. Besides. 2. the name Conjahu occurs also at <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-1.htm">Jeremiah 37:1</a>, in a historical heading, as of equal dignity with Jeconjahu, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-2.htm">Jeremiah 29:2</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/28-4.htm">Jeremiah 28:4</a>, etc., where a name proper only to prophetic discourse would not have been in place. The passages in which the prophets express the character and destiny of a person in a name specially formed for the purpose, are of another kind. There we have always: they shall call his name, or: his name shall be; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-16.htm">Jeremiah 33:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-5.htm">Isaiah 9:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/62-4.htm">Isaiah 62:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-35.htm">Ezekiel 48:35</a>. That the name Jeconjah has not merely the prophet's authority, is vouched for by <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-15.htm">1 Chronicles 3:15</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/2-6.htm">Esther 2:6</a>, and by the historical notices, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-1.htm">Jeremiah 24:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-20.htm">Jeremiah 27:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/28-4.htm">Jeremiah 28:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-2.htm">Jeremiah 29:2</a>. And the occurrence of the name Jojachin only in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/24.htm">2 Kings 24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-1.htm">2 Chronicles 36:1</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-31.htm">Jeremiah 52:31</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-2.htm">Ezekiel 1:2</a> is in consequence of the original documents used by the authors of these books, where, so to speak, the official names were made use of; whereas Jeremiah preferred the proper, original name which the man bore as the prince-royal and son of Jehoiakim, and which was therefore the current and best known one.<p>The utterance concerning Jechoniah is more distinct and decided than that concerning Jehoiakim. With a solemn oath the Lord not only causes to be made known to him that he is to be cast off and taken into exile, but further, that his descendants are debarred from the throne for ever. Nothing is said of his own conduct towards the Lord. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-9.htm">2 Kings 24:9</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-9.htm">2 Chronicles 36:9</a> it is said of him that he did that which was displeasing to the Lord, even as his father had done. Ezekiel confirms this sentence when in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/19-5.htm">Ezekiel 19:5-9</a> he portrays him as a young lion that devoured men, forced widows, and laid cities waste. The words of Jahveh: Although Conjahu were a signet ring on my right hand, convey no judgment as to his character, but simply mean: Although he were as precious a jewel in the Lord's eyes as a signet ring (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/2-23.htm">Haggai 2:23</a>), the Lord would nevertheless cast him away. &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; before &#1488;&#1501; introduces the body of the oath, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-5.htm">Jeremiah 22:5</a>, and is for rhetorical effect repeated before the apodosis, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-9.htm">2 Samuel 3:9</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-27.htm">2 Samuel 2:27</a>, etc. Although he were, sc. what he is not; not: although he is (Graf); for there is no proof for the remark: that as being the prince set by Jahveh over His people, he has really as close a connection with Him. Hitz.'s explanation is also erroneous: "even if, seeking help, he were to cling so closely to me as a ring does to the finger." A most unnatural figure, not supported by reference to Sol 8:6. As to &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1504;&#1498;&#1468;, from &#1504;&#1514;&#1511; with &#1503; epenth., cf. Ew. 250, b. - From <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-25.htm">Jeremiah 22:25</a> on, the discourse is addressed directly to Jechoniah, to make his rejection known to him. God will deliver him into the hand of his enemies, whom he fears, namely, into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar and the Chaldeans, and cast him with his mother into a strange land, where he shall die. The mother was called Nehushta, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-8.htm">2 Kings 24:8</a>, and is brought forward in 29:2 as &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1512;&#1492;. On the fulfilment of this threatening, see <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-12.htm">2 Kings 24:12</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-15.htm">2 Kings 24:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-1.htm">Jeremiah 24:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-2.htm">Jeremiah 29:2</a>. The construction &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509;  is like that of &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1508;&#1503; &#1504;&#1499;&#1512;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-21.htm">Jeremiah 2:21</a>; and the absence of the article from &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1514; is no sufficient reason for holding it to be a gloss (Hitz.), or for taking the article in &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; to be a slip caused by &#1506;&#1500; &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-27.htm">Jeremiah 22:27</a>. To lift up their souls, i.e., to direct their longings, wishes, towards a thing, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-15.htm">Deuteronomy 24:15</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/4-8.htm">Hosea 4:8</a>, etc. - The further sentence on Jechoniah was not pronounced after he had been carried captive, as Ng. infers from the perfects &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1496;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468; and &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;. The perfects are prophetic. The question: Is this man a vessel despised and to be broken (&#1506;&#1510;&#1489;, vas fictile)? is an expression of sympathising regret on the part of the prophet for the unhappy fate of the king; but we may not hence conclude that Jeremiah regarded him as better than his father. The prophet's sympathy for his fate regarded less the person of the unfortunate king than it did the fortunes of David's royal seed, in that, of Jechoniah's sons, none was to sit on the throne of David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-30.htm">Jeremiah 22:30</a>). Ew. has excellently paraphrased the sense: "Although there is many a sympathising heart in the land that bitterly laments the hard fate of the dear young king, who along with his infant children has been (? will be) dragged away, yet it is God's unchangeable decree that neither he nor any of his sons shall ascend the throne of David." &#1504;&#1508;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509;, not: broken, but: that shall be broken (cf. Ew. 335, b). Wherefore are they - he and his seed - cast out? At his accession Jehoiachin was eighteen years old, not eight, as by an error stands in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-9.htm">2 Chronicles 36:9</a>, see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-8.htm">2 Kings 24:8</a>; so that when taken captive, he might well enough have children, or at least one son, since his wives are expressly mentioned in the account of the captivity, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-15.htm">2 Kings 24:15</a>. That the sons mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-16.htm">1 Chronicles 3:16</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-17.htm">1 Chronicles 3:17</a> were born to him in exile, cannot be inferred from that passage, rightly understood, see on that passage. The fact that no sons are mentioned in connection with the carrying captive is simply explained by the fact that they were still infants. </body></html>
