It must be our confession, the language of our convictions. Here is Daniel's humble, serious, devout address to God; in which he gives glory to him as a God to be feared, and as a God to be trusted. We should, in prayer, look both at God's greatness and his goodness, his majesty and mercy. Here is a penitent confession of sin, the cause of the troubles the people for so many years groaned under. All who would find mercy must thus confess their sins. Here is a self-abasing acknowledgment of the righteousness of God; and it is evermore the way of true penitents thus to justify God. Afflictions are sent to bring men to turn from their sins, and to understand God's truth. Here is a believing appeal to the mercy of God. It is a comfort that God has been always ready to pardon sin. It is encouraging to recollect that mercies belong to God, as it is convincing and humbling to recollect that righteousness belongs to him. There are abundant mercies in God, not only forgiveness, but forgivenesses. Here are pleaded the reproach God's people was under, and the ruins God's sanctuary was in. Sin is a reproach to any people, especially to God's people. The desolations of the sanctuary are grief to all the saints. Here is an earnest request to God to restore the poor captive Jews to their former enjoyments. O Lord, hearken and do. Not hearken and speak only, but hearken and do; do that for us which none else can do; and defer not. Here are several pleas and arguments to enforce the petitions. Do it for the Lord Christ's sake; Christ is the Lord of all. And for his sake God causes his face to shine upon sinners when they repent, and turn to him. In all our prayers this must be our plea, we must make mention of his righteousness, even of his only. The humble, fervent, believing earnestness of this prayer should ever be followed by us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/daniel/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Neither have we obeyed the voice of the Lord - The commands of God as made known by the prophets, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-6.htm">Daniel 9:6</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/daniel/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. set before us&#8212;not ambiguously, but plainly, so that we were without excuse.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/daniel/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> To be large in, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

"A watcher and an holy one came down from heaven." &#1493;&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; with the explic. ,&#1493; even, and that too, brings it before us in a very expressive way that the &#1506;&#1497;&#1512; was an "holy one." &#1506;&#1497;&#1512; is not to be combined with &#1510;&#1497;&#1512;, a messenger, but is derived from &#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, to watch, and corresponds with the Hebr. &#1506;&#1512;, Sol 5:2; <a href="http://biblehub.com/malachi/2-12.htm">Malachi 2:12</a>, and signifies not keeping watch, but being watchful, one who is awake, as the scholium to the &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1; of Theodotion in the Cod. Alex. explains it: &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;. Similarly Jerome remarks: "significat angelos, quod semper vigilent et ad Dei imperium sint parati." From this place is derived the name of &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; for the higher angels, who watch and slumber not, which is found in the book of Enoch and in other apocryphal writings, where it is used of good and of bad angels or demons. The designation of the angel as &#1506;&#1497;&#1512; is peculiar to this passage in the O.T. This gives countenance to the conjecture that it is a word associated with the Chaldee doctrine of the gods. Kliefoth quite justly, indeed, remarks, that this designation does not come merely from the lips of Nebuchadnezzar, but is uttered also by the holy watcher himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-14.htm">Daniel 4:14</a>), as well as by Daniel; and he draws thence the conclusion, that obviously the holy watcher himself used this expression first of himself and the whole council of his companions, that Nebuchadnezzar used the same expression after him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-10.htm">Daniel 4:10</a>), and that Daniel again adopted it from Nebuchadnezzar. Thence it follows that by the word angel we are not to understand a heathen deity; for as certainly as, according to this narrative, the dream was given to Nebuchadnezzar by God, so certainly was it a messenger of God who brought it. But from this it is not to be concluded that the name accords with the religious conceptions of Nebuchadnezzar and of the Babylonians. Regarding the Babylonian gods Diod. Sic. ii. 30, says: "Under the five planets ( equals  gods) are ranked thirty others whom they call the counselling gods (&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;), the half of whom have the oversight of the regions under the earth, and the other half oversee that which goes on on the earth, and among men, and in heaven. Every ten days one of these is sent as a messenger of the stars from the upper to the lower, and at the same time also one from the lower to the upper regions."<p>If, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/4-14.htm">Daniel 4:14</a>, the &#1506;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1503; constitute a deliberative council forming a resolution regarding the fate of men, and then one of these &#1506;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1503; comes down and makes known the resolution to the king, the conclusion is tenable that the &#1506;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1503; correspond to the &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; of the Babylonians. The divine inspiration of the dream corresponds with this idea. The correct thought lay at the foundation of the Chaldean representation of the &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;, that the relation of God to the world was mediate through the instrumentality of heavenly beings. The biblical revelation recognises these mediating beings, and calls them messengers of God, or angels and holy ones. Yea, the Scripture speaks of the assembling of angels before the throne of God, in which assemblies God forms resolutions regarding the fate of men which the angels carry into execution; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-6.htm">Job 1:6</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-19.htm">1 Kings 22:19</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-8.htm">Psalm 89:8</a> (7). Accordingly, if Nebuchadnezzar's dream came from God, we can regard the &#1506;&#1497;&#1512; as an angel of God who belonged to the &#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; &#1505;&#1493;&#1491; around the throne of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-8.htm">Psalm 89:8</a>). But this angel announced himself to the Chaldean king not as a messenger of the most high God, not as an angel in the sense of Scripture, but he speaks (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-14.htm">Psalm 89:14</a>) of &#1506;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1503; &#1490;&#1468;&#1494;&#1512;&#1514;, of a resolution of the watchers, a fatum of the &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; who have the oversight of this world. The conception &#1506;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1503; &#1490;&#1468;&#1494;&#1512;&#1514; is not biblical, but Babylonian heathen. According to the doctrine of Scripture, the angels do not determine the fate of men, but God alone does, around whom the angels stand as ministering spirits to fulfil His commands and make known His counsel to men. The angel designates to the Babylonian king the divine resolution regarding that judgment which would fall upon him from God to humble him for his pride as "the resolution of the watchers," that it might be announced to him in the way most easily understood by him as a divine judgment. On the other hand, one may not object that a messenger of God cannot give himself the name of a heathen deity, and that if Nebuchadnezzar had through misunderstanding given to the bringer of the dream the name of one of his heathen gods, Daniel ought, in interpreting the dream, to have corrected the misunderstanding, as Klief. says. For the messenger of God obviated this misunderstanding by the explanation that the matter was a decree of the watchers, to acknowledge the living God, that the Most High rules over the kingdom of men and gives it to whomsoever He will (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-17.htm">Daniel 4:17</a>), whereby he distinctly enough announces himself as a messenger of the Most High, i.e., of the living God. To go yet further, and to instruct the king that his religious conceptions of the gods, the &#1506;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1503;, or &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;, were erroneous, inasmuch as, besides the Highest, the only God, there are no other gods, but only angels, who are no &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;, but creatures of God, was not at all necessary fore the purpose of his message. This purpose was only to lead Nebuchadnezzar to an acknowledgment of the Most High, i.e., to an acknowledgment that the Most High rules as King of heaven over the kingdom of men. Now, since this was declared by the messenger of God, Daniel in interpreting the dream to the king needed to say nothing more than what he said in vv. 21, 22 (24, 25), where he designates the matter as a resolution of the Most High, and thereby indirectly corrects the view of the king regarding the "resolutions of the watchers," and gives the king distinctly to understand that the humiliation announced to him was determined,<p>(Note: We must altogether reject the assertion of Berth., v. Leng., Hitz., and Maur., that the language of this verse regarding the angel sent to Nebuchadnezzar is formed in accordance with the Persian representation of the seven Amschaspands (Ame&#772;scha&#775;-cpenta), since, according to the judgment of all those most deeply conversant with Parsism, the doctrine of the Ame&#772;scha&#775;-cpenta does not at all occur in the oldest parts of the Avesta, and the Avesta altogether is not so old as that the Babylonian doctrine of the gods can be shown to be dependent on the Zend doctrine of the Parsees.)<p>not by the &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; of the Babylonians, but by the only true God, whom Daniel and his people worshipped. For Nebuchadnezzar designates &#1506;&#1497;&#1512; as &#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; in the same sense in which, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/4-5.htm">Daniel 4:5</a>, he speaks of the holy gods. </body></html>
