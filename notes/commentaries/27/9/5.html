The whole result of sin under these several aspects is expressed by the words “departing from Thy precepts.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/daniel/9.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-5.htm" title="We have sinned, and have committed iniquity, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, even by departing from your precepts and from your judgments:">Daniel 9:5</a></span>. <span class="ital">We have sinned, and have committed iniquity — </span>Daniel uses the same confession here that is prescribed, in Solomon’s consecration prayer, to be used by the Jews in the land of their captivity; with a promise subjoined, of a favourable answer that God would make to their supplications presented to him on such an occasion: see the margin. And being one of the Jewish nation, he speaks of their sins as his own; and, though certainly a most holy man, puts himself among the greatest sinners.

It must be our confession, the language of our convictions. Here is Daniel's humble, serious, devout address to God; in which he gives glory to him as a God to be feared, and as a God to be trusted. We should, in prayer, look both at God's greatness and his goodness, his majesty and mercy. Here is a penitent confession of sin, the cause of the troubles the people for so many years groaned under. All who would find mercy must thus confess their sins. Here is a self-abasing acknowledgment of the righteousness of God; and it is evermore the way of true penitents thus to justify God. Afflictions are sent to bring men to turn from their sins, and to understand God's truth. Here is a believing appeal to the mercy of God. It is a comfort that God has been always ready to pardon sin. It is encouraging to recollect that mercies belong to God, as it is convincing and humbling to recollect that righteousness belongs to him. There are abundant mercies in God, not only forgiveness, but forgivenesses. Here are pleaded the reproach God's people was under, and the ruins God's sanctuary was in. Sin is a reproach to any people, especially to God's people. The desolations of the sanctuary are grief to all the saints. Here is an earnest request to God to restore the poor captive Jews to their former enjoyments. O Lord, hearken and do. Not hearken and speak only, but hearken and do; do that for us which none else can do; and defer not. Here are several pleas and arguments to enforce the petitions. Do it for the Lord Christ's sake; Christ is the Lord of all. And for his sake God causes his face to shine upon sinners when they repent, and turn to him. In all our prayers this must be our plea, we must make mention of his righteousness, even of his only. The humble, fervent, believing earnestness of this prayer should ever be followed by us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/daniel/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>We have sinned - Though Daniel was alone, he spake in the name of the people in general - doubtless recounting the long series of crimes in the nation which had preceded the captivity, and which were the cause of the ruin of the city and temple.<p>And have committed iniquity ... - These varied forms of expression are designed to give "intensity" to what he says.

Some think there is a gradation in these words; that they had committed some sins through error and ignorance; others through infirmity and obliquity, or in the perverseness of their spirits, and the crookedness of their ways; and others wilfully and in malice, in the wickedness of their hearts; and others were open acts of hostility against God, casting off his yoke, and refusing obedience to him, and obstinately persisting therein. Jacchiades refers them to sins of actions, words, and thoughts, which they proudly and presumptuously committed. This heap of phrases seems to be used to take in all kind of sin committed by them, and rather to exaggerate than to extenuate them, and to confess them with all their aggravated circumstances; and Daniel puts in himself among the body of the people, as being a member of it, and as well knowing he was not without sin; and therefore willingly took his part in the blame of it, in confession of it, and confusion for it: <p>even by departing from thy precepts, and from thy judgments; both of a moral and positive nature, which were enjoined by the law of Moses, as the rule of their conduct; but from this they swerved. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/daniel/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">We have sinned, and have committed iniquity, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, even by departing from thy precepts and from thy judgments:</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/daniel/9.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">5</span>. <span class="ital">We have sinned, and have</span> <span class="bld">dealt perversely</span>, <span class="ital">and have done wickedly</span>] from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-47.htm" title="Yet if they shall bethink themselves in the land where they were carried captives, and repent, and make supplication to you in the land of them that carried them captives, saying, We have sinned, and have done perversely, we have committed wickedness;">1 Kings 8:47</a>, with extremely slight differences, indicated in R.V. by the substitution of <span class="ital">done</span> for <span class="ital">dealt</span>, and of <span class="ital">dealt</span> for <span class="ital">done</span>. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-6.htm" title="We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly.">Psalm 106:6</a> is based similarly on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-47.htm" title="Yet if they shall bethink themselves in the land where they were carried captives, and repent, and make supplication to you in the land of them that carried them captives, saying, We have sinned, and have done perversely, we have committed wickedness;">1 Kings 8:47</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">and have turned aside</span> <span class="ital">from thy</span> <span class="bld">commandments</span>] Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-20.htm" title="That his heart be not lifted up above his brothers, and that he turn not aside from the commandment, to the right hand, or to the left: to the end that he may prolong his days in his kingdom, he, and his children, in the middle of Israel.">Deuteronomy 17:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-102.htm" title="I have not departed from your judgments: for you have taught me.">Psalm 119:102</a>. ‘Even’ with the partic. is quite false; the construction of the Heb. is one with which every tyro is familiar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-43.htm" title="And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he made him ruler over all the land of Egypt.">Genesis 41:43</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-11.htm" title="And the frogs shall depart from you, and from your houses, and from your servants, and from your people; they shall remain in the river only.">Exodus 8:11</a>, &c.).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">judgements</span>] i.e. <span class="ital">ordinances</span>, as the word is sometimes rendered (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/24-25.htm" title="So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and set them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem.">Joshua 24:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-34.htm" title="To this day they do after the former manners: they fear not the LORD, neither do they after their statutes, or after their ordinances, or after the law and commandment which the LORD commanded the children of Jacob, whom he named Israel;">2 Kings 17:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-37.htm" title="And the statutes, and the ordinances, and the law, and the commandment, which he wrote for you, you shall observe to do for ever more; and you shall not fear other gods.">2 Kings 17:37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-2.htm" title="Yet they seek me daily, and delight to know my ways, as a nation that did righteousness, and forsook not the ordinance of their God: they ask of me the ordinances of justice; they take delight in approaching to God.">Isaiah 58:2</a>).

But they could not do so, although on this occasion he only asked them to give the interpretation, and not, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/2-2.htm">Daniel 2:2</a>, at the same time the dream itself. Instead of the Kethiv &#1506;&#1500;&#1500;&#1497;&#1503;, the Keri here and at <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/5-8.htm">Daniel 5:8</a> gives the contracted form &#1506;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503;, which became possible only by the shortening of , as in &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1503; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/3-16.htm">Daniel 3:16</a>. The form &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1503; is differently explained; apparently it must be the plur. masc. instead of &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1503;, and &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1503; &#1506;&#1491;, to the last, a circumlocution of the adverb at last. That &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1503; means posterus, and &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1503; alius, Hitzig has not yet furnished the proof. The question, wherefore Daniel came only when the Chaldean wise men could not interpret the dream, is not answered satisfactorily by the remark of Zndel, p. 16, that it was the natural course that first they should be called who by virtue of their wisdom should interpret the dream, and that then, after their wisdom had failed, Daniel should be called, who had gained for himself a name by revelations not proceeding from the class of the Magi. For if Nebuchadnezzar had still the events of <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/2.htm">Daniel 2</a> in view, he would without doubt have called him forthwith, since it certainly did not come into his mind, in his anxiety on account of his dream, first to try the natural wisdom of his Magi. The objection offered by Hitzig, that the king does not go at once to his chief magician, v. 6 (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-9.htm">Daniel 4:9</a>), who had already (<a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/2.htm">Daniel 2</a>) shown himself to be the best interpreter of dreams, is not thereby confuted; still less is it by the answer that the custom was not immediately to call the president of the Magi (Jahn), or that in the haste he was not at once thought of (Hv.). Though it may have been the custom not to call the chief president in every particular case, yet a dream by the king, which had filled him with terror, was an altogether unusual occurrence. If Daniel, therefore, was in this case first called only when the natural wisdom of the Magi had proved its inadequacy, the reason of this was, either that Nebuchadnezzar had forgotten what had occurred several years before (<a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/2.htm">Daniel 2</a>), and since the chief president of the wise men was only in special cases called on for counsel, therefore only the incorporated cultivators of the magician's art were called, and only when these could not accomplish that which was asked of them was the chief president Daniel required to come, - or it lay in this, that the king, afraid of receiving an unwelcome answer, purposely adopted the course indicated. Kranichfeld has decided in favour of this latter supposition. "The king," he thinks, "knew from the dream itself that the tree (v. 8 [<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-11.htm">Daniel 4:11</a>]) reaching unto heaven and extending to the end of the whole earth represented a royal person ruling the earth, who could come to ruin on account of the God of the Jews, and would remain in his ruin till there was an acknowledgment of the Almighty; cf. vv. 13, 14, (<a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/4-16.htm">Daniel 4:16</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-17.htm">Daniel 4:17</a>). There was this reason for the king's keeping Daniel the Jew at a distance from this matter of the dream. Without doubt he would think himself intended by the person concerned in the dream; and since the special direction which the dream took (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-14.htm">Daniel 4:14</a>) set forth as its natural point of departure an actual relation corresponding to that of the king to the God of Daniel, it must have occasioned to him a well-grounded fear (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-24.htm">Daniel 4:24</a>), as in the case of Ahab, the idolater, towards Micah, the prophet of Jehovah (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-8.htm">1 Kings 22:8</a>), of a severe judgment, leading him to treat with any other regarding his matter rather than with Daniel." For the establishment of this view Kranichfeld refers to the "king's subsequent address to Daniel, designed especially to appease and captivate (vv. 5, 6 [<a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/4-8.htm">Daniel 4:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-9.htm">Daniel 4:9</a>]), as well as the visibly mild and gentle deportment of the king toward the worshipper of the God of the Jews." This proceeding tending to captivate appears in the appellation, Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, according to the name of my god; for Nebuchadnezzar, by the addition of a name of honour in commemoration of the celebrated god of the kingdom, intended to show favour toward him, as also in the expression which follows, In whom is the spirit of the holy gods, which Nebuchadnezzar repeats in the address. But neither in the one nor the other of these considerations can we perceive the intention of specially captivating and appeasing the Jew Daniel; - not in the latter of these expressions, for two reasons: 1. because Nebuchadnezzar uses the expression not merely in the address to Daniel, but also in the references to him which go before; had he designed it to captivate him, he would have used these words of honour only in the address to him; 2. because the expression, "in whom is the spirit of the holy gods," is so truly heathenish, that the Jew, who knew only one God, could not feel himself specially flattered by having the spirit of the holy gods ascribed to him.<p>If Nebuchadnezzar had had the intention of gaining the favour of Daniel, he would certainly, according to his confession (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-47.htm">Daniel 2:47</a>), have attributed to him the spirit of the God of gods, the Lord of lords, - a confession which even as a heathen he could utter. We cannot give the king so little credit for understanding as to suppose that he meant to show<p>(Note: Calvin here rightly remarks: non dubium est, quin hoc nomen graviter vulneraverit animum prophetae.)<p>a special favour to Daniel, who held so firmly the confession of his father's God, by reminding him that he had given him the name Belteshazzar after the name of his god Bel, whom the Jews abhorred as an idol. Thus the reminding him of this name, as well as the saying that he possessed the spirit of the holy gods, is not accounted for by supposing that he intended to appease and captivate Daniel. In showing the unsatisfactoriness of this interpretation of these expressions, we have set aside also the explanation of the reason, which is based upon it, why Daniel was called in to the king only after the Chaldean wise men; and other weighty considerations can also be adduced against it. First, the edict contains certainly nothing which can give room to the conjecture that Nebuchadnezzar entertained no true confidence, but much rather want of confidence, in him. The comparison of Nebuchadnezzar also with king Ahab in his conduct toward the prophet Micah is not suitable, because Ahab was not a mere polytheist as Nebuchadnezzar, but much rather, like Antiochus Epiphanes, persecuted the servants of Jehovah in his kingdom, and at the instigation of his heathenish wife Jezebel wished to make the worship of Baal the only religion of his kingdom. Finally, the relation of the dream does not indicate that Nebuchadnezzar, if he knew or suspected that the dream referred to himself as ruler over the whole earth, thought that he would come to ruin because of the God of the Jews. For that this does not follow from v. 14 (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-17.htm">Daniel 4:17</a>), is shown not only by the divine visitation that happened to the king, as mentioned in v. 27 (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-30.htm">Daniel 4:30</a>) in fulfilment of the dream, but also by the exhortation to the king with which Daniel closes the interpretation, "to break off sin by righteousness, and his iniquities by showing mercy to the poor" (v. 24 [v. 27]).<p>Thus there only remains this supposition, that the former revelations of God to the king had passed away from his heart and his memory; which was not surprising in the successful founder and ruler of a world-kingdom, if we consider that from twenty-five to thirty years must have passed away since Daniel interpreted to him his dream in the second year of his reign, and from ten to fifteen had passed since the miracle of the deliverance of the three from the burning fiery furnace. But if those earlier revelations of God were obscured in his heart by the fulness of his prosperity, and for ten years Daniel had no occasion to show himself to him as a revealer of divine secrets, then it is not difficult to conceive how, amid the state of disquietude into which the dream recorded in this chapter had brought him, he only gave the command to summon all the wise men of Babylon without expressly mentioning their president, so that they came to him first, and Daniel was called only when the natural wisdom of the Chaldeans had shown itself helpless.<p>The naming of Daniel by his Hebrew name in the manifesto, intended for all the people of the kingdom as well as for the Jews, is simply intended, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/2-29.htm">Daniel 2:29</a>, to designate the interpreter of the dream, as distinguished from the native wise men of Babylon, as a Jew, and at the same time as a worshipper of the most high God; and by the addition, "whose name is Belteshazzar, according to the name of my god," Nebuchadnezzar intends to indicate that Daniel by this name was brought into fellowship with his chief god Bel, and that not only as a worshipper of the God of the Jews, but also of the great god Bel, he had become a partaker of the spirit of the holy gods. But by the holy gods Nebuchadnezzar does not understand Jehovah, the Holy One, deriving this predicate "holy," as M. Geier says, ex theologia Isralitica, and the plur. "gods" denoting, as Calovius supposes, the mysterium pluralitatis personarum; but he speaks of the holy gods, as Jerome, Calvin, and Grotius supposed, as a heathen (ut idololatra) in a polytheistic sense. For that the revelation of supernatural secrets belonged to the gods, and that the man who had this power must possess the spirit of the gods, all the heathen acknowledged. Thus Pharaoh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-38.htm">Genesis 41:38</a>) judged regarding Joseph, and thus also the Chaldeans say to Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-11.htm">Daniel 2:11</a>) that only the gods could know his dream. The truth lying at the foundation of this belief was acknowledged by Joseph before Pharaoh, as also by Daniel before the Chaldean king, for both of them declared before the heathen kings that the interpretation of their dreams was not in the power of man, but could come only from God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-16.htm">Genesis 41:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-28.htm">Daniel 2:28</a>). But when in the case before us Nebuchadnezzar speaks of the holy gods, he means by the expression the &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2; as opposed to the &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;, using the word holy of the good gods, probably from his conversation with Daniel on the subject.<p>In the address, <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/4-6.htm">Daniel 4:6</a>, he calls Belteshazzar &#1495;&#1512;&#1496;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488; &#1512;&#1489;, master of the magicians, probably from the special branch of Chaldean wisdom with which Daniel was particularly conversant, at the same time that he was chief president over all the magicians. &#1488;&#1504;&#1505;, to oppress, to compel any one, to do violence to him; here, to make trouble, difficulty. </body></html>
