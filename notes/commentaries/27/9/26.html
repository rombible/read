Observe the care with which the seventy weeks are arranged in a series of the form 7 + 62 + 1. During the period of seven weeks Jerusalem is to be rebuilt. The “troublous times” are not to be restricted to this period, but may apply to the sixty-two weeks which follow. After the end of the sixty-nine weeks Messiah is to be cut off. By “Messiah” we must understand the same person who is spoken of in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-25.htm" title="Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem to the Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks, and three score and two weeks: the street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous times.">Daniel 9:25</a>. It should also be observed that the word “prince,” which is applied to Messiah in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-25.htm" title="Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem to the Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks, and three score and two weeks: the street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous times.">Daniel 9:25</a>, is here used of another person—some secular prince, who stands in opposition to the Messiah. The Greek versions render “unction” instead of “anointed,” whence Jacob of Edessa explains “the cutting off” to mean “the cessation of the unction by which judgment and sovereignty were established.” The word “to cut off,” however, applies to a person more appropriately than to a thing. It is frequently used of excommunication, <span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-33.htm" title="Whoever compounds any like it, or whoever puts any of it on a stranger, shall even be cut off from his people.">Exodus 30:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-38.htm" title="Whoever shall make like to that, to smell thereto, shall even be cut off from his people.">Exodus 30:38</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-9.htm" title="For evildoers shall be cut off: but those that wait on the LORD, they shall inherit the earth.">Psalm 37:9</a>, and must not be mistaken for the word “to cut off” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-8.htm" title="He was taken from prison and from judgment: and who shall declare his generation? for he was cut off out of the land of the living: for the transgression of my people was he stricken.">Isaiah 53:8</a>).<p><span class= "bld">But not for himself.—</span>On the marginal rendering comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-30.htm" title="Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the prince of this world comes, and has nothing in me.">John 14:30</a>. Literally the words mean, <span class= "ital">and He has not,</span> but what it is that He loses is left indefinite. Taking the sense according to the context, the meaning is either that He has no more a people, or that His office of Messiah amongst His people ceases.<p><span class= "bld">That shall come.</span>—These words imply coming with hostile intent, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/1-1.htm" title="In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Jerusalem, and besieged it.">Daniel 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/11-10.htm" title="But his sons shall be stirred up, and shall assemble a multitude of great forces: and one shall certainly come, and overflow, and pass through: then shall he return, and be stirred up, even to his fortress.">Daniel 11:10</a>. Two such princes have been already mentioned (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-23.htm" title="Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom on earth, which shall be diverse from all kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces.">Daniel 7:23</a>, &c., <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-23.htm" title="And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors are come to the full, a king of fierce countenance, and understanding dark sentences, shall stand up.">Daniel 8:23</a>, &c.), the one being Antiochus, the other his great antitype, namely, Antichrist. Are we to identify this “prince” with either of these? Apparently not. Another typical prince is here introduced to our notice, who shall destroy the city and the sanctuary after the “cutting off” or rejection of the Messiah. But it must be noticed that the work of destruction is here attributed to the “people,” and not to the “prince.”<p><span class= "bld">The end thereof.—</span>It is not clear what end or whose end is signified. According to grammatical rules, the possessive pronoun may either refer to “sanctuary, the last substantive, or to “prince,” the chief nominative in the sentence. The use of the word “flood” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/11-22.htm" title="And with the arms of a flood shall they be overflowed from before him, and shall be broken; yes, also the prince of the covenant.">Daniel 11:22</a>) (comp. “overflow,” <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/11-26.htm" title="Yes, they that feed of the portion of his meat shall destroy him, and his army shall overflow: and many shall fall down slain.">Daniel 11:26</a>) makes it, at first sight, more plausible to think of the end of a person than of a thing. (Comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/1-8.htm" title="But with an overrunning flood he will make an utter end of the place thereof, and darkness shall pursue his enemies.">Nahum 1:8</a>.) But upon comparing this clause with the following, it appears that by “the end” is meant the whole issue of the invasion. This is stated to be desolation, such as is caused by a deluge.<p><span class= "bld">Unto the end.—</span>That is, until the end of the seventy weeks, desolations are decreed. The words recall <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/10-22.htm" title="For though your people Israel be as the sand of the sea, yet a remnant of them shall return: the consumption decreed shall overflow with righteousness.">Isaiah 10:22-23</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/daniel/9.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-26.htm" title="And after three score and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off, but not for himself: and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary; and the end thereof shall be with a flood, and to the end of the war desolations are determined.">Daniel 9:26</a></span>. <span class="ital">After threescore and two weeks </span>(counting from the expiration of the first interval) <span class="ital">shall Messiah be cut off — </span>“This long interval extends from the 93d Olympiad to the 202d Olympiad, or four hundred and thirty- four years; ending with the sixty-ninth [prophetic] week, and with the commencing of our Lord’s ministry. No prophetic characters are here given of the long interval; but they are supplied from other predictions of this great prophet, which respect the Roman people and empire, the Persian monarchy, Alexander and his successors; particularly by that circumstantial prophecy in the eleventh chapter, respecting the Lagidæ and Seleucidæ, and extending to the antichristian persecutions and idolatries typified by those of Antiochus Epiphanes. These four centuries include the most interesting periods of profane history, and their chronology is so well ascertained as to make the computation of Daniel’s weeks mathematically exact. For sixty-two weeks, or four hundred and thirty-four years, added to seven weeks, or forty-nine years, are equal to four hundred and eighty- three years. After which period, or in the last one week, containing seven years, the Messiah should be cut off. The title of MESSIAH is, by way of eminence, peculiar to Christ. It was first used in this prophecy in that appropriate sense. No other application of this title ever obtained among the ancient Jews. Nor can it, without absurdity, be applied to any civil or ecclesiastical prince, much less to a succession in the high-priesthood. It is here used personally, proper to some one anointed; and to whom it is proper is decided by that emphatic circumstance, <span class="ital">Messiah shall be </span>CUT OFF, an expression used in Scripture to denote a judicial sentence and a violent death; BUT NOT FOR HIMSELF — Isaiah gives an exact comment on both these expressions, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-8.htm" title="He was taken from prison and from judgment: and who shall declare his generation? for he was cut off out of the land of the living: for the transgression of my people was he stricken.">Isaiah 53:8</a>.

We cannot now expect that God should send answers to our prayers by angels, but if we pray with fervency for that which God has promised, we may by faith take the promise as an immediate answer to the prayer; for He is faithful that has promised. Daniel had a far greater and more glorious redemption discovered to him, which God would work out for his church in the latter days. Those who would be acquainted with Christ and his grace, must be much in prayer. The evening offering was a type of the great sacrifice Christ was to offer in the evening of the world: in virtue of that sacrifice Daniel's prayer was accepted; and for the sake of that, this glorious discovery of redeeming love was made to him. We have, in verses 24-27, one of the most remarkable prophecies of Christ, of his coming and his salvation. It shows that the Jews are guilty of most obstinate unbelief, in expecting another Messiah, so long after the time expressly fixed for his coming. The seventy weeks mean a day for a year, or 490 years. About the end of this period a sacrifice would be offered, making full atonement for sin, and bringing in everlasting righteousness for the complete justification of every believer. Then the Jews, in the crucifixion of Jesus, would commit that crime by which the measure of their guilt would be filled up, and troubles would come upon their nation. All blessings bestowed on sinful man come through Christ's atoning sacrifice, who suffered once for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God. Here is our way of access to the throne of grace, and of our entrance to heaven. This seals the sum of prophecy, and confirms the covenant with many; and while we rejoice in the blessings of salvation, we should remember what they cost the Redeemer. How can those escape who neglect so great salvation!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/daniel/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And after threescore and two weeks - After the completion of the last period of four hundred and thirty-four years. The angel had shown in the previous verse what would be the characteristic of the first period of "seven weeks" - that during that time the wall and the street would be built in circumstances of general distress and anxiety, and he now proceeds to state what would occur in relation to the remaining sixty-two weeks. The particular thing which would characterize that period would be, that the Messiah would be cut off, and that the series of events would commence which would terminate in the destruction of the city and the temple. He does not say that this would be immediately on the termination of the sixty-two weeks, but he says that it would be "after" &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;  'acha&#774;re&#772;y - "subsequent" to the close of that period. The word does not mean necessarily immediately, but it denotes what is to succeed - to follow - and would be well expressed by the word "afterward:" <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-14.htm">Genesis 15:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/23-19.htm">Genesis 23:19</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/25-26.htm">Genesis 25:26</a>, et al. See Gesenius, Lexicon The natural meaning here would be, that this would be the "next event" in the order of events to be reckoned; it would be that on which the prophetic eye would rest subsequent to the close of the period of sixty-two weeks. There are two circumstances in the prophecy itself which go to show that it is not meant that this would immediately follow:<p>(a) One is, that in the previous verse it is said that the "sixty-two weeks" would extend "unto the Messiah;" that is, either to his birth or to his manifestation as such; and it is not implied anywhere that he would be "cut off" at once on his appearing, nor is such a supposition reasonable, or one that would have been embraced by an ancient student of the prophecies;<p>(b) the other is, that, in the subsequent verse, it is expressly said that what he would accomplish in causing the oblation to cease would occur "in the midst of the week;" that is, of the remaining one week that would complete the seventy. This could not occur if he were to be "cut off" immediately at the close of the sixty-two weeks.<p>The careful student of this prophecy, therefore, would anticipate that the Messiah would appear at the close of the sixty-two weeks, and that he would continue during a part, at least, of the remaining one week before he would be cut off. This point could have been clearly made out from the prophecy before the Messiah came.<p>Shall Messiah - Notes, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-25.htm">Daniel 9:25</a>.<p>Be cut off - The word used here (&#1499;&#1512;&#1514;  ka&#770;rath) means, properly, to cut, to cut off, as a part of a garment, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-5.htm">1 Samuel 24:5</a> (6), 11 (12); a branch of a tree, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-23.htm">Numbers 13:23</a>; the prepuce, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-25.htm">Exodus 4:25</a>; the head, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-51.htm">1 Samuel 17:51</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/5-4.htm">1 Samuel 5:4</a>; to cut down trees, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-5.htm">Deuteronomy 19:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-8.htm">Isaiah 14:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-14.htm">Isaiah 44:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-3.htm">Jeremiah 10:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-7.htm">Jeremiah 22:7</a>.

The phrase, "that soul shall be cut off from his people," "from the midst of the people," "from Israel," "from the congregation," etc., occurs frequently in the Scriptures (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-14.htm">Genesis 17:14</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-20.htm">Leviticus 7:20-21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/15-30.htm">Numbers 15:30</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/19-13.htm">Numbers 19:13</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/19-20.htm">Numbers 19:20</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-19.htm">Exodus 12:19</a>, et al.), and denotes the punishment of death in general, without defining the manner. "It is never the punishment of exile." - Gesenius, Lexicon The proper notion or meaning here is, undoubtedly, that of being cut off by death, and would suggest the idea of a "violent" death, or a death by the agency of others.<p>It would apply to one who was assassinated, or murdered by a mob, or who was appointed to death by a judicial decree; or it might be applied to one who was cut down in battle, or by the pestilence, or by lightning, or by shipwreck, but it would not naturally or properly be applied to one who had lived out his days, and died a peaceful death. We always now connect with the word the idea of some unusual interposition, as when we speak of one who is cut down in middle life. The ancient translators understood it of a violent death. So the Latin "Vulgate, occidetur Christus;" Syriac, "the Messiah shall be slain," or put to death. It need not be here said that this phrase would find a complete fulfillment in the manner in which the Lord Jesus was put to death, nor that this is the very language in which it is proper now to describe the manner in which he was removed. He was cut off by violence; by a judicial decree: by a mob; in the midst of his way, etc. If it should be admitted that the angel meant to describe the manner of his death, he could not have found a single word that would have better expressed it.<p>But not for himself - Margin, "and shall have nothing." This phrase has given rise to not a little discussion, and not a little diversity of opinion. The Latin Vulgate is, "et non erit ejus populus, qui eum negaturus est" - "and they shall not be his people who shall deny him." Theodotion (in the Septuagint), &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837;  kai krima ouk estin en auto&#772; - "and there is no crime in him." Syriac, "And it is not with him." The Hebrew is &#1500;&#1493; &#1493;&#1488;&#1497;&#1503;  ve'e&#772;yn lo&#770; - and the interpretation turns on the meaning of the word &#1488;&#1497;&#1503;  'e&#772;yn. Hengstenberg maintains that it is never used in the sense of &#1500;&#1488;  lo' (not), but that it always conveys the idea of "nothing," or "non-existence," and that the meaning here is, that, then, "there was nothing to him;" that is, that he ceased to have authority and power, as in the cutting off of a prince or ruler whose power comes to an end.<p>Accordingly he renders it, "and is not to him;" that is, his dominion, authority, or power over the covenant people as an anointed prince, would cease when he was cut off, and another one would come and desolate the sanctuary, and take possession. Bertholdt renders it, Ohne Nachfolger von den Seinigen zu haben - "without any successors of his own " - meaning that his family, or that the dynasty would be cut off, or would end with him. He maintains that the whole phrase denotes "a sudden and an unexpected death," and that it here means that he would have no successor of his own family. He applies it to Alexander the Great. Lengerke renders it, Und nicht ist vorhanden, der ihm, angehoret - and explains the whole to mean, "The anointed one (as the lawful king) shall be cut off, but it shall not then be one who belongs to his family (to wit, upon the throne), but a Prince shall come to whom the crown did not belong, to whom the name anointed could not properly belong."<p>Maurer explains it, "There shall be to him no successor or lawful heir." Prof. Stuart renders it, "One shall be cut off, and there shall be none for it" (the people). C. B. Michaelis, "and not to be will be his lot." Jacch. and Hitzig, "and no one remained to him." Rosch, "and no one was present for him." Our translation - "but not for himself" - was undoubtedly adopted from the common view of the atonement - that the Messiah did not die for himself, but that his life was given as a ransom for others. There can be no doubt of that fact to those who hold the common doctrine of the atonement, and yet it maybe doubted whether the translators did not undesignedly allow their views of the atonement to shape the interpretation of this passage, and whether it can be fairly made out from the Hebrew. The ordinary meaning of the Hebrew word &#1488;&#1497;&#1503;  'e&#772;yn is, undoubtedly, "nothing, emptiness" - in the sense of there being nothing (see Gesenius, Lexicon); and, thus applied, the sense here would be, that after he was cut off, or in consequence of his being cut off, what he before possessed would cease, or there would be "nothing" to him; that is, either his life would cease, or his dominion would cease, or he would be cut off as the Prince - the Messiah. This interpretation appears to be confirmed by what is immediately said, that another would come and would destroy the city and the sanctuary, or that the possession would pass into his bands.<p>It seems probable to me that this is the fair interpretation. The Messiah would come as a "Prince." It might be expected that he would come to rule - to set up a kingdom. But he would be suddenly cut off by a violent death. The anticipated dominion over the people as a prince would not be set up. It would not pertain to him. Thus suddenly cut off, the expectations of such a rule would be disappointed and blasted. He would in fact set up no such dominion as might naturally be expected of an anointed prince; he would have no successor; the dynasty would not remain in his hands or his family, and soon the people of a foreign prince would come and would sweep all away. This interpretation does not suppose that the real object of his coming would be thwarted, or that he would not set up a kingdom in accordance with the prediction properly explained, but that such a kingdom as would be expected by the people would not be set up.<p>He would be cut off soon after he came, and the anticipated dominion would not pertain to him, or there would be "nothing" of it found in him, and soon after a foreign prince would come and destroy the city and the sanctuary. This interpretation, indeed, will take this passage away as a proof-text of the doctrine of the atonement, or as affirming the design of the death of the Messiah, but it furnishes a meaning as much in accordance with the general strain of the prophecy, and with the facts in the work of the Messiah. For it was a natural expectation that when he came he would set up a kingdom - a temporal reign - and this expectation was extensively cherished among the people. He was, however, soon cut off, and all such hopes at once perished in the minds of his true followers (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-21.htm">Luke 24:21</a>), and in the minds of the multitudes who, though not his true followers, began to inquire whether he might not be the predicted Messiah - the Prince to sit on the throne of David. But of such an anticipated dominion or rule, there was "nothing" to him.<p>All these expectations were blighted by his sudden death, and soon, instead of his delivering the nation from bondage and setting up a visible kingdom, a foreign prince would come with his forces and would sweep away everything. Whether this would be the interpretation affixed to these words before the advent of the Messiah cannot now be determined. We have few remains of the methods in which the Hebrews interpreted the ancient prophecies, and we may readily suppose that they would not be disposed to embrace an exposition which would show them that the reign of the Messiah, as they anticipated it, would not occur, but that almost as soon as he appeared, he would be put to death, and the dominion pass away, and the nation be subjected to the ravages of a foreign power. "And the people of the prince that shall come." Margin, "And they (the Jews) shall be no more his people; or, the Prince's (Messiah's) future people." This seems to be rather an explanation of the meaning, than a translation of the Hebrew. The literal rendering would be, "and the city, and the sanctuary, the people of a prince that comes, shall lay waste." On the general supposition that this whole passage refers to the Messiah and his time, the language used here is not difficult of interpretation, and denotes with undoubted accuracy the events that soon followed the "cutting off" of the Messiah. The word "people" (&#1506;&#1501;  &#8219;am) is a word that may well be applied to subjects or armies - such a people as an invading prince or warrior would lead with him for purposes of conquest. It denotes properly<p>(a) a people, or tribe, or race in general; and then<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/daniel/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>26. after threescore and two weeks&#8212;rather, the threescore and two weeks. In this verse, and in Da 9:27, Messiah is made the prominent subject, while the fate of the city and sanctuary are secondary, being mentioned only in the second halves of the verses. Messiah appears in a twofold aspect, salvation to believers, judgment on unbelievers (Lu 2:34; compare Mal 3:1-6; 4:1-3). He repeatedly, in Passion week, connects His being "cut off" with the destruction of the city, as cause and effect (Mt 21:37-41; 23:37, 38; Lu 21:20-24; 23:28-31).

To be reckoned from the end of the seven weeks, or forty nine years, which, added to them, make four hundred and eighty three years: <p>shall Messiah be cut off, but not for himself; by whom is designed the same with Messiah the Prince in <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/9-25.htm">Daniel 9:25</a>, not Onias the high priest, as a late writer (g) would have it, an upright person, and of great holiness, taken off by an unjust death; since he was dead many years before the expiration of these weeks; nor Hyrcanus the high priest, slain by Herod, as Eusebius (h) thinks; in whom the succession of the ancient priests terminated, and with whom the priestly unction perished; which indeed bids fairer than the former; but he was not a person of so much note as to be pointed at in such a prophecy; besides, the priesthood continued much longer: nor is King Agrippa intended, as Jarchi and Abarbinel, who, they say, was the last king of the Jews, and was slain by Vespasian at the destruction of Jerusalem; which is not true; he was not properly king of the Jews, having only Galilee for his jurisdiction; was not slain by Vespasian; was a confederate of the Romans, lived some years after the destruction of the city, and at last died in peace; but Jesus the true Messiah is intended, with whom the character, dates, and death, and the manner of it, entirely agree: now to his death were to be four hundred and eighty three years; which years ended, as we have observed, in the thirty third year of the vulgar era of Christ, and the nineteenth of Tiberius; when Jesus the true Messiah was cut off in a judicial way; not for any sins of his own, but for the sins of his people, to make satisfaction for them, and to obtain their redemption and salvation; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-8.htm">Isaiah 53:8</a>, or "he is not", as Jarchi, no more in the land of the living, is dead; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-15.htm">Jeremiah 31:15</a>, or "there is", or "will be, none for him", or "with him" (i), to help and assist him in his great work, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-5.htm">Isaiah 63:5</a>. The Vulgate Latin version is, "they shall not be his people"; the Jews rejecting him shall have a "loammi" upon them, and be no more the people of God. Gussetius (k) better renders it, "he hath not"; or he has nothing, so Cocceius; all things were wanted by him, that is, by Christ; he had neither riches, nor clothes, nor any to stand by him, or to accompany him: <p>and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary; that is, the people of the Romans, under Vespasian their prince, emperor, and general, should, in a little time after the cutting off of the Messiah, enter into the land of Judea, and destroy the city of Jerusalem, and the temple that stood in it; though some understand this of Messiah the Prince that should come in his power, and in a way of judgment upon the Jewish nation, and destroy them for their rejection of him; whose people the Romans would be, and under whose direction, and by whose orders, all these judgments should be brought upon the Jews; but many of the Jewish writers themselves interpret it of Vespasian, as Aben Ezra, Jarchi, Abarbinel, and Jacchiades: <p>and the end thereof shall be with a flood: the end of the city and temple, and of the whole nation, should be by the Roman army, which, like a flood, would overspread the land, and carry all before it. It denotes the number, power, and irresistible force of the enemy, and the sad devastation made by them: <p>and unto the end of the war desolations are determined; from the beginning of the war by the Romans with the Jews, to the end of it, there would be nothing but continual desolations; a dreadful havoc and ruin everywhere; and all this appointed and determined by the Lord, as a just punishment for their sins. <p>(g) Scheme of literal Prophecy, &amp;c. p. 183.

Onias III. was high-priest till b.c. 175, when he was superseded by his brother Jason, who by the offer of 440 talents of silver purchased the office from Antiochus for himself (<a href="http://apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/4-7.htm" title="But after the death of Seleucus, when Antiochus, called Epiphanes, took the kingdom, Jason the brother of Onias laboured underhand to be high priest,...">2Ma 4:7-9</a>). Jason held office for three years, at the end of which time a certain Menelaus, whom he had employed as his agent to carry the 440 talents to the king, took advantage of the occasion to secure the high-priesthood for himself by offering Antiochus 300 talents more. The money promised by Menelaus not being paid, he was summoned before the king. When he arrived he found Antiochus absent in Cilicia and a courtier named Andronicus representing him at Antioch. Menelaus, anxious to secure Andronicus’s favour, presented him with some golden vessels which he had stolen from the Temple. Onias, who was in the neighbourhood, hearing of what he had done, rebuked him sharply for his sacrilege; and Menelaus, resenting the rebuke, prevailed upon Andronicus to assassinate Onias. Antiochus, upon his return home, was vexed with what had occurred, and (according to 2 Macc.) had Andronicus put to death at the very spot at which he had murdered Onias (<a href="http://apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/4-7.htm" title="But after the death of Seleucus, when Antiochus, called Epiphanes, took the kingdom, Jason the brother of Onias laboured underhand to be high priest,...">2Ma 4:7-9</a>; <a href="http://apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/4-23.htm" title="Three years afterward Jason sent Menelaus, the aforesaid Simon's brother, to bear the money unto the king, and to put him in mind of certain necessary matters....">2Ma 4:23-38</a>). The assassination of one who was the lawful high-priest was an occurrence which might well be singled out for mention in the prophecy; and how the godly character of Onias, and his unjust end, impressed the Jews, appears from what is said of him in <a href="http://apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/3-1.htm" title="Now when the holy city was inhabited with all peace, and the laws were kept very well, because of the godliness of Onias the high priest, and his hatred of wickedness,...">2Ma 3:1-2</a>; <a href="http://apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/4-2.htm" title="Thus was he bold to call him a traitor, that had deserved well of the city, and tendered his own nation, and was so zealous of the laws.">2Ma 4:2</a>; <a href="http://apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/4-35.htm" title="For the which cause not only the Jews, but many also of other nations, took great indignation, and were much grieved for the unjust murder of the man....">2Ma 4:35-37</a>; <a href="http://apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/15-12.htm" title="And this was his vision: That Onias, who had been high priest, a virtuous and a good man, reverend in conversation, gentle in condition, well spoken also, and exercised from a child in all points of virtue, holding up his hands prayed for the whole body of the Jews.">2Ma 15:12</a>[339]. On the chronological difficulty involved in the verse, see below, p. 146 f.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[339] This account of the end of Onias III. is accepted generally by historians (e.g. Ewald, v. 295; Schürer2, i. 152; Grätz ii. 2, 303): but 2 Macc. (which alone records it) is known to contain much that is not historical; and Josephus not only does not mention the assassination of Onias, but, while he sometimes (<span class="ital">Ant.</span> xii. ix. 7, xiii. iii. 1–3, xx. x.) speaks of Onias’ <span class="ital">son</span> as fleeing to Egypt, and founding there the temple at Leontopolis, elsewhere (<span class="ital">B. J.</span> i. i. 1, vii. x. 2–3) says that Onias himself, after Antiochus attack upon Jerusalem in 170 (Introduction, p. xliii.), fled to Egypt, and founded the temple at Leontopolis (cf. Bäthgen, <span class="ital">ZATW.</span>, 1886, pp. 278–282). On, these and some other grounds, Wellhausen (<span class="ital">Gött. Gel. Anz.</span> 1895, pp. 950–6; <span class="ital">Isr. u. Jüd. Gesch.</span>3, 1897, pp. 244–7), partly following Willrich (<span class="ital">Juden u. Griechen vorder Makkab. Erhebung</span>, 1895, pp. 77–90), regards the account of Onias’ murder in 2 Macc. as apocryphal: see, however, on the other side, Büchler, <span class="ital">Die Tobiaden u. die Oniaden</span> (1899), pp. 106–124, 240 f., 275 f., 353–6, whose conclusion on this subject has the weighty support of the historian Niese, <span class="ital">Kritik der beiden Makkabäerbücher</span> (1900), p. 96 f. <span class="ital">If</span> Wellhausen’s view is correct, the reference in this verse of Dan. will be to the cessation of the legitimate high-priesthood, when Jason was superseded by the Benjaminite (<a href="http://apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/4-23.htm" title="Three years afterward Jason sent Menelaus, the aforesaid Simon's brother, to bear the money unto the king, and to put him in mind of certain necessary matters.">2Ma 4:23</a>; cf. <a href="http://apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/3-4.htm" title="But one Simon of the tribe of Benjamin, who was made governor of the temple, fell out with the high priest about disorder in the city.">2Ma 3:4</a>; Büchler, p. 14) Menelaus.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">and shall have no</span>.…] The clause is difficult; though the same text (<span class="greekheb">ואין לו</span>) was perhaps already read (but rendered incorrectly) by the LXX. (<span class="greekheb">καὶ οὐκ ἔσται</span>), and is distinctly implied by Aq., Symm., and the Pesh. The rendering ‘and shall have <span class="bld">nothing</span>’ may be defended by <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-3.htm" title="If the sun be risen on him, there shall be blood shed for him; for he should make full restitution; if he have nothing, then he shall be sold for his theft.">Exodus 22:3</a> [Hebrews 2], though, it is true, the ‘thing’ lacking is there more easily supplied from the context than is the case here; but the sense obtained is not very satisfactory, and the sentence (in the Heb.) reads also incompletely; we should have expected, ‘and shall have no [helper].’—as Grätz would actually read, comparing <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/11-45.htm" title="And he shall plant the tabernacles of his palace between the seas in the glorious holy mountain; yet he shall come to his end, and none shall help him.">Daniel 11:45</a>,—or ‘[successor],’ or ‘[seed],’ or something of the kind. Still, if the text be sound, this, it seems, must be the meaning: the ‘anointed one,’ when he is ‘cut off,’ <span class="ital">will have nought</span>, i.e. he will be left with <span class="ital">nothing</span>,—no name, no house, no legitimate successor. (LXX. <span class="ital">and be no more</span>, would be the correct rendering of <span class="greekheb">ואיננו</span>; but this reading is suspiciously easy.) The rendering of A.V., ‘but not for himself,’ is an impossible one: <span class="greekheb">אין</span> is not a synonym of <span class="greekheb">לא</span>, but always includes the substantive verb, ‘there is not,’ ‘was not,’ ‘shall not be’ (the tense being supplied according to the context).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the people of a prince that shall come</span>] viz. against the land, the verb being used in the same hostile sense which it has in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/1-1.htm" title="In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Jerusalem, and besieged it.">Daniel 1:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/11-13.htm" title="For the king of the north shall return, and shall set forth a multitude greater than the former, and shall certainly come after certain years with a great army and with much riches.">Daniel 11:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/11-16.htm" title="But he that comes against him shall do according to his own will, and none shall stand before him: and he shall stand in the glorious land, which by his hand shall be consumed.">Daniel 11:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/11-21.htm" title="And in his estate shall stand up a vile person, to whom they shall not give the honor of the kingdom: but he shall come in peaceably, and obtain the kingdom by flatteries.">Daniel 11:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/daniel/11-40.htm" title="And at the time of the end shall the king of the south push at him: and the king of the north shall come against him like a whirlwind, with chariots, and with horsemen, and with many ships; and he shall enter into the countries, and shall overflow and pass over....">Daniel 11:40-41</a>.

The 70th week (b.c. 171 to 164).<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/daniel/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In this verse there is a brief comprehensive statement regarding the fulfilment of the dream to the king, which is then extended from v. 26 to 30. At the end of twelve months, i.e., after the expiry of twelve months from the time of the dream, the king betook himself to his palace at Babylon, i.e., to the flat roof of the palace; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-2.htm">2 Samuel 11:2</a>. The addition at Babylon does not indicate that the king was then living at a distance from Babylon, as Berth., v. Leng., Maur., and others imagine, but is altogether suitable to the matter, because Nebuchadnezzar certainly had palaces outside of Babylon, but it is made with special reference to the language of the king which follows regarding the greatness of Babylon. &#1506;&#1504;&#1492; means here not simply to begin to speak, but properly to answer, and suggests to us a foregoing colloquy of the king with himself in his own mind. Whether one may conclude from that, in connection with the statement of time, after twelve months, that Nebuchadnezzar, exactly one year after he had received the important dream, was actively engaging himself regarding that dream, must remain undetermined, and can be of no use to a psychological explanation of the occurrence of the dream. The thoughts which Nebuchadnezzar expresses in v. 26 (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-29.htm">Daniel 4:29</a>) are not favourable to such a supposition. Had the king remembered that dream and its interpretation, he would scarcely have spoken so proudly of his splendid city which he had built as he does in v. 27 (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-30.htm">Daniel 4:30</a>).<p>When he surveyed the great and magnificent city from the top of his palace, "pride overcame him," so that he dedicated the building of this great city as the house of his kingdom to the might of his power and the honour of his majesty. From the addition &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1488; it does not follow that this predicate was a standing Epitheton ornans of Babylon, as with &#1495;&#1502;&#1514; , <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/6-2.htm">Amos 6:2</a>, and other towns of Asia; for although Pausanias and Strabo call Babylon &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b7; and &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, yet it bears this designation as a surname in no ancient author. But in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-8.htm">Revelation 14:8</a> this predicate, quoted from the passage before us, is given to Babylon, and in the mouth of Nebuchadnezzar it quite corresponds to the self-praise of his great might by which he had built Babylon as the residence of a great king. &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492; designates, as &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492; more frequently, not the building or founding of a city, for the founding of Babylon took place in the earliest times after the Flood (<a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/11.htm">Genesis 11</a>), and was dedicated to the god Belus, or the mythic Semiramis, i.e., in the pre-historic time; but &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492; means the building up, the enlargement, the adorning of the city &#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468; &#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;, for the house of the kingdom, i.e., for a royal residence; cf. The related expression &#1502;&#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1492; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/7-13.htm">Amos 7:13</a>. &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; stands in this connection neither for town nor for &#1492;&#1497;&#1499;&#1500; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-29.htm">Daniel 4:29</a>), but has the meaning dwelling-place. The royalty of the Babylonian kingdom has its dwelling-place, its seat, in Babylon, the capital of the kingdom.<p>With reference to the great buildings of Nebuchadnezzar in Babylon, vide the statements of Berosus in Josephi Ant. x. 11, 1, and con. Ap. i. 19, and of Abydenus in Eusebii praepar. evang. ix. 41, and Chron. i. p. 59; also the delineation of these buildings in Duncker's Gesch. des Alterth. i. p. 854ff. The presumption of this language appears in the words, "by the strength of my might, and for the splendour (honour) of my majesty." Thus Nebuchadnezzar describes himself as the creator of his kingdom and of its glory, while the building up of his capital as a residence bearing witness to his glory and his might pointed at the same time to the duration of his dynasty. This proud utterance is immediately followed by his humiliation by the omnipotent God. A voice fell from heaven. &#1504;&#1508;&#1500; as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-7.htm">Isaiah 9:7</a>, of the sudden coming of a divine revelation. &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1503; for the passive, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/3-4.htm">Daniel 3:4</a>. The perf. &#1506;&#1491;&#1468;&#1514; denotes the matter as finished. At the moment when Nebuchadnezzar heard in his soul the voice from heaven, the prophecy begins to be fulfilled, the king becomes deranged, and is deprived of his royalty.<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/4-29.htm">Daniel 4:29-30</a> (<a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/4-32.htm">Daniel 4:32-33</a>)<p>(4:25-30)<p>The fulfilling of the dream.<p>Nebuchadnezzar narrates the fulfilment of the dream altogether objectively, so that he speaks of himself in the third person. Berth., Hitz., and others find here that the author falls out of the role of the king into the narrative tone, and thus betrays the fact that some other than the king framed the edict. But this conclusion is opposed by the fact that Nebuchadnezzar from v. 31 speaks of his recovery again in the first person. Thus it is beyond doubt that the change of person has its reason in the matter itself. Certainly it could not be in this that Nebuchadnezzar thought it unbecoming to speak in his own person of his madness; for if he had had so tender a regard for his own person, he would not have published the whole occurrence in a manifesto addressed to his subjects. But the reason of his speaking of his madness in the third person, as if some other one were narrating it, lies simply in this, that in that condition he was not Ich  equals  Ego (Kliefoth). With the return of the Ich, I, on the recovery from his madness, Nebuchadnezzar begins again to narrate in the first person (v. 31 34).<p>Here the contents of the prophecy, v. 22 (v. 25), are repeated, and then in v. 30 (v. 33) it is stated that the word regarding Nebuchadnezzar immediately began to be fulfilled. On &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1514;&#1488; &#1489;&#1492;&#1468;, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/3-6.htm">Daniel 3:6</a>. &#1505;&#1508;&#1514;, from &#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1507;, to go to an end. The prophecy goes to an end when it is realized, is fulfilled. The fulfilling is related in the words of the prophecy. Nebuchadnezzar is driven from among men, viz., by his madness, in which he fled from intercourse with men, and lived under the open air of heaven as a beast among the beasts, eating grass like the cattle; and his person was so neglected, that his hair became like the eagles' fathers and his nails like birds' claws. &#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1503; and &#1499;&#1468;&#1510;&#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1503; are abbreviated comparisons; vide under <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-16.htm">Daniel 4:16</a>. That this condition was a peculiar appearance of the madness is expressly mentioned in v. 31 (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-34.htm">Daniel 4:34</a>), where the recovery is designated as the restoration of his understanding.<p>This malady, in which men regard themselves as beasts and imitate their manner of life, is called insania zoanthropica, or, in the case of those who think themselves wolves, lycanthropia. The condition is described in a manner true to nature. Even "as to the eating of grass," as G. Rsch, in the Deutsch. Morgenl. Zeitschr. xv. p. 521, remarks, "there is nothing to perplex or that needs to be explained. It is a circumstance that has occurred in recent times, as e.g., in the case of a woman in the Wrttemberg asylum for the insane." Historical documents regarding this form of madness have been collected by Trusen in his Sitten, Gebr. u. Krank. der alten Hebrer, p. 205f., 2nd ed., and by Friedreich in Zur Bibel, i. p. 308f.<p>(Note: Regarding the statement, "his hair grew as the feathers of an eagle," etc., Friedr. remarks, p. 316, that, besides the neglect of the external appearance, there is also to be observed the circumstance that sometimes in psychical maladies the nails assume a peculiarly monstrous luxuriance with deformity. Besides, his remaining for a long time in the open air is to be considered, "for it is an actual experience that the hair, the more it is exposed to the influences of the rough weather and to the sun's rays, the more does it grow in hardness, and thus becomes like unto the feathers of an eagle.") </body></html>
