Daniel here observes, and lays a great emphasis on, the time when this answer was given; <span class="ital">While I was speaking, </span>says he, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-20.htm" title="And whiles I was speaking, and praying, and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before the LORD my God for the holy mountain of my God;">Daniel 9:20</a>, <span class="ital">yea, while I was speaking in prayer, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-21.htm" title="Yes, whiles I was speaking in prayer, even the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, being caused to fly swiftly, touched me about the time of the evening oblation.">Daniel 9:21</a>. Before he rose from his knees, and while there was yet more which he intended to say if the answer was not given. He mentions the two heads which he chiefly insisted on in prayer, and which, perhaps, he designed yet further to enlarge upon. 1st, He was confessing sin, his own sin, and the sin of his people Israel. 2d, He was making supplication before the Lord his God, and presenting petitions to him as an intercessor for Israel. Now while Daniel was thus employed, he had both a grant made him of the mercy he prayed for, and had a discovery communicated of a far greater and more glorious redemption, which God could work out for his church in the latter days. He further observes, that as this answer was given him at the very moment when he was requesting it, and before he had concluded his petitions, so it was <span class="ital">about the time of the evening oblation — </span>The altar was in ruins, and there was no oblation offered upon it; but, it seems, the pious Jews, in their captivity, daily thought of the times when it should have been offered, and at those hours endeavoured to set forth before God their prayers <span class="ital">as incense, </span>and the lifting up of their hands as a morning or evening sacrifice, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/141-2.htm" title="Let my prayer be set forth before you as incense; and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice.">Psalm 141:2</a>. The evening oblation was a type of the great sacrifice which Christ was to offer in the evening of the world; and it was in virtue of that sacrifice that Daniel’s prayer was accepted, and this glorious discovery of redeeming love was made to him: the Lamb opened the seals of prophecy in the virtue of his own blood, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-5.htm" title="And one of the elders said to me, Weep not: behold, the Lion of the tribe of Juda, the Root of David, has prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof.">Revelation 5:5</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Daniel informs us here also by whom this answer was sent. It was not communicated to him in a dream, or by a voice from heaven; but, for the greater certainty and solemnity of it, an angel was sent from heaven to bring it to him. <span class="ital">The man Gabriel — </span>That is, the angel Gabriel, appearing in a human shape, <span class="ital">whom I had seen in the beginning — </span>Or, <span class="ital">before, </span>see <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-16.htm" title="And I heard a man's voice between the banks of Ulai, which called, and said, Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision.">Daniel 8:16</a>; <span class="ital">being caused to fly swiftly — </span>An expression used to signify the haste he made to bring Daniel an answer to his prayer. Angels are winged messengers, quick in their motions, and delay not a moment to execute the orders they receive. But, it would seem, that at some times they are directed to use more expedition, and make a quicker despatch than at others, as, it appears, was the case with Gabriel now; <span class="ital">touched me — </span>Probably to infuse additional strength and courage into him, that he might be perfectly recollected, have the proper use and exercise of all his faculties at this important season, and might at once understand and retain a perfect remembrance of the whole message which the angel was commissioned to bring him from God.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:20-27 An answer was immediately sent to Daniel's prayer, and it is a very memorable one. We cannot now expect that God should send answers to our prayers by angels, but if we pray with fervency for that which God has promised, we may by faith take the promise as an immediate answer to the prayer; for He is faithful that has promised. Daniel had a far greater and more glorious redemption discovered to him, which God would work out for his church in the latter days. Those who would be acquainted with Christ and his grace, must be much in prayer. The evening offering was a type of the great sacrifice Christ was to offer in the evening of the world: in virtue of that sacrifice Daniel's prayer was accepted; and for the sake of that, this glorious discovery of redeeming love was made to him. We have, in verses 24-27, one of the most remarkable prophecies of Christ, of his coming and his salvation. It shows that the Jews are guilty of most obstinate unbelief, in expecting another Messiah, so long after the time expressly fixed for his coming. The seventy weeks mean a day for a year, or 490 years. About the end of this period a sacrifice would be offered, making full atonement for sin, and bringing in everlasting righteousness for the complete justification of every believer. Then the Jews, in the crucifixion of Jesus, would commit that crime by which the measure of their guilt would be filled up, and troubles would come upon their nation. All blessings bestowed on sinful man come through Christ's atoning sacrifice, who suffered once for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God. Here is our way of access to the throne of grace, and of our entrance to heaven. This seals the sum of prophecy, and confirms the covenant with many; and while we rejoice in the blessings of salvation, we should remember what they cost the Redeemer.

All, however, derive the word from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;</span>, "to fly;" another etymology is possible from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;</span>. As to the meaning of this word, there is a difference of opinion, Gesenius holding that it means "wearied out" - a meaning unsuited to the subject or to the context, though in accordance with the use of the word elsewhere. Meinbold would connect this word with the preceding clause, and refer it to Daniel, "when I was faint." The main difficulty is the succeeding word. Furst suggests that it means "shining in splendour" - a meaning perfectly suited to the circumstances, but for which there seems little justification in etymology from cognate tongues. Furst suggests a transposal from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5e4;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span>. Winer gives it, "celeriter ivit, cucurrit." This view is taken by Hitzig, yon Lengerke, and Havernick. Ver. 20 is largely an expansion of the first clause of ver. 21. <span class="accented">Whiles I was speaking</span>, <span class="accented">and praying.</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-15.htm">Genesis 24:15</a>, "And it came to pass, before he had done speaking"). This shows the rapidity of the Divine answer to prayer; even before we ask, "our Father knows what things we have need of." <span class="accented">The man Gabriel.</span> The name Gabriel, as mentioned above, means "Hero of God;" and the word here translated "man" is the ordinary word for "man," '<span class="accented">ish.</span> It may be remarked that in Scripture angels are always "men;" never, as in modern art and poetry, "women." <span class="accented">Whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning.</span> This really means "whom I had seen previously in vision," the reference being to <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-16.htm">Daniel 8:16</a>. <span class="accented">Being caused to fly swiftly. As</span> above mentioned, there is considerable difficulty in deciding which meaning is to be taken as the correct. Kliefoth's and Meinhold's view would be the simplest, if there were any certainty that <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5e2;&#x5e4;</span> means "faintness." <span class="accented">Touched me about the time of the evening oblation.</span> Daniel is so absorbed in his devotions that not till Gabriel touched him did he recognize the presence of an an gel-visitant. The time of the evening offering does not imply that those offerings were made in Babylon, but simply that, through the half-century that had intervened since the capture of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar the sacred hour had been kept in remembrance, not impossibly as being one consecrated to prayer. Daniel had been using this season to make known his request and petition to God. "Oblation," <span class="accented">minhah</span>, the bloodless meat offering (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-1.htm">Leviticus 2:1, 4, 14</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/daniel/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Daniel interprets to the king his dream, repeating only here and there in an abbreviated form the substance of it in the same words, and then declares its reference to the king.

The fuller description of the tree is subordinated to the relative clause, which thou hast seen, so that the subject is connected by &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-19.htm">Daniel 4:19</a>), representing the verb. subst., according to rule, with the predicate &#1488;&#1497;&#1500;&#1504;&#1488;. The interpretation of the separate statements regarding the tree is also subordinated in the relative clauses to the subject. For the Kethiv &#1512;&#1489;&#1497;&#1514;  equals  &#1512;&#1489;&#1497;&#1514;&#1468;, the Keri gives the shortened form &#1512;&#1489;&#1514;, with the elision of the third radical, analogous to the shortening of the following &#1502;&#1496;&#1514; for &#1502;&#1496;&#1514;. To the call of the angel to "cut down the tree," etc. (<a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/4-20.htm">Daniel 4:20</a>, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/4-10.htm">Daniel 4:10-13</a>), Daniel gives the interpretation, <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/4-24.htm">Daniel 4:24</a>, "This is the decree of the Most High which is come upon the king, that he shall be driven from men, and dwell among the beasts," etc. &#1506;&#1500; &#1502;&#1496;&#1488;  equals  Hebr. &#1506;&#1500; &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1488;. The indefinite plur. form &#1496;&#1512;&#1491;&#1497;&#1503; stands instead of the passive, as the following &#1500;&#1498; &#1497;&#1496;&#1506;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503; and &#1502;&#1510;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1497;&#1503;, cf. under <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/3-4.htm">Daniel 3:4</a>. Thus the subject remains altogether indefinite, and one has neither to think on men who will drive him from their society, etc., nor of angels, of whom, perhaps, the expulsion of the king may be predicated, but scarcely the feeding on grass and being wet with dew.</body></html>
