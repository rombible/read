It remains for Daniel to realise the complete “pouring” out of the curse. It is poured out like a torrent of rain (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-33.htm" title="And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad his hands to the LORD: and the thunders and hail ceased, and the rain was not poured on the earth.">Exodus 9:33</a>); as the fire melts the silver (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/22-20.htm" title="As they gather silver, and brass, and iron, and lead, and tin, into the middle of the furnace, to blow the fire on it, to melt it; so will I gather you in my anger and in my fury, and I will leave you there, and melt you.">Ezekiel 22:20-22</a>), so does the curse cause the nation to melt away.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/daniel/9.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/daniel/9-11.htm" title="Yes, all Israel have transgressed your law, even by departing, that they might not obey your voice; therefore the curse is poured on us, and the oath that is written in the law of Moses the servant of God, because we have sinned against him....">Daniel 9:11-14</a></span>. <span class="ital">Yea, all Israel have transgressed thy law — </span>Not here and there one, but the generality of them; the body of the people have transgressed, <span class="ital">by departing, </span>and taking themselves out of the way, <span class="ital">that they might not </span>hear, and so might not <span class="ital">obey thy voice: therefore the curse is poured upon us, and the oath, </span>&c. — That is, the curse that was ratified by an oath in the law of Moses. This further justified God in their troubles, that he only inflicted the penalty of the law, of which he had given them fair notice. It was necessary for preserving the honour of God’s veracity, and saving his government from contempt, that the threatenings of his word should be executed; otherwise they would have looked but as bugbears, nay, they would have had no terror in them. <span class="ital">And he hath confirmed his words against us — </span>Because we broke his laws, <span class="ital">And against our judges that judged us — </span>Because they did not, according to the duty of their places, punish the breach of God’s laws. He informed them frequently, that if they did not execute justice, as terrors to evil-doers, he must and would take the work into his own hands; and now, says Daniel, he has confirmed what he said, <span class="ital">by bringing upon us a great evil — </span>In which the princes and judges themselves have deeply shared. <span class="ital">For under the whole heaven hath not been done, </span>&c. — See note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/1-12.htm" title="Is it nothing to you, all you that pass by? behold, and see if there be any sorrow like to my sorrow, which is done to me, with which the LORD has afflicted me in the day of his fierce anger.">Lamentations 1:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-13.htm" title="What thing shall I take to witness for you? what thing shall I liken to you, O daughter of Jerusalem? what shall I equal to you, that I may comfort you, O virgin daughter of Zion? for your breach is great like the sea: who can heal you?">Lamentations 2:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-9.htm" title="And I will do in you that which I have not done, and whereunto I will not do any more the like, because of all your abominations.">Ezekiel 5:9</a>. <span class="ital">As it is written, &c., all this is come upon us </span>— This is a devout acknowledgment, that, from the very beginning of their state, they had been forewarned that such evils as they now suffered would come upon them, when they forsook the Lord their God, and turned aside from the observation of his law. And it is an humble confession of God’s justice and providence, in making his judgments exactly fulfil the threatenings denounced many ages before by Moses. <span class="ital">Yet we made not our prayer before the Lord our God — </span>Not in a right manner, as we should have made it, with a lowly, penitent, and obedient heart; we have been smitten, but have not returned to him that smote us; literally, <span class="ital">we have not entreated the face, </span>or, as Wintle translates it, <span class="ital">have not deprecated the wrath, of the Lord our God. </span>We have taken no care to make our peace with God, and reconcile ourselves to him. Daniel set his brethren a good example of praying continually, but he was sorry to see how few there were that followed his example; in their affliction it was expected they would seek God early, but they sought him not, so as to <span class="ital">turn from </span>their <span class="ital">iniquities and understand </span>his <span class="ital">truth. Therefore hath the Lord watched upon the evil — </span>Hebrew, <span class="ital">watched over the evil; </span>namely, hath taken care that his threatenings should be fulfilled, as a just judge takes care that execution be done, according to the sentence pronounced; because we have not been melted, he hath kept us still in the furnace, and watched over it to make the heat yet more intense; for when God judges he will overcome, and will be justified in all his proceedings.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:4-19 In every prayer we must make confession, not only of the sins we have been guilty of, but of our faith in God, and dependence upon him, our sorrow for sin, and our resolutions against it. It must be our confession, the language of our convictions. Here is Daniel's humble, serious, devout address to God; in which he gives glory to him as a God to be feared, and as a God to be trusted. We should, in prayer, look both at God's greatness and his goodness, his majesty and mercy. Here is a penitent confession of sin, the cause of the troubles the people for so many years groaned under. All who would find mercy must thus confess their sins. Here is a self-abasing acknowledgment of the righteousness of God; and it is evermore the way of true penitents thus to justify God. Afflictions are sent to bring men to turn from their sins, and to understand God's truth. Here is a believing appeal to the mercy of God. It is a comfort that God has been always ready to pardon sin. It is encouraging to recollect that mercies belong to God, as it is convincing and humbling to recollect that righteousness belongs to him. There are abundant mercies in God, not only forgiveness, but forgivenesses. Here are pleaded the reproach God's people was under, and the ruins God's sanctuary was in. Sin is a reproach to any people, especially to God's people. The desolations of the sanctuary are grief to all the saints. Here is an earnest request to God to restore the poor captive Jews to their former enjoyments. O Lord, hearken and do. Not hearken and speak only, but hearken and do; do that for us which none else can do; and defer not. Here are several pleas and arguments to enforce the petitions. Do it for the Lord Christ's sake; Christ is the Lord of all. And for his sake God causes his face to shine upon sinners when they repent, and turn to him. In all our prayers this must be our plea, we must make mention of his righteousness, even of his only. The humble, fervent, believing earnestness of this prayer should ever be followed by us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/daniel/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Yea, all Israel have transgressed ... - Embracing not only the tribe and the kingdom of Judah, but the whole nation. The calamity, therefore, had come upon them all.<p>Even by departing - By departing from thy commandments; or by rebellion against thee.<p>That they might not obey thy voice - By refusing to obey thy voice, or thy commands.<p>Therefore the curse is poured upon us - As rain descends, or as water is poured out. The "curse" here refers to what was so solemnly threatened by Moses in case the nation did not obey God. See <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15-68</a>.<p>And the oath that is written in the law of Moses ... - The word here rendered "oath" (&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1493;&#1506;&#1492;  shebu&#770;&#8219;a&#770;h) means, properly, a "swearing," or "an oath;" and hence, either an oath of promise as in a covenant, or an oath of cursing or imprecation - that is, a curse. It is evidently used in the latter sense here. See Gesenius, "Lexicon" Daniel saw clearly that the evils which had been threatened by Moses <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a> had actually come upon the nation, and he as clearly saw that the cause of all these calamities was thai which Moses had specified. He, therefore, frankly and penitently confessed these sins in the name of the whole people, and earnestly supplicated for mercy. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/daniel/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11. all&#8212;(Ps 14:3; Ro 3:12).<p>the curse &#8230; and &#8230; oath &#8230; in &#8230; law&#8212;the curse against Israel, if disobedient, which God ratified by oath (Le 26:14-39; De 27:15-26; 28:15-68; 29:1-29).1.

This makes the gap great, and leaves none to stand in it.

Even God's professing people, on whom he had bestowed distinguishing favours and blessings, and gave them such a law as no other people had, and yet they transgressed it; not a few, or the greatest part only, but the whole body of them: and indeed there is no man that lives without sin, or the transgression of the law, in thought, word, or deeds; no, not a just man; but these transgressed the law in a very heinous manner, both the first as well as the second table of it, committing idolatry, and all manner of impiety, in which they continued: <p>even by departing, that they might not obey thy voice; by departing from the law, and the precepts of it; from God and his worship; from the temple of God, and the service of it; and from the tribes of Judah and Benjamin: it seems to have some respect to the separation of the ten tribes under Jeroboam, who set up the calves at Dan and Bethel, that the people might not obey the voice of the Lord, in going to worship at the solemn feasts in Jerusalem: <p>therefore the curse is poured upon us, and the oath that is written in the law of Moses the servant of God: that is, the just punishment of their sins was inflicted on them; or the curse the law threatened the transgressors of it with was come upon them in its large extent, and overflowed them like a flood; which God swore he would bring upon them, if they transgressed his law; or which they by an oath imprecated and pronounced upon themselves, should they not hearken to it, but transgress and disobey it: <p>because we have sinned against him; and therefore this curse was not a causeless one;

The prayer is resumed during the greater part of this verse.

The last clause is a lapse again into the narrative style. In the parallel passage in Baruch it is narrative throughout. This clause may easily have been a gloss added by a scribe and inserted in the text by a copyist. There may, however, simply be an error in the prenominal suffix. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/daniel/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(<a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/4-11.htm">Daniel 4:11-12</a>)<p>The messenger of God cried with might (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/3-4.htm">Daniel 3:4</a>), "as a sign of the strong, firm utterance of a purpose" (Kran.). The command, Hew it down, is not given to the angels (Hv., Hitz., Auberl.). The plur. here is to be regarded as impersonal: the tree shall be cut down. &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; stands for &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; according to the analogy of the verbs 3rd gutt., from &#1504;&#1514;&#1491;, to fall off, spoken of withering leaves. In consequence of the destruction of the tree, the beasts which found shelter under it and among its branches flee away. Yet the tree shall not be altogether destroyed, but its stock (v. 12 15) shall remain in the earth, that it may again afterwards spring up and grow into a tree. The stem is not the royalty, the dynasty which shall remain in the house of Nebuchadnezzar (Hv.), but the tree with its roots is Nebuchadnezzar, who shall as king be cut down, but shall as a man remain, and again shall grow into a king. But the stock must be bound "with a band of iron and brass." With these words, to complete which we must supply &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468; from the preceding context, the language passes from the type to the person represented by it. This transition is in the last part of the verse: with the beasts of the field let him have his portion in the grass of the earth; for this cannot be said of the stock with the roots, therefore these words are in the interpretation also (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-22.htm">Daniel 4:22</a> [25]) applied directly to Nebuchadnezzar. But even in the preceding passages this transition is not doubtful. Neither the words in the grass of the field, nor the being wet with the dew of heaven, are suitable as applied to the stock of the tree, because both expressions in that case would affirm nothing; still less is the band of iron and brass congruous, for the trunk of a tree is not wont to be surrounded with bands of iron in order to prevent its being rent in pieces and completely destroyed. Thus the words refer certainly to Nebuchadnezzar; but the fastening in brass and iron is not, with Jerome and others, to be understood of the binding of the madman with chains, but figuratively or spiritually of the withdrawal of free self-determination through the fetter of madness; cf. The fetters of affliction, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-10.htm">Psalm 107:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/36-8.htm">Job 36:8</a>. With this fettering also agrees the going forth under the open heaven among the grass of the field, and the being wet with the dew of heaven, without our needing thereby to think of the maniac as wandering about without any oversight over him. </body></html>
