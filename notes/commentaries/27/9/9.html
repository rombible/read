It must be our confession, the language of our convictions. Here is Daniel's humble, serious, devout address to God; in which he gives glory to him as a God to be feared, and as a God to be trusted. We should, in prayer, look both at God's greatness and his goodness, his majesty and mercy. Here is a penitent confession of sin, the cause of the troubles the people for so many years groaned under. All who would find mercy must thus confess their sins. Here is a self-abasing acknowledgment of the righteousness of God; and it is evermore the way of true penitents thus to justify God. Afflictions are sent to bring men to turn from their sins, and to understand God's truth. Here is a believing appeal to the mercy of God. It is a comfort that God has been always ready to pardon sin. It is encouraging to recollect that mercies belong to God, as it is convincing and humbling to recollect that righteousness belongs to him. There are abundant mercies in God, not only forgiveness, but forgivenesses. Here are pleaded the reproach God's people was under, and the ruins God's sanctuary was in. Sin is a reproach to any people, especially to God's people. The desolations of the sanctuary are grief to all the saints. Here is an earnest request to God to restore the poor captive Jews to their former enjoyments. O Lord, hearken and do. Not hearken and speak only, but hearken and do; do that for us which none else can do; and defer not. Here are several pleas and arguments to enforce the petitions. Do it for the Lord Christ's sake; Christ is the Lord of all. And for his sake God causes his face to shine upon sinners when they repent, and turn to him. In all our prayers this must be our plea, we must make mention of his righteousness, even of his only. The humble, fervent, believing earnestness of this prayer should ever be followed by us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/daniel/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>To the Lord our God belong mercies and forgivenesses - Not only does righteousness belong to him in the sense that he has done right, and that he cannot be blamed for what he has done, but mercy and forgiveness belong to him in the sense that he only can pardon, and that these are attributes of his nature.<p>Though we have rebelled against him - The word used here and rendered "though" (&#1499;&#1497;  k&#305;&#770;y) may mean either "though" or "for." That is, the passage may mean that mercy belongs to God, and we may hope that he will show it, "although" we have been so evil and rebellious; or it may mean that it belongs to him, and he only can show it, "for" we have rebelled against him; that is, our only hope now is in his mercy, "for" we have sinned, and forfeited all claims to his favor. Either of these interpretations makes good sense, but the latter would seem to be most in accordance with the general strain of this part of the prayer, which is to make humble and penitent confession. So the Latin Vulgate "quia." So Theodotion, &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;  hoti. So Luther and Lengerke, "denn." In the same way, the passage in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-11.htm">Psalm 25:11</a> is rendered, "For thy name's sake, O Lord, pardon mine iniquity, for (&#1499;&#1497;  k&#305;&#770;y) it is great" - though this passage will admit of the other interpretation, "although it is great." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/daniel/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. mercies&#8212;The plural intensifies the force; mercy manifold and exhibited in countless ways. As it is humbling to recollect "righteousness belongeth unto God," so it is comforting, that "mercies belong to the Lord OUR God."<p>though we have rebelled&#8212;rather, "since," &c. [Vulgate], (Ps 25:11). Our punishment is not inconsistent with His "mercies," since we have rebelled against Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/daniel/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> How did God show himself merciful, when he punished them so severely? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Answ.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

Mercy is his nature, and what he delights in; it is abundant, and he is plenteous in it the fountain of mercy is with him, and numerous are the streams which flow from it, called "the multitude of his tender mercies"; all temporal favours spring from hence, and so do all spiritual blessings, the sure mercies of David; and particularly the forgiveness of sin, which is the Lord's prerogative, and is according to the tender mercies of our God, and the riches of his grace; and is of all sins, and of all sorts of sinners; he doth abundantly pardon all that apply to him for it, and forgives all trespasses; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/130-4.htm">Psalm 130:4</a>, <p>though we have rebelled against him: there is mercy with the Lord, and forgiveness with him, even for rebellious ones; which is an exaggeration and illustration of his pardoning grace and mercy: or, "for we have sinned against him" (g); so that it is a plain case that he is merciful and has forgiven our iniquities, since he has spared us, and not destroyed us, and now is about to put an end to our captivity, according to his promise; and if he had not mercy on us, and did not forgive our sins, we must perish in them, and there would be no hope of salvation for us. <p>(g)  "quia rebellavimus", Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator, Polanus, Cocceius, Michaelis. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/daniel/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">To the Lord our God belong mercies and forgivenesses, though we have rebelled against him;</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/daniel/9.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">9</span>. <span class="ital">mercies</span>] The word often rendered ‘tender mercies’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-6.htm" title="Remember, O LORD, your tender mercies and your loving kindnesses; for they have been ever of old.">Psalm 25:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-11.htm" title="Withhold not you your tender mercies from me, O LORD: let your loving kindness and your truth continually preserve me.">Psalm 40:11</a>, &c.).

There is a change here which has the appearance of marking an interpolation. The prayer ceases, and an explanatory narrative begins. In content it resembles the parallel passage in Bar. 1, but is much briefer, and therefore more likely to be the older. "Forgivenesses" occurs only here and <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-17.htm">Nehemiah 9:17</a> in a prayer that otherwise seems borrowed from that before us. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/daniel/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-9.htm">Daniel 4:9</a>)<p>At the same time the tree abounded with leaves and fruit, so that birds and beasts found shadow, protection, and nourishment from it. &#1513;&#1473;&#1490;&#1497;&#1488;, neither great nor many, but powerful, expressing the quantity and the greatness of the fruit. The &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468; the Masoretes have rightly connected with &#1500;&#1499;&#1500;&#1468;&#1488;, to which it is joined by Maqqeph. The meaning is not: food was in it, the tree had food for all (Hv., Maur., and others), but: (it had) food for all in it, i.e., dwelling within its district (Kran., Klief.). The words, besides, do not form an independent sentence, but are only a further view of the &#1513;&#1473;&#1490;&#1497;&#1488; (Kran.), and return in the end of the verse into further expansion, while the first and the second clauses of the second hemistich give the further expansion of the first clause in the verse. &#1488;&#1496;&#1500;&#1500;, umbram captavit, enjoyed the shadow; in Targg. The Aphel has for the most part the meaning obumbravit. The Kethiv &#1497;&#1491;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503; is not to be changed, since the &#1510;&#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1503; is gen. comm. The Keri is conform to <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/4-18.htm">Daniel 4:18</a>, where the word is construed as fem. The expression all flesh comprehends the beasts of the field and the fowls of heaven, but is chosen with reference to men represented under this image. For the tree, mighty, reaching even to the heavens, and visible over the whole earth, is an easily recognised symbol of a world-ruler whose power stretches itself over the whole earth. The description of the growth and of the greatness of the tree reminds us of the delineation of Pharaoh and his power under the figure of a mighty cedar of Lebanon, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-3.htm">Ezekiel 31:3</a>., also <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-22.htm">Ezekiel 17:22</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/19-10.htm">Ezekiel 19:10</a>. The comparison of the growth of men to the growth of the trees is every frequent in biblical and other writings. </body></html>
