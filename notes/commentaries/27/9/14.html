(See <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-12.htm" title="Then said the LORD to me, You have well seen: for I will hasten my word to perform it.">Jeremiah 1:12</a>, &c.) He prays that as all the curses foretold by that prophet have been poured upon the nation, so also the release from the Captivity, which was also promised by him, may be accomplished also.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:4-19 In every prayer we must make confession, not only of the sins we have been guilty of, but of our faith in God, and dependence upon him, our sorrow for sin, and our resolutions against it. It must be our confession, the language of our convictions. Here is Daniel's humble, serious, devout address to God; in which he gives glory to him as a God to be feared, and as a God to be trusted. We should, in prayer, look both at God's greatness and his goodness, his majesty and mercy. Here is a penitent confession of sin, the cause of the troubles the people for so many years groaned under. All who would find mercy must thus confess their sins. Here is a self-abasing acknowledgment of the righteousness of God; and it is evermore the way of true penitents thus to justify God. Afflictions are sent to bring men to turn from their sins, and to understand God's truth. Here is a believing appeal to the mercy of God. It is a comfort that God has been always ready to pardon sin. It is encouraging to recollect that mercies belong to God, as it is convincing and humbling to recollect that righteousness belongs to him. There are abundant mercies in God, not only forgiveness, but forgivenesses. Here are pleaded the reproach God's people was under, and the ruins God's sanctuary was in. Sin is a reproach to any people, especially to God's people. The desolations of the sanctuary are grief to all the saints. Here is an earnest request to God to restore the poor captive Jews to their former enjoyments. O Lord, hearken and do. Not hearken and speak only, but hearken and do; do that for us which none else can do; and defer not. Here are several pleas and arguments to enforce the petitions. Do it for the Lord Christ's sake; Christ is the Lord of all. And for his sake God causes his face to shine upon sinners when they repent, and turn to him. In all our prayers this must be our plea, we must make mention of his righteousness, even of his only. The humble, fervent, believing earnestness of this prayer should ever be followed by us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/daniel/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Therefore hath the Lord watched upon the evil - The word here used and rendered watched - &#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1491;  sha&#770;qad - means, properly, "to wake; to be sleepless; to watch." Then it means to watch over anything, or to be attentive to it. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-12.htm">Jeremiah 1:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-28.htm">Jeremiah 31:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-27.htm">Jeremiah 44:27</a>. - Gesenius, "Lexicon" The meaning here is, that the Lord had not been inattentive to the progress of things, nor unmindful of his threatening. He had never slumbered, but had carefully observed the course of events, and had been attentive to all that they had done, and to all that he had threatened to do. The practical "truth" taught here - and it is one of great importance to sinners - is, that God is not inattentive to their conduct, though he may seem to be, and that in due time he will show that he has kept an unslumbering eye upon them. See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/18-4.htm">Isaiah 18:4</a>.<p>For the Lord our God is righteous in all his works ... - This is the language of a true penitent; language which is always used by one who has right feelings when he reflects on the Divine dealings toward him. God is seen to be righteous in his law and in his dealings, and the only reason why we suffer is that we have sinned. This will be found to be true always; and whatever calamities we suffer, it should he a fixed principle with us to "ascribe righteousness to our Maker," <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/36-3.htm">Job 36:3</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/daniel/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14. watched upon the evil&#8212;expressing ceaseless vigilance that His people's sins might not escape His judgment, as a watchman on guard night and day (Job 14:16; Jer 31:28; 44:27). God watching upon the Jews' punishment forms a striking contrast to the Jews' slumbering in their sins.<p>God is righteous&#8212;True penitents "justify" God, "ascribing righteousness to Him," instead of complaining of their punishment as too severe (Ne 9:33; Job 36:3; Ps 51:4; La 3:39-42).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/daniel/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Therefore hath the Lord watched:</span> this notes, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

The Peshitta, when one remembers the different division of the verses, is also identical. There is an obvious resemblance here to <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-27.htm">Jeremiah 44:27</a>, "Behold, I am watching over you for evil, and not for good." The verb <span class="accented">shaqad is</span> somewhat rare, occurring only twelve times in Scripture, and five of these times in Jeremiah. It is not always an evil watching; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-28.htm">Jeremiah 31:28</a> the two meanings are contrasted. Then follows an acknowledgment of the righteousness of God in so dealing with them Bar. 2:9 is really a version of this verse; the original Hebrew would be almost identical. There are few indications which, did this verse stand alone, would enable one to decide which is the more primitive. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/daniel/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-14.htm">Daniel 4:14</a>)<p>The divine messenger concludes his announcement with the words that the matter was unchangeably decreed, for this purpose, that men might be led to recognise the supremacy of the Most High over the kings of the earth. The first two passages have no verb, and thus the verb. substant. must be supplied. Accordingly we must not translate: by the decree of the watchers is the message, i.e., is it delivered (Kran.), nor: the decree is included in the fate, the unalterable will of Heaven (Hv.); but  &#1489;denotes the department within which the &#1490;&#1468;&#1494;&#1512;&#1492; lies, and is to be translated: "the message consists in, or rests on, the decree of the watchers." &#1490;&#1468;&#1494;&#1512;&#1492;, the unchangeable decision, the decretum divinum, quod homini aut rebus humanis tanquam inevitabile impositum est (Buxtorf's Lex. talm. rabb. p. 419), the Fatum in which the Chaldeans believed. Regarding &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1490;&#1468;&#1501; see under <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/3-16.htm">Daniel 3:16</a>. Here the fundamental meaning, the message, that which is to happen, can be maintained. The second member is synonymous, and affirms the same thing in another way. The word, the utterance of the holy ones, i.e., the watchers (see under <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-13.htm">Daniel 4:13</a>), is &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1488;, the matter. The meaning lying in the etymon, request or question, is not here suitable, but only the derivative meaning, matter as the object of the request or inquiry. The thing meant is that which is decided regarding the tree, that it should be cut down, etc. This is so clear, that a pronoun referring to it appears superfluous.<p>&#1491;&#1468;&#1497; &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1514; &#1506;&#1491;, till the matter that ... to the end that; not  equals  &#1491;&#1468;&#1497; &#1506;&#1491;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/4-25.htm">Daniel 4:25</a>, because here no defining of time goes before. The changing of &#1506;&#1491; into &#1506;&#1500; (Hitz.) is unnecessary and arbitrary. That the living may know, etc. The expression is general, because it is not yet said who is to be understood by the tree which should be cut down. This general expression is in reality correct; for the king comes by experience to this knowledge, and so all will attain to it who consider this. The two last passages of <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-14.htm">Daniel 4:14</a> express more fully how the Most High manifests His supremacy over the kingdom of men. The Kethiv &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492; is shortened from &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492;&#1488;, and in the Keri is yet further shortened by the rejection of the ;&#1497; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/5-21.htm">Daniel 5:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-4.htm">Daniel 7:4</a>., etc. </body></html>
