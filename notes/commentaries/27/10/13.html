If we were without a revelation, we should have thought it congruent that God Himself should direct all events in the world without using any intervening means. But revelation points out that as spiritual beings carry out God’s purpose in the natural world (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-23.htm" title="For the LORD will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when he sees the blood on the lintel, and on the two side posts, the LORD will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come in to your houses to smite you.">Exodus 12:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-16.htm" title="And when the angel stretched out his hand on Jerusalem to destroy it, the LORD repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed the people, It is enough: stay now your hand. And the angel of the LORD was by the threshing place of Araunah the Jebusite.">2Samuel 24:16</a>) and in the moral world (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-10.htm" title="Likewise, I say to you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repents.">Luke 15:10</a>), so also they do in the political world. From this chapter we not only learn that Israel had a spiritual champion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-21.htm" title="But I will show you that which is noted in the scripture of truth: and there is none that holds with me in these things, but Michael your prince.">Daniel 10:21</a>) to protect her in her national life, and to watch over her interests, but also that the powers opposed to Israel had their princes, or saviours, which were antagonists of those which watched over Israel. The “princes” of the heathen powers are devils, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-20.htm" title="But I say, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God: and I would not that you should have fellowship with devils.">1Corinthians 10:20</a>. The doctrine of the ministry of angels is taught in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-7.htm" title="The angel of the LORD encamps round about them that fear him, and delivers them.">Psalm 34:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/91-11.htm" title="For he shall give his angels charge over you, to keep you in all your ways.">Psalm 91:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/96-5.htm" title="For all the gods of the nations are idols: but the LORD made the heavens.">Psalm 96:5</a> (LXX.); <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-21.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD shall punish the host of the high ones that are on high, and the kings of the earth on the earth.">Isaiah 24:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/46-2.htm" title="They stoop, they bow down together; they could not deliver the burden, but themselves are gone into captivity.">Isaiah 46:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-25.htm" title="The LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, said; Behold, I will punish the multitude of No, and Pharaoh, and Egypt, with their gods, and their kings; even Pharaoh, and all them that trust in him:">Jeremiah 46:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-3.htm" title="Howl, O Heshbon, for Ai is spoiled: cry, you daughters of Rabbah, gird you with sackcloth; lament, and run to and fro by the hedges; for their king shall go into captivity, and his priests and his princes together.">Jeremiah 49:3</a>. Further passages in the New Testament bearing upon the question are <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-5.htm" title="For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or in earth, (as there be gods many, and lords many,)">1Corinthians 8:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-16.htm" title=" For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:">Colossians 1:16</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Withstood me.—</span>The phrase is identical with <span class= "ital">“</span>stood over against him” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/5-13.htm" title="And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand: and Joshua went to him, and said to him, Are you for us, or for our adversaries?">Joshua 5:13</a>). The verse implies that the spiritual powers attached to Persia were influencing Cyrus in a manner that was prejudicial to the interests of God’s people. It must be borne in mind that the vision occurred at the time of the Samaritan intrigues with the Persian Court in opposition to Zerubbabel.<p><span class= "bld">Michael.—</span>Mentioned only in the Book of Daniel and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-9.htm" title="Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses, dared not bring against him a railing accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke you.">Jude 1:9</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-7.htm" title="And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels,">Revelation 12:7</a>. The title “chief princes,” rightly explained in the margin, shows that the charge of Israel had been entrusted by God to the highest of the heavenly powers; but the name “first prince” points out that, great though he is, he is inconsiderable when compared with God.<p><span class= "bld">I remained there.</span>—Literally, <span class= "ital">I prevailed there,</span> as <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-4.htm" title="Unstable as water, you shall not excel; because you went up to your father's bed; then defiled you it: he went up to my couch.">Genesis 49:4</a>. The person is explaining to Daniel how it had happened that he had received no visible answer to a prayer that had been offered with success three weeks previously. There had been a conflict between the powers of light and darkness, in which the former had gained the victory, which had been decisive. By the kings of Persia are meant all the successors of Cyrus. It may be remarked that from this time onward the Persian kings were, upon the whole, favourable to the interests of Israel.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/daniel/10.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/daniel/10-13.htm" title="But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days: but, see, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me; and I remained there with the kings of Persia....">Daniel 10:13-14</a></span>. <span class="ital">But the prince of the kingdom of Persia opposed me — </span>Hebrew, <span class="greekheb">עמד לנגדי</span>, <span class="ital">stood before me. — </span>Purver. And so Jun. and Tremel., referring it to an earthly prince. This is thought by some to be Cambyses, the son of Cyrus, intrusted with the management of affairs in the court of Persia when his father was absent on some expedition, and set against the Jews by their enemies, and now endeavouring to embarrass their affairs: over his designs the angel had been watching, in order to defeat them. Others have thought there is an allusion in this verse, and at <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-20.htm" title="Then said he, Know you why I come to you? and now will I return to fight with the prince of Persia: and when I am gone forth, see, the prince of Grecia shall come.">Daniel 10:20</a>, to the guardian, or tutelary angels, of different countries; which doctrine seems to be countenanced by some passages in Scripture, and especially by Zechariah, chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/6-5.htm" title="Then said these men, We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel, except we find it against him concerning the law of his God.">Daniel 6:5</a>. Grotius is of this opinion; and Bishop Newcome, on the last-mentioned place, refers to the passage before us. “That there were such tutelar angels,” says Lowth, “not only over private persons, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/12-15.htm" title="And they said to her, You are mad. But she constantly affirmed that it was even so. Then said they, It is his angel.">Acts 12:15</a>, but likewise over provinces and kingdoms, was an opinion generally received. The <span class="ital">four spirits, </span>mentioned <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/6-5.htm" title="And the angel answered and said to me, These are the four spirits of the heavens, which go forth from standing before the LORD of all the earth.">Zechariah 6:5</a>, seem to be the guardian angels of the four great empires.” This opinion supposes the presiding angels, here mentioned, to be good angels, but it is surely absurd to think that the holy angels are ever engaged in contending with each other; or that “one holy angel is set to oppose another holy angel.” — Scott. Others suppose the contest to be between a good and an evil angel, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/3-1.htm" title="And he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him.">Zechariah 3:1</a>, and Jude, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-9.htm" title="Yet heard I the voice of his words: and when I heard the voice of his words, then was I in a deep sleep on my face, and my face toward the ground.">Daniel 10:9</a>, “which latter opinion,” says Wintle, “is perhaps the most just, as there should seem to be no dispute, or contest, between the ministering spirits of heaven, who are always obedient to the pleasure of their Lord. And when the Almighty sent a superior angel, Michael, whose name is sometimes given to Christ himself, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-7.htm" title="And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels,">Revelation 12:7</a>, his office probably was to assist Gabriel in subduing <span class="ital">the prince of the power of the air, </span>the powers of this darksome world, or the <span class="ital">spirits that rule over the children of disobedience, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-2.htm" title="Wherein in time past you walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now works in the children of disobedience:">Ephesians 2:2</a>. The opposition was made twenty-one days; and as this was exactly the number of days that Daniel fasted, the contest may possibly have some allusion to this struggle. Daniel was certainly highly favoured, and the Almighty, who delights in hearing and answering the prayers of his servants, directs the angel to apologize (if I may so speak) for his delay in attending to the patient solicitations of the prophet: the angel also is represented as pleading the difficulty of his task, and another higher power, or chief, in the regal court of heaven, favours his business, and comes in to his assistance. In whatever light this is to be understood, it is a strong and affecting, though less gross, instance of the anthropopathia, or of the Deity’s accommodating himself and his measures to the manners of men.” See <span class="ital">De Sacra Poes. Hebrews, </span>Præl. 6. Houbigant is of opinion, that this <span class="ital">prince of the kingdom of Persia </span>was an evil angel, and in agreement with it renders the last clause of the verse, <span class="ital">and I have now left him on the side of the kings of Persia. </span>But it seems most proper to understand Cambyses as meant. <span class="ital">Now I am come to make thee understand, </span>&c. — I am now come to inform thee of what shall befall thy people hereafter; <span class="ital">for yet the vision is</span> <span class="ital">for many days — </span>For it will be a long course of time before the things I shall inform thee of shall come to pass.

How shall we, that are dust and ashes, speak to the Lord of glory? Nothing is more likely, nothing more effectual to revive the drooping spirits of the saints, than to be assured of God's love to them. From the very first day we begin to look toward God in a way of duty, he is ready to meet us in the way of mercy. Thus ready is God to hear prayer. When the angel had told the prophet of the things to come, he was to return, and oppose the decrees of the Persian kings against the Jews. The angels are employed as God's ministering servants, Heb 1:14. Though much was done against the Jews by the kings of Persia, God permitting it, much more mischief would have been done if God had not prevented it. He would now more fully show what were God's purposes, of which the prophecies form an outline; and we are concerned to study what is written in these Scriptures of truth, for they belong to our everlasting peace. While Satan and his angels, and evil counsellors, excite princes to mischief against the church, we may rejoice that Christ our Prince, and all his mighty angels, act against our enemies; but we ought not to expect many to favour us in this evil world. Yet the whole counsel of God shall be established; and let each one pray, Lord Jesus, be our righteousness now, and thou wilt be our everlasting confidence, through life, in death, at the day of judgment, and for evermore.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/daniel/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But the prince of the kingdom of Persia - In explaining this very difficult verse it may be proper<p>(1) to consider the literal sense of the words;<p>(2) to deduce the fair meaning of the passage as thus explained; and<p>(3) to notice the practical truths taught.<p>The word rendered "prince" - &#1513;&#1474;&#1512;  s'ar - means, properly, a leader, commander, chief, as of troops, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/21-22.htm">Genesis 21:22</a>; of a king's body-guard, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/37-36.htm">Genesis 37:36</a>; of cup-bearers, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-9.htm">Genesis 41:9</a>; of a prison, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/39-21.htm">Genesis 39:21-22</a>; of a flock, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/47-6.htm">Genesis 47:6</a>. Then it means a prince, a noble, a chief in the state, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-15.htm">Genesis 12:15</a>. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/8-25.htm">Daniel 8:25</a>, in the phrase "Prince of princes," it refers to God. So far as the word is concerned in the phrase "prince of the kingdom of Persia," it might refer to a prince ruling over that kingdom, or to a prime minister of the state; but the language also is such that it is applicable to an angelic being supposed to preside over a state, or to influence its counsels. If this idea is admitted; if it is believed that angels do thus preside over particular states, this language would properly express that fact. Gesenius (Lexicon) explains it in this passage as denoting the "chiefs, princes, and angels; i. e., the archangels acting as patrons and advocates of particular nations before God." That this is the proper meaning here as deduced from the words is apparent, for<p>(a) it is an angel that is speaking, and it would seem most natural to suppose that he had encountered one of his own rank;<p>(b) the mention of Michael who came to his aid - a name which, as we shall see, properly denotes an angel, leads to the same conclusion;<p>(c) it accords, also, with the prevailing belief on the subject.<p>Undoubtedly, one who takes into view all the circumstances referred to in this passage would most naturally understand this of an angelic being, having some kind of jurisdiction over the kingdom of Persia. What was the character of this "prince," however, whether he was a good or bad angel, is not intimated by the language. It is only implied that he had a chieftainship, or some species of guardian care over that kingdom - watching over its interests and directing its affairs. As he offered resistance, however, to this heavenly messenger on his way to Daniel, as it was necessary to counteract his plans, and as the aid of Michael was required to overcome his opposition, the fair construction is, that he belonged to the class of evil angels.<p>Withstood me - Hebrew, "stood over against me." Vulgate, "restitit mihi." The fair meaning is, that he resisted or opposed him; that he stood over against him, and delayed him on his way to Daniel. In what manner he did this is not stated. The most obvious interpretation is, that, in order to answer the prayers of Daniel in respect to his people, it was necessary that some arrangement should be made in reference to the kingdom of Persia - influencing the government to be favorable to the restoration of the Jews to their own land; or removing some obstacles to such return - obstacles which had given Daniel such disquietude, and which had been thrown in his way by the presiding angel of that kingdom.<p>One and twenty days - During the whole time in which Daniel was engaged in fasting and prayer <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/10-2.htm">Daniel 10:2-3</a>. The angel had been sent forth to make arrangements to secure the answer to his prayer when he began to pray, but had been delayed during all that time by the opposition which he had met with in Persia. That is, it required all that time to overcome the obstacles existing there to the accomplishment of these purposes, and to make those arrangements which were necessary to secure the result. Mean-time, Daniel, not knowing that these arrangements were in a process of completion, or that an angel was employed to secure the answer to his prayers, yet strong in faith, was suffered to continue his supplications with no intimation that his prayers were heard, or that he would be answered. How many arrangements may there be in progress designed to answer our prayers of which we know nothing! How many agents may be employed to bring about an answer! What mighty obstacles may be in a process of removal, and what changes may be made, and what influences exerted, while we are suffered to pray, and fast, and weep, amidst many discouragements, and many trials of our faith and patience! For a much longer period than Daniel was engaged in his devotions, may we be required often now to pray before the arrangements in the course of Providence shall be so far complete that we shall receive an answer to our supplications, for the things to be done may extend far into future months or years.<p>But, lo, Michael, one of the chief princes - Margin, "the first." That is, the first in rank of the "princes," or the angels. In other words, Michael, the archangel." The proper meaning of this name (&#1502;&#1497;&#1499;&#1488;&#1500;  m&#305;&#770;yka&#770;'e&#770;l) is, "Who as God," and is a name given, undoubtedly, from some resemblance to God. The exact reason why it is given is not anywhere stated; but may it not be this - that one looking on the majesty and glory of the chief of the angels would instinctively ask, "Who, after all, is like God? Even this lofty angel, with all his glory, cannot be compared to the high and lofty One." Whatever may have been the reason of the appellation, however, the name in the Scriptures has a definite application, and is given to the chief one of the angels. Compare the notes at Jde 1:9. The word "Michael," as a proper name, occurs several times in the Scriptures, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-13.htm">Numbers 13:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-13.htm">1 Chronicles 5:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-40.htm">1 Chronicles 6:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-3.htm">1 Chronicles 7:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-16.htm">1 Chronicles 8:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-20.htm">1 Chronicles 12:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/27-18.htm">1 Chronicles 27:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-2.htm">2 Chronicles 21:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/8-8.htm">Ezra 8:8</a>.

This verse gives the reason why, though Daniel's "words were heard from the first day" (Da 10:12), the good angel did not come to him until more than three weeks had elapsed (Da 10:4).<p>one and twenty days&#8212;answering to the three weeks of Daniel's mourning (Da 10:2).<p>Michael&#8212;that is, "Who is like God?"

Which was just the time Daniel had been mourning and fasting, <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/10-2.htm">Daniel 10:2</a>, and the angel had had his instructions to acquaint him with the Lord's answer to his prayers: by "the prince of the kingdom of Persia" is not to be understood the then reigning king of Persia, Cyrus, or his son Cambyses; who either of them would have been called rather king of Persia; nor were they able to withstand an angel, and such an one as Gabriel; nor is a good angel meant, the tutelar one of this kingdom; for it cannot be reasonably thought that good angels should militate against one another; but an evil angel, either Satan, the prince and god of this world, or one of his principal angels under him, employed by him to do what mischief he could in the court of Persia, against the people of God, the Jews; and with this sense agree the contests ascribed to Satan and the Angel of the Lord concerning Joshua, <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/3-1.htm">Zechariah 3:1</a> and to Michael and the devil disputing about the body of Moses, Jde 1:9 and to Michael and his angels, and the devil and his angels, warring in heaven, <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/12-7.htm">Revelation 12:7</a>, now Gabriel's business in the court of Persia was to work upon the minds of the king of Persia and his nobles, and to influence their counsels, and put them on such measures as would be in favour of the Jews, and be encouraging to them to go on in the rebuilding of their city and temple: in this he was withstood and opposed by an evil spirit that counterworked him; by exasperating the spirit of Cambyses against them; by stirring up the Samaritans to corrupt the Persian courtiers with gifts, to take their part against the Jews; and by influencing them to accept of their gifts, and act in their favour; and this business on the angel's hands, to oppose these measures, detained him at the Persian court for the three weeks Daniel had been fasting and praying: <p>but, lo, Michael one of the chief Princes, came to help me; called in the New Testament an Archangel, the Prince of angels, the Head of all principality and power; and is no other than Christ the Son of God, an uncreated Angel; who is "one", or "the first of the chief Princes" (x), superior to angels, in nature, name, and office; he came to "help" Gabriel, not as a fellow creature, but as the Lord of hosts; not as a fellow soldier, but as General of the armies in heaven and earth, as superior to him in wisdom and strength; and he helped him by giving him fresh counsels, orders, and instructions, which he following succeeded: <p>and I remained there with the kings of Persia; with the king of Persia and his nobles, putting into execution the orders Michael had given him, and so baffled the designs of the evil spirit; and this retarded him from being with the prophet one and twenty days. The Septuagint and Arabic versions very wrongly render the words, "and I left him there with the kings of Persia"; as if Michael was left there by Gabriel, whereas it was just the reverse. <p>(x) "primus", Junius &amp; Tremellius. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/daniel/10.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But the <span class="cverse3">{h}</span> prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days: but, lo, <span class="cverse3">{i}</span> Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me; and I remained there with the kings of Persia.</span><p>(h) Meaning Cambyses, who reigned in his father's absence, and did not only for this time hinder the building of the temple, but would have further raged, if God had not sent me to resist him: and therefore I have stayed for the profit of the Church.<p>(i) Even though God could by one angel destroy all the world, yet to assure his children of his love he sends forth double power, even Michael, that is, Christ Jesus the head of angels.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/daniel/10.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">13</span>.

The doctrine of tutelary angels, presiding over the destinies of particular nations, though there appears a trace of the idea in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-21.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD shall punish the host of the high ones that are on high, and the kings of the earth on the earth.">Isaiah 24:21</a>, and according to some commentators, in Psalms 82, is found for the first time distinctly in the O.T. in this prophecy of Dan. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-13.htm" title="But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days: but, see, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me; and I remained there with the kings of Persia.">Daniel 10:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/daniel/10-20.htm" title="Then said he, Know you why I come to you? and now will I return to fight with the prince of Persia: and when I am gone forth, see, the prince of Grecia shall come....">Daniel 10:20-21</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/11-1.htm" title="Also I in the first year of Darius the Mede, even I, stood to confirm and to strengthen him.">Daniel 11:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/12-1.htm" title="And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince which stands for the children of your people: and there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time: and at that time your people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book.">Daniel 12:1</a>). In the earlier books of the O.T. angels appear merely as the ‘messengers’ of Jehovah, with little or no personal character or distinctness of their own: in the later books of the O.T. grades and differences begin to be recognised among them; particular angels are appropriated to particular purposes or functions; and they begin to receive individual names (see below). The origin of the idea of patron-angels is matter of conjecture: even as applied to Israel, it evidently signifies more than is implied in such passages as <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-20.htm" title="Behold, I send an Angel before you, to keep you in the way, and to bring you into the place which I have prepared.">Exodus 23:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-23.htm" title="For my Angel shall go before you, and bring you in to the Amorites, and the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites: and I will cut them off.">Exodus 23:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-34.htm" title="Therefore now go, lead the people to the place of which I have spoken to you: behold, my Angel shall go before you: nevertheless in the day when I visit I will visit their sin on them.">Exodus 32:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-2.htm" title="And I will send an angel before you; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite:">Exodus 33:2</a> (which speak of an angel leading Israel to its home in Canaan). According to some (see the art. Angel in the <span class="ital">Encycl. Biblica</span>, col. 108), they are the ancient ‘gods of the nations,’—which, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-26.htm" title="For they went and served other gods, and worshipped them, gods whom they knew not, and whom he had not given to them:">Deuteronomy 29:26</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-19.htm" title="Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was astonished for one hour, and his thoughts troubled him.

Angel in Hastings’ <span class="ital">Dict. of the Bible</span>, p. 96 <span class="ital">b</span>), the idea is due to the tendencies which arose in later times, (1) of conceiving God as ruling the world by intermediate agencies, and (2) of personifying abstract conceptions, such as the ‘spirit,’ or genius, of a nation, and of locating such personified forces in the supersensible world, whence they ruled the destinies of men. Other passages in which the same idea is found are <a href="http://apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/17-17.htm" title="For in the division of the nations of the whole earth he set a ruler over every people; but Israel is the Lord's portion:">Sir 17:17</a> <span class="greekheb">ἑκάστῳ ἔθνει κατέστησεν ἡγούμενον</span>); and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-8.htm" title="When the Most High divided to the nations their inheritance, when he separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of Israel.">Deuteronomy 32:8</a> LXX. (‘he fixed the borders of the peoples according to the number <span class="ital">of the sons of God</span> [<span class="greekheb">אל</span> for <span class="greekheb">ישראל</span>],’ a reading thought by some moderns to be the original). The later Jews developed the doctrine further, teaching, for instance, that each of the 70 nations mentioned in Genesis 10 had its Angel-Prince, who defended its interests, and pleaded its cause with God (cf. the Targ. of Ps.-Jon. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/11-7.htm" title="Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech....">Genesis 11:7-8</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-8.htm" title="When the Most High divided to the nations their inheritance, when he separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of Israel.">Deuteronomy 32:8</a>; and Weber, <span class="ital">System der Altsynag.

The idea of the passage is that the fortunes of nations are determined by the angels representing them in heaven: the success or failure of these regulating the success or failure of the nations themselves. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-21.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD shall punish the host of the high ones that are on high, and the kings of the earth on the earth.">Isaiah 24:21</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>As was remarked in the last note but one, it is not till the later books of the O.T. that angels begin to receive names.

Enoch lxxxi. 5 ‘those seven holy ones,’ xc. 21, 22] which present the prayers of the saints’ to God. In 2 (4) Esdr. 4:1, 5:20, 10:28, Uriel is mentioned; and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-36.htm" title="At the same time my reason returned to me; and for the glory of my kingdom, my honor and brightness returned to me; and my counsellors and my lords sought to me; and I was established in my kingdom, and excellent majesty was added to me.">Daniel 4:36</a> (R.V.) Jeremiel, the ‘archangel.’ In the book of Enoch many names of angels occur: in ix. 1 [see the Greek text, in Charles’ ed., p. 333] and elsewhere, Michael, Uriel, Raphael, and Gabriel; in xx. 1–7 (p. 356f., Charles) the names and offices of seven principal angels, or ‘archangels,’ are enumerated (Uriel, Raphael, Raguel, Michael, Sariel, Gabriel, and Remeiel); in xl. 2–10, those of four principal angels, called here ‘presences’ (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-9.htm" title="In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the angel of his presence saved them: in his love and in his pity he redeemed them; and he bore them, and carried them all the days of old.">Isaiah 63:9</a>), Michael, Rufael (Raphael), Gabriel, and Phanuel (<span class="greekheb">פנואל</span>): the names of many fallen angels, who seduced the children of men (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-2.htm" title="That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.">Genesis 6:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-5.htm" title="And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.">Genesis 6:5</a>), are also given (vi. 7, viii. 1–3, lxix. 1–15, &c.).

Cf. Judges 9, where Michael is called the ‘archangel.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Michael is the warrior-angel (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-7.htm" title="And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels,">Revelation 12:7</a>), whose special office it is to protect the interests of Israel; in Enoch xx. 5 he is described as <span class="greekheb">ὁ εῖς τῶν ἁγίων ἀγγέλων ὃς ἐπὶ τῶν τοῦ λαοῦ ἀγαθῶν τέτακται</span> [<span class="greekheb">καὶ</span>] <span class="greekheb">ἐπὶ τῷ λαῷ</span>; in the Assumption of Moses x. 2 (ed. Charles, 1897) he appears to be the ‘angel’ who avenges Israel on their enemies at the end of the world; in the legend quoted in Judges 9 (see the patristic quotations, in Charles, <span class="ital">l. c.</span> p. 106 ff.), it is he who, as the angelic patron of Israel, defends the body of Moses against the devil (who claims it on the ground that Moses has been guilty of the murder of the Egyptians).

The rendering of the LXX. is, "And the general (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>) of the King of the Persians withstood me one and twenty days, and behold Michael, one of the first princes, came to help me, and I left him there with the general of the King of the Persians." The sense of Theedotion is nearly the same as the LXX., only he has <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> instead of <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>. Like the LXX., Thee-dotion declares that Michael was left with the Prince of Persia. The Peshitta agrees more with the Massoretic, but, like the LXX. and Theedotion, it is with the "Prince" of Persia that there is some one remaining. The Peshitta here, in opposition to the Greek versions, has the statement that Gabriel remained, not Michael. The Vulgate agrees still further with the Massoretic, only instead of the plural "kings," it has "king." The most important differences are in the last clause, where the LXX. and Theodotion must have had the hiphil of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;&#x5b4;&#x5e8;</span> where the Massoretic has the niphal. Gratz adopts this reading, which certainly has the advantage of making sense of an otherwise unintelligible passage. Professor Bevan, in his easy way, suggests this to be probably a mere guess, the insertion of <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>, and the substitution of a transitive for an intransitive verb are quite in the manner of the LXX. translators. He forgets that Theodotion also has this variation, and also that, without any justification from the versions, he himself has suggested various readings. He does not observe that this interpretation affords a reason for Gabriel's presence with Daniel. Michael relieved him in his opposition to the Prince of Persia. The other variant, "prince" instead of "king," has the support of all the versions. <span class="accented">But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days.</span> That is to say, during the whole of Daniel's fast. The angelology of later Judaism is a very complicated, not to say confused, subject. The angelology of one age is not that of another; and the angelology of the Jews in one country is not that of the Jews in another. The Jews themselves understood that the Babylonian captivity did a great deal to develop the doctrine of the angels; the Jewish tradition was that they brought back from Babylon the names of the angels. Not only had their residence in Babylon defined the Jewish ideas as to the names f the angels, they began to have clearer ideas of their functions. They reached the idea that every race had its guardian angel. This view is expressed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-8.htm">Deuteronomy 32:8</a>, according to the Septuagint, "He set bounds for the nations according to the number of the angels of God." To a similar purport is Ecclus. 17:17, "To each of the nations he appointed a leader, and Israel is the portion of the Lord." There seems, however, a preparation for this in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-21.htm">Isaiah 24:21</a> (comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/29-1.htm">Psalm 29:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-9.htm">Psalm 106:9</a>). As independent of revelation there is a strong inherent probability that there are races of beings of intelligence and might vastly superior to man, there is nothing inherently improbable in these intelligences being employed by the Almighty in furthering his providential scheme. Men are instruments of God; is it not at least not improbable that, if there are angels, they, too, co-operate with God in the working out of his great purpose? That every nation should have an angelic prince over it is not more extraordinary than that every Church should have a special angel over it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-20.htm">Revelation 1:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-2.htm">Revelation 2:2</a>, etc.). That there should be conflicts between these angelic princes is simply to say they are finite. Hitzig's reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-7.htm">Revelation 12:7</a> is not to the point, for there is no indication of warlike opposition here. By the indications here, we might judge that the opposition of the Prince of Persia was to the coming of Gabriel to reveal to Daniel the purpose of God. We know nothing of the means employed in the opposition, or of the reason of it. Keil and Kliefoth have the idea that Gabriel was striving to influence the King of Persia, but was hindered in his efforts by the "Prince of Persia;" this is scarcely berne out by the context. <span class="accented">But</span>, <span class="accented">lo</span>, <span class="accented">Michael</span>, <span class="accented">one of the chief princes</span>, <span class="accented">came to help</span> me. Michael ("Who is like God?") is, in the twenty-first verse, declared to be the "prince" of the Jewish people, therefore equivalent to "the captain of the host of the Lord" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/5-14.htm">Joshua 5:14</a>). He is referred to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-7.htm">Revelation 12:7</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-9.htm">Jude 1:9</a>. Where he is called one of "the chief princes," there is reference to an angelic hierarchy, whether the same as that we find developed in the Book of Enoch or not cannot be decided certainly. In the Book of Tobit 12:15 Raphael declares himself "one of the seven holy angels who present the prayers of the saints, and who go in and out before the glory of the Holy One." The Book of Tobit seems to have been written about  <span class="date">B.C. 400</span>; hence this is an indication of opinion before the Books of Enoch. In the Enoch books not only are the great  angels mentioned, but their names arc given, and functions are assigned to them; but they are numbered as four, not seven. Enoch is posterior to Tobit, and finds a place for Michael, Raphael, and Gabriel. We have no means of testing whether the number of the chief angelic princes, of whom Michael was one, was four or seven, according to the opinion of Daniel. From the fact that Enoch is, so to speak, in the direct line of apocalyptic descent from Daniel, and Tobit is not, and, moreover, as the angelology of Tobit is in close connection with the Persian hierarchy of <span class="accented">am-haspentas</span>, of which there were seven, - we may regard four as the more genuinely Jewish number. The later Jewish angel-elegy has many Persian elements, as shown by Dr. Kohut, in his 'Angelologie und Demonologie.' Whether the number of the archangels be made four or seven, both Gabriel and Michael are of the number, whereas Gabriel's words would rather indicate that, though Michael belonged to the rank of chief prince, he did not. As we cannot tell the nature of the opposition, we cannot tell the nature of the help afforded. <span class="accented">And I remained there with the kings of Persia.</span> It is very difficult to interpret this if we retain the Massoretic reading. In the first place, the sense given to <span class="accented">nothartee</span> in the Authorized and Revised is unsuitable. The angel is explaining how, after having delayed three whole weeks, he has now come. The sentence, as interpreted above,would have explained why he could not come at all to Daniel. It is attempted to get over this by explaining that Gabriel had beaten off the "Prince" of Persia, and that Michael remained with the King of Persia instead of him. This view, however, contradicts the function assigned to angels of nations, and implies a quasi-omnipresence on the part of Gabriel, and would render his explanation no explanation. The explanation of Gesenius, Havernick, and yon Lengerke, that <span class="accented">nothartee</span> is to be taken as meaning "I received the pre-eminence," as Wirier, "superior discessi apud reges Persarum," has no justification in usage. Gescnius would bring in the Syriac use of the hithpael of this verb, but though both Castell and Brockehuann assign meanings suitable, none of their quotations represents a sense precisely similar to that assigned to the verb here Hitzig's interpretation, "I was delayed," fails to explain his coming. Ewald's explanation, "I was superfluous," is logical, but has no grammatical justification. Professor Bevan's explanation, which would take this last clause as parenthetical, is untenable, as it supplies no redden for the presence of Gabriel with Daniel. We must follow the LXX. and Theodotion in reading, either as Meinhold and Behrmann, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span> or better, as Gratz, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b9;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>, as the <span class="accented">vav </span>in the former ease would naturally be read conversively. Besides, Gratz's reading explains the needlessly emphatic <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>. Further, it seems needful to accept the reading of the two Greek versions and the Peshitta, and instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span> read <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5d3;</span>. None of the old versions support the Massoretic; the Vulgate is the nearest; and all of them have either read <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5b6;&#x5da;</span> or regarded <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5dc;&#x5db;&#x5d9;</span> as a form of the construct state, and so vocalized differently. Further, the later context here implies the contiuance of the conflict or controversy (vers. 20, 21). We must understand, then, that Gabriel left Michael to maintain the conflict against the angelic "Prince" of Persia, while he came in obedience to Daniel's prayer. We can have but little idea of what is meant by this conflict in the heavenlies between angelic beings. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/daniel/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>&#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1468;&#1488; (the king) stands absolutely, because the impression made by the occurrence on the king is to be depicted. The plur. &#1494;&#1497;&#1493;&#1492;&#1497; has an intensive signification: the colour of the countenance. Regarding &#1494;&#1497;&#1493;, see under <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-33.htm">Daniel 4:33</a>. The suffix to &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1493;&#1492;&#1497; is to be taken in the signification of the dative, since &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1488; in the Peal occurs only intransitively. The connection of an intransitive verb with the suff. accus. is an inaccuracy for which &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-7.htm">Ezekiel 47:7</a>, and perhaps also &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/29-3.htm">Ezekiel 29:3</a>, afford analogies; cf. Ewald's Lehrb. 315b. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/5-9.htm">Daniel 5:9</a>, where the matter is repeated, the harshness is avoided, and &#1506;&#1500;&#1493;&#1492;&#1497; is used to express the change of colour yet more strongly. The meaning is: "the king changed colour as to his countenance, became pale from terror, and was so unmanned by fear and alarm, that his body lost its firmness and vigour." The bands or ligaments of his thighs (&#1495;&#1512;&#1509;, equivalent to the Hebr. &#1495;&#1500;&#1510;&#1497;&#1501;) were loosed, i.e., lost the strength to hold his body, and his knees smote one against another. &#1488;&#1512;&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1488; with  &#1488;prosth., for &#1512;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1488;, in the Targg. means the knee. The alarm was heightened by a bad conscience, which roused itself and filled him with dark forebodings. Immediately the king commanded the magicians to be brought, and promised a great reward to him who would read and interpret the mysterious writing. </body></html>
