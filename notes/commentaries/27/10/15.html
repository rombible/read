How shall we, that are dust and ashes, speak to the Lord of glory? Nothing is more likely, nothing more effectual to revive the drooping spirits of the saints, than to be assured of God's love to them. From the very first day we begin to look toward God in a way of duty, he is ready to meet us in the way of mercy. Thus ready is God to hear prayer. When the angel had told the prophet of the things to come, he was to return, and oppose the decrees of the Persian kings against the Jews. The angels are employed as God's ministering servants, Heb 1:14. Though much was done against the Jews by the kings of Persia, God permitting it, much more mischief would have been done if God had not prevented it. He would now more fully show what were God's purposes, of which the prophecies form an outline; and we are concerned to study what is written in these Scriptures of truth, for they belong to our everlasting peace. While Satan and his angels, and evil counsellors, excite princes to mischief against the church, we may rejoice that Christ our Prince, and all his mighty angels, act against our enemies; but we ought not to expect many to favour us in this evil world. Yet the whole counsel of God shall be established; and let each one pray, Lord Jesus, be our righteousness now, and thou wilt be our everlasting confidence, through life, in death, at the day of judgment, and for evermore.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/daniel/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And when he had spoken such words ... - Daniel was naturally overcome by the communication which had been made to him. The manner in which the prayer was answered seems to have been entirely different from what he had expected. The presence of a heavenly being; the majesty of his appearance; the assurance that he gave that he had come to answer his prayer; and the fact that he had important revelations to make respecting the future, overcame him, and he laid his face upon the ground in silence. Is there any one of us who would not be awed into profound silence if a heavenly messenger should stand before us to disclose what was to occur to us, to our families, to our friends, to our country, in far-distant years? <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/daniel/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15. face toward the ground&#8212;in humble reverence (Ge 19:1).<p>dumb&#8212;with overwhelming awe.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/daniel/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> He was not yet quite free of all his fear, of which we heard, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-9.htm" title="Yet heard I the voice of his words: and when I heard the voice of his words, then was I in a deep sleep on my face, and my face toward the ground.">Daniel 10:9</a></span>; haply this pressed him down the more, when he considered the majesty of the angel, the greatness of the vision, and his own frailty; this transported him with astonishment; and above all, that he saw so much of God in it, in his favour to him and his poor church. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/daniel/10.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And when he had spoken such words unto me,....

Certainly the verb '<span class="accented">alam</span> means "to be dumb," although, as with ourselves, this phrase dots not mean always physiological dumbness, but simply a silence which, from <span class="accented">shyness</span> or fear, one is unable to break. This is the  meaning the versions attach to it. The opinion we indicate finds support in the dumbness of Zacharias, the father of John Baptist, after Gabriel appeared to him, and, still more, in what is related in the following verse. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/daniel/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Since there are in this verse only three classes of wise men named as ordered to come to the king, to whom he promised the reward for the reading and the interpretation of the writing, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/5-8.htm">Daniel 5:8</a> it is first stated that all the king's wise men came, the probability, is, that at first the king commanded only the three classes named in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/5-7.htm">Daniel 5:7</a> to be brought to him. On this probability Kranichfeld founds the supposition that the king purposely, or with intention, summoned only the three classes named to avoid Daniel, whom he did not wish to consult, from his heathen religious fear of the God of the Jews. But this supposition is altogether untenable. For, first, it does not follow from <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-27.htm">Daniel 8:27</a> that under Belshazzar Daniel was president over all the wise men, but only that he was in the king's service. Then, in the event of Daniel's yet retaining the place assigned to him by Nebuchadnezzar, his non-appearance could not be explained on the supposition that Belshazzar called only three classes of the wise men, because the supposition that &#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1468;&#1488; &#1495;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497; &#1499;&#1468;&#1500; (all the king's wise men) in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/5-8.htm">Daniel 5:8</a> forms a contrast to the three classes named in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/5-7.htm">Daniel 5:7</a> is not sustained by the language here used. But if by "all the wise men of the king," <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/5-8.htm">Daniel 5:8</a>, we are to understand the whole body of the wise men of all the classes, and that they appeared before the king, then they must all have been called at the first, since no supplementary calling of the two classes not named in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/5-7.htm">Daniel 5:7</a> is mentioned. Besides this, the words, "the king spake to the wise men of Babylon," make it probable that all the classes, without the exception of the two, were called. Moreover it is most improbable that in the case before us, where the matter concerned the reading of a writing, the &#1495;&#1512;&#1496;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, the magicians Schriftkenner, should not have been called merely to avoid Daniel, who was their &#1512;&#1489; (president) (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-6.htm">Daniel 4:6</a> [<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-9.htm">Daniel 4:9</a>]). Finally, it is psychologically altogether very improbable, that in the great agitation of fear which had filled him at the sight of the hand writing, Belshazzar should have reflected at all on this, that Daniel would announce to him misfortune or the vengeance of the God of the Jews. Such a reflection might perhaps arise on quiet deliberation, but not in the midst of agitating heart-anguish.<p>The strange circumstance that, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/5-7.htm">Daniel 5:7</a>, the king already promised a reward to the wise men, which presupposes that they were already present, and then that for the first time their presence is mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/5-8.htm">Daniel 5:8</a>, is occasioned by this, that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/5-7.htm">Daniel 5:7</a> the appearing of the wise men is not expressly mentioned, but is naturally presupposed, and that the first two clauses of the eighth verse are simply placed together, and are not united to each other by a causal nexus. The meaning of the statement in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/5-7.htm">Daniel 5:7</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/5-8.htm">Daniel 5:8</a> is this: The king calls aloud, commanding the astrologers, etc., to be brought to him; and when the wise men of Babylon came to him, he said to each of them, Whoever reads the writing, etc. But all the king's wise men, when they had come, were unable to read the writing. As to the names of the wise men in <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/5-7.htm">Daniel 5:7</a>, see under <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-2.htm">Daniel 2:2</a>. &#1497;&#1511;&#1512;&#1492; for &#1497;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488;, from &#1511;&#1512;&#1488;, to read. As a reward, the king promises a purple robe, a gold chain for the neck, and the highest office in the kingdom. A robe of purple was the sign of rank worn by the high officers of state among the Persians, - cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/8-15.htm">Esther 8:15</a> with Xenophon, Anab. i. 5. 8, - and among the Selucidae, 1 Macc. 10:20; and was also among the Medes the princely garb, Xen. Anab. i. 3. 2, ii. 4. 6. &#1488;&#1512;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1503;, Hebr. &#1488;&#1512;&#1490;&#1468;&#1502;&#1503;, purple, is a word of Aryan origin, from the Sanscrit ra&#770;ga, red colour, with the formative syllables man and vat; cf. Gesen. Thes. Addid. p. 111f. &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;' &#1491;&#1468;&#1497; &#1493;&#1492;&#1502;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1488; does not depend on &#1497;&#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;, but forms a clause by itself: and a chain of gold shall be about his neck. For the Kethiv &#1492;&#1502;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1488; the Keri substitutes the Targum. and Syr. form &#1492;&#1502;&#1504;&#1497;&#1499;&#1488; (<a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/5-7.htm">Daniel 5:7</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/5-16.htm">Daniel 5:16</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/5-29.htm">Daniel 5:29</a>), i.e., The Greek &#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;, from the Sansc. mani, jewel, pearl, with the frequent formative syllable ka in the Zend, whence the Chaldee word is derived; it signifies neck- or arm-band, here the former. The golden neck-chain (&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;) was an ornament worn by the Persians of rank, and was given by kings as a mark of favour even to kings, e.g., Cambyses and the younger Cyrus; cf. Herod. iii. 20; Xen. Anab. i. 1. 27, 5. 8, 8. 29.<p>It is not quite certain what the princely situation is which was promised to the interpreter of the writing, since the meaning of &#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; is not quite clear. That it is not the ordinale of the number third, is, since Hvernick, now generally acknowledged, because for tertius in Aram. &#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497; is used, which occurs also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-39.htm">Daniel 2:39</a>. Hvernick therefore regards &#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;, for which &#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1488; is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/5-16.htm">Daniel 5:16</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/5-29.htm">Daniel 5:29</a>, as an adjective formation which indicates a descent or occupation, and is here used as a nomen officii corresponding to the Hebr. &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;. Gesenius and Dietrich regard &#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; as only the singular form for &#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497;, and &#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1488; as the stat. abs. of &#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514;, third rank. Hitzig would change &#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; into &#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;, and regard &#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1488; as a singular formed from &#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;&#1503;, as triumvir from triumvirorum, and would interpret it by &#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;, the third (selbst-dritt): as one of three he shall rule in the kingdom, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/6-3.htm">Daniel 6:3</a>. Finally, Kranichfeld takes &#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; to be a fem. verbal formation according to the analogy of &#1488;&#1512;&#1502;&#1497;&#1514;, &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;, in the sense of three-ruler-wise, and &#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1488; for a noun formed from &#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514;&#1488;, triumvir. Almost all these explanations amount to this, that the statements here regard the government of a triumvirate as it was regulated by the Median king Darius, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/6-3.htm">Daniel 6:3</a> (2); and this appears also to be the meaning of the words as one may literally explain &#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; and &#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1488;. Regarding the Keri &#1506;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503; see under <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/4-4.htm">Daniel 4:4</a>, and regarding &#1508;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1488;, under <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-15.htm">Daniel 4:15</a>.<p>As all the wise men were unable to read the writing, it has been thought that it was in a foreign language different from the usual language of Babylon, the knowledge of which could not legitimately be expected to be possessed by the native wise men; and since, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/5-17.htm">Daniel 5:17</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/5-24.htm">Daniel 5:24</a>., Daniel at once showed his acquaintance with the writing in question, it has from this been concluded that already the old Babylonians had handwriting corresponding to the later Syro-Palmyrenian inscriptions, while among the Hebrews to the time of the Exile the essentially Old-Phoenician writing, which is found on the so-called Samaritan coins and in the Samaritan Scriptures, was the peculiar national style of writing (Kran.). But this interpretation of the miracle on natural principles is quite erroneous. First, it is very unlikely that the Chaldean wise men should not have known these old Semitic characters, even although at that time they had ceased to be in current use among the Babylonians in their common writing. Then, from the circumstance that Daniel could at once read the writing, it does not follow that it was the well-known Old-Hebrew writing of his fatherland. "The characters employed in the writing," as Hengstenberg has rightly observed (Beitr. i. p. 122), "must have been altogether unusual so as not to be deciphered but by divine illumination." Yet we must not, with M. Geier and others, assume that the writing was visible only to the king and Daniel. This contradicts the text, according to which the Chaldean wise men, and without doubt all that were present, also saw the traces of the writing, but were not able to read it. </body></html>
