But though supported by this hand, the prophet is unable to stand upright. He crouches in a terrified posture. It should be noticed that the equivalent of “set” is translated “scatter” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/59-11.htm" title="Slay them not, lest my people forget: scatter them by your power; and bring them down, O Lord our shield.">Psalm 59:11</a> [12]). It is used in the same sense in the passage before us. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/9-9.htm" title="For, see, I will command, and I will sift the house of Israel among all nations, like as corn is sifted in a sieve, yet shall not the least grain fall on the earth.">Amos 9:9</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/daniel/10.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/daniel/10-10.htm" title="And, behold, an hand touched me, which set me on my knees and on the palms of my hands....">Daniel 10:10-12</a></span>. <span class="ital">And behold, a hand touched me — </span>This was not the same angel, or personage, who is described <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-5.htm" title="Then I lifted up my eyes, and looked, and behold a certain man clothed in linen, whose loins were girded with fine gold of Uphaz:">Daniel 10:5</a>, but some other of not so great brightness, probably the angel Gabriel in a human form, who had before been sent to Daniel on the like occasions.

What an encouragement is this to us, to spread our wants before God, and present to him our lawful requests; for we find twice in this book an angel assuring Daniel, that as soon as he began to pray, God began to grant his petitions.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/10.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>10:10-21 Whenever we enter into communion with God, it becomes us to have a due sense of the infinite distance between us and the holy God. How shall we, that are dust and ashes, speak to the Lord of glory? Nothing is more likely, nothing more effectual to revive the drooping spirits of the saints, than to be assured of God's love to them. From the very first day we begin to look toward God in a way of duty, he is ready to meet us in the way of mercy. Thus ready is God to hear prayer. When the angel had told the prophet of the things to come, he was to return, and oppose the decrees of the Persian kings against the Jews. The angels are employed as God's ministering servants, Heb 1:14. Though much was done against the Jews by the kings of Persia, God permitting it, much more mischief would have been done if God had not prevented it. He would now more fully show what were God's purposes, of which the prophecies form an outline; and we are concerned to study what is written in these Scriptures of truth, for they belong to our everlasting peace. While Satan and his angels, and evil counsellors, excite princes to mischief against the church, we may rejoice that Christ our Prince, and all his mighty angels, act against our enemies; but we ought not to expect many to favour us in this evil world. Yet the whole counsel of God shall be established; and let each one pray, Lord Jesus, be our righteousness now, and thou wilt be our everlasting confidence, through life, in death, at the day of judgment, and for evermore.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/daniel/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And, behold, an hand touched me - The hand of the angel.

This is given in the margin of the Revised, "Set me tottering on my knees," etc. Strangely enough, the LXX. renders, "soles of my feet " - an impossible attitude; that this is the true reading of the LXX. is confirmed by Paulus Telleusis. Theodotion omits "the palms of the hands." The Peshitta renders as the LXX.

The hand of him that appeared to him - though Daniel does not say. It is needless to multiply angelic agencies. A discussion has been raised on the question whether this is Gabriel who appeared to Daniel in the eighth chapter, or Michael, or the angel of the presence. It is not a matter of importance, but Michael is excluded by ver. 13, and also, to our thinking, "the angel of the presence," if by that title the Second Person of the Trinity is indicated. <span class="accented">Which set me upon my knees and upon the palms of my hands.</span> Although the touch communicated to Daniel some strength, yet he was unable to raise himself so as to look up - his face was still to the ground, his attitude was still one of abasement, and he was trembling. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/daniel/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>&#1492;&#1497;&#1499;&#1500;&#1488; denotes the holy place of the temple, the inner apartment of the temple, as at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-3.htm">1 Kings 6:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-1.htm">Ezekiel 41:1</a>. &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493; for &#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1497;&#1493;, with  &#1488;prosthet., cf.
