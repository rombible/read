But why could not they read an inscription which Daniel deciphered at first sight? It has been conjectured (1) that the character was old Semitic, or one which the wise men did not know; (2) that the language of the inscription was unknown to them; (3) that the words were written in vertical columns, and the wise men endeavoured to read them horizontally. The only true explanation is to be found in the supernatural character of the inscription, and in the inspiration of Daniel. In this way God asserts Himself against the false wisdom of the heathens.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/daniel/5.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/daniel/5-8.htm" title="Then came in all the king's wise men: but they could not read the writing, nor make known to the king the interpretation thereof....">Daniel 5:8-9</a></span>. <span class="ital">Then came in all the king’s wise men </span>— Ambitious of the honour, and desirous to gratify the king. <span class="ital">But they could not read the writing — </span>Because, says Houbigant, it was written in the ancient Samaritan characters, which were very unlike the Chaldean letters.

Mr. Wintle renders the clause, “They were unable to read the writing, so as to make known the interpretation to the king.” <span class="ital">Then was King Belshazzar greatly troubled — </span>His consternation and distress were renewed and increased, his last hope having failed him; <span class="ital">and his lords were astonished — </span>His associates in sin shared in the consternation; and notwithstanding their number, mirth, and wine, were dismayed and terrified exceedingly.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:1-9 Belshazzar bade defiance to the judgments of God. Most historians consider that Cyrus then besieged Babylon. Security and sensuality are sad proofs of approaching ruin. That mirth is sinful indeed, which profanes sacred things; and what are many of the songs used at modern feasts better than the praises sung by the heathens to their gods! See how God struck terror upon Belshazzar and his lords. God's written word is enough to put the proudest, boldest sinner in a fright. What we see of God, the part of the hand that writes in the book of the creatures, and in the book of the Scriptures, should fill us with awful thoughts concerning that part which we do not see. If this be the finger of God, what is his arm when made bare? And what is He? The king's guilty conscience told him that he had no reason to expect any good news from heaven. God can, in a moment, make the heart of the stoutest sinner to tremble; and there needs no more than to let loose his own thoughts upon him; they will give him trouble enough. No bodily pain can equal the inward agony which sometimes seizes the sinner in the midst of mirth, carnal pleasures, and worldly pomp. Sometimes terrors cause a man to flee to Christ for pardon and peace; but many cry out for fear of wrath, who are not humbled for their sins, and who seek relief by lying vanities. The ignorance and uncertainty concerning the Holy Scriptures, shown by many who call themselves wise, only tend to drive sinners to despair, as the ignorance of these wise men did.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/daniel/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Then came in all the king's wise men - The classes above referred to, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/5-7.htm">Daniel 5:7</a>.<p>But they could not read the writing - The character was an unknown character to them.

As we have already said, the Septuagint here repeats the list of wise men. and omits "the Chaldeans." If the word "Chaldean" had been in the text originally, the fact that astrologers were frequently called Chaldeans would render it unlikely that the word should be omitted. Whereas from this very ground  it was a word specially apt to be added on the margin, and once on the margin it would easily drop into the text. Even in the case of the Massoretic text, there seems to be a repetition here. It is certainly more obvious in the Septuagint text. The verse according to the Septuagint is, "And there entered in the enchanters, the sorcerers, and the astrologers, and were not able to announce the interpretation of the writing." Theodotion agrees here with the received text; the Peshitta omits "all." The only way in which we can escape the idea of this being a repetition is by holding that the word "all" is emphatic. The omission of the word "all" from the Peshitta is against this. It is to be observed that in the Septuagint there is no reference to "reading the writing;" it is only to announce the interpretation. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/48.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Size, Gates, and Name of the City<p>To complete the whole picture of the future land of Israel, what has been stated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-15.htm">Ezekiel 48:15</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-16.htm">Ezekiel 48:16</a> concerning the size of the holy city is still further expanded here. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-30.htm">Ezekiel 48:30</a>. And these are the outgoings of the city from the north side, four thousand and five hundred (rods) measurement. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-31.htm">Ezekiel 48:31</a>. And the gates of the city according to the names of the tribes of Israel: three gates toward the north; the gate of Reuben one, the gate of Judah one, the gate of Levi one. E<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/48-32.htm">Zechariah 48:32</a>. And on the east side four thousand five hundred (rods): and three gates; namely, the gate of Joseph one, the gate of Benjamin one, the gate of Dan one. E<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/48-33.htm">Zechariah 48:33</a>. And to the south side, four thousand five hundred measurement: and three gates; the gate of Simeon one, the gate of Issachar one, the gate of Zebulon one. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-34.htm">Ezekiel 48:34</a>. To the west side, four thousand five hundred - their gates three; the gate of Gad one, the gate of Asher one, the gate of Naphtali one. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-35.htm">Ezekiel 48:35</a>. Round about, eighteen thousand (rods); and the name of the city: from henceforth Jehovah there. - The situation of the city of God within the terumah and its external dimensions have already been generally indicated in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-15.htm">Ezekiel 48:15</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-16.htm">Ezekiel 48:16</a>. Here the measurement of the several sides is specified with a notice of their gates, and this is preceded by the heading, "the outlets of the city." &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1510;&#1488;&#1514;, the outgoings (not extensions, for the word never has this meaning) as the furthest extremities in which a city or a tract of land terminates; not outlets or gates, which are expressly distinguished from them, but outgoing sides; hence the definition of the extent or length of the several sides is appended immediately afterwards. The enumeration commences, as above in the case of the land, with the north side. Each side has three gates, so that the whole city has twelve, which bear the names of the twelve tribes, like the gates of the heavenly Jerusalem in <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/21-12.htm">Revelation 21:12</a>, because it will be the city of the true people of God. Levi is included here, and consequently Ephraim and Manasseh are united in the one tribe of Joseph. The three sons of Leah commence the series with the northern gates. They also stand first in the blessing of Moses in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-6.htm">Deuteronomy 33:6-8</a> : the first-born in age, the first-born by virtue of the patriarchal blessing, and the one chosen by Jehovah for His own service in the place of the first-born. Then follow, for the eastern gates, the two sons of Rachel, according to their age (thus deviating from <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-12.htm">Deuteronomy 33:12</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-13.htm">Deuteronomy 33:13</a>), and, along with them, the elder son of Rachel's maid; for the southern gates, the three other sons of Leah; and lastly, for the western gates, the three other sons of the maids. Being thus indicated by the names of its gates as the city of all Israel, the city itself receives a name, which exalts it into the city of God (Jehovah). But different explanations have been given of the words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-35.htm">Ezekiel 48:35</a> which refer to this name. The allusion in &#1502;&#1497;&#1493;&#1501; and the meaning of &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; are both disputed points. It is true that the latter literally means "thither;" but Ezekiel also uses it as synonymous with &#1513;&#1473;&#1501;, "there," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-3.htm">Ezekiel 23:3</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-29.htm">Ezekiel 32:29-30</a>, so that the assertion that &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; never means "there" is incorrect. &#1502;&#1497;&#1493;&#1501;, from day forward, equivalent to henceforward; but not henceforth and for ever, though this may be implied in the context. Whether &#1502;&#1497;&#1493;&#1501; be taken in connection with the preceding words, "the name of the city will henceforward be," or with those which follow, the name of the city will be, "henceforward Jehovah there," makes no material difference so far as the thought is concerned, as the city can only bear the name from the time when Jehovah is &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492;, and can only bear it so long as Jehovah is &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492;. But so far as the question is concerned, whether &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; signifies thither or there in this passage, Hvernick is of opinion, indeed, that the whole of Ezekiel's vision does not harmonize with the meaning "there," inasmuch as he separates temple and city, so that Jehovah does not properly dwell in Jerusalem, but, in the strictest an highest sense, in His sanctuary, and turns thence to Jerusalem with the fulness of His grace and love. But if Jehovah does not merely direct His love toward the city from afar off, but, as Hvernick still further says, turns it fully toward it, causes His good pleasure to rest upon it, then He also rules and is in the city with His love, so that it can bear the name "Jehovah thither (there)." In any case, the interpretation, "Jehovah will from henceforth proceed thither, to restore it, to make it a holy city" (Kliefoth), is untenable; for the name is not given to Jerusalem when lying waste, but to the city already restored and fully built, which Ezekiel sees in the spirit. He has therefore before this turned His favour once more to Jerusalem, which was laid waste; and the name &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492;, given to the new Jerusalem, can only affirm that henceforward it is to be a city of Jehovah, i.e., that from this time forth Jehovah will be and rule in her. The rendering "Jehovah thither" does not answer to this, but only the rendering, "Jehovah will be there." compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-14.htm">Isaiah 60:14</a>, where Jerusalem is called the city of Jehovah, Zion of the Holy One in Israel, because the glory of Jehovah has risen over her as a brilliant light. </body></html>
