He had not taken warning by the judgments upon Nebuchadnezzar. And he had insulted God. Sinners are pleased with gods that neither see, nor hear, nor know; but they will be judged by One to whom all things are open. Daniel reads the sentence written on the wall. All this may well be applied to the doom of every sinner. At death, the sinner's days are numbered and finished; after death is the judgment, when he will be weighed in the balance, and found wanting; and after judgment the sinner will be cut asunder, and given as a prey to the devil and his angels. While these things were passing in the palace, it is considered that the army of Cyrus entered the city; and when Belshazzar was slain, a general submission followed. Soon will every impenitent sinner find the writing of God's word brought to pass upon him, whether he is weighed in the balance of the law as a self-righteous Pharisee, or in that of the gospel as a painted hypocrite.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/daniel/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This is the interpretation of the thing - It may seem not to have been difficult to interpret the meaning of the communication, when one was able to read the words, or when the sense of the words was understood. But, if the words are placed together, and considered in their abstract form, the whole communication would be so enigmatical that the interpretation would not be likely to occur to anyone without a Divine guidance. This will appear more clearly by arranging the words together, as has been done by Hales:<p>MENE, number, MENE, number, TEKEL, weight, (PERES) (division) UPHARSIN, division.  Or, as it is explained more accurately by Berholdt and Gesenius:<p>Mene, Numbered, Mene, Numbered, Tekel, Weighted, Upharsin. Divided.  From this arrangement it will be at once seen that the interpretation proposed by Daniel was not one that would have been likely to have occurred to anyone.<p>Mene - &#1502;&#1504;&#1488;  mene&#770;'. This word is a passive participle from &#1502;&#1504;&#1492;  mena&#770;h - "to number, to review." - Gesenius, "Lex." The verb is also written  &#1502;&#1504;&#1488;  mena&#770;' - Buxtorf, "Lex." It would be literally translated "numbered," and would apply to that of which an estimate was taken by counting. We use now an expression which would convey a similar idea, when we say of one that "his days are numbered;" that is, he has not long to live, or is about to die. The idea seems to be taken from the fact, that the duration of a man's life cannot usually be known, and in the general uncertainty we can form no correct estimate of it, but when he is old, or when he is dangerously sick, we feel that we can with some degree of probability number his days, since he cannot now live long. Such is the idea here, as explained by Daniel. All uncertainty about the duration of the kingdom was now removed, for, since the evil had come, an exact estimate of its whole duration - of the number of the years of its continuance - could be made. In the Greek of Theodotion there is no attempt to translate this word, and it is retained in Greek letters - &#x39c;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#768;  Mane&#772;. So also in the Codex Chisianus and in the Latin Vulgate.<p>God hath numbered thy kingdom - The word which is used here, and rendered "numbered" - &#1502;&#1504;&#1492;  mena&#770;h - is the verb of which the previous word is the participle. Daniel applies it to the "kingdom" or "reign" of the monarch, as being a thing of more importance than the life of the king himself. It is evident, if, according to the common interpretation of <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/5-30.htm">Daniel 5:30</a>, Belshazzar was slain that very night, it "might" have been applied to the king himself, meaning that his days were numbered, and that he was about to die. But this interpretation (see Notes) is not absolutely certain, and perhaps the fact that Daniel did not so apply the word may be properly regarded as one circumstance showing that such an interpretation is not necessary, though probably it is the correct one.<p>And finished it - This is not the meaning of the word "Mene," but is the explanation by Daniel of the thing intended. The word in its interpretation fairly implied that; or that might be understood from it. The fact that the "kingdom" in its duration was "numbered," properly expressed the idea that it was now to come to an end. It did actually then come to an end by being merged in that of the Medes and Persians. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/daniel/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>26.

The translation, steward or chief cook, is founded on the explanation of the word as given by Haug (Ewald's bibl.

Ten, in the decimal system the number of completeness or conclusion, may, according to circumstances, mean a long time or only a proportionally short time. Here it is used in the latter sense, because ten days are sufficient to show the effect of the kind of food on the appearance. &#1494;&#1512;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501;, food from the vegetable kingdom, vegetables, leguminous fruit. <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/1-13.htm">Daniel 1:13</a>. &#1502;&#1512;&#1488;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; is singular, and is used with &#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; in the plural because two subjects follow. &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;  &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492;, as thou shalt see, viz., our appearance, i.e., as thou shalt then find it, act accordingly.

The confidence of living faith which hopes in the presence and help of God is fundamentally different from the eager expectation of miraculous interference of a Maccabean Jew, which C. v. Lengerke and other deists and atheists wish to find here in Daniel.)<p>The youths throve so visibly on the vegetables and water, that the steward relieved them wholly from the necessity of eating from the royal table. <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/1-15.htm">Daniel 1:15</a>. &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512; &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1488;&#1497;, fat, well nourished in flesh, is grammatically united to the suffix of &#1502;&#1512;&#1488;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501;, from which the pronoun is easily supplied in thought. <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/1-16.htm">Daniel 1:16</a>. &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;, took away  equals  no more gave. </body></html>
