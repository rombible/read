But the king saw a celestial being, <span class="ital">a watcher, and a holy one, </span>come down from heaven; and heard him give orders, with a loud voice, that the tree should be hewn down, its branches lopped off, and its fruit scattered, and nothing left of it but <span class="ital">the stump of its roots in the earth, </span>which was to be secured, however, with a <span class="ital">band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field. </span>Words of menace follow, which are applicable only to a man, and plainly show, that the whole vision was typical of some dreadful calamity, to fall for a time, but for a time only, on some one of the sons of men.” — Bishop Horsley. The whole of this allegorical dream is explained in the subsequent part of the chapter; and therefore it will only be necessary to notice here two or three of the singular expressions and particulars found in it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1st, By the terms <span class="ital">watcher and holy one, </span>or, as the expression is, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-17.htm" title="This matter is by the decree of the watchers, and the demand by the word of the holy ones: to the intent that the living may know that the most High rules in the kingdom of men, and gives it to whomsoever he will, and sets up over it the basest of men.">Daniel 4:17</a>, <span class="ital">watchers and holy ones, </span>has generally been understood some principal angel, or angels, the angelical orders being described as always attending upon God’s throne to receive and execute his commands: see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-20.htm" title="Bless the LORD, you his angels, that excel in strength, that do his commandments, hearkening to the voice of his word.">Psalm 103:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-10.htm" title="Take heed that you despise not one of these little ones; for I say to you, That in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven.">Matthew 18:10</a>; and notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-11.htm" title="Thus were their faces: and their wings were stretched upward; two wings of every one were joined one to another, and two covered their bodies.">Ezekiel 1:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-24.htm" title="And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of great waters, as the voice of the Almighty, the voice of speech, as the noise of an host: when they stood, they let down their wings.">Ezekiel 1:24</a>. For which reason they are called the eyes of the Lord, <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/4-10.htm" title="For who has despised the day of small things? for they shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel with those seven; they are the eyes of the LORD, which run to and fro through the whole earth.">Zechariah 4:10</a>. But Bishop Horsley, in his sermon on the 17th verse, strongly combats, and seems to have fully confuted this opinion. His train of reasoning is too long to be inserted here, and indeed it is not necessary to insert it, the following short extract being quite sufficient to clear up the point. “Those who understand the titles of <span class="ital">watchers </span>and <span class="ital">holy ones </span>of angelic beings, agree, that they must be principal angels — angels of the highest orders; which, if they are angels at all, must certainly be supposed: for it is to be observed, that it is not the mere execution of the judgment upon Nebuchadnezzar, but the decree itself, which is ascribed to them. The whole matter originated in their decree; and at their command the decree was executed. <span class="ital">The holy ones </span>are not said to hew down the tree, but to give command for the hewing of it down. Of how high order, indeed, must these <span class="ital">watchers </span>and <span class="ital">holy ones </span>have been, on whose decrees the judgments of God himself are founded, and by whom the warrant for the execution is finally issued? It is surprising, that such men as Calvin among the Protestants of the continent — such as Wells and the elder Lowth in our own church — and such as Calmet in the Church of Rome, should not have their eyes open to the error, and impiety indeed, of such an exposition as this which makes them angels, especially when the learned Grotius, in the extraordinary manner in which he recommends it, had set forth its merits, as it should seem, in a true light, when he says, that it represents God as acting like a great monarch ‘upon a decree of his senate:’ and when another of the most learned of its advocates imagines something might pass in the celestial senate, bearing some analogy to the forms of legislation used in the assemblies of the people at Rome, in the times of the republic. It might have been expected that the exposition would have needed no other confutation, in the judgment of men of piety and sober minds, than this fair statement of its principles by its ablest advocates. “The plain truth is, that these appellations, <span class="ital">Watchers </span>and <span class="ital">Holy Ones, </span>denote the persons in the Godhead; the first describing them by the vigilance of their universal providence, the second by the transcendent sanctity of their nature. The word rendered <span class="ital">Holy Ones </span>is so applied in other texts of Scripture, which make the sense of the other word, coupled with it here, indisputable. In perfect consistency with this exposition, and with no other, we find, in the 24th verse, that this decree of the <span class="ital">Watchers </span>and the <span class="ital">Holy Ones </span>is the decree of the <span class="ital">Most High God; </span>and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-13.htm" title="I saw in the visions of my head on my bed, and, behold, a watcher and an holy one came down from heaven;">Daniel 4:13</a>, God, who in regard to the plurality of the persons, is afterward described by these two plural nouns, <span class="ital">Watchers </span>and <span class="ital">Holy Ones, </span>is, in regard to the unity of the essence, described by the same nouns in the singular number, <span class="ital">Watcher </span>and <span class="ital">Holy One. </span>And this is a fuller confirmation of the truth of this exposition: for God is the only being to whom the same name in the singular and in the plural may be indiscriminately applied: and this change from the one number to another, without any thing in the principles of the language to account for it, is frequent in speaking of God in the Hebrew tongue, but unexampled in the case of any other being. The assertion, therefore, is, that God had decreed to execute a signal judgment upon Nebuchadnezzar for his pride and impiety, in order to prove, by the example of that mighty monarch, that ‘the Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will, and setteth up over it the basest of men.’ To make the declaration the more solemn and striking, the terms in which it is conceived distinctly express that consent and concurrence of all the persons in the Trinity, in the design and execution of this judgment, which must be understood indeed in every act of the Godhead.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2d, The command given by these <span class="ital">watchers </span>and <span class="ital">holy ones </span>may be considered as addressed to any of those creatures, animate or inanimate, that are to fulfil the Creator’s will; or the expression may be understood as being merely a prediction that the tree should be cut down, and its leaves shaken off, &c: and the hewing down of the tree signified only the removal of it for a time, not its entire destruction, because while the root remained in the ground new shoots might break forth, and so the tree grow up again. When it is added, <span class="ital">let the beasts get away from under it, </span>the meaning evidently is, let not his subjects rely upon him for protection, for he shall not be in a condition to afford them any, or to be the author of any good to them. <span class="ital">Nevertheless </span>(it is further commanded) <span class="ital">leave the stump of his roots in the earth — </span>By which is signified, that Nebuchadnezzar’s kingdom should be preserved to him, and that no one should seize upon it during his exile, or affliction. The words, <span class="ital">with a band of iron and brass, </span>were meant to give still further assurance that his kingdom should remain unshaken and sure to him, like things held firm and immoveable by iron or brass. The next expression, <span class="ital">in the tender grass of the field, </span>either alludes to the circumstance of the stump of a tree lying buried and neglected in the field, till it is overgrown with grass and herbs, and so is not noticed; or it is a transition from the sign to the thing signified, from the tree to Nebuchadnezzar, represented by it, the tree with its stump being lost sight of, and a person coming in its stead, to whom only what follows is applicable. <span class="ital">Let his heart be changed from man’s — </span>“It is hard to say what the real nature of this transformation was. The Syriac seems to incline to a change of the mind, and probably it means no more than that his heart, or the nature of his constitution, was made savage and brutish, either by a real madness, or by such a slovenly neglect of himself, or deprivation of the proper use of his speech and limbs, as might reduce him to a state like the beasts. There is a kind of madness called lycanthropy, wherein men have the fury of wolves.” — Wintle. See <span class="ital">Univ. Hist., </span>p. 964. Scaliger thinks this madness of Nebuchadnezzar is obscurely hinted at in a document of Abydenus, produced by Eusebius; wherein, having represented the king, from the Chaldean writers, to have fallen into an ecstasy, and to have foretold the destruction of that empire by the Medes and Persians, the author adds, that immediately after uttering this prophecy he disappeared; which Scaliger expounds of the king’s being driven from his kingly state, and the society of men: see Scaliger’s notes upon the <span class="ital">Ancient Fragments </span>in the appendix to his work <span class="ital">de Emendatione Temporum. </span>See also Houbigant and Calmet on the metamorphosis of Nebuchadnezzar. <span class="ital">And let seven times pass over him — </span>Literally, <span class="ital">Till seven times be changed upon him, </span>that is, seven years, for so the expression evidently signifies in several parts of this book, as we shall see hereafter.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:1-18 The beginning and end of this chapter lead us to hope, that Nebuchadnezzar was a monument of the power of Divine grace, and of the riches of Divine mercy. After he was recovered from his madness, he told to distant places, and wrote down for future ages, how God had justly humbled and graciously restored him. When a sinner comes to himself, he will promote the welfare of others, by making known the wondrous mercy of God. Nebuchadnezzar, before he related the Divine judgments upon him for his pride, told the warnings he had in a dream or vision. The meaning was explained to him. The person signified, was to be put down from honour, and to be deprived of the use of his reason seven years. This is surely the sorest of all temporal judgments. Whatever outward affliction God is pleased to lay upon us, we have cause to bear it patiently, and to be thankful that he continues the use of our reason, and the peace of our consciences. Yet if the Lord should see fit by such means to keep a sinner from multiplying crimes, or a believer from dishonouring his name, even the dreadful prevention would be far preferable to the evil conduct. God has determined it, as a righteous Judge, and the angels in heaven applaud. Not that the great God needs the counsel or concurrence of the angels, but it denotes the solemnity of this sentence. The demand is by the word of the holy ones, God's suffering people: when the oppressed cry to God, he will hear. Let us diligently seek blessings which can never be taken from us, and especially beware of pride and forgetfulness of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/daniel/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thus were the visions of my head in my bed - These are the things which I saw upon my bed. When he says that they were the "visions of his head," he states a doctrine which was then doubtless regarded as the truth, that the head is the seat of thought.<p>I saw - Margin, "was seeing." Chaldee, "seeing I saw." The phrase would imply attentive and calm contemplation. It was not a flitting vision; it was an object which he contemplated deliberately so as to retain a distinct remembrance of its form and appearance.<p>And, behold, a tree in the midst of the earth - Occupying a central position on the earth. It seems to have been by itself - remote from any forest: to have stood alone. Its central position, no less than its size and proportions, attracted his attention. Such a tree, thus towering to the heavens, and sending out its branches afar, and affording a shade to the beasts of the field, and a home to the fowls of heaven <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/4-12.htm">Daniel 4:12</a>, was a striking emblem of a great and mighty monarch, and it undoubtedly occurred to Nebuchadnezzar at once that the vision had some reference to himself. Thus in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-3.htm">Ezekiel 31:3</a>, the Assyrian king is compared with a magnificent cedar: "Behold, the Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon, with fair branches, and with a shadowing shroud, and of a high stature, and his top was among the thick boughs." Compare also <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-22.htm">Ezekiel 17:22-24</a>, where "the high tree and the green tree" refer probably to Nebuchadnezzar. See the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-13.htm">Isaiah 2:13</a>. Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-18.htm">Isaiah 10:18-19</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-7.htm">Jeremiah 22:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-23.htm">Jeremiah 22:23</a>. Homer often compares his heroes to trees. Hector, felled by a stone, is compared with an oak overthrown by a thunderbolt. The fall of Simoisius is compared by him to that of a poplar, and that of Euphorbus to the fall of a beautiful olive. Nothing is more obvious than the comparison of a hero with a lofty tree of the forest, and hence, it was natural for Nebuchadnezzar to suppose that this vision had a reference to himself.<p>And the height thereof was great - In the next verse it is said to have reached to heaven. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/daniel/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. tree&#8212;So the Assyrian is compared to a "cedar" (Eze 31:3; compare Eze 17:24).<p>in the midst of the earth&#8212;denoting its conspicuous position as the center whence the imperial authority radiated in all directions.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/daniel/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The visions of mine head; </span> because the fancy and imagination is in the head; and he calls them <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">visions</span> or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">seeings, </span> because eyes and sight are attributed to the understanding, and the thing seemed visible to him, as if he beheld it with his eyes. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">A tree:</span> those that write of the language of the East tell us that a tree denote some excellent man.

Nebuchadnezzar’s dream was of a mighty tree, the head of which towered to heaven, while its branches sheltered, and afforded nutriment for, the beasts and fowl of the earth: as he watched it, he heard the command given that it should be hewn down to the earth, and only its stump left standing. For the imagery, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/31-3.htm" title="Behold, the Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon with fair branches, and with a shadowing shroud, and of an high stature; and his top was among the thick boughs....">Ezekiel 31:3-10</a> ff.

The Septuagint is different here, "I was sleeping [on my couch], and behold a lofty tree springing out of the earth, and its appearance was great, and there was not another like to it." The words, "on my couch," are marked with an asterisk, denoting that they have been added, probably from Theodotion. There are indications here of a text slightly different from the Massoretic, even in the latter portion of the verse, where the LXX. and the Massoretic text come closest. Instead of <span class="accented">bega</span>,' (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5d2;&#x5d5;&#x5d0;</span>), "in the midst of," the LXX. reading has been <span class="accented">saggeee</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d0;</span>), "great." The last clause is most widely different from the Massoretic text; instead of "and the height thereof was great," we have, "and there was no other like it." It is not easy to imagine how the one reading grew from the other, <span class="accented">roomeh</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5de;&#x5b5;&#x5d4;</span>), "height," might easily be mistaken for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (demah), if <span class="accented">roomeh</span> were written defectively; but the rest of the clause cannot easily be explained The Massoretic text has a certain redundancy of meaning, which is suspicious. In this verse we are told the tree was "great;" the opening clause of the following says the tree grew; whereas the Septuagint, while asserting its loftiness, asserts also that it was "growing" (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>). On the whole, we prefer the Septuagint, as it does not proceed to assert further that the tree "grew great." Theodotion, while in the latter portion of the verse agreeing with the Massoretic text, omits the introductory clause. The Pe-shitta is a briefer recension of the Massoretic text, "The vision in my couch was - a tree in the midst of the earth, the height great." The reference here may be, to the sacred tree of the Assyrians, the symbol of life, which is so perpetually introduced into the sculptures of Nineveh, and seen also in some Babylonian cylinders, especially in connection with royal <span class="accented">acts</span> of worship, in Lenormant ('La Magie,' p. 27) we find that a sacred tree - a conifer of some sort  as seen by the sculptures - was supposed to have the quality of breaking the power of the seven <span class="accented">Maskim.</span> Whatever the origin of this belief, it seems to have passed into the faith of Assyria and Babylon, and to have so permeated them that Ezekiel (31) describes Assyria as a mighty cedar. To pass from the empire to its ruler was a specially easy step in regard to an Oriental monarchy, in which the state was the monarch, <span class="accented">in the midst of the earth.</span> This refers to the notion each nation had that their own was the middle point, or <span class="accented">omphalos</span>, of the world. Though <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5b7;&#x5d5;</span> (<span class="accented">gav</span>) meant originally really "back," not "middle," yet it is used of the furnace of fire in the preceding chapter, and the primitive meaning is entirely lost in the Targums. </body></html>
