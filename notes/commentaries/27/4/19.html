Daniel thus expresses his dutiful concern for the safety of the king’s person and government. For though Nebuchadnezzar was an idolater, a persecutor, and oppressor of the people of God, yet he was Daniel’s prince, and therefore, though he foresees, and is now going to foretel, ill concerning him, he dares not wish ill to him. Thus Jeremiah had before exhorted the Jewish captives at Babylon to wish and pray for the prosperity of the government under which they lived.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:19-27 Daniel was struck with amazement and terror at so heavy a judgment coming upon so great a prince, and gives advice with tenderness and respect. It is necessary, in repentance, that we not only cease to do evil, but learn to do good. Though it might not wholly prevent the judgment, yet the trouble may be longer before it comes, or shorter when it does come. And everlasting misery will be escaped by all who repent and turn to God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/daniel/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar - <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-8.htm">Daniel 4:8</a>. It has been objected that the mention in this edict of "both" the names by which Daniel was known is an improbable circumstance; that a pagan monarch would only have referred to him by the name by which he was known in Babylon - the name which he had himself conferred on him in honor of the god ("Belus") after whom he was called. See the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/1-7.htm">Daniel 1:7</a>. To this it may be replied, that although in ordinary intercourse with him in Babylon, in addressing him as an officer of state under the Chaldean government, he would undoubtedly be mentioned only by that name; yet, in a proclamation like this, both the names by which he was known would be used - the one to identify him among his own countrymen, the other among the Chaldeans. This proclamation was designed for people of all classes, and ranks, and tongues <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-1.htm">Daniel 4:1</a>; it was intended to make known the supremacy of the God worshipped by the Hebrews. Nebuchadnezzar had derived the knowledge of the meaning of his dream from one who was a Hebrew, and it was natural, therefore, in order that it might be known by whom the dream had been interpreted, that he should so designate him that it would be understood by all.<p>Was astonied - Was astonished. The word "astonied," now gone out of use, several times occurs in the common version; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/9-3.htm">Ezra 9:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-8.htm">Job 17:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/18-20.htm">Job 18:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-17.htm">Ezekiel 4:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/3-24.htm">Daniel 3:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-19.htm">Daniel 4:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/5-9.htm">Daniel 5:9</a>. Daniel was "amazed" and "overwhelmed" at what was manifestly the fearful import of the dream.<p>For one hour - It is not possible to designate the exact time denoted by the word "hour" - &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1492;  sha&#770;&#8219;a&#770;h. According to Gesenius ("Lex."), it means moment of time; properly, a look, a glance, a wink of the eye - German, "augenblick." In Arabic the word means both a moment and an hour. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/3-6.htm">Daniel 3:6</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/3-15.htm">Daniel 3:15</a>, it evidently means immediately. Here it would seem to mean a short time. That is, Daniel was fixed in thought, and maintained a profound silence until the king addressed him. We are not to suppose that this continued during the space of time which we call an hour, but he was silent until Nebuchadnezzar addressed him. He would not seem to be willing even to speak of so fearful calamities as he saw were coming upon the king.<p>And his thoughts troubled him - The thoughts which passed through his mind respecting the fearful import of the dream.<p>The king spake and said ... - Perceiving that the dream had, as he had probably apprehended, a fearful significancy, and that Daniel hesitated about explaining its meaning. Perhaps he supposed that he hesitated because he apprehended danger to himself if he should express his thoughts, and the king therefore assured him of safety, and encouraged him to declare the full meaning of the vision, whatever that might be.<p>Belteshazzar answered and said, My lord, the dream be to them that hate thee - Let such things as are foreboded by the dream happen to your enemies rather than to you. This merely implies that he did not desire that these things should come upon him. It was the language of courtesy and of respect; it showed that he had no desire that any calamity should befall the monarch, and that he had no wish for the success of his enemies. There is not, in this, anything necessarily implying a hatred of the enemies of the king, or any wish that calamity should come upon them; it is the expression of an earnest desire that such an affliction might not come upon him. If it must come on any, such was his respect for the sovereign, and such his desire for his welfare and prosperitry, that he preferred that it should fall upon those who were his enemies, and who hated him. This language, however, should not be rigidly interpreted. It is the language of an Oriental; language uttered at a court, where only the words of respect were heard. Expressions similar to this occur not unfrequently in ancient writings. Thus Horace, b. iii. ode 27:<p>"Hostium uxores puerique caecos<p>Sentiant motus orientis Austri."<p>And Virgil, Georg. iii.:513:<p>"Di meliora piis, erroremque liostibus ilium."<p>"Such rhetorical embellishments are pointed at no individuals, have nothing in them of malice or ill-will, are used as marks of respect to the ruling powers, and may be presumed to be free from any imputation of a want of charity." - Wintle, in loc. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/daniel/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19. Daniel &#8230; Belteshazzar&#8212;The use of the Hebrew as well as the Chaldee name, so far from being an objection, as some have made it, is an undesigned mark of genuineness. In a proclamation to "all people," and one designed to honor the God of the Hebrews, Nebuchadnezzar would naturally use the Hebrew name (derived from El, "God," the name by which the prophet was best known among his countrymen), as well as the Gentile name by which he was known in the Chaldean empire.<p>astonied&#8212;overwhelmed with awe at the terrible import of the dream.<p>one hour&#8212;the original means often "a moment," or "short time," as in Da 3:6, 15.<p>let not the dream &#8230; trouble thee&#8212;Many despots would have punished a prophet who dared to foretell his overthrow. Nebuchadnezzar assures Daniel he may freely speak out.<p>the dream be to them that hate thee&#8212;We are to desire the prosperity of those under whose authority God's providence has placed us (Jer 29:7). The wish here is not so much against others, as for the king: a common formula (2Sa 18:32).

Thus far the two main recensions are agreed. The Septuagint renders practically to the same effect as our version, only that <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> means rather "suspicions disturbed him," which is the rendering of Paulus Tellensis. There are traces in it of doublet; the rendering of the LXX. is, "And Daniel greatly marvelled, and suspicions disturbed him, and he was terrified, trembling having taken hold of him, and his visage was changed, having moved (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>) his head, having been amazed one <span class="cmt_word"></span> hour, he answered me in a meek voice." Theodotion and the Peshitta are at one with the Massoretic text here. It is to be noted here that the word <span class="accented">sha'a</span>, translated "hour," has no such definite meaning; Gesenius gives, "a moment of time," in which he is followed by Bevan, Keil, and Stuart. Ewald translates, <span class="accented">eine Stunde</span>, and with him agree Hitzig, Kranichfeld, Zockler. Both the Greek versions have <span class="greek">&#x1f65;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, but we must bear in mind that <span class="greek">&#x1f65;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> had not the definite meaning which we attach to "hour." Jerome renders <span class="accented">hera.</span> The Septuagint adds, as we have seen, somewhat grotesquely, "having moved (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>) his head, he was astonished for one hour." This seems a case of "doublet," that phenomenon so frequent in the Septuagint. The Septuagint rendering, "And (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span>) Daniel was greatly astonished, and suspicions troubled him, and, trembling having seized him, he was afraid," suggests that it is not impossible that <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5d2;&#x5d9;</span>, "greatly," had been read instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5e2;&#x5d4;</span>, "an hour;" but the rest is not so easily explicable. There is one case of Syriasm here in the vocalization of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d9;&#x5d9;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">The king spake, and said, Belteshazzar, let not the dream, or the interpretation thereof, trouble</span> <span class="cmt_word">thee.</span> This clause is absent from both the Greek versions, though present in the Peshitta and Vulgate. As it stands, on the one hand, it is a departure from the epistolary style, or perhaps rather the proclamative style of the earlier portion of the chapter. On the other hand, if we think this clause an interpolation, we cannot fail to note that the kindly courtesy and consideration ascribed by the interpolator to Nebuchadnezzar is utterly unlike the character of Epiphanes as manifested to the Jews. Nebuchadnezzar saw that Daniel was filled with sorrow and apprehension at the meaning he saw in the vision, and endeavours to reassure and encourage him. If the conduct of Nebuchadnezzar is unlike that which a Jew of  <span class="date">B.C. 170</span> would have ascribed to him were it his intention to present in him Epiphanes under a disguise, still more unlike is the conduct of Daniel to that which certainly would have been ascribed to him had the author intend(,d to represent him as a model of the pious Jew in a heathen court - in the court of Epi-phanes. Would Mattathias have remained astonished and speechless in the presence of Epiphanes, had it been revealed to him that Epiphanes was to be driven out to the wilds a madman? If, then, it is an interpolation, it is an early one - earlier than the Maccabean struggle. But if the interpolation be early, the book interpolated must be yet earlier. <span class="cmt_word">Belteshazzar answered and said, My lord, the dream be to them that hate thee, and the interpretation thereof to thine enemies</span>. The Septuagint maintains the epistolary character of this narrative here, "And Baltasar answered me with a meek voice, This dream be to those that hate thee, and let the interpretation thereof come upon thine enemies." Theodotion, the Peshitta, and the Vulgate are at one with the ordinary text. The feelings of Daniel towards Nebuchadnezzar seem to have been those of the highest personal loyalty, and thus in the widest contrast from the feelings that any Jew of the time of the Maccabees would have towards Epiphanes. He, Daniel, in his love for the grand impulsive despot, would have the enemies and haters of his monarch swept forth to wander as maniacs, rather than that he should so suffer. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/48.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The division of the land, like the definition of the boundaries (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-15.htm">Ezekiel 47:15</a>), commences in the north, and enumerates the tribes in the order in which they were to receive their inheritances from north to south: first, seven tribes from the northern boundary to the centre of the land (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-1.htm">Ezekiel 48:1-7</a>), where the heave for the sanctuary, with the land of the priests and Levites and the city domain, together with the prince's land on the two sides, was to be set apart (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-8.htm">Ezekiel 48:8-22</a>; and secondly, the other five tribes from this to the southern boundary (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-23.htm">Ezekiel 48:23-29</a>).

And as for the workmen of the city, they shall cultivate it from all the tribes. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-20.htm">Ezekiel 48:20</a>. The whole of the heave is five and twenty thousand by five and twenty thousand; a fourth of the holy heave shall ye take for the possession of the city. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-21.htm">Ezekiel 48:21</a>. And the remainder shall belong to the prince on this side and on that side of the holy heave and of the city possession; along the five and twenty thousand of the heave to the eastern boundary, and toward the west along the five and twenty thousand to the western boundary parallel with the tribe portions, it shall belong to the prince; and the holy heave and the sanctuary of the house shall be in the midst. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-22.htm">Ezekiel 48:22</a>. Thus from the possession of the Levites (as) from the possession of the city shall that which lies in the midst of what belongs to the prince between the territory of Judah and the territory of Benjamin belong to the prince. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-23.htm">Ezekiel 48:23</a>. And the rest of the tribes are from the east side to the west side: Benjamin one. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-24.htm">Ezekiel 48:24</a>. And on the boundary of Benjamin from the east side to the west side: Simeon one. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-25.htm">Ezekiel 48:25</a>. And on the boundary of Simeon from the east side to the west side: Issachar one. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-26.htm">Ezekiel 48:26</a>. And on the boundary of Issachar from the east side to the west side: Zebulon one. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-27.htm">Ezekiel 48:27</a>. And on the boundary of Zebulon from the east side to the west side: Gad one. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-28.htm">Ezekiel 48:28</a>. And on the boundary of Gad on the south side toward the south, the boundary shall be from Tamar to the water of strife from Kadesh along the brook to the great sea. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-29.htm">Ezekiel 48:29</a>. This is the land which ye shall divide by lot for inheritance to the tribes of Israel; these are their portions, is the saying of the Lord Jehovah.<p>The new division of the land differs from the former one effected in the time of Joshua, in the first place, in the fact that all the tribe-portions were to extend uniformly across the entire breadth of the land from the eastern boundary to the Mediterranean Sea on the west, so that they were to form parallel tracts of country; whereas in the distribution made in the time of Joshua, several of the tribe-territories covered only half the breadth of the land. For example, Dan received his inheritance on the west of Benjamin; and the territories of half Manasseh and Asher ran up from the northern boundary of Ephraim to the northern boundary of Canaan; while Issachar, Naphtali, and Zebulon received their portions on the east of these; and lastly, Simeon received his possession within the boundaries of the tribe of Judah. And secondly, it also differs from the former, in the fact that not only are all the twelve tribes located in Canaan proper, between the Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea; whereas previously two tribes and a half had received from Moses, at their own request, the conquered land of Bashan and Gilead on the eastern side of the Jordan, so that the land of Canaan could be divided among the remaining nine tribes and a half. But besides this, the central tract of land, about the fifth part of the whole, was separated for the holy heave, the city domain, and the prince's land, so that only the northern and southern portions, about four-fifths of the whole, remained for distribution among the twelve tribes, seven tribes receiving their hereditary portions to the north of the heave and five to the south, because the heave was so selected that the city with its territory lay near the ancient Jerusalem. - In <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-1.htm">Ezekiel 48:1-7</a> the seven tribes which were to dwell on the north of the heave are enumerated. The principal points of the northern boundary, viz., the way to Chetlon and Hazar-Enon, the boundary of Damascus, are repeated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-1.htm">Ezekiel 48:1</a> from <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-15.htm">Ezekiel 47:15</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-17.htm">Ezekiel 47:17</a>, as the starting and terminal points of the northern boundary running from west to east. The words &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1497;&#1491; &#1495;&#1502;&#1514; fix the northern boundary more precisely in relation to the adjoining territory; and in '&#1493;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468;  the enumeration of the tribe-lots begins with that of the tribe of Dan, which was to receive its territory against the northern boundary. &#1500;&#1493; refers to the name &#1491;&#1468;&#1503; which follows, and which Ezekiel already had in his mind. &#1508;&#1468;&#1488;&#1514; &#1511;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1501; is constructed asyndeto&#770;s; and &#1508;&#1468;&#1488;&#1514; is to be repeated in thought before &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1501;: the east side (and) the west (side) are to belong to it, i.e., the tract of land toward its west and its east side. The words which follow, &#1491;&#1468;&#1503; &#1488;&#1495;&#1491;, are attached in an anacoluthistic manner: "Dan (is to receive) one portion," for "one shall belong to Dan." To &#1488;&#1495;&#1491; we are to supply in thought the substantive &#1495;&#1489;&#1500;, tribe-lot, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-13.htm">Ezekiel 47:13</a>. "The assumption that one tribe was to receive as much as another (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-14.htm">Ezekiel 47:14</a>), leads to the conclusion that each tribe-lot was to be taken as a monas" (Kliefoth). In this way the names in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-2.htm">Ezekiel 48:2-7</a>, with the constantly repeated &#1488;&#1495;&#1491;, must also be taken. The same form of description is repeated in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-23.htm">Ezekiel 48:23-28</a> in the case of the five tribes placed to the south of the heave. - In the order of the several tribe-territories it is impossible to discover any universal principle of arrangement. All that is clear is, that in the case of Dan, Asher, Naphtali, Manasseh, and Ephraim, regard is had to the former position of these tribe-territories as far as the altered circumstances allowed. In the time of the Judges a portion of the Danites had migrated to the north, conquered the city of Laish, and given it the name of Dan, so that from that time forward Dan is generally named as the northern boundary of the land (e.g., as early as <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-10.htm">2 Samuel 3:10</a>, and in other passages). Accordingly Dan receives the tract of land along the northern boundary. Asher and Naphtali, which formerly occupied the most northerly portions of the land, follow next. Then comes Manasseh, as half Manasseh had formerly dwelt on the east of Naphtali; and Ephraim joins Manasseh, as it formerly joined the western half of Manasseh. The reason for placing Reuben between Ephraim and Judah appears to be, that Reuben was the first-born of Jacob's sons. The position of the termuah between Judah and Benjamin is probably connected with the circumstance that Jerusalem formerly stood on the boundary of these two tribes, and so also in the future was to skirt Benjamin with its territory. The other tribes had then to be located on the south of Benjamin; Simeon, whose territory formerly lay to the south; Issachar and Zebulon, for which no room was left in the north; and Gad, which had to be brought over from Gilead to Canaan.<p>In <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-8.htm">Ezekiel 48:8-22</a>, the terumah, which has already been described in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-1.htm">Ezekiel 45:1-7</a> for a different purpose, is more precisely defined: first of all, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-8.htm">Ezekiel 48:8</a>, according to its whole extent - viz. twenty-five thousand rods in breadth (from north to south), and the length the same as any one ( equals  every one) of the tribe-lots, i.e., reaching from the Jordan to the Mediterranean Sea (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-7.htm">Ezekiel 45:7</a>). In the centre of this separated territory the sanctuary (the temple) was to stand. &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493;&#1499;&#1493;, the suffix of which refers ad sensum to &#1495;&#1500;&#1511; instead of &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492;, has not the indefinite meaning "therein," but signifies "in the centre;" for the priests' portion, in the middle of which the temple was to stand, occupied the central position between the portion of the Levites and the city possession, as is evident from <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-22.htm">Ezekiel 48:22</a>. The circumstance that here, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-1.htm">Ezekiel 45:1</a>., in the division of the terumah, the priests' portion is mentioned first, then the portion of the Levites, and after this the city possession, proves nothing so far as the local order in which these three portions followed one another is concerned; but the enumeration is regulated by their spiritual significance, so that first of all the most holy land for the temple and priests is defined, then the holy portion of the Levites, and lastly, the common land for the city. The command, that the sanctuary is to occupy the centre of the whole terumah, leads to a more minute description in the first place (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-9.htm">Ezekiel 48:9-12</a>) of the priests' portion, in which the sanctuary was situated, than of the heave to be lifted off for Jehovah. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-10.htm">Ezekiel 48:10</a>, &#1500;&#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;, which stands at the head, is explained by &#1500;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; which follows. The extent of this holy terumah on all four sides is then given; and lastly, the command is repeated, that the sanctuary of Jehovah is to be in the centre of it. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-11.htm">Ezekiel 48:11</a>, &#1492;&#1502;&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473; is rendered in the plural by the lxx, Chald. and Syr., and is taken in a distributive sense by Kimchi and others: to the priests whoever is sanctified of the sons of Zadok. This is required by the position of the participle between &#1500;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; and &#1502;&#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1510;&#1491;&#1493;&#1511; (compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-18.htm">2 Chronicles 26:18</a>, and for the singular of the participle after a previous plural, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/8-9.htm">Psalm 8:9</a>). The other rendering, "for the priests is it sanctified, those of the sons of Zadok," is at variance not only with the position of the words, but also with the fact, namely, that the assignment to the priests of a heave set apart for Jehovah is never designated as &#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;, and from the nature of the case could not be so designated. The apodosis to <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-11.htm">Ezekiel 48:11</a> follows in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-12.htm">Ezekiel 48:12</a>, where &#1500;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; is resumed in &#1500;&#1492;&#1501;. &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; is an adjective formation derived from &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492;, with the signification of an abstract: that which is lifted (the lifting) from the heave, as it were "a terumah in the second potency" (for these formations, see Ewald, 164 and 165). This terumiyah is called most holy, in contrast with the Levites' portion of the terumah, which was &#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-14.htm">Ezekiel 48:14</a>). The priests' portion is to be beside the territory of the Levites, whether on the southern or northern side cannot be gathered from these words any more than from the definition in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-13.htm">Ezekiel 48:13</a> : "and the Levites beside (parallel with) the territory of the priests." Both statements simply affirm that the portions of the priests and Levites were to lie side by side, and not to be separated by the town possession. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-13.htm">Ezekiel 48:13</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-14.htm">Ezekiel 48:14</a> treat of the Levites' portion: <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-13.htm">Ezekiel 48:13</a>, of its situation and extent; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-14.htm">Ezekiel 48:14</a>, of its law of tenure. The seemingly tautological repetition of the measurement of the length and breadth, as "all the length and the breadth," is occasioned by the fact "that Ezekiel intends to express himself more briefly here, and not, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-10.htm">Ezekiel 48:10</a>, to take all the four points of the compass singly; in 'all the length' he embraces the two long sides of the oblong, and in '(all) the breadth' the two broad sides, and affirms that 'all the length,' i.e., of both the north and south sides, is to be twenty-five thousand rods, and 'all the breadth,' i.e., of both the east and west sides, is to be ten thousand rods" (Kliefoth). Hitzig has missed the sense, and therefore proposes to alter the text. With regard to the possession of the Levites, the instructions given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-34.htm">Leviticus 25:34</a> for the field of the Levites' cities - namely, that none of it was to be sold - are extended to the whole of the territory of the Levites: no part of it is to be alienated by sale or barter. And the character of the possession is assigned as the reason: the first-fruit of the land, i.e., the land lifted off (separated) as first-fruit, is not to pass into the possession of others, because as such it is holy to the Lord. The Chetib ya`abowr &#1497;&#1506;&#1489;&#1493;&#1512; is the correct reading: to pass over, sc. to others, to non-Levites.<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-15.htm">Ezekiel 48:15-18</a> treat of the city possession. As the terumah was twenty-five thousand rods in breadth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-8.htm">Ezekiel 48:8</a>), after measuring off ten thousand rods in breadth for the priests and ten thousand rods in breadth for the Levites from the entire breadth, there still remain five thousand rods &#1506;&#1500;, in front of, i.e., along, the long side, which was twenty-five thousand rods. This remnant was to be &#1495;&#1500;, i.e., common (not holy) land for the city (Jerusalem). &#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;, for dwelling-places, i.e., for building dwelling-houses upon; and &#1500;&#1502;&#1490;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;, for open space, the precinct around the city. The city was to stand in the centre of this oblong. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-16.htm">Ezekiel 48:16</a> gives the size of the city: on each of the four sides, four thousand five hundred rods (the &#1495;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;, designated by the Masoretes as &#1499;&#1514;&#1497;&#1489; &#1493;&#1500;&#1488; &#1511;&#1512;&#1497;, has crept into the text through a copyist's error); and <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-17.htm">Ezekiel 48:17</a>, the extent of the open space surrounding it: on each side two hundred and fifty rods. This gives for the city, together with the open space, a square of five thousand rods on every side; so that the city with its precinct filled the entire breadth of the space left for it, and there only remained on the east and west an open space of ten thousand rods in length and five thousand rods in breadth along the holy terumah. This is noticed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-18.htm">Ezekiel 48:18</a>; its produce was to serve for bread, i.e., for maintenance, for the labourers of the city (the masculine suffix in &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1514;&#1492; refers grammatically to &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;&#1512;). By &#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1497; &#1492;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512; Hitzig would understand the inhabitants of the city, because one cultivates a piece of land even by dwelling on it. But this use of &#1506;&#1489;&#1491; cannot be established. Nor are &#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1497; &#1492;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512; the workmen employed in building the city, as Gesenius, Hvernick, and others suppose; for the city was not perpetually being built, so that there should be any necessity for setting apart a particular piece of land for the builders; but they are the working men of the city, the labouring class living in the city. They are not to be without possession in the future Jerusalem, but are to receive a possession in land for their maintenance. We are told in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-19.htm">Ezekiel 48:19</a> who these workmen are. Here &#1492;&#1506;&#1489;&#1491; is used collectively: as for the labouring class of the city, people out of all the tribes of Israel shall work upon the land belonging to the city. The suffix in &#1497;&#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; points back to &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;&#1512;. The transitive explanation, to employ a person in work, has nothing in the language to confirm it. The fact itself is in harmony with the statement in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-6.htm">Ezekiel 45:6</a>, that the city was to belong to all Israel. Lastly, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-20.htm">Ezekiel 48:20</a> the dimensions of the whole terumah, and the relation of the city possession to the holy terumah, are given. &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492; is the whole heave, so far as it has hitherto been described, embracing the property of the priests, of the Levites, and of the city. In this extent it is twenty-five thousand rods long and the same broad. If, however, we add the property of the prince, which is not treated of till <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-21.htm">Ezekiel 48:21-23</a>, it is considerably longer, and reaches, as has been stated in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-8.htm">Ezekiel 48:8</a>, to the boundaries of the land both on the east and west, the Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea, as the several tribe-territories do. But if we omit the prince's land, the space set apart fro the city possession occupied the fourth part of the holy terumah, i.e., of the portion of the priests and Levites. This is the meaning of the second half of <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-20.htm">Ezekiel 48:20</a>, which literally reads thus: "to a fourth shall ye lift off the holy terumah for the city possession." This is not to be understood as meaning that a fourth was to be taken from the holy terumah for the city possession; for that would yield an incorrect proportion, as the twenty thousand rods in breadth would be reduced to fifteen thousand rods by the subtraction of the fourth part, which would be opposed to <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-9.htm">Ezekiel 48:9</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-15.htm">Ezekiel 48:15</a>. The meaning is rather the following: from the whole terumah the fourth part of the area of the holy terumah is to be taken off for the city possession, i.e., five thousand rods for twenty thousand. According to <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-15.htm">Ezekiel 48:15</a>, this was the size of the domain set apart for the city.<p>In <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-21.htm">Ezekiel 48:21-23</a> the situation and extent of the prince's possession are described. For <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-21.htm">Ezekiel 48:21</a>, vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-7.htm">Ezekiel 45:7</a>. &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;&#1512;, the rest of the terumah, as it has been defined in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-8.htm">Ezekiel 48:8</a>, reaching in length from the Jordan to the Mediterranean. As the holy terumah and the city possession were only twenty-five thousand rods in length, and did not reach to the Jordan on the east, or to the sea on the west, there still remained an area on either side whose length or extent toward the east and west is not given in rods, but may be calculated from the proportion which the intervening terumah bore to the length of the land (from east to west). &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; and &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;, in front of, or along, the front of the twenty-five thousand rods, refer to the eastern and western boundaries of the terumah, which was twenty-five thousand rods in length. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-21.htm">Ezekiel 48:21</a> the statement is repeated, that the holy terumah and the sanctuary were to lie in the centre of it, i.e., between the portions of land appointed for the prince on either side; and lastly, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-22.htm">Ezekiel 48:22</a> it is still further stated, with regard to the prince's land on both sides of the terumah, that it was to lie between the adjoining tribe-territories of Judah (to the north) and Benjamin (to the south), so that it was to be bounded by these two. But this is expressed in a heavy and therefore obscure manner. The words &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493;&#1498; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1500;&#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1488; &#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492;, "in the centre of that which belongs to the prince," belong to &#1492;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512;... &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1488;&#1495;&#1494;&#1468;&#1514;, and form together with the latter the subject, which is written absolutely; so that &#1502;&#1503; is not used in a partitive, but in a local sense (from), and the whole is to be rendered thus: And as for that which lies on the side of the possession of the Levites, and of the possession of the city in the centre of what belongs to the prince, (that which lies) between the territory of Judah and the territory of Benjamin shall belong to the prince. Hitzig's explanation - what remains between Judah and Benjamin, from the city territory to the priests' domain, both inclusive, shall belong to the prince - is arbitrary, and perverts the sense. The periphrastic designation of the terumah bounded off between the prince's land by the two portions named together without a copula, viz., "possession of the Levites and possession of the city," is worthy of notice. This periphrasis of the whole by two portions, shows that the portions named formed the boundaries of the whole, that the third portion, which is not mentioned, was enclosed within the two, so that the priests' portion with the sanctuary lay between them. - In <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-23.htm">Ezekiel 48:23-27</a> the rest of the tribes located to the south of the terumah are mentioned in order; and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-28.htm">Ezekiel 48:28</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-29.htm">Ezekiel 48:29</a> the account of the division of the land is brought to a close with a repetition of the statement as to the southern boundary (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-19.htm">Ezekiel 47:19</a>), and a comprehensive concluding formula.<p>If now we attempt, in order to form a clear idea of the relation in which this prophetic division of the land stands to the actual size of Canaan according to the boundaries described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-15.htm">Ezekiel 47:15</a>., to determine the length and breadth of the terumah given here by their geographical dimensions, twenty-five thousand rods, according to the metrological calculations of Boeckh and Bertheau, would be 1070 geographical miles, or, according to the estimate of the Hebrew cubit by Thenius, only 975 geographical miles.<p>(Note: According to Boeckh, one sacred cubit was equal to 234-1/3 Paris lines  equals  528.62 millimtres; according to Thenius  equals  214-1/2 P. l.  equals  481.62 millim. Now as one geographical mile, the 5400th part of the circumference of the globe, which is 40,000,000 metres, is equivalent to 7407.398 metres  equals  22, 803.290 old Paris feet, the geographical mile according to Boeckh is 14, 012-1/10 cubits  equals  2335-1/2 rods (sacred measure); according to Thenius, 15, 380-1/6 cubits  equals  2563-1/3 roads (s. m.), from which the numbers given in the text may easily be calculated.)<p>The extent of Canaan from Beersheba, or Kadesh, up to a line running across from Rs esh-Shukah to the spring El Lebweh, is 3 1/3 degrees, i.e., fifty geographical miles, ten of which are occupied by the terumah, and forty remain for the twelve tribe-territories, so that each tribe-lot would be 3 1/3 geographical miles in breadth. If, now, we reckon three geographical miles as the breadth of each of the five tribe-lots to the south of the terumah, and as the land becomes broader toward the south a breadth of 3-4/7 geographical miles for the seven tribe-lots to the north, the terumah set apart in the centre of the land would extend from the site of Jerusalem to Dothan or Jenin. If, however, we take into consideration the breadth of the land from east to west in the neighbourhood of Jerusalem, or where the Jordan enters the Dead Sea, Canaan is eleven geographical miles in breadth, whereas at Jenin it is hardly ten geographical miles broad. If, therefore, the length of the terumah (from east to west) was fully ten geographical miles, there would only remain a piece of land of half a mile in breadth on the east and west at the southern boundary, and nothing at all at the northern, for prince's land. We have therefore given to the terumah upon the map (Plate IV) the length and breadth of eight geographical miles, which leaves a tract of two miles on the average for the prince's land, so that it would occupy a fifth of the area of the holy terumah, whereas the city possession covered a fourth. No doubt the breadth of the terumah from south to north is also diminished thereby, so that it cannot have reached quite down to Jerusalem or quite up to Jenin. - If, now, we consider that the distances of places, and therefore also the measurements of a land in length and breadth, are greater in reality than those given upon the map, on account partly of the mountains and valleys and partly of the windings of the roads, and, still further, that our calculations of the Hebrew cubit are not quite certain, and that even the smaller estimates of Thenius are possibly still too high, the measurements of the terumah given by Ezekiel correspond as exactly to the actual size of the land of Canaan as could be expected with a knowledge of its extent obtained not by trigonometrical measurement, but from a simple calculation of the length of the roads. - But this furnishes a confirmation by no means slight of our assumption, that the lengths and breadths indicated here are measured by rods and not by cubits. Reckoned by cubits, the terumah would be only a mile and a half or a mile and two-thirds in length and breadth, and the city possession would be only a third of a mile broad; whereas the prince's land would be more than six times as larg</body></html>
