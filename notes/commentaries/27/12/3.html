Michael signifies, Who is like God, and his name, with the title of the great Prince, points out the Divine Saviour. Christ stood for the children of our people in their stead as a sacrifice, bore the curse for them, to bear it from them. He stands for them in pleading for them at the throne of grace. And after the destruction of antichrist, the Lord Jesus shall stand at the latter day upon the earth; and He shall appear for the complete redemption of all his people. When God works deliverance from persecution for them, it is as life from the dead. When his gospel is preached, many who sleep in the dust, both Jews and Gentiles, shall be awakened by it out of their heathenism of Judaism. And in the end the multitude that sleep in the dust shall awake; many shall arise to life, and many to shame. There is glory reserved for all the saints in the future state, for all that are wise, wise for their souls and eternity.

See the book of Proverbs, passim. True religion is wisdom, and sin is folly, and they who live for God and for heaven are the truly wise. The meaning is, that they have chosen the path which true wisdom suggests as that in which man should walk, while all the ways of sin are ways of folly. The language used here is expressive of a general truth, applicable in itself to all the righteous at all times, and nothing can be inferred from the term employed as to what was designed by the angel.<p>Shall shine as the brightness of the firmament - As the sky above us. The image is that of the sky at night, thick set with bright and beautiful stars. No comparison could be more striking. The meaning would seem to be, that each one of the righteous will be like a bright and beautiful star, and that, in their numbers, and order, and harmony, they would resemble the heavenly constellations at night. Nothing can be more sublime than to look on the heavens in a clear night, and to think of the number and the order of the stars above us as an emblem of the righteous in the heavenly world. The word rendered firmament means, properly, expanse, or what is spread out, and it is applied to the sky as it appears to be spread out above us.<p>And they that turn many to righteousness - Referring to those who would be instrumental in converting men to the worship of the true God, and to the ways of religion. This is very general language, and might be applied to any persons who have been the means of bringing sinners to the knowledge of the truth. It would apply in an eminent degree to ministers of the gospel who were successful in their work, and to missionaries among the pagan. From the mere language, however, nothing certain can be argued as to the original reference as used by the angel, and it seems to have been his intention to employ language so general that it might be applied to all, of all ages and countries, who would be instrumental in turning men to God.<p>As the stars - As the stars that are distinguished by their size and luster in the firmament. In the former part of the verse, when speaking of those who were "wise," the design seems to be to compare them to the sky as it appears, set over with innumerable stars, and in their numbers and groupings constituting great beauty; in this member of the sentence the design seems to be to compare these who are eminent in converting men, to the particular beautiful and bright stars that strike us as we look on the heavens - those more distinguished in size and splendor, and that seem to lead on the others. The meaning is, that amidst the hosts of the saved they will be conspicuous, or they will be honored in proportion to their toils, their sacrifices, and their success.<p>Forever and ever - To all eternity. This refers to those who shall turn many to righteousness; and the meaning is, that they shall continue thus to be distinguished and honored to all eternity. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/daniel/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. wise&#8212;(Pr 11:30).

That are wise, not in things natural and civil, but in things spiritual; who are wise unto salvation; that are wise to know themselves, their state and condition by nature; their impurity and impotence; the insufficiency of their own righteousness; the exceeding sinfulness of sin, and the dangerous circumstances they are in; that are wise to know Christ, and him crucified; to believe in him, and trust in him for everlasting life and salvation: these at the resurrection shall shine, both in body and soul; their bodies shall be fashioned like to the glorious body of Christ; their souls shall be filled with perfect light and knowledge, and be completely holy, without any sin upon them; and this light and glory that will be upon both soul and body will be like the brightness of the heavens when the sun is risen; yea, it will be like the brightness and glory of the sun itself, as our Lord affirms; having, as it seems, respect to this passage, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-43.htm">Matthew 13:43</a>. Some render it, "they that instruct" (i); or make others wise, and so restrain it to ministers of the word; but the more general sense is best; and, besides, they are more particularly described in the next clause: <p>and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars forever and ever; or, "that justify many" (k); that teach the doctrine of a sinner's free justification by the righteousness of Christ; that lead and direct souls sensible of sin, and of the weakness of their own righteousness, to the righteousness of Christ, as being that only which justifies before God; otherwise it is God alone that justifies men, by imputing the righteousness of his Son unto them: but these show men the way of justification, or that which God takes to justify sinners; and this being the principal doctrine of the GospeL, they are denominated from it; and no man deserves the name of a Gospel minister that does not preach it, though this is not all that they preach; they preach all other doctrines of the Gospel in connection with it, and also instruct men thus justified to live soberly, righteously, and godly: now, as these are stars in the church of Christ below, who receive their light from Christ the sun of righteousness, and communicate it to his people; so they will continue stars in the Millennium state, and appear exceeding glorious, having the glory of God and Christ upon them, and not only then, but to all eternity.

And yet, to those living in the midst of them, this was a question of vital interest. Daniel accordingly asks, and receives, specific information on this point (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/12-6.htm" title="And one said to the man clothed in linen, which was on the waters of the river, How long shall it be to the end of these wonders?">Daniel 12:6</a></span> ff.).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever.</span> The rendering of the LXX. differs from this considerably, "Those who understand shall appear as the lights of heaven, and those that confirm my word as the stars of heaven for ever and ever." There seems to be a difference of reading in the first clause. Instead of <span class="accented">yazheeroo kezohar</span>, there seems to have been <span class="accented">yayraro kim'ooroth.</span> The verb used in the Massoretic text means really "admonish." The noun occurs only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-2.htm">Ezekiel 13:2</a>. In the last clause, instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">harabbeem</span>), "many," the Septuagint has read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span> (<span class="accented">deboray</span>), "my words." It is difficult to account for the omission of the final <span class="hebrew">&#x20;&#x5dd;</span> <span class="accented">unless</span> from the likeness of <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;</span> to <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;</span> and  and  (see Corpus Insc. Semit.). Theodotion renders, "And they that understand shall shine as the <span class="accented">brightness</span> of the firmament, and certain from amongst the righteous as the stars for  ever and ever." The Peshitta rendering is somewhat paraphrastic, "Those that do good and are wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament, and those who conquer many shall be lights, and arise as the stars of heaven for ever and ever." The Vulgate is in close harmony with the Massoretic text. The versions are superior to our Authorized, in having "those that understand" instead of "those that be wise." Bevan regards the wise here as the "teachers." There seems, however, no reason for such a restriction. The reading of the Septuagint in the opening clause of the second member of the sentence is inferior, as confirming or justifying the words of Daniel or of God is a simpler idea than that of turning many to righteousness. Further, there is a difficulty of fixing who is referred to by the prenominal suffix "my." Professor Fuller refers to <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-11.htm">Isaiah 51:11</a> for a parallel use of the hiphil of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;</span>; but there, as elsewhere, it means, not "turn to righteousness," but "justify," that is, "declare righteous." Yet the connection between the two ideas is close, and the forensic idea can have no place here. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-43.htm">Matthew 13:43</a> represents a similar reward to the righteous. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/daniel/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>With <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-2.htm">Daniel 7:2</a> Daniel begins his written report: "Daniel began and said," introduces the matter. &#1495;&#1494;&#1493;&#1497; &#1506;&#1501;&#1470;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1488;, visions in (during) the night, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-19.htm">Daniel 2:19</a>. <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-2.htm">Daniel 7:2</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-3.htm">Daniel 7:3</a> describe the scene in general. The four winds of heaven break loose upon the great sea, and rage fiercely, so that four great beasts, each diverse from the others, arise out of its bosom. The great sea is not the Mediterranean (Berth., Ges., Hitz., Ewald), for such a geographical reference is foreign to the context. It is the ocean; and the storm on it represents the "tumults of the people," commotions among the nations of the world (Hv., Leng., Hofm., etc.), corresponding to the prophetic comparison found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-12.htm">Jeremiah 17:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-7.htm">Jeremiah 46:7</a>. "Since the beasts represent the forms of the world-power, the sea must represent that out of which they arise, the whole heathen world" (Hofmann). In the interpretation of the image (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-17.htm">Daniel 7:17</a>) &#1497;&#1490;&#1468;&#1502;&#1488; &#1502;&#1503; is explained by &#1488;&#1512;&#1506;&#1488; &#1502;&#1503;. &#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1495; means to break forth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-2.htm">Ezekiel 32:2</a>), to burst out in storm, not causative, "to make the great sea break forth" (Kran.). The causative meaning is not certainly found either in the Hebrew or the Chaldee. The four winds stand in relation to the four quarters of the heavens; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-39.htm">Jeremiah 49:39</a>. Calvin remarks: Mundus similis turbulento mari, quod non agitatur una procella vel uno vento, sed diversis ventis inter se confligentibus, ac si totum coelum conspiraret ad motus excitandos. With this, however, the meaning of the words is not exhausted. The four winds of heaven are not merely diversi venti, and their bursting forth is not only an image of a general commotion represented by a storm in the ocean. The winds of the heavens represent the heavenly powers and forces by which God sets the nations of the world in motion; and the number four has a symbolical meaning: that the people of all regions of the earth are moved hither and thither in violent commotion. "(Ecumenical commotions give rise to oecumenical kingdoms" (Kliefoth). As a consequence of the storm on the sea, there arise out of it four fierce beasts, not all at once, but, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-6.htm">Daniel 7:6</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-7.htm">Daniel 7:7</a> teach, one after another, and each having a different appearance. The diversity of the form of the beasts, inasmuch as they represent kingdoms, is determined beforehand, not only to make it noticeable that the selection of this symbol is not arbitrary but is significant (Hvernick), but emphatically to intimate that the vision of different kingdoms is not to be dealt with, as many interpreters seem inclined to do, as one only of different kings of one kingdom. </body></html>
