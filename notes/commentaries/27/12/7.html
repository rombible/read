(See <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-14.htm" title="And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.">Daniel 7:14</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">To scatter.</span>—The ancient versions (not the LXX., however) appear to have understood this to mean the dispersion of Israel (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-6.htm" title="For you are an holy people to the LORD your God: the LORD your God has chosen you to be a special people to himself, above all people that are on the face of the earth.">Deuteronomy 7:6</a>), and seem to have connected the “<span class= "ital">end,”</span> of which Daniel speaks, with the cessation of the dispersion of Israel, or, in other words, to have regarded it as a prediction of the re-gathering of Israel, which would immediately precede the coming of Elias. (See the remarks of Theodoret on the passage.) But by the “holy people” are meant, more probably, those who shall suffer in the last days (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-25.htm" title="And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.">Daniel 7:25</a>, “the saints”), and the word “scatter” means to break in pieces, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-9.htm" title="You shall break them with a rod of iron; you shall dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.">Psalm 2:9</a>, &c. So that the words imply that the end will not come till “the shattering of the power of the saints” has been accomplished, or till persecution appears to have stamped out all that remains of godliness. This makes the prophecy accord with <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-25.htm" title="And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.">Daniel 7:25</a> and the parallel passages in the New Testament.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/daniel/12.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/12-7.htm" title="And I heard the man clothed in linen, which was on the waters of the river, when he held up his right hand and his left hand to heaven, and swore by him that lives for ever that it shall be for a time, times, and an half; and when he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people, all these things shall be finished.">Daniel 12:7</a></span>. <span class="ital">And he held up his right hand and his left unto heaven — </span>It was the general custom, in swearing, to lift up one hand to heaven: see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-22.htm" title="And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up my hand to the LORD, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,">Genesis 14:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-40.htm" title="For I lift up my hand to heaven, and say, I live for ever.">Deuteronomy 32:40</a>; but here Christ is represented as holding up both his hands, as a greater confirmation of the truth and importance of what he was about to say; <span class="ital">and sware by him that liveth for ever — </span>By the self-existent and everlasting God. Thus the mighty angel, whom St. John saw, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/10-5.htm" title="And the angel which I saw stand on the sea and on the earth lifted up his hand to heaven,...">Revelation 10:5-6</a>, is brought in, with a plain reference to this vision here, standing with his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the earth, and, with his hand lifted up to heaven, swearing that there should be no longer any delay of the execution of the divine counsels. <span class="ital">That it should be for a time, times, and a half, </span>or, <span class="ital">the dividing of time, </span>as it is expressed in Chaldee, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-25.htm" title="And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.">Daniel 7:25</a>, where see the note, which contains, understood literally, <span class="ital">three years and a half, </span>during which time the public sacrifices and worship were discontinued through the persecution of Antiochus, the type of antichrist. But this line of time is expressly applied to the antichristian persecution, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-14.htm" title="And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent.">Revelation 12:14</a>, and is further explained in that chapter, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/12-6.htm" title="And one said to the man clothed in linen, which was on the waters of the river, How long shall it be to the end of these wonders?">Daniel 12:6</a>, by one thousand two hundred and sixty days, which is three years and a half, reckoning three hundred and sixty days to a year: see note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-24.htm" title="Seventy weeks are determined on your people and on your holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most Holy.">Daniel 9:24</a>. And if we suppose each day to signify a year, which is the prophetical sense of the word <span class="ital">day, </span>this period of time denotes one thousand two hundred and sixty years: see note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-14.htm" title="And he said to me, To two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.">Daniel 8:14</a>. <span class="ital">And when he shall have accomplished to disperse the power of the holy people — </span>When the dispersions of the Jews shall be ended, then the most remarkable events contained in this prophecy shall be fulfilled. The restoration of the Jewish nation is foretold by the prophets, as one of those signal events to be brought to pass in the latter days, or times, of the world. Mr. Mede makes this parallel with those words of Christ, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/21-24.htm" title="And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led away captive into all nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled.">Luke 21:24</a>; <span class="ital">Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled; </span>that is, till the times of the fourth monarchy and the reign of antichrist be expired. Many commentators understand this last clause, which speaks of <span class="ital">accomplishing to scatter the power of the holy people, </span>not of the termination of the time of their dispersions, but of the beginning of it; and suppose that it will be one thousand two hundred and sixty years, from the beginning to the end of that time. But then, by the <span class="ital">power of the holy people, </span>they do not understand the Jews, but the Christians. They do not, therefore, calculate this period from the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans, and the subsequent dispersion of the Jews; but from the time when the anti- christian usurpers began to scatter the power of true Christians, by false doctrines, persecutions, massacres, and religious wars; and they extend it to the period when these powers shall be subverted.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/12.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>12:5-13 One of the angels asking how long it should be to the end of these wonders, a solemn reply is made, that it would be for a time, times, and a half, the period mentioned ch. 7:25, and in the Revelation. It signifies 1260 prophetic days or years, beginning from the time when the power of the holy people should be scattered. The imposture of Mohammed, and the papal usurpation, began about the same time; and these were a twofold attack upon the church of God. But all will end well at last. All opposing rule, principality, and power, shall be put down, and holiness and love will triumph, and be in honour, to eternity. The end, this end, shall come. What an amazing prophecy is this, of so many varied events, and extending through so many successive ages, even to the general resurrection! Daniel must comfort himself with the pleasing prospect of his own happiness in death, in judgment, and to eternity. It is good for us all to think much of going away from this world. That must be our way; but it is our comfort that we shall not go till God calls us to another world, and till he has done with us in this world; till he says, Go thou thy way, thou hast done thy work, therefore now, go thy way, and leave it to others to take thy place. It was a comfort to Daniel, and is a comfort to all the saints, that whatever their lot is in the days of their lives, they shall have a happy lot in the end of the days. And it ought to be the great care and concern of every one of us to secure this. Then we may well be content with our present lot, and welcome the will of God. Believers are happy at all times; they rest in God by faith now, and a rest is reserved for them in heaven at last.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/daniel/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And I heard the man ... - That is, he replied to the question at once, and in a most solemn manner, as if he were communicating a great and momentous truth respecting the future.<p>When he held up his right hand and his left hand unto heaven - Toward heaven; as if appealing to heaven for the sincerity and truth of what he was about to utter. The act of swearing or taking an oath was often accompanied with the lifting up of the hand to heaven, usually the right hand (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-22.htm">Genesis 14:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-8.htm">Exodus 6:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-40.htm">Deuteronomy 32:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-5.htm">Ezekiel 20:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/10-5.htm">Revelation 10:5</a>); but here the angel stretched both hands toward heaven, as if he were about to make the affirmation in the most solemn manner conceivable.<p>And sware by him that liveth for ever - By the eternal God. That is, he appealed to him: he made the solemn asseveration in his presence; he called him to witness to the truth of what he said. The occasion; the manner; the posture of the angel; the appeal to the Eternal One - all give great sublimity to this transaction, and all imply that the answer was to be one of great consequence in regard to future times.<p>That it shall be for a time, times, and an half - Margin, or, a part. The word &#1495;&#1510;&#1497;  cha&#774;ts&#305;&#770;y means, properly, half, the half part, that which is divided (&#1495;&#1510;&#1509;  cha&#770;tsats) - to divide), s. c., in the middle. The word "times" means two times, for it is dual in its form, and the expression means three times, or periods, and a half. See the meaning of the language fully considered and explained in the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/7-24.htm">Daniel 7:24-28</a>. (See Editor's Essay on Year-day Principle, prefixed to the vol. on Revelation.)<p>And when he shall have accomplished - When he shall have finished his purpose in the matter; when he shall have done all that he could do.<p>To scatter the power - All that constituted the power - their armies, means of defense, etc. The word rendered "power" (&#1497;&#1491;  ya&#770;d) means, properly, hand, but it is sometimes used to denote a part of a thing - as a portion that we take up by the hand - a handful; that is, a part of a thing taken up at once in dividing - Gesenius, Lexicon See <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-3.htm">Jeremiah 6:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-7.htm">2 Kings 11:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/47-24.htm">Genesis 47:24</a>. In accordance with this, Gesenius, Lengerke, and De Wette suppose that the reference here is to the scattering of a portion or part of the Hebrew people in other lands, and to the hope that they would be restored again to their own country; and that the meaning of the angel is, that when these dispersions were ended, all this would have been accomplished. The word has also the sense of power, might, strength (Gesenius, Lexicon), the hand being regarded as the seat of strength, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-2.htm">Isaiah 28:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/27-11.htm">Job 27:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/76-5.htm">Psalm 76:5</a> (6).<p>Thus employed, it may denote whatever constituted their strength; and then the idea in the passage before us is, that all this would be scattered. When that should have been done; when that dispersion should have been ended; when these scattered forces and people should have been again restored, then all this that was predicted would be accomplished, and these troubles cease. This would be in the period designated by the "time, and times, and an half." If it refers to Antiochus, it means that the scattered forces and people of the Hebrews would be rallied under the Maccabees, and that on their return victory would crown their efforts, and the land would be again at peace. If it has a higher and an ultimate signification, it would seem to imply that when the scattered Hebrew people should be gathered into the Christian church - when their dispersions and their wanderings should come to an end by their returning to the Messiah, and, under him, to the true God, then the series of predictions will have received their complete fulfillment - for then religion will triumph in the world, and the kingdom of God be set up over all the nations, agreeably to <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-15.htm">Romans 11:15-25</a>. In reference, then, to the meaning of the passage as used by the angel here, the following remarks may be made:<p>(1) It had an applicability to the times of Antiochus, and to the duration of the calamities that would come upon the Hebrew people under his reign. If there had been nothing further intended than this, the mere language employed would have found a literal fulfillment in these events, and there can be no reasonable doubt that the primary reference of the angel was to them. See this point fully considered and illustrated in the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/7-24.htm">Daniel 7:24-28</a>.<p>(2) Yet there are circumstances which lead us to suppose that, at the same time, and by the laws of prophetic suggestion (see Introduction to Isaiah, Section 7.), more important events were also referred to, and were designed to be connected with this statement. Those circumstances are<p>(a) the manner in which the angel introduces the subject - by a solemn appeal, with out-stretched arms, to heaven. This would look as if he regarded the answer as of momentous importance, and as if he were contemplating vast movements in the future.<p>(b) The fact that the language here had a settled meaning - referring, as used, elsewhere, to future events deeply affecting the welfare of the world. The language is so couched, indeed, that it would express the fact in regard to the duration of the troubles under Antiochus; but it was also of such a nature that in its higher signification it would describe the duration of more momentous transactions, and would designate a period when the true religion would begin its universal reign; when the evils of a vast Anti-christian power would come to an end, and when the kingdom of the saints would be set up in the world. See the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/7-24.htm">Daniel 7:24-28</a>.<p>(3) The full meaning of the language would then seem to be, that the angel designed to include all in the future to which those words, as intended by the Divine Spirit, would be applicable. The period designated by the phrase, "a time, and times, and an half," was most momentous. In that time the troubles introduced by Antiochus would end, and a state of peace and prosperity would succeed; and in that time, also, far greater troubles and woes - those connected with a most fearful apostasy from the true religion, and the setting up of a kingdom of oppression and wrong over the people of God, of which the oppressions and wrongs under Antiochus would be but an emblem, would also come to an end, and there would be a state of peace - a reign of righteousness - a prevalence of religion - and a far-diffused happiness in the world, at which the joy at the dedication of the temple, and the triumphs over Antiochus, would be but a symbol. The ultimate reference, therefore, I suppose, is to the downfall of that great Anti-christian power, the Papacy, and the spread and triumphs of the true religion subsequent to that, and consequent on that in the world. These were events that justified the solemn asseveration of the angel, and that made it proper for him, in referring to them, to stretch out both his hands in this sublime manner to heaven. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/daniel/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. held up &#8230; right &#8230; and &#8230; left hand&#8212;Usually the right hand was held up in affirmation as an appeal to heaven to attest the truth (De 32:40; Re 10:5, 6). Here both hands are lifted up for the fuller confirmation.<p>time, times, and a half&#8212;(See on [1111]Da 7:25). Newton, referring this prophecy to the Eastern apostasy, Mohammedanism, remarks that the same period of three and a half years, or 1260 prophetic days, is assigned to it as the Western apostasy of the little horn (Da 7:25); and so, says Prideaux, Mohammed began to forge his imposture, retiring to his cave, A.D. 606, the very year that Phocas made the grant to the bishop of Rome, whence he assumed the title, The Universal Pastor; Antichrist thus setting both his feet on Christendom together, the one in the East, and the other in the West. Three and a half is the time of the world power, in which the earthly kingdoms rule over the heavenly [Auberlen]. "Three and a half" represents the idea of spiritual trial; (besides this certain symbolical meaning, there is doubtless an accurate chronological meaning, which is as yet to us uncertain): it is half of "seven," the complete number, so a semi-perfect state, one of probation. The holy city is trodden by the Gentiles forty-two months (Re 11:2), so the exercise of the power of the beast (Re 13:5). The two witnesses preach in sackcloth 1260 days, and remained unburied three days and a half: so the woman in the wilderness: also the same for a "time, times, and a half" (Re 11:3, 9, 11; 12:6, 14). Forty-two connects the Church with Israel, whose haltings in the wilderness were forty-two (Nu 33:1-50). The famine and drought on Israel in Elijah's days were for "three years and six months" (Lu 4:25; Jas 5:17); there same period as Antiochus' persecution: so the ministry of the Man of Sorrows, which ceased in the midst of a week (Da 9:27) [Wordsworth, Apocalypse].<p>scatter &#8230; holy people&#8212;"accomplished" here answers to "the consummation" (Da 9:27), namely, the "pouring out" of the last dregs of the curse on the "desolated holy people." Israel's lowest humiliation (the utter "scattering of her power") is the precursor of her exaltation, as it leads her to seek her God and Messiah (Mt 23:39).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/daniel/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">He held up his right hand and his left hand unto heaven:</span> here he calls God to witness the truth of this thing: many reasons are given by sundry expositors of it why he held up both hands to heaven. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

Christ, as he appeared in a human form, and as the High Priest our profession, and as the Mediator that has power over all flesh; so he pronounced articulate sounds with a human voice, and so loud, clear, and distinct, that Daniel could hear every word he said, and for whose sake it was said: <p>when he held up his right hand and his left hand unto heaven; the lifting up of the right hand is a gesture used in swearing, and the lifting up of both hands is either for the greater solemnity of the action, or with respect to the two angels that stood one on one side of him, and the other on the other, that both might be eyewitnesses of this solemn affair; though lifting up both hands is often a prayer gesture, and there may be a mixture of both in this action, of both praying and swearing; Christ, as the High Priest, intercedes for his church and people, that their faith fail not till the end of their troubles comes: <p>and sware by him that liveth for ever; by the living God, the immortal One, who only hath immortality. Maimonides (n) interprets it, "by the Life of the world"; that is, by God, who is the Life of the world, that gives life and being to all creatures; all live, and move, and have their being in him, and so is greater than all, and by whom an oath is only to be taken. Christ, as man, swears by his divine Father, who, as such, was greater than he; though, if we understand it of God, Father, Son, and Spirit, the one, only, true, and living God, there is no impropriety in Christ's swearing by himself the living God, which is a character he sometimes bears; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-12.htm">Hebrews 3:12</a>, what he here swears to is, <p>that it shall be for a time, times, and an half; that it would be so long to the end of these wonderful things; or that the troubles of the church would last so long, and, at the end of that date here fixed, a glorious scene would open, and amazing things appear, to the great joy and comfort of the saints. "Time" signifies a prophetic year, or 360 years; and "times" two prophetic years, or 720 years; and half a time half a prophetic year, or 180 years, in all 1260 years; which is the exact date and duration of the reign of antichrist, of the church's being in the wilderness, and of the witnesses prophesying in sackcloth, and of the treading under foot the holy city, expressed both by 1260 days, and by forty two months, which are the same; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/11-2.htm">Revelation 11:2</a>, <p>and when he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people: that is, either, "when he (God) shall have finished the scattering the power of the holy people", the Jews; when the dispersion of them, who were formerly a holy people to the Lord, and shall be so again, will be over; and they shall be gathered out of all nations where they have been dispersed, and, being converted, shall return to their own land: or, "when he" (antichrist) "shall have done scattering", the church and people of God in general; when his wars with the saints, and victories over them, will be ended; and particularly when the slaying of the witnesses will be over, at which time there will be a great scattering of the saints; they will be as sheep without a shepherd, their pastors being smitten, slain, or removed into corners; all which things will be fulfilled about the end of the date before mentioned: <p>and then all these things shall be finished; or, as the same glorious Person explains it, "time will be no longer, and the mystery of God will be finished", <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/10-6.htm">Revelation 10:6</a>, the time of antichrist's reign, and of the troubles of the church, and the witnesses' prophesying in sackcloth, will be protracted no longer than the time, and times, and half a time, or the 1260 days, or forty months, that is, 1260 years; then all the afflictions of the church will be at an end, and glorious times will succeed, as before spoken of; the spiritual reign of Christ, the first resurrection, and the Millennium, in their order. <p>(n) Moreh Nevochim, par. 1. c. 72. p. 146.

Hence Bevan and Marti, transposing two words, and changing the punctuation, read, ‘and as the power of the shatterer of the holy people cometh to an end [or, ‘as the hand (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-25.htm" title="And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.">Daniel 7:25</a>) … faileth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/71-9.htm" title="Cast me not off in the time of old age; forsake me not when my strength fails.">Psalm 71:9</a>)’], all these things shall be finished,’ i.e. Antiochus is to be the last oppressor of all, when <span class="ital">his</span> power has ceased, the sufferings of the holy people will be ended for ever.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I heard the man clothed in</span> <span class="cmt_word">linen, which was upon the waters of the river, when he held up his right hand and his left hand unto heaven, and sware by him that liveth for ever that it shall be for a time, times, and an half; and when he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people, all these things shall be finished.</span> The Septuagint essentially agrees with this. It omits "man" in the first clause; has "water" instead of "waters;" adds "God" as explanatory of "him that liveth for ever;" it renders "scatter the power" by "loose the hands." Theodotion, while agreeing with the Massoretic text as to the first portion of the verse, differs very much in the end. He renders, "when the scattering is finished, they shall know these things." There is, as will be seen, no reference to the "holy people." His manuscript must have omitted "holy," for the rest may be explained by a false division into words, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d3;&#x5be;&#x5e2;&#x5dd;</span> being read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d3;&#x5e2;&#x5d5;</span> The Massoretic reading is to be preferred. The Peshitta and Vulgate do not call for remark. <span class="accented">When he held up his right hand and his left hand unto heaven.</span> The lifting up the hand, in sign of making a solemn asseveration, is used of God himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-40.htm">Deuteronomy 32:40</a>), of Abraham (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-22.htm">Genesis 14:22</a>), of the angel in the passage in Revelation founded on this (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/10-5.htm">Revelation 10:5</a>). Here the fact that both right hand and left hand are lifted up to heaven gives greater solemnity to the act. <span class="accented">And sware by him that liveth for ever.</span> This title is ascribed to God in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-34.htm">Daniel 4:34</a> (31); also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-40.htm">Deuteronomy 32:40</a>; the idea is involved in the name Jehovah (Yahveh). The relationship between the oath and the ascription to God, on whose faithfulness its fulfilment depended, is obvious, The fact that the "man clothed in linen" thus "swears" implies that in some way he is the source of the determination of the period. This notion is involved in the whole spiritual scenery of the Book of Daniel; the angels of the nations are the agents under God for carrying out the decrees of providence. <span class="accented">That it shall be for a time</span>, <span class="accented">times</span>, <span class="accented">and an half.</span> This is a space of time repeatedly used in the Biblical apocalypses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-25.htm">Daniel 7:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-14.htm">Revelation 12:14</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-3.htm">Revelation 11:3</a>, the same period seems to be represented by twelve hundred and sixty days. In the present case twelve hundred and ninety days seem to be regarded as equivalent to the "time, times, and an half (ver. 11). The divergency of interpretation comes to its height here. A great number of interpreters - not merely those of the critical school - maintain that "time" here is a literal year, and the days of the succeeding verses literal days, and that the period in question is that between the desecration of the temple by Antiochus's orders, and the setting up "the abomination of desolation" (1 Macc. 1:54), till the Jews were able to sacrifice once more in the re-consecrated temple (1 Macc. 4:52). This period, however, is only ten days over the three years from the 15th Casleu, 145 of the era of the Seleucids, to the 25th Casleu, 148. Or, if we take the date from the time that sacrifices to Jupiter began, till the re-establishment of the worship of Jehovah, it is then exactly three years from the 25th Casleu to the 25th Casleu. This period is not sufficient. Professor Moses Stuart gets over the difficulty by reckoning back from the cleansing of the temple to what he consider, the probable date of Antiochus's entrance into Jerusalem on his retreat from Egypt. This, however, is arbitrary, as the eleventh verse makes the <span class="accented">terminus a quo</span> the setting up of the "abomination of desolation," which occurred in 145, Seleucid era. Professor Bevan would reckon to the death of Antiochus. Of this event we only know it happened in 149, Seleucid era (1 Macc. 6:16). If the year began, as the Maceabaean reckoning seems to have been, with the month Nisan, it might be that approximately three years and a half was the time from the desecration of the temple to the death of Anti-ochua But the death of Antiochus produced but little change on the condition of the Jews. In the following year Lysias inflicted a defeat on Judas and besieged Jerusalem, and captured a portion of the city. To some extent we have anticipated our remarks on this text when considering <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-25.htm">Daniel 7:25</a>. There are, however, peculiarities due to the fact that Aramaic, not Hebrew, is the language used in that passage. <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5d3;</span> (<span class="accented">mo'ed</span>), here rendered "time." is translated "congregation" most generally in the Peutatcuch. Sometimes it is "feast," and sometimes it is "season;"  but if the word here means a definite period of time, it is the only case in which it does so, and it is a word that appears several hundreds of times in the Scriptures. We admit that the enumeration of days which follows renders the assertion that <span class="accented">mo'ed</span> means here a "year," to some extent plausible, yet only plausible. But the next question arises - Even though we should grant that it means a year, are we to understand a literal year? We saw that the "weeks" of ch. 9. are not to be taken literally, but as weeks of years, in which each day stands for a year; the contention of the traditional interpreters has then a justification from analogy in taking a <span class="accented">mo'ed</span>, if a "year," to be one of three hundred and sixty or three hundred and sixty-five years. Not only is the extent of time indicated here extremely doubtful, but the <span class="accented">terminus a qao</span> is also. Although the writer of 1 Maccabees fixes the setting up the abomination of desolation, that is only his interpretation. Our Lord, on the other hand, refers it to the Roman conquest of Jerusalem, which was a vastly more thorough destruction than that inflicted by Antiochus. The meaning of this period is not fixed yet. <span class="accented">When he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people.</span> Professor Bevan would change the reading here, as from the order of the Greek words in the Septuagint he deduces that the order in the text before the translator was different from that in the Massoretic text. He would render, "When the power of the shatterer of the holy people shall come to an end." Behrmann sees grammatical difficulties, but these are not cogent; but the argument for this change is weak. Yet we prefer, though with difficulty, Professor Bevan's reading. It makes the connection much simpler to take this solution, as the end of all things is not the scattering of the holy people, but their building up. If we had any authority from the versions we should be inclined to read <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5db;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>, and insert <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span> before <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5db;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b6;&#x5d9;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, and thus would wish to render, "From the breaking of the power of the scatterer of the holy people till all these things are ended." This gives beth <span class="accented">termini</span>, but none of the versions gives any hint of such a reading. <span class="accented">All these things shall be finished.</span> As the resurrection is mentioned in the second verse, we might at once assume that this refers to the end of time; but <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-34.htm">Matthew 24:34</a>, compared with 30, renders this conclusion doubtful. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/daniel/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The fourth beast. - Introduced by a more detailed description, the fourth beast is presented more distinctly before our notice than those which preceded it. Its terribleness and its strength, breaking in pieces and destroying all things, and the fact that no beast is named to which it can be likened, represent it as different from all the beasts that went before. This description corresponds with that of the fourth kingdom denoted by the legs and the feet of the metallic image of the monarchies (<a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/2.htm">Daniel 2</a>). The iron breaking in pieces all things (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-40.htm">Daniel 2:40</a>) is here represented by the great iron teeth with which this monster devoured and brake in pieces. In addition to that, there are also feet, or, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-19.htm">Daniel 7:19</a> by way of supplement adds, "claws of brass," with which in the mere fury of its rage it destroyed all that remained, i.e., all that it did not devour and destroy with its teeth. &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492; &#1492;&#1497;&#1488; (it was made different) denotes not complete diversity of being, from which Hitz. and Del. conclude that the expression suits only the Macedonian world-kingdom, which as occidental was different in its nature from the three preceding monarchies, which shared among themselves an oriental home and a different form of civilisation and despotic government. For although &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492; expresses more than &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-5.htm">Daniel 7:5</a>), yet the &#1491;&#1468;&#1488; &#1502;&#1503; &#1491;&#1468;&#1488; &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;&#1503; (diverse one from another), spoken (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-3.htm">Daniel 7:3</a>) of all the beasts, shows that &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492; cannot be regarded as expressing perfect diversity of being, but only diversity in appearance. The beast was of such terrible strength and destructive rage, that the whole animal world could furnish no representative by whose name it might be characterized. It had ten horns, by which its terrible strength is denoted, because a horn is in Scripture always the universal symbol of armed strength. With this the interpretation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-24.htm">Daniel 7:24</a>), that these horns are so many kings or kingdoms, fully corresponds. In the ten horns the ten toes of the image (<a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/2.htm">Daniel 2</a>) are again repeated. The number ten comes into consideration only according to its symbolical meaning of comprehensive and definite totality. That the horns are on the head of the one beast, signifies that the unfolding of its power in the ten kingdoms is not a weakening of its power, but only its full display.</body></html>
