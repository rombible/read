It signifies 1260 prophetic days or years, beginning from the time when the power of the holy people should be scattered. The imposture of Mohammed, and the papal usurpation, began about the same time; and these were a twofold attack upon the church of God. But all will end well at last. All opposing rule, principality, and power, shall be put down, and holiness and love will triumph, and be in honour, to eternity. The end, this end, shall come. What an amazing prophecy is this, of so many varied events, and extending through so many successive ages, even to the general resurrection! Daniel must comfort himself with the pleasing prospect of his own happiness in death, in judgment, and to eternity. It is good for us all to think much of going away from this world. That must be our way; but it is our comfort that we shall not go till God calls us to another world, and till he has done with us in this world; till he says, Go thou thy way, thou hast done thy work, therefore now, go thy way, and leave it to others to take thy place. It was a comfort to Daniel, and is a comfort to all the saints, that whatever their lot is in the days of their lives, they shall have a happy lot in the end of the days. And it ought to be the great care and concern of every one of us to secure this. Then we may well be content with our present lot, and welcome the will of God. Believers are happy at all times; they rest in God by faith now, and a rest is reserved for them in heaven at last.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/daniel/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And he said, Go thy way, Daniel - That is, make no further inquiries. All has been disclosed that is to be. At the close of his communication <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/12-4.htm">Daniel 12:4</a>, he had told Daniel to shut up, and seal the book, for his revelations were ended. He here repeats substantially the same thing, and he assures him that no more could be imparted on the subject.<p>For the words are closed up and sealed until the time of the end - He had finished his communication, and had directed Daniel to close up the record which he made of it, and to affix a seal to the volume, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/12-4.htm">Daniel 12:4</a>. He regarded the whole, therefore, as closed and sealed, until the "end" should come. The events themselves would unfold the meaning of the prediction more fully, and would confirm its truth by their exact correspondence with it. Yet, though the revelation was closed, and all that the angel had designed to say had been said, he does, in the subsequent verses, throw out some suggestions as to the time, or as to some important events which were to mark the termination of the wonders referred to. They are bare hints, however, the meaning of which was to be reserved until the time when the predictions would be accomplished, and they are not of such a nature that they can be supposed to have furnished any additional light to Daniel, or to have done anything to relieve the perplexity of his mind in the case. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/daniel/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9.

The Peshitta and the Vulgate agree with the Massoretic. <span class="accented">Go thy way</span>, <span class="accented">Daniel.</span> This is a refusal to grant Daniel's prayer, but in the refusal no condemnation of Daniel is implied. The oracles were sealed until circumstance broke the seal. The purpose of prophecy was not to enable men to write history beforehand. It is to be a sign that, recognized in its fulfilment, may afford evidence of the Divinity of the message or person to whom it referred. <span class="accented">Closed up and sealed.</span> This verse gives us the real meaning of these words. Daniel's oracles were not concealed and sealed from being read, but because they were not interpreted they were not understood. For even to Daniel they are "closed up and sealed." <span class="accented">Till the time of the end.</span> This is omitted, as may be seen above, from the Septuagint. Although this has a satisfactory meaning, yet it seems better to connect this verse more directly with that which follows. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/daniel/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The judgment on the horn speaking great things and on the other beasts, and the delivering of the kingdom to the Son of Man.<p>After Daniel had for a while contemplated the rising up of the little horn that appeared among the ten horns, the scene changed. There is a solemn sitting in judgment by God, and sentence is pronounced. Seats or chairs were placed. &#1512;&#1502;&#1497;&#1493;, activ. with an indefinite subject: they were thrown, i.e., they were placed in order quickly, or with a noise. Seats, not merely a throne for God the Judge, but a number of seats for the assembly sitting in judgment with God. That assembly consists neither of the elders of Israel (Rabb.), nor of glorified men (Hengstb. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-4.htm">Revelation 4:4</a>), but of angels (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-8.htm">Psalm 89:8</a>), who are to be distinguished from the thousands and tens of thousands mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-10.htm">Daniel 7:10</a>; for these do not sit upon thrones, but stand before God as servants to fulfil His commands and execute His judgments. &#1497;&#1493;&#1502;&#1497;&#1503; &#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1511;, one advanced in days, very old, is not the Eternal; for although God is meant, yet Daniel does not see the everlasting God, but an old man, or a man of grey hairs, in whose majestic from God makes Himself visible (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-26.htm">Ezekiel 1:26</a>). When Daniel represents the true God as an aged man, he does so not in contrast with the recent gods of the heathen which Antiochus Epiphanes wished to introduce, or specially with reference to new gods, as Hitzig and Kran. suppose, by reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-17.htm">Deuteronomy 32:17</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-23.htm">Jeremiah 23:23</a>; for God is not called the old God, but appears only as an old man, because age inspires veneration and conveys the impression of majesty. This impression is heightened by the robe with which He is covered, and by the appearance of the hair of His head, and also by the flames of fire which are seen to go forth from His throne. His robe is white as snow, and the hair of His head is white like pure wool; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-14.htm">Revelation 1:14</a>. Both are symbols of spotless purity and holiness. Flames of fire proceed from His throne as if it consisted of it, and the wheels of His throne scatter forth fire. One must not take the fire exclusively as a sign of punishment. Fire and the shining of fire are the constant phenomena of the manifestation of God in the world, as the earthly elements most fitting for the representation of the burning zeal with which the holy God not only punishes and destroys sinners, but also purifies and renders glorious His own people; see under <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-3.htm">Exodus 3:3</a>. The fire-scattering wheels of the throne show the omnipresence of the divine throne of judgment, the going of the judgment of God over the whole earth (Kliefoth). The fire which engirds with flame the throne of God pours itself forth as a stream from God into the world, consuming all that is sinful and hostile to God in the world, and rendering the people and kingdom of God glorious. &#1511;&#1491;&#1502;&#1493;&#1492;&#1497; &#1502;&#1503; (from before Him) refers to God, and not to His throne. A thousand times a thousand and ten thousand times ten thousand are hyperbolical expressions for an innumerable company of angels, who as His servants stand around God; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-2.htm">Deuteronomy 33:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-18.htm">Psalm 68:18</a>. The Keri presents the Chaldaic form &#1488;&#1500;&#1508;&#1497;&#1503; for the Hebraizing form of the text &#1488;&#1500;&#1508;&#1497;&#1501; (thousands), and for &#1512;&#1489;&#1493;&#1503; the Hebraizing form &#1512;&#1489;&#1489;&#1503; (myriads), often found in the Targg., to harmonize the plur. form with the singular &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493; going before.<p>Forthwith the judgment begins. &#1497;&#1514;&#1489; &#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1504;&#1488; we translate, with most interpreters, the judgment sets itself. &#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1504;&#1488;, judgment, abstr. pro concreto, as judicium in Cicero, Verr. 2. 18. This idea alone is admissible in <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/7-26.htm">Daniel 7:26</a>, and here also it is more simple than that defended by Dathe and Kran.: "He" (i.e., the Ancient of days) "sets Himself for judgment," - which would form a pure tautology, since His placing Himself for judgment has been already (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-9.htm">Daniel 7:9</a>) mentioned, and nothing would be said regarding the object for which the throne was set. - "The books were opened." The actions of men are recorded in the books, according to which they are judged, some being ordained to eternal life and others condemned to eternal death; cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/20-12.htm">Revelation 20:12</a>, and the notes under <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/12-1.htm">Daniel 12:1</a>. The horn speaking great things is first visited with the sentence of death. </body></html>
