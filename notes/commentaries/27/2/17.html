Observe, reader, whatever is the matter of our care, or occasions us trouble or fear, we must spread before God in prayer; for God gives us leave to be humbly free with him, and in prayer to enter into the detail of our wants and burdens. The danger here equally threatened Daniel and his friends, and therefore it was fit they should all join in prayer for the averting of it. And here we see the power and efficacy of united addresses to Heaven, and the important benefits which the fervent prayers of a few holy men may sometimes bring down upon a multitude. Daniel’s prudence, and his piety, with that of his friends, were the means of saving the lives of all the wise men of Babylon!<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:14-23 Daniel humbly prayed that God would discover to him the king's dream, and the meaning of it. Praying friends are valuable friends; and it well becomes the greatest and best men to desire the prayers of others. Let us show that we value our friends, and their prayers. They were particular in prayer. And whatever we pray for, we can expect nothing but as the gift of God's mercies. God gives us leave in prayer to tell our wants and burdens. Their plea with God was, the peril they were in. The mercy Daniel and his fellows prayed for, was bestowed. The fervent prayers of righteous men avail much. Daniel was thankful to God for making known that to him, which saved the lives of himself and his fellows. How much more should we be thankful to God, for making known the great salvation of the soul to those who are not among the worldly wise and prudent!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/daniel/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Then Daniel went to his house - It is quite evident that he had obtained the object of his request, though this is not expressly mentioned. The king was undoubtedly, for the reasons above stated, willing that he should have a fair opportunity to try his skill in disclosing the mysterious secret.<p>And made the thing known to Hananiah ... - Made the whole matter known - the perplexity respecting the dream; the failure of the Chaldeans to interpret it; the decree; and his own petition to the king.

It was not a small thing, he was sure, that God was about, wherewith he had troubled the king’s mind in such a manner.

Which Sanctius thinks was in the king's palace; very probably it might be near it, somewhere in the city of Babylon; for that it should be twenty miles from that city, as Benjamin of Tudela relates (o), is not likely; since Arioch's orders reached to none but the wise men of Babylon, and where he sought for and found Daniel; hither he went, to be alone, and to seek the Lord in secret: <p>and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions; who either dwelt in the same house with him, or not far off; whom he sent for and acquainted with all that had passed, both between the king and the wise men, and the consequence of that; and between him and the king, and what promise he had made, relying on his God and theirs. <p>(o) Itinerarium, p. 76. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/daniel/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions:</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/daniel/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">17–19</span>. In answer to the supplication of Daniel and his three friends, the secret of Nebuchadnezzar’s dream is revealed to him in a dream.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions</span>. There is nothing in the versions that calls for remark here, save that the Septuagint seems to have had <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b9;&#x5dc;</span>, "all," or some such word, instead of <span class="accented">mill'tha.</span> Alter having got his petition granted, to all appearance easily, Daniel now proceeds to his own house. As during the period of their education the four friends had formed one "mess" in the hall of Nebuchadnezzar, and it is probable had one table set apart to them, so when in college - if we may use the phrase - they occupied one apartment or set of apartments. Their life in the matter of food was simple and abstemious, and it is little likely that they would require extensive accommodation. Having got the reprieve he had petitioned for, Daniel now informs his friends of it. We have assumed that the news of the royal decree had reached the college where, among other students and soothsayers of as yet lesser grade, Daniel and his friends abode; in that case, he would merely have to inform them how he had sped with Arioch. and how he had further presented a petition to the king tbr a time to be set when he should answer the king's request, and how he got what he desired. It may, however, have been that Daniel had alone heard the dreadful news, and then acted so that his companions heard only of the threatened disaster when they heard of the mode of escape. It is to be observed, in passing, that the names of the friends are given in the Hebrew, not in the Babylonian form. Alone with each other, we may imagine they  used the old Hebrew names of their childhood. Now especially would the sacred tongue be present to their lips and their thoughts when the cloud of a great danger hung over them. It was as Jews, members of the holy people, that they could appeal for help and deliverance to Jehovah the God of Israel. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/46.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Sacrifices for the Sabbath and New Moon<p>As, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-17.htm">Ezekiel 45:17</a>, it devolved upon the prince to provide and bring the sacrifices for himself and the house of Israel; after the appointment of the sacrifices to be offered at the yearly feasts (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-18.htm">Ezekiel 45:18-25</a>), and before the regulation of the sacrifices for the Sabbath and new moon (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-4.htm">Ezekiel 46:4-7</a>), directions are given as to the conduct of the prince at the offering of these sacrifices (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-1.htm">Ezekiel 46:1-3</a>). For although the slaughtering and preparation of the sacrifices for the altar devolved upon the priests, the prince was to be present at the offering of the sacrifices to be provided by him, whereas the people were under no obligation to appear before the Lord in the temple except at the yearly feasts.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-1.htm">Ezekiel 46:1</a>. Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, The gate of the inner court, which looks toward the east, shall be shut the six working days, and on the Sabbath it shall be opened, and on the day of the new moon it shall be opened. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-2.htm">Ezekiel 46:2</a>. And the prince shall come by the way to the porch of the gate from without, and stand at the posts of the gate, and the priests shall prepare his burnt-offering and his peace-offerings, and he shall worship on the threshold of the gate and then go out; but the gate shall not be shut till the evening. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-3.htm">Ezekiel 46:3</a>. And the people of the land shall worship at the entrance of that gate on the Sabbaths and on the new moons before Jehovah. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-4.htm">Ezekiel 46:4</a>. And the burnt-offering which the prince shall offer to Jehovah shall consist on the Sabbath-day of six lambs without blemish and a ram without blemish; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-5.htm">Ezekiel 46:5</a>. And as a meat-offering, an ephah for the ram, and for the lambs as a meat-offering that which his hand may give, and of oil a hin to the ephah (of meal). <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-6.htm">Ezekiel 46:6</a>. And on the day of the new moon there shall be an bullock, a young ox without blemish, and six lambs and a ram without blemish; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-7.htm">Ezekiel 46:7</a>. And he shall put an ephah for the bullock, and an ephah for the ram for the meat-offering, and for the lambs as much as his hand affords, and of oil a hin for the ephah. - <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-1.htm">Ezekiel 46:1-3</a> supply and explain the instructions given in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-1.htm">Ezekiel 44:1-3</a> concerning the outer eastern gate. As the east gate of the outer court (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-1.htm">Ezekiel 44:1</a>), so also the east gate of the inner court was to remain closed during the six working days, and only to be opened on the Sabbaths and new moons, when it was to remain open till the evening. The prince was to enter this inner east gate, and to stand there and worship upon the threshold while his sacrifice was being prepared and offered. &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1488; &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498; &#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1501; is to be taken as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-3.htm">Ezekiel 44:3</a>; but &#1502;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509;, which is appended, is not to be referred to the entrance into the inner court, as the statement would be quite superfluous so far as this is concerned, since any one who was not already in the inner court must enter the gate-building of the inner court from without, or from the outer court. The meaning of &#1502;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509; is rather that the prince was to enter, or to go to, the gate porch of the inner court through the outer east gate. There he was to stand at the posts of the gate and worship on the threshold of the gate during the sacrificial ceremony; and when this was over he was to go out again, namely, by the same way by which he entered (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-3.htm">Ezekiel 44:3</a>). But the people who came to the temple on the Sabbaths and new moons were to worship &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1495;, i.e., at the entrance of this gate, outside the threshold of the gate. Kliefoth in wrong in taking &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1495; in the sense of through the doorway, as signifying that the people were to remain in front of the outer east gate, and to worship looking at the temple through this gate and through the open gate between. For &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512; &#1492;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; roF ., hits gate, can only be the gate of the inner court, which has been already mentioned. There is no force in the consideration which has led Kliefoth to overlook &#1492;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;, and think of the outer gate, namely, that "it would be unnatural to suppose that the people were to come into the outer court through the outer north and south gates, whilst the outer east gate remained shut (or perhaps more correctly, was opened for the prince), and so stand in front of the inner court," as it is impossible to see what there is that is unnatural in such a supposition. On the other hand, it is unnatural to assume that the people, who, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-9.htm">Ezekiel 46:9</a>, were to come through the north and south gates into the outer court at all the &#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; to appear before Jehovah, were not allowed to enter the court upon the Sabbaths and new moons if they should wish to worship before Jehovah upon these days also, but were to stand outside before the gate of the outer court. The difference between the princes and the people, with regard to visiting the temple upon the Sabbaths and new moons, consisted chiefly in this, that the prince could enter by the outer east gate and proceed as far as the posts of the middle gate, and there worship upon the threshold of the gate, whereas the people were only allowed to come into the outer court through the outer north and south gates, and could only proceed to the front of the middle gate. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-4.htm">Ezekiel 46:4</a>. The burnt-offering for the Sabbath is considerably increased when compared with that appointed in the Mosaic law. The law requires two yearling lambs with the corresponding meat-offering (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/28-9.htm">Numbers 28:9</a>); Ezekiel, six lambs and one ram, and in addition to these a meat-offering for the ram according to the proportion already laid down in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-24.htm">Ezekiel 45:24</a> for the festal sacrifices; and for the lambs, &#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1514; &#1497;&#1491;&#1493;, a gift, a present of his hand, - that is to say, not a handful of meal, but, according to the formula used in alternation with it in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-7.htm">Ezekiel 46:7</a>, as much as his hand can afford. For &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; , see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/14-30.htm">Leviticus 14:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-26.htm">Leviticus 25:26</a>. - It is different with the sacrifices of the new moon in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-6.htm">Ezekiel 46:6</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-7.htm">Ezekiel 46:7</a>. The law of Moses prescribed two bullocks, one ram, and seven lambs, with the corresponding meat-offering, and a he-goat for a sin-offering (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/28-11.htm">Numbers 28:11-15</a>); the thorah of Ezekiel, on the contrary, omits the sin-offering, and reduces the burnt-offering to one bullock, one ram, and six lambs, together with a meat-offering, according to the proportion already mentioned, which is peculiar to his law.
