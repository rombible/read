Nebuchadnezzar is the head; or, in other words, he is the first of the four kingdoms which are denoted by the image. His kingdom was the largest that the world had till then known; in fact, a writer cited by Josephus (<span class= "ital">Ap.</span> i. 20), compares him to Hercules. We find a similar allusion to the beasts of the field as Nebuchadnezzar’s servants <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-6.htm" title="And now have I given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant; and the beasts of the field have I given him also to serve him.">Jeremiah 27:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/28-14.htm" title="For thus said the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; I have put a yoke of iron on the neck of all these nations, that they may serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and they shall serve him: and I have given him the beasts of the field also.">Jeremiah 28:14</a>. The title of “king of kings” is also ascribed to Nebuchadnezzar by Ezekiel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/26-7.htm" title="For thus said the Lord GOD; Behold, I will bring on Tyrus Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, a king of kings, from the north, with horses, and with chariots, and with horsemen, and companies, and much people.">Ezekiel 26:7</a>). We are therefore left in no doubt as to what is meant by the first of the four empires. It is the Babylonian Empire, of which Nebuchadnezzar was in every sense the head, being the actual founder of it, and its mainstay during his long reign of forty-three years.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:31-45 This image represented the kingdoms of the earth, that should successively rule the nations, and influence the affairs of the Jewish church. 1. The head of gold signified the Chaldean empire, then in being. 2. The breast and arms of silver signified the empire of the Medes and Persians. 3. The belly and thighs of brass signified the Grecian empire, founded by Alexander. 4. The legs and feet of iron signified the Roman empire. The Roman empire branched into ten kingdoms, as the toes of these feet. Some were weak as clay, others strong as iron. Endeavours have often been used to unite them, for strengthening the empire, but in vain. The stone cut out without hands, represented the kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ, which should be set up in the kingdoms of the world, upon the ruins of Satan's kingdom in them. This was the Stone which the builders refused, because it was not cut out by their hands, but it is become the head stone of the corner. Of the increase of Christ's government and peace there shall be no end. The Lord shall reign, not only to the end of time, but when time and days shall be no more. As far as events have gone, the fulfilling this prophetic vision has been most exact and undeniable; future ages shall witness this Stone destroying the image, and filling the whole earth.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/daniel/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thou, O King, art a king of kings - The phrase "king of kings" is a Hebraism, to denote a supreme monarch, or one who has other kings under him as tributary, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/7-12.htm">Ezra 7:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/26-7.htm">Ezekiel 26:7</a>. As such it is applied by way of eminence to the Son of God, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-14.htm">Revelation 17:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-16.htm">Revelation 19:16</a>. As here used, it means that Nebuchadnezzar ruled over tributary kings and princes, or that he was the most eminent of the kings of the earth. The scepter which he swayed was, in fact, extended over many nations that were once independent kingdoms, and the title here conferred on him was not one that was designed to flatter the monarch, but was a simple statement of what was an undoubted truth. Daniel would not withhold any title that was in accordance with reality, as he did not withhold any communication in accordance with reality that was adapted to humble the monarch.<p>For the God of heaven hath given thee a kingdom ... - At the same time that Daniel gave him a title which might in itself have ministered to the pride of the monarch, he is careful to remind him that he held this title in virtue of no wisdom or power of his own. It was the true God who had conferred on him the sovereignty of these extensive realms, and it was one of the designs of this vision to show him that he held his power at his will, and that at his pleasure he could cause it to pass away. It was the forgetfulness of this, and the pride resulting from that forgetfulness, which led to the melancholy calamity which befel this haughty monarch, as recorded in <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/4.htm">Daniel 4</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/daniel/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>37. Thou &#8230; art a king of kings&#8212;The committal of power in fullest plenitude belongs to Nebuchadnezzar personally, as having made Babylon the mighty empire it was. In twenty-three years after him the empire was ended: with him its greatness is identified (Da 4:30), his successors having done nothing notable. Not that he actually ruled every part of the globe, but that God granted him illimitable dominion in whatever direction his ambition led him, Egypt, Nineveh, Arabia, Syria, Tyre, and its Phœnician colonies (Jer 27:5-8). Compare as to Cyrus, Ezr 1:2.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/daniel/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">A king of kings</span>; he means Nebuchadnezzar in person, together with his successors, Evil-merodach and Belshazzar. The prophet would not mind the king of any thing past, nor of any other governments but those with whom his church were then and to be concerned for the future, till the coming of the Messiah, by whose coming they should support and comfort themselves against all their sufferings by oppressors; and also God would have the prophet mind Nebuchadnezzar of the stone cut out of the mountain without hands, growing and breaking in pieces all earthly power. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The God of heaven hath given thee a kingdom; </span> it came not to thee by thy ancestors, or by fortune, or by thy valour, but the great God of heaven hath the bestowing of those, and giveth them to whomsoever he will. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Power, and strength, and glory; </span> authority; victorious armies, with great prosperity. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/daniel/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Thou, O king, art a king of kings,....

There appears here to be two cases of doublet; <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> are probably originally alternative renderings of <span class="accented">malcutha</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;</span> double renderings of <span class="accented">yiqara.</span> On this hypothesis there is only one Greek word for two Aramaic. We shall consider this later. Paulus Tellensis, in his translation of the Septuagint Version, draws the beginning of the next verse into connection with the final words of this verse as given here. The words, "in the whole earth," is a transference from the next verse. The rendering of Theodotion is, "Thou, O king, art a king of kings, to whom the God of heaven gave a strong and mighty and honourable kingdom," making thus <span class="accented">hisna</span>, <span class="accented">toqpa</span>, and <span class="accented">yiqara</span> adjectives of <span class="accented">malcut a.</span> But <span class="accented">malcutha</span> is feminine, and, if adjectives. <span class="accented">hisna</span>, etc., are masculine. The Peshitta differs from the Massoretic in leaving out one of the terms, "Thou, O king, art a king of kings; God most high (<span class="accented">merima</span>) a strong kingdom and glory has given to thee." Of course, the same objection holds to some extent against this version as against that of Theodotion, but it is to be noted that there are not two words conveying the same idea of strength. As there was only one in the Septuagint, we are inclined to think that <span class="accented">toqpi</span> must have been an addition. Jerome's rendering is, "Thou art a king of kings, and the God of heaven has given to thee the kingdom, and might, and dominion, and glory." There seems to be a transposition here. The general scope of this verse and the next is given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-5.htm">Jeremiah 27:5, 6</a>. There is certainly high honour given to Nebuchadnezzar in this address, but, at the same time, he is warned that all his glory is bestowed upon him by the God of heaven. It is possible that Nebuchadnezzar interpreted the words as referring to Merodach, the god whom he specially worshipped, or regarded the God of heaven as only another of the gods many and lords many which, as a polytheist, he acknowledged. The title of the Babylonian king was <span class="accented">shar-sharani</span>," king of kings," and  <span class="accented">sharru-rabbu</span>, "great king." Thus in this address the technical title is given him. The Babylonian monarchs assumed this from their Assyrian predecessors, as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> Asshurbanipal (Smith, 'History,' pp. 26, 73, 196). From the Babylonians it was passed on to the Persian monarchs. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/26-7.htm">Ezekiel 26:7</a> the prophet gives Nebuchadnezzar this title. As we find by the succeeding verse, the kingdom here is not mere royalty or kingship, but the special royalty of practically universal empire; that is to say, universal so far as the knowledge of the times went. Our rendering in the Authorized Version fails in accuracy, in not inserting the definite article, which is really implied in the sign of the <span class="accented">status emphaticus.</span> Luther makes the same mistake. Happily the Revisers have altered matters, and inserted "the," as does Behrmann. The Greek Version and Peshitta are accurate in this. The word translated "power," <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b4;&#x5e1;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> (<span class="accented">his'na</span>), <span class="accented">is</span> consonantly present in both dialects of more recent Aramaic. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/46.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Sacrificial Kitchens for the Priests and for the People<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-19.htm">Ezekiel 46:19</a>. And he brought me up the entrance by the shoulder of the gate to the holy cells for the priests, which looked to the north; and behold there was a place on the outermost side toward the west. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-20.htm">Ezekiel 46:20</a>. And he said to me, This is the place where the priests boil the trespass-offering and the sin-offering, where they bake the meat-offering that they may not need to carry it out into the outer court, to sanctify the people. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-21.htm">Ezekiel 46:21</a>. And he led me out into the outer court, and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court; and behold, in every corner of the court there was again a court. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-22.htm">Ezekiel 46:22</a>. In the four corners of the court were closed courts of forty cubits in length and thirty cubits in breadth; all four corner spaces had one measure. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-23.htm">Ezekiel 46:23</a>. And a row of stands was round about therein in all four, and boiling hearths were under the  rows made round about. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-24.htm">Ezekiel 46:24</a>. And he said to me, These are the kitchen-house, where the servants of the house boil the slain-offering of the people. - In the list and description of the subordinate buildings of the temple, the sacrificial kitchens are passed over; and they are therefore referred to here again in a supplementary manner. Ewald has shifted <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-19.htm">Ezekiel 46:19-24</a>, and placed them after <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-14.htm">Ezekiel 42:14</a>, which would certainly have been the most suitable place for mentioning the sacrificial kitchens for the priests. But it is evident that they stood here originally, and not there; not only from the fact that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-19.htm">Ezekiel 46:19</a> the passage to the holy cells (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-1.htm">Ezekiel 42:1</a>.) is circumstantially described, which would have been unnecessary if the description of the kitchens had originally followed immediately after <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-14.htm">Ezekiel 42:14</a>, as Ezekiel was then standing by the cells; but also, and still more clearly, from the words that serve as an introduction to what follows, "he led me back to the door of the house" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-1.htm">Ezekiel 47:1</a>), which are unintelligible unless he had changed his standing-place between <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-18.htm">Ezekiel 46:18</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-1.htm">Ezekiel 47:1</a>, as is related in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-19.htm">Ezekiel 46:19</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-21.htm">Ezekiel 46:21</a>, since Ezekiel had received the sacrificial thorah (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-5.htm">Ezekiel 44:5-46:18</a>) in front of the house (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-4.htm">Ezekiel 44:4</a>). If <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-19.htm">Ezekiel 46:19-24</a> had originally stood elsewhere, so that <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-1.htm">Ezekiel 47:1</a> was immediately connected with <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-18.htm">Ezekiel 46:18</a>, the transition-formula in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-1.htm">Ezekiel 47:1</a> would necessarily have read very differently. - But with this section the right of the preceding one, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-16.htm">Ezekiel 46:16-18</a>, which Ewald has arbitrarily interpolated in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45.htm">Ezekiel 45</a> between <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-8.htm">Ezekiel 45:8</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-9.htm">Ezekiel 45:9</a>, to hold its present place in the chapter before us as an appendix, is fully vindicated. - The holy cells (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-19.htm">Ezekiel 46:19</a>) are those of the northern cell-building (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-1.htm">Ezekiel 42:1-10</a>) described in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-1.htm">Ezekiel 42:1-14</a> (see Plate I L). &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488; is the approach or way mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-9.htm">Ezekiel 42:9</a>, which led from the northern inner gate to these cells (see Plate I l); not the place to which Ezekiel was brought (Kliefoth), but the passage along which he was led. The spot to which he was conducted follows in &#1488;&#1500;  (the article before the construct state, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-21.htm">Ezekiel 43:21</a>, etc.). &#1488;&#1500; &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; is appended to this in the form of an apposition; and here &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1493;&#1514; is to be repeated in thought: to those for the priests. '&#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; &#1510; belongs to &#1492;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1493;&#1514;. There, i.e., by the cells, was a space set apart at the outermost (hindermost) sides toward the west (Plate I M), for the boiling of the flesh of the trespass-offering and sin-offering, and the baking of the minchah, - that is to say, of those portions of the sacrifices which the priests were to eat in their official capacity (see the comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-13.htm">Ezekiel 42:13</a>). For the motive assigned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-20.htm">Ezekiel 46:20</a> for the provision of special kitchens for this object, see the exposition of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-19.htm">Ezekiel 44:19</a>.<p>In addition to these, kitchens were required for the preparation of the sacrificial meals, which were connected with the offering of the shelamim, and were held by those who presented them. These sacrificial kitchens for the people are treated of in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-20.htm">Ezekiel 46:20-24</a>. They were situated in the four corners of the outer court (Plate I N). To show them to the prophet, the angel leads him into the outer court. The holy cells (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-19.htm">Ezekiel 46:19</a>) and the sacrificial kitchens for the priests (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-20.htm">Ezekiel 46:20</a>) were also situated by the outside wall of the inner court; and for this reason Ezekiel had already been led out of the inner court, where he had received the sacrificial thorah, through the northern gate of the court by the way which led to the holy cells, that he might be shown the sacrificial kitchens. When, therefore, it is stated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-21.htm">Ezekiel 46:21</a> that "he led me out into the outer court," &#1497;&#1493;&#1510;&#1497;&#1488;&#1504;&#1497; can only be explained on the supposition that the space from the surrounding wall of the inner court to the way which led from the gate porch of that court to the holy cells, and to the passage which continued this way in front of the cells (Plate I l and m), was regarded as an appurtenance of the inner court. In every one of the four corners of the outer court there was a (small) courtyard in the court. The repetition of '&#1495;&#1510;&#1512; &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1511;&#1510;&#1506; &#1492;&#1495; has a distributive force. The small courtyards in the four corners of the court were &#1511;&#1496;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;, i.e., not "uncovered," as this would be unmeaning, since all courts or courtyards were uncovered; nor "contracted" (Bttcher), for &#1511;&#1496;&#1512; has no such meaning; nor "fumum exhalantia," as the Talmudists suppose; nor "bridged over" (Hitzig), which there is also nothing in the language to sustain; but in all probability atria clausa, i.e., muris cincta et janius clausa (Ges. Thes.), from &#1511;&#1496;&#1512;; in Aram. ligavit; in Ethiop. clausit, obseravit januam. The word &#1502;&#1492;&#1511;&#1510;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514; is marked with puncta extraordinaria by the Masoretes as a suspicious word, and is also omitted in the Septuagint and Vulgate. Bttcher and Hitzig have therefore expunged it as a gloss. But even Hitzig admits that this does not explain how it found its way into the text. The word is a Hophal participle of &#1511;&#1510;&#1506;, in the sense of cornered off, cut off into corners, and is in apposition to the suffix to &#1500;&#1488;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501;, - literally, one measure wax to all four, the spaces or courtyards cut off in the corners. For this appositional use of the participle, compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-6.htm">1 Kings 14:6</a>. There is also a difference of opinion as to the meaning of the word &#1496;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, which only occurs here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-17.htm">Exodus 28:17</a>. and <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/39-10.htm">Ezekiel 39:10</a>, where it signifies "row," and not "enclosure" (Kliefoth). &#1496;&#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;, which follows, is evidently merely the feminine plural, from &#1496;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, as &#1496;&#1497;&#1512;&#1492; is also derived from &#1496;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, in the sense of "to encircle" (see the comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-26.htm">Psalm 69:26</a>). Consequently &#1496;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; does not mean a covering or boundary wall, but a row or shelf of brickwork which had several separate shelves, under which the cooking hearths were placed. &#1502;&#1489;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514;, not kitchens, but cooking hearths; strictly speaking a partic. Piel, things which cause to boil. -  &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1489;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;  - .liob ot e, kitchen house. &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;, the temple servants, as distinguished from the servants of Jehovah (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-15.htm">Ezekiel 44:15-16</a>), are the Levites (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-11.htm">Ezekiel 44:11-12</a>). &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1468;&#1497; is construed as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-17.htm">Ezekiel 40:17</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-18.htm">Ezekiel 41:18-19</a>. </body></html>
