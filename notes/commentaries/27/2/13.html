We know not the uneasiness of many who live in great pomp, and, as others vainly think, in pleasure also. The king said that his learned men must tell him the dream itself, or they should all be put to death as deceivers. Men are more eager to ask as to future events, than to learn the way of salvation or the path of duty; yet foreknowledge of future events increases anxiety and trouble. Those who deceived, by pretending to do what they could not do, were sentenced to death, for not being able to do what they did not pretend to.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/daniel/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And the decree went forth that the wise men should be slain - The original here will bear a somewhat different translation, meaning, "the decree went forth, "and" the wise men were slain;" that is, the execution of the sentence was actually commenced. So the Vulgate: Et egressa sententia, sapientes interficiebantur. So also the Greek version: &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#788; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;  kai hoi sophoi apektennonto - "and the wise men were slain." This seems to me to be the more probable interpretation, and better to suit the connection. Then it would mean that they had actually begun to execute the decree, and that in the prosecution of their bloody work they sought out Daniel and his companions, and that by his influence with Arioch the execution of the sentence was arrested.<p>And they sought Daniel and his fellows to be slain - His three companions <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/1-6.htm">Daniel 1:6</a>, who probably had not been among those who were summoned to court to explain the matter. Had they been consulted at first, the issuing of the decree would have been prevented, but it seems to have been the design of Providence to give the fairest trial of the ability of these sages, and to allow matters to come to a crisis, in order to show that what was done was wholly beyond human power. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/daniel/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12, 13. Daniel and his companions do not seem to have been actually numbered among the Magi or Chaldeans, and so were not summoned before the king. Providence ordered it so that all mere human wisdom should be shown vain before His divine power, through His servant, was put forth.

Further, the use of the participle for the preterite is not by any means uncommon in Daniel, certainly mainly in the principal clause, as in ver. 5 of the present chapter. Noldeke, in his 'Syriac Grammar,' 278<span class="accented">a</span>, gives examples of the passive participle being used as here in the subordinate clause. The Septuagint is very condensed, but possibly drawn from a similar text, only such extreme condensation is unlike the translator elsewhere. It is possible that some part of the <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e7;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span>. (<span class="accented">peqad</span>), "to decree," was used, perhaps the participle hithpael. It is possible that the verb <span class="accented">qetal</span> was in the infinitive. Theodotion renders, "And the decree went forth, and the wise men were slain." This, though a possible translation, does not fit what we find represented to be the circumstances, as ver. 24 seems to assume that the wise men were not yet destroyed. On the other hand, it would be hardly possible to imagine the king allowing these wise men who had refused to answer his question, to go out of his presence in safety and unbound. It would seem more natural to imagine that they were carried off to prison, and that all the soothsaying class were intended to be gathered together in prison, in order that the vengeance of the king might be more appallingly manifest. The sentence looks at first sight to us as too savage to be true, but just as savage proofs of vengeance were given by Asshurbanipal. <span class="cmt_word">And they sought Daniel and his fellows to be slain</span>. The Septuagint translation of this clause is somewhat paraphrastic, "And Daniel was sought for and all those with him in order to be put to death." The want of an antecedent to fix the nominative of the verb probably led to the sentence assuming its present mould; but "all" seems to have no word to occasion it. Theodotion follows the Massoretic text closely; so also does the Peshitta. It is clear from this that Daniel and his companions had not been summoned into the royal presence when the question concerning the dream was put to the wise men. This would seem to contradict the statement of <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/1-19.htm">Daniel 1:19</a>, "Therefore stood they"  - to wit these Hebrew youths <span class="accented">-</span> "before the king." Their position was probably like those who had passed the examination for the Indian Civil Service - they are accepted, but they have still a season of study, and then, after they go out to India, they occupy only subordinate situations at first. While permited to enter the ranks of the soothsayers and astrologers to the court, they were placed at first only in the lower grades, and would have to rise by degrees, and in ordinary circumstances a long time would elapse before they would be summoned into the immediate presence of the sovereign. On the reading of the LXX., Daniel and his friends would not, because they were Jews, and not Chaldeans. One has only to turn to the Talumdic tales to see how unlike this reasonable position is to the ordinary Jewish fictitious narrative. The Book of Daniel is not nearly prodigal enough in wonders to be a representative of the Jewish Midrash. It is further clear that the decree of the king went beyond those who had actually been in his council-chamber on that merest-able day. The idea of the king probably was that the treason which he had found in the heads of the various classes of Chaldean soothsayers would have permeated all the members. Babylonian and foreign, as well; therefore he orders them all to suffer a common fate. Wieseler's hypothesis, that this event took place close to the end of the three years of study which had been assigned to these youths, would suit the  statement of events which we find here; although it is not necessary, yet on this assumption, the succession of events as narrated in this chapter becomes perfectly natural. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/45.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Sacrifices at the Passover and Feast of Tabernacles<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-21.htm">Ezekiel 45:21</a>.

In the seventh (month), on the fifteenth day of the month, at the feast he shall do the same for seven days with regard to the sin-offering, as also the burnt-offering, and the meat-offering, as also the oil. - In the words, "shall the Passover be to you," there lies the thought that the Passover is to be celebrated in the manner appointed in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12.htm">Exodus 12</a>, with the paschal meal in the evening of the 14th Abib. - There is considerable difficulty connected with the following words, &#1495;&#1490; &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514; &#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, which all the older translators have rendered "a feast of seven days." &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514; ".syad neves fo signifies periods of seven days or weeks. A feast of heptads of days, or weeks of days, cannot possibly mean a feast which lasted only seven days, or a week. &#1495;&#1490; &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514; is used elsewhere for the feast of weeks (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-22.htm">Exodus 34:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-10.htm">Deuteronomy 16:10</a>), because they were to reckon seven weeks from the second day of the Passover, the day of the sheaf of first-fruits, and then to keep the feast of the loaves of first-fruits, or the feast of harvest (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-9.htm">Deuteronomy 16:9</a>). Kliefoth retains this well-established meaning of the words in this passage also, and give the following explanation: If the words &#1495;&#1490;  stood alone without &#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, it would mean that in future the Passover was to be kept like the feast of seven weeks, as the feast of the loaves of first-fruits. But the addition of &#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, which is to be taken in the same sense as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/10-2.htm">Daniel 10:2-3</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/29-14.htm">Genesis 29:14</a>, etc., gives this turn to the thought, that in future the Passover is to be kept as a feast of seven weeks long, "a feast lasting seven weeks." According to this explanation, the meaning of the regulation is, "that in future not only the seven days of sweet loaves, but the whole of the seven weeks intervening between the feast of the wave-sheaf and the feast of the wave-loaves, was to be kept as a Passover, that the whole of the quinquagesima should be one Easter &#1495;&#1490;, and the feast of weeks be one with the Passover." To this there is appended the further regulation, that unleavened bread is to be eaten, not merely for the seven days therefore, but for the whole of the seven weeks, till the feast of the loaves of first-fruits. This explanation is a very sagacious one, and answers to the Christian view of the Easter-tide. But it is open to objections which render it untenable. In the first place, that &#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, when used in the sense of lasting for days, is not usually connected with the preceding noun in the construct state, but is attached as an adverbial accusative; compare &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;  in <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/10-2.htm">Daniel 10:2-3</a>, and &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501; &#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-1.htm">Genesis 41:1</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/28-3.htm">Jeremiah 28:3</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/28-11.htm">Jeremiah 28:11</a>, etc. But a still more important objection is the circumstance that the words &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1506;&#1514; &#1497;&#1502;&#1497; &#1492;&#1495;&#1490; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-23.htm">Ezekiel 45:23</a> unquestionably point back to &#1495;&#1490; &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514; &#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, as there is no other way in which the article in &#1492;&#1495;&#1490; ni elcitra eht h can be explained, just as &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1501; &#1492;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-22.htm">Ezekiel 45:22</a> points back to the fourteenth day mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-21.htm">Ezekiel 45:21</a> as the time of the pesach feast. It follows from this, however, that &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514; &#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; can only signify a seven days' feast. It is true that the plural &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514; appears irreconcilable with this; for Kimchi's opinion, that &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514; is a singular, written with Cholem instead of Patach, is purely a result of perplexity, and the explanation given by Gussetius, that Ezekiel speaks in the plural of weeks, because the reference is "to the institution of the Passover as an annual festival to be celebrated many times in the series of times and ages," is no better. The plural &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514; must rather be taken as a plural of genus, as in &#1506;&#1512;&#1497;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/13-12.htm">Genesis 13:12</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/12-7.htm">Judges 12:7</a>; &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1503;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-29.htm">Genesis 19:29</a>; or &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/21-7.htm">Genesis 21:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-3.htm">Isaiah 37:3</a>; so that Ezekiel speaks indefinitely of heptads of days, because he assumes that the fact is well known that the feast only lasted one heptad of days, as he expressly states in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-23.htm">Ezekiel 45:23</a>. If this explanation of the plural does not commend itself, we must take &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514; as a copyist's error for &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1506;&#1514;, feast of a heptad of days, i.e., a feast lasting a full week, and attribute the origin of this copyist's error to the fact that &#1495;&#1490; &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1506;&#1514; naturally suggested the thought of &#1495;&#1490; &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514;, feast of weeks, or Pentecost, not merely because the feast of Pentecost is always mentioned in the Pentateuch along with the feasts of Passover and tabernacles, but also because the only singular form of &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514; that we meet with elsewhere is &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-27.htm">Daniel 9:27</a>), or in the construct state &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1506; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/29-27.htm">Genesis 29:27</a>), not &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1506;&#1492; and &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1506;&#1514;.<p>The word &#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1505;&#1495; is used here as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-1.htm">Deuteronomy 16:1-2</a>, so that it includes the seven days' feast of unleavened bread. The Niphal &#1497;&#1488;&#1499;&#1500; is construed with the accusative in the olden style: mazzoth shall men eat. - In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-22.htm">Ezekiel 45:22</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-23.htm">Ezekiel 45:23</a> there follow the regulations concerning the sacrifices of this festival, and first of all concerning the sin-offering to be presented on the fourteenth day, on the evening of which the paschal lamb was slaughtered and the paschal meal was held (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-22.htm">Ezekiel 45:22</a>). The Mosaic legislation makes no allusion to this, but simply speaks of festal sacrifices for the seven days of mazzoth, the 15th to the 21st Abib (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-5.htm">Leviticus 23:5-8</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/28-16.htm">Numbers 28:16-25</a>), with regard to which fresh regulations are also given here. The Mosaic law prescribes for each of these seven days as burnt-offerings two bullocks, a ram, and seven yearling lambs, as a meat-offering; three-tenths of an ephah of meal mixed with oil for each bullock, two-tenths for the ram, and one-tenth for each lamb, and a he-goat for the sin-offering (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/28-19.htm">Numbers 28:19-22</a>). The new law for the feasts, on the other hand, also requires, it is true, only one he-goat daily for a sin-offering on the seven feast days, but for the daily burnt-offerings seven bullocks and seven rams reach; and for the meat-offering, an ephah of meal and a hin of oil for every bullock, and for every ram. In the new thorah, therefore, the burnt-offerings and meat-offerings are much richer and more copious, and the latter in far greater measure than the former. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-25.htm">Ezekiel 45:25</a>. The same number of sacrifices is to be offered throughout the feast of seven days falling upon the fifteenth day of the seventh month. This feast is the feast of tabernacles, but the name is not mentioned, doubtless because the practice of living in tabernacles (booths) would be dropped in the time to come. And even with regard to the sacrifices of this feast, the new thorah differs greatly from the old. According to the Mosaic law, there were to be offered, in addition to the daily sin-offering of a he-goat, seventy bullocks in all as burnt-offerings for the seven days; and these were to be so distributed that on the first day thirteen were to be offered, and the number was to be reduced by one on each of the following days, so that there would be only seven bullocks upon the seventh day; moreover, every day two rams and fourteen yearling lambs were to be offered, together with the requisite quantity of meal and oil for a meat-offering according to the number of the animals (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/29-12.htm">Numbers 29:12-34</a>). According to Ezekiel, on the other hand, the quantity of provision made for the sacrifices remained the same as that appointed for the feast of Passover; so that the whole cost of the burnt-offerings and meat-offerings did not reach the amount required by the Mosaic law. In addition to all this, there was an eighth day observed as a closing festival in the Mosaic feast of tabernacles, with special sacrifices; and this also is wanting in Ezekiel. - But the following is still more important than the points of difference just mentioned: Ezekiel only mentions the two yearly feats of seven days in the first and seventh months, and omits not only the Pentecost, or feast of weeks, but also the day of trumpets, on the first of the seventh month, and the day of atonement on the tenth; from which we must infer that the Israeli of the future would keep only the two first named of all the yearly feasts. The correctness of this conclusion is placed beyond the reach of doubt by the fact that he practically transfers the feasts of the day of trumpets and of the day of atonement, which were preparatory to the feast of tabernacles, to the first month, by the appointment of special sin-offerings for the first and seventh days of that month (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-18.htm">Ezekiel 45:18-20</a>), and of a sin-offering on the day of the paschal meal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-22.htm">Ezekiel 45:22</a>). This essentially transforms the idea which lies at the foundation of the cycle of Mosaic feasts, as we intend subsequently to show, when discussing the meaning and significance of the whole picture of the new kingdom of God, as shown in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40.htm">Ezekiel 40-48</a>. </body></html>
