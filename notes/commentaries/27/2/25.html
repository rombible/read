The insufficiency of creatures should drive us to the all-sufficiency of the Creator. There is One who can do that for us, and make known that to us, which none on earth can, particularly the work of redemption, and the secret designs of God's love to us therein. Daniel confirmed the king in his opinion, that the dream was of great consequence, relating to the affairs and changes of this lower world. Let those whom God has highly favoured and honoured, lay aside all opinion of their own wisdom and worthiness, that the Lord alone may be praised for the good they have and do.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/daniel/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste - The Chaldee word used here implies "in tumultuous haste," as of one who was violently excited, or in a state of trepidation, from       &#1489;&#1492;&#1500;  ba&#770;hal - "to tremble, to be in trepidation." The trepidation in this case may have arisen from one or both of two causes:<p>(1) exultation, or joy, that the great secret was discovered; or<p>(2) joy that the effusion of blood might be stayed, and that there might be now no necessity to continue the execution of the sentence against the wise men.<p>I have found a man - Margin, as in Chaldee, "That I have found a man It is not to be supposed that Arioch had known anything of the application which Daniel had made to the king to delay the execution of the sentence <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/2-16.htm">Daniel 2:16</a>, and, for anything that appears, he had suspended that execution on his own responsibility. Ignorant as he was, therefore, of any such arrangement, and viewing only his own agency in the matter, it was natural for him to go in and announce this as something entirely new to the king, and without suggesting that the execution of the sentence had been at all delayed. It was a most remarkable circumstance, and one which looks like a Divine interposition, that he should have been disposed to delay the execution of the sentence at all, so that Daniel could have an opportunity of showing whether he could not divulge the secret. All the circumstances of the case seem to imply that Arioch was not a man of a cruel disposition, but was disposed, as far as possible, to prevent the effusion of blood.<p>Of the captives of Judah - Margin, as in Chaldee, "of the children of the captivity." The word "Judah" here probably refers to the "country" rather than to the "people," and means that he was among those who had been brought from the land of Judah.<p>That will make known unto the king the interpretation - It is clear, from the whole narrative, that Arioch had great confidence in Daniel. All the "evidence" which he could halve that he would be able to make this known, must have been from the fact that Daniel "professed" to be able to do it; but such was his confidence in him that he had no doubt that he would be able to do it. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/daniel/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>25. I have found a man&#8212;Like all courtiers, in announcing agreeable tidings, he ascribes the merit of the discovery to himself [Jerome]. So far from it being a discrepancy, that he says nothing of the previous understanding between him and Daniel, or of Daniel's application to the king (Da 2:15, 16), it is just what we should expect. Arioch would not dare to tell an absolute despot that he had stayed the execution of his sanguinary decree, on his own responsibility; but would, in the first instance, secretly stay it until Daniel had got, by application from the king, the time required, without Arioch seeming to know of Daniel's application as the cause of the respite; then, when Daniel had received the revelation, Arioch would in trembling haste bring him in, as if then for the first time he had "found" him. The very difficulty when cleared up is a proof of genuineness, as it never would be introduced by a forger.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/daniel/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> How comes Arioch to boast of what he had found; as if he got him by great search, or by great chance, and as if Daniel had been some obscure, unknown person, when Daniel had asked time of the king just before? It is the manner of courtiers to be very officious, and to commend their own little deeds, that thereby they may signify something with their prince, and make themselves necessary to him, possibly Arioch might not know that Daniel had been with the king, and therefore comes with this Eurhka, I have found your man, here he is, behold him, he will give the king full satisfaction in all concerning the dream. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/daniel/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste,.... As knowing how impatient the king was to have his dream, and the interpretation of it, told him; and how pleasing this would be to him, and be a means of ingratiating and establishing him in his affections, as well as for the sake of saving the lives of the wise men: <p>and said thus unto him, I have found a man of the captives of Judah: as if he had made it his business to inquire after a man capable of answering the king's demands; whereas he sought after Daniel at first, not for this purpose, but to destroy him; and now Daniel made his application to him for introduction to the king, and was not looked after by Arioch; but he here did as courtiers do, make the most of everything to their own advantage, to insinuate themselves into the favour of princes: it looks by this as if Arioch did not know of Daniel's having been with the king before, and of the promise he had made him; that granting him time, he would satisfy him in the matter requested, which he was now ready to do, as he had told Arioch; and therefore he adds, <p>that will make known unto the king the interpretation; that is, of his dream. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/daniel/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said thus unto him, I have found a man of the captives of Judah, that will make known unto the king the interpretation.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/daniel/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">25</span>. <span class="ital">captives</span>] lit. <span class="ital">children of the captivity</span> (or, better[209], <span class="ital">of the</span> <span class="bld">exile</span>), as A.V. itself renders in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/5-13.htm" title="Then was Daniel brought in before the king.

And when the prince cometh, he shall go in by the way to the porch of the gate, and by its way shall he go out. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-9.htm">Ezekiel 46:9</a>. And when the people of the land come before Jehovah on the feast days, he who enters through the north gate to worship shall go out through the south gate; and he who enters through the south gate shall go out through the north gate: they shall not return through the gate through which they entered, but go out straight forward. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-10.htm">Ezekiel 46:10</a>. And the prince shall enter in the midst of them, when they enter; and when they go out, they shall go out (together). <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-11.htm">Ezekiel 46:11</a>. And at the feast days and holy days the meat-offering shall be an ephah for the bullock, an ephah for the ram, and for the lambs what his hand may give, and of oil a hin for the ephah. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-12.htm">Ezekiel 46:12</a>. And when the prince prepares a voluntary burnt-offering or voluntary peace-offerings to Jehovah, they shall open the gate that looks to the east, and he shall prepare his burnt-offerings and his peace-offering as he does on the Sabbath day; and when he has gone out they shall shut the gate after his going out. - The coming of the people to worship before Jehovah has been already mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-3.htm">Ezekiel 46:3</a>, but only causally, with reference to the position which they were to take behind the prince in case any individuals should come on the Sabbaths or new moons, on which they were not bound to appear. At the high festivals, on the other hand, every one was to come (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-16.htm">Deuteronomy 16:16</a>); and for this there follow the necessary directions in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-9.htm">Ezekiel 46:9</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-10.htm">Ezekiel 46:10</a>, to prevent crowding and confusion. For the purpose of linking these directions to what comes before, the rule already laid down in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-2.htm">Ezekiel 46:2</a> concerning the entrance and exit of the prince is repeated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-8.htm">Ezekiel 46:8</a>. &#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; is supposed by the commentators to refer to the high festivals of the first and seventh months (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-21.htm">Ezekiel 45:21</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-25.htm">Ezekiel 45:25</a>); but &#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; does not apply to the same feasts as those which are called &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-11.htm">Ezekiel 46:11</a>, as we may see from the combination of &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; and &#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501;. &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; is the term applied to the greater annual feasts, as distinguished from the Sabbaths, new moons, and the day of atonement. The &#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501;, on the contrary, are all the times and days sanctified to the Lord, including even the Sabbath (see the comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-2.htm">Leviticus 23:2</a>). It is in this sense that &#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; is used here in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-9.htm">Ezekiel 46:9</a>, and not &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, because what is laid down concerning the entrance and exit of the people, when visiting the temple, is not merely intended to apply to the high festivals, on which the people were bound to appear before Jehovah, but also to such feast days as the Sabbaths and new moons, whenever individuals from among the people were desirous of their own free-will to worship before the Lord. The latter cases were not to be excluded, although, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-10.htm">Ezekiel 46:10</a> clearly shows, the great feasts were principally kept in mind. For the entrance and exit of the prince in the midst of the people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-10.htm">Ezekiel 46:10</a>) apply to the great yearly feasts alone. The Chetib yeetsee'uw &#1497;&#1510;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-9.htm">Ezekiel 46:9</a> is to be preferred to the easier Keri &#1497;&#1510;&#1488;, and is not merely the more difficult reading, but the more correct reading also, as two kinds of people are mentioned, - those who entered by the north gate and those who entered by the south. Both are to go out walking straight forward; and neither of them is to turn in the court for the purpose of going out by the gate through which he entered. Even in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-10.htm">Ezekiel 46:10</a> &#1497;&#1510;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; is not to be altered, as Hitzig supposes, but to be taken as referring to the prince and the people. - In <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-11.htm">Ezekiel 46:11</a>, the instructions given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-24.htm">Ezekiel 45:24</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-5.htm">Ezekiel 46:5</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-7.htm">Ezekiel 46:7</a>, concerning the quantities composing the meat-offering for the different feasts, are repeated here as rules applicable to all festal times. &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; has been correctly explained as follows: "at the feasts, and generally at all regular (more correctly, established) seasons," cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-17.htm">Ezekiel 45:17</a>. Only the daily sacrifices are excepted from this rule, other regulations being laid down for them in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-14.htm">Ezekiel 46:14</a>. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-12.htm">Ezekiel 46:12</a>. The freewill-offerings could be presented on any week-day. And the rules laid down in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-1.htm">Ezekiel 46:1</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-2.htm">Ezekiel 46:2</a> for the Sabbath-offerings of the prince are extended to cases of this kind, with one modification, namely, that the east gate, which had been opened for the occasion, should be closed again as soon as the sacrificial ceremony was over, and not left open till the evening, as on the Sabbath and new moon. &#1504;&#1491;&#1489;&#1492; is a substantive: the freewill-offering, which could be either a burnt-offering or a peace-offering. </body></html>
