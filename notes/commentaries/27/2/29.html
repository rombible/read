The insufficiency of creatures should drive us to the all-sufficiency of the Creator. There is One who can do that for us, and make known that to us, which none on earth can, particularly the work of redemption, and the secret designs of God's love to us therein. Daniel confirmed the king in his opinion, that the dream was of great consequence, relating to the affairs and changes of this lower world. Let those whom God has highly favoured and honoured, lay aside all opinion of their own wisdom and worthiness, that the Lord alone may be praised for the good they have and do.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/daniel/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>As for thee, O king, thy thoughts came into thy mind upon thy bed - Margin, "up;" that is, thy thoughts ascended. The Chaldee is, "thy thoughts ascended" - &#1505;&#1500;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;  sel&#305;&#770;qu&#770;. So the Greek: "Thy thoughts ascended (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;  anebe&#772;san) upon thy couch." There is, evidently, some allusion to the thoughts "ascending," or "going up;" and perhaps the idea is, that they were employed on important subjects - an idea which we now express by saying that one's thoughts are "elevated," as contrasted with those which are "low" and "grovelling."<p>What should come to pass hereafter - It would seem most probable from this, that the thoughts of Nebuchadnezzar were occupied with this subject in his waking moments on his bed, and that the dream was grafted on this train of thought when he fell asleep. Nothing is more probable than that his thoughts might be thus occupied. The question respecting his successor; the changes which might occur; the possibility of revolutions in other kingdoms, or in the provinces of his own vast empire, all were topics on which his mind would probably be employed. As God designed, too, to fix his thoughts particularly on that general subjects the changes which were to occur in his empire - such an occasion, when his attention was greatly engrossed with the subject, would be very suitable to impart the knowledge which he did by this vision. Daniel refers to this, probably, because it would do much to confirm the monarch in the belief of his inspiration, if he referred to the train of thought which had preceded the dream; as it is not improbable that the king would remember his "waking" thoughts on the subject, though his "dream" was forgotten. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/daniel/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>29.

The king, as he lay awake at night, was meditating on the future, speculating, it may be, upon the future destinies of his kingdom, or the success of his projects for the beautification of his capital; and the dream, it seems to be implied, was the form into which, under Providence, his thoughts gradually shaped themselves. In a dream, the images and impressions, which the mind, while in a waking state, has received, are recombined into new, and often fantastic forms; in the present case, a colossal and strangely constructed statue was the form which the recombination ultimately produced.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="accented">As for thee, O king, thy thoughts came into thy mind m on thy bed, what should come to pass hereafter: and he that revealeth secrets maketh known to thee what shall come to pass</span>. This verse is of somewhat suspicious authenticity, the renderings of the different versions show such a diversity of text. The Septuagint rendering is very brief, being merely a version of the last clause, "He that revealeth secrets (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>) showed that which behoveth to be." This has the appearance as if the translators here rendered the last word as an infinitive, taking <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;</span> as not the preformatvre of the third person future, but as the sign of the infinitive. It is not necessarily so, because it may be that <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>' is regarded as included in <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b6;&#x5da;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5b5;&#x5d0;</span> (<span class="accented">lehave</span>). Theodotion is in closer agreement with the Massoretic, "O king, thy thoughts upon thy bed raised up what behoved to be after these things; and he that revealeth secrets hath made known to thee what behoveth to be." The Peshitta renders slightly differently, Thou, O king, thy thoughts arose in thy heart on account of what should be in the latter days, and he that revealeth secrets made known to thee what shall be." Even Jerome, who is usually pretty close to the Massoretic text, differs a little here. "Thou, O king, didst begin to think upon thy couch what would be after these things; and he who reveal-eth mysteries showeth thee what shall be." Paulus Tellensis has broken away from the Septuagint, supplying the clause omitted, not improbably from Theodotion, "Thou, O king, when. thou layest upon thy couch, sawest all things which behoved to happen in the last days; and he who revealeth secrets hath showed to thee what behoved to be." Altogether, with the exception of the last clause, which is evidenced by all the versions, we doubt the authenticity of this verse. However, the interpolation, if we have a case of it here, must have been of old date, as is indicated by the archaic form <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">an'tah</span>), which becomes in the Q'ri <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;</span> (<span class="accented">an't</span>). Whether an interpolation or part of the original text, the picture suggested is very natural. The young conqueror, who had already secured the whole of South-Western Asia to the river of Egypt, was occupying his thoughts in speculating what should come after him. He falls asleep, and the subject of his waking thoughts becomes the subject of his dreams. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/46.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Daily Sacrifice<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-13.htm">Ezekiel 46:13</a>. And a yearling lamb without blemish shalt thou prepare as a burnt-offering daily for Jehovah: every morning shalt thou prepare it. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-14.htm">Ezekiel 46:14</a>. And a meat-offering shalt thou add to it every morning, a sixth of an ephah, and oil a third of a hin, to moisten the wheaten flour, as a meat-offering for Jehovah: let these be everlasting statutes, perpetually enduring. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-15.htm">Ezekiel 46:15</a>. And prepare the lamb, and the meat-offering, and the oil, every morning as a perpetual burnt-offering. - The preparation of the daily sacrifice is not imposed upon the prince, in harmony with <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-17.htm">Ezekiel 45:17</a>; it is the duty of the congregation, which the priests have to superintend. Every morning a yearling lamb is to be brought as a burnt-offering. The Mosaic law required such a lamb both morning and evening (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/28-3.htm">Numbers 28:3-4</a>). The new thorah omits the evening sacrifice, but increases the meat-offering to the sixth of an ephah of meal and the third of a hin of oil, against the tenth of an ephah of meal and the fourth of a hin of oil prescribed by the Mosaic law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/28-5.htm">Numbers 28:5</a>). &#1512;&#1505;, from &#1512;&#1505;&#1505;, &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;.., to moisten (cf. &#1512;&#1505;&#1497;&#1505;&#1497;&#1501;, Sol 5:2). The plural &#1495;&#1511;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; refers to the burnt-offering and meat-offering. &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1491; is added to give greater force, and, according to the correct remark of Hitzig, appears to be intended as a substitute for &#1500;&#1491;&#1493;&#1512;&#1514;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-14.htm">Leviticus 23:14</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-21.htm">Leviticus 23:21</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-31.htm">Leviticus 23:31</a>. The repeated emphasizing of &#1489;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512; &#1489;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1511; shows that the silence as to the evening sacrifice is not a mere oversight of the matter, but that in the new order of worship the evening sacrifice is to be omitted. The Chetib &#1493;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1468; is to be retained, in opposition to the Keri &#1497;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1468;.<p>This brings to an end the new order of worship. The verses which follow in the chapter before us introduce two supplementary notices, - namely, a regulation pointing back to <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-7.htm">Ezekiel 45:7-9</a>, concerning the right of the prince to hand down or give away his landed property (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-16.htm">Ezekiel 46:16-18</a>); and a brief description of the sacrificial kitchens for priests and people (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-19.htm">Ezekiel 46:19-24</a>). </body></html>
