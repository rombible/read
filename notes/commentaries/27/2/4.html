This language is found in its greatest purity in the books of Daniel and Ezra. The following part of the chapter, from this verse, is written in Chaldee, and so on to the end of the seventh chapter: the reason of which seems to be, that what is said from hence to the end of that chapter, relates chiefly to the Chaldeans, or the inhabitants of Babylonia; whereas what follows, from the beginning of the eighth chapter, refers mostly to the Jewish people, and therefore is written in Hebrew.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:1-13 The greatest men are most open to cares and troubles of mind, which disturb their repose in the night, while the sleep of the labouring man is sweet and sound. We know not the uneasiness of many who live in great pomp, and, as others vainly think, in pleasure also. The king said that his learned men must tell him the dream itself, or they should all be put to death as deceivers. Men are more eager to ask as to future events, than to learn the way of salvation or the path of duty; yet foreknowledge of future events increases anxiety and trouble. Those who deceived, by pretending to do what they could not do, were sentenced to death, for not being able to do what they did not pretend to.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/daniel/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Then spake the Chaldeans to the king - The meaning is, either that the Chaldeans spoke in the name of the entire company of the soothsayers and magicians (see the notes, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/1-20.htm">Daniel 1:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-2.htm">Daniel 2:2</a>), because they were the most prominent among them, or the name is used to denote the collective body of soothsayers, meaning that this request was made by the entire company.<p>In Syriac - In the original - &#1488;&#1512;&#1502;&#1497;&#1514;  'a&#774;ra&#770;m&#305;&#770;yt - in "Aramean." Greek, &#x3a3;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#768;  Suristi - "in Syriac." So the Vulgate. The Syriac retains the original word. The word means Aramean, and the reference is to that language which is known as East Aramean - a general term embracing the Chaldee, the Syriac, and the languages which were spoken in Mesopotamia. See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/1-4.htm">Daniel 1:4</a>. This was the vernacular tongue of the king and of his subjects, and was that in which the Chaldeans would naturally address him. It is referred to here by the author of this book, perhaps to explain the reason why he himself makes use of this language in explaining the dream. The use of this, however, is not confined to the statement of what the magicians said, but is continued to the close of the seventh chapter. Compare the Intro. Section IV. III. The language used is what is commonly called Chaldee. It is written in the same character as the Hebrew, and differs from that as one dialect differs from another. It was, doubtless, well understood by the Jews in their captivity, and was probably spoken by them after their return to their own land.<p>O king, live for ever - This is a form of speech quite common in addressing monarchs. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-24.htm">1 Samuel 10:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-25.htm">1 Kings 1:25</a> (margin); <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/3-9.htm">Daniel 3:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/5-10.htm">Daniel 5:10</a>. The expression is prevalent still, as in the phrases, "Long live the king," "Vive l' empereur," "Vive le roi," etc. It is founded on the idea that long life is to be regarded as a blessing, and that we can in no way express our good wishes for anyone better than to wish him length of days. In this place, it was merely the usual expression of respect and homage, showing their earnest wish for the welfare of the monarch. They were willing to do anything to promote his happiness, and the continuance of his life and reign. It was especially proper for them to use this language, as they wore about to make a rather unusual request, which "might" be construed as an act of disrespect, implying that the king had not given them all the means which it was equitable for them to have in explaining the matter, by requiring them to interpret the dream when he had not told them what it was.<p>Tell thy servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation - The claim which they set up in regard to the future was evidently only that of "explaining" what were regarded as the prognostics of future events. It was not that of being able to recal what is forgotten, or even to "originate" what might be regarded preintimations of what is to happen. This was substantially the claim which was asserted by all the astrologers, augurs, and soothsayers of ancient times. Dreams, the flight of birds, the aspect of the entrails of animals slain for sacrifice, the positions of the stars, meteors, and uncommon appearances in the heavens, were supposed to be intimations made by the gods of what was to occur in future times, and the business of those who claimed the power of divining the future was merely to interpret these things. When the king, therefore, required that they should recal the dream itself to his own mind, it was a claim to something which was not involved in their profession, and which they regarded as unjust. To that power they made no pretensions. If it be asked why, as they were mere jugglers and pretenders, they did not "invent" something and state "that" as his dream, since he had forgotten what his dream actually was, we may reply,<p>(1) that there is no certain evidence that they were not sincere in what they professed themselves able to do - for we are not to suppose that all who claimed to be soothsayers and astrologers were hypocrites and intentional deceivers. It was not at that period of the world certainly determined that nothing could be ascertained respecting the future by dreams, and by the positions of the stars, etc. Dreams "were" among the methods by which the future was made known; and whether the knowledge of what is to come could be obtained from the positions of the stars, etc., was a question which was at that time unsettled Even Lord Bacon maintained that the science of astrology was not to be "rejected," but to be "reformed."<p>(2) If the astrologers had been disposed to attempt to deceive the king, there is no probability that they could have succeeded in palming an invention of their own on him as his own dream. We may not be able distinctly to recollect a dream, but we have a sufficient impression of it - of its outlines - or of some striking, though disconnected, things in it, to know what it is "not." We might instantly recognize it if stated to us; we should see at once, if anyone should attempt to deceive us by palming an invented dream on us, that "that" was not what we had dreamed. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/daniel/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4.

There were numerous ‘Aramaic’ dialects—as the Aramaic spoken in Assyria, at Zinjirli (near Aleppo), in Palmyra, in Têma, by the Nabataeans at ’el‘Öla, that of the books of Daniel and Ezra, that of the Targums of Onkelos and Jonathan, that of the Babylonian, that of the Palestinian Talmud—which, while similar in their general features, differed in details, somewhat in the manner in which the Greek dialects differed from one another: but the language which is now known distinctively as ‘Syriac,’—i.e. the language in which the ‘Peshiṭtâ’ version of the Bible (2nd cent. a.d.) was made, and in which an extensive Christian literature exists,—differs markedly from the Aramaic of Daniel and Ezra: and hence the rendering ‘Syriack’ suggests an entirely false idea of the language here meant. R.V., ‘in the Syrian language’ (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-11.htm" title="Then said Eliakim and Shebna and Joah to Rabshakeh, Speak, I pray you, to your servants in the Syrian language; for we understand it: and speak not to us in the Jews' language, in the ears of the people that are on the wall.">Isaiah 36:11</a>) is some improvement; but the term which ought to be employed is ‘Aramaic.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Aramaic part of the book begins with the words <span class="ital">O king</span>; and if ‘(in) Aramaic’ forms an integral part of the sentence, the author, it seems, must mean to indicate that in his opinion Aramaic was used at the court for communications of an official nature. That, however, does not explain why the use of Aramaic continues to the end of ch. 7; and it is besides quite certain that Aramaic, such as that of the Book of Daniel, was <span class="ital">not</span> spoken in Babylon.

The name is simply the name of the nation, but is here used of this small portion of it that were soothsayers, in the same way as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-22.htm">John 9:22</a> "Jews," the name of the nation, is used for the rulers: "For the Jews had agreed already that if any man did confess that he was Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue." Hence it is needless to speak of' the Chaldeans being the principal class, and therefore "for the sake of breviloquence" (Moses Stuart) "put for the whole." So also Kliefoth ('Kom.,' p. 79), "Because the Chaldeans were the first class, they alone are named." The Chaldeans were not the inhabitants of Babylonia, but belonged to several cantons south and east of Babylon. <span class="accented">Spake.</span> The word <span class="accented">yedabberu</span> is usually followed by the verb <span class="accented">amar</span> in the infinitive. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-4.htm">Ezekiel 40:4</a> we have the verb <span class="accented">dibber</span> used without <span class="accented">arnar</span>, to introduce the thing said. It is not improbable that in this instance <span class="accented">Aramith</span>, "in the Syriac tongue," helped to the omission of <span class="accented">amar. In the Syriack</span> (<span class="accented">Aramith</span>). All scholars know now that there are two leading dialects of the Aramaean or Aramaic - the Eastern or Syriac, and the Western or Chaldee. The terms are very confusing; as Syria was certainly to the west of Chaldea, it seems strange that the usage should ever have sprung up to call the Western variety Chaldee, and the Eastern variety Syriac. The usage having been established, it has a certain convenience to be able to name all the Western, or, as they may be called, Palestinian dialects of Aramaic Chaldee, and all the Eastern varieties Syriac. While the English version uses the term "Syriac," as the portion of Daniel which follows has come down to us, it is not written in Syriac, but in Chaldee. We shall, however, endeavour to show that this is due to changes introduced by transcribers. As to the word <span class="accented">Aramith</span> occurring here, there is great force in the view maintained by Lenormant, that it is to be regarded as a note to the reader, indicating that st this point the Hebrew ceases and the Aramaic begins. The reason of the change from one language to another has been already dealt with in considering the question of the structure of Daniel. In the mean time it is sufficient to say that our theory is that the Hebrew in the beginning of Daniel is due to the editor, who collected the scattered fly-leaves. In the first chapter and in the three opening verses of that before us, we have the results of translation and condensation. As the previous sacred books had been written in Hebrew  - the prophecies of Isaiah and Jeremiah, not to speak of other books - it was natural that the editor, especially if he were under the influence of Ezra, would desire to see a book that had so much of holy hope and aspiration about it, in the sacred language of the patriarchs and prophets. There would be probably a considerable mass of irregular material to be gone over before a connected account could be given of the early days of Daniel. These sources would be necessarily in the main Aramaic, and hence the translation and condensation. It was formerly one of the objections urged against Daniel that the author regarded Aramaic  as the language spoken in Babylon. By this time the language engraved on the tablets had been discovered not to be any previously known toungue. It is now found that, although the inhabitants of Babylon used the cuneiform for inscriptions, the language of ordinary business and social intercourse was Aramaic. and had been for several centuries. Dr. Hugo Winckler says, in his 'History of Babylonia and Assyria,' p. 179, "Aramaic soon became the language of social intercourse (<span class="accented">ungangsprache</span>) in nearly the whole of Mesopotamia, and. expelled the Assyro-Babylonian, which continued only as a literary tongue (<span class="accented">schriftsprache</span>)." Bronze weights have been found dating back to the Sargo-nids, with the weight marked on the one side in Aramaic, while on the other the titles of the king are given in Assyrian, When Sennacherib sent Rabshakeh to Jerusalem, Eliakim and Shebna wished the conversation to be carried on in Aramaic, implying that by this time Aramaic had become the ordinary language of diplomacy. The single Aramaic verse in Jeremiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-11.htm">Jeremiah 10:11</a>) implies that the Jewish captives would be dwelling among a people who ordinarily spoke Aramaic. Some have deduced from the phrase, "then spake," etc., that Aramaic was not the ordinary language of the speakers - a deduction that would be plausible if it had not been that from this point till the end. of the seventh chapter the book is in Aramaic. Jephet-ibn-Ali thinks that Nebuchadnezzar had first addressed the wise men in some other language, and then betook him to Aramaic. O <span class="accented">king</span>, <span class="accented">live for ever</span>: <span class="accented">tell thy servaats the dream</span>, <span class="accented">andl we will show the interpretation.</span> The soothsayers address the king in terms of Oriental adulation. Similar phrases are found in despatches to Asshurbanipal. In the Septuagint Version the phrase is accommodated more to the Hellenic usage, and the king is addressed as <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;</span>. Their language implies that they expected to be told the dream, and then, having been told the dream, they would apply the rules of their art to it, and declare to the king the interpretation. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/45.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Heave-offerings of the People. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-13.htm">Ezekiel 45:13</a>.

The word &#1513;&#1473;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514;&#1501; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-13.htm">Ezekiel 45:13</a> must not be altered, as Hitzig proposes; for although this is the only passage in which &#1513;&#1473;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1492; occurs, it is analogous to &#1495;&#1502;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/41-34.htm">Genesis 41:34</a>, both in its formation and its meaning, "to raise the sixth part." A sixth of an ephah is the sixtieth part of a homer. &#1495;&#1511;, that which is fixed or established, i.e., the proper quantity. &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1514; &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1502;&#1503; is in apposition to &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1502;&#1503; (for the article, see the comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-21.htm">Ezekiel 43:21</a>), the fixed quantity of oil, namely of the bath of oil-i.e., the measure of that which is to be contributed from the oil, and that from the bath of oil-shall be the tenth part of the bath from the cor, i.e., the hundredth part of the year's crop, as the cor contained ten baths. The cor is not mentioned in the preceding words (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-11.htm">Ezekiel 45:11</a>), nor does it occur in the Mosaic law. It is another name for the homer, which is met with for the first time in the writings of the captivity (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-2.htm">1 Kings 5:2</a>, 25; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-9.htm">2 Chronicles 2:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/27-5.htm">2 Chronicles 27:5</a>). For this reason its capacity is explained by the words which are appended to &#1502;&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;: '&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1514; &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;, from the cor (namely) of ten baths, one homer; and the latter definition is still further explained by the clause, "for ten baths are one homer." - <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-15.htm">Ezekiel 45:15</a>. &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1492;, from the watered soil (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/13-10.htm">Genesis 13:10</a>), that is to say, not a lean beast, but a fat one, which has been fed upon good pasture. &#1500;&#1499;&#1508;&#1468;&#1512; &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; indicates the general purpose of the sacrifices (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-4.htm">Leviticus 1:4</a>). - <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-16.htm">Ezekiel 45:16</a>. The article in &#1492;&#1506;&#1501;, as in &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1514; ni sa ,&#1492;&#1506;&#1501; ni  in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-14.htm">Ezekiel 45:14</a>. &#1492;&#1497;&#1492; &#1488;&#1500;, to be, i.e., to belong, to anything - in other words, to be held to it, under obligation to do it; &#1492;&#1497;&#1492; &#1506;&#1500;  (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-17.htm">Ezekiel 45:17</a>), on the other hand, to be upon a person, i.e., to devolve upon him. In &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491;&#1497; the feast and days of festival, which have been previously mentioned separately, are all grouped together. '&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1488;&#1514; &#1492;&#1495;&#1496;&#1468;&#1488;&#1514; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;' .rehtegot, to furnish the sin-offering, etc., i.e., to supply the materials for them.<p>So far as the fact is concerned, the Mosaic law makes no mention of any contributions to the sanctuary, with the exception of the first-born, the first-fruits and the tithes, which could be redeemed with money, however. Besides these, it was only on extraordinary occasions - e.g., the building of the tabernacle - that the people were called upon for freewill heave-offerings. But the Mosaic law contains no regulation as to the sources from which the priests were to meet the demands for the festal sacrifices. So far, the instructions in the verses before us are new. What had formerly been given for this object as a gift of spontaneous love, is to become in the future a regular and established duty, to guard against that arbitrary and fitful feeling from which the worship of God might suffer injury. - To these instructions there are appended, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-18.htm">Ezekiel 45:18</a> onwards, the regulations concerning the sacrifices to be offered at the different festivals. </body></html>
