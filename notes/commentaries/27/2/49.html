They were his countrymen; they had been captives with him; they had been selected with a view to stand with him before the king <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/1-3.htm">Daniel 1:3-4</a>; they had shared with him in his rules of abstinence <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/1-11.htm">Daniel 1:11-17</a>; they had all passed an honorable examination before the king <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/1-18.htm">Daniel 1:18-19</a>; they had united with him in supplication to God that he would disclose the meaning of the vision <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/2-17.htm">Daniel 2:17-18</a>; and now it was proper that they should be remembered by him who had been so signally honored.<p>Over the affairs of the province of Babylon - In what particular departments of business they were employed is not mentioned; but it would seem that all that especially pertained to this province was entrusted to them. Daniel had the general superintendence, but the subordinate duties growing out of the office were entrusted to them. The fact that the king granted the request shows the influence that Daniel had at the court. The reasons which influenced the king in granting the request may have been, not only the favor with which he regarded Daniel, but the fact that the duties of the office conferred on him now were such as to require assistance, and the remembrance of the virtues ot these youths when they stood before him.<p>But Daniel sat in the gate of the king - The post of chief honor and dignity as a counselor of the king. The "gate" of a city in the East, being a chief place of concourse, was the place where courts were held, and public business was usually transacted. See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/29-7.htm">Job 29:7</a>. To say, therefore, that he "sat in the gate of the king," is merely to say that he occupied a place with the chief counselors and dignitaries of the realm. The phrase "Sublime Porte," that is, "the Sublime Gate," is still employed at Constantinople to denote the government of the sultan, for, in the earlier days of Ottoman rule, the reigning sovereign, as is still the case in some parts of the East, held courts of justice and levees at the entrance of his residence. See "Harper's Magazine," vol. iv. p. 333. The office of Daniel was, perhaps, not far different from that of the grand vizier of the Turkish government. See Murray's "Ency. Geog." vol. ii. p. 202.<p>Remarks<p>Among the lessons of practical value suggested by this chapter, we may notice the following:<p>(1) We have an instance <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/2-1.htm">Daniel 2:1-3</a> of the methods which were resorted to in early periods of the world to ascertain what the future would be. This great monarch relied on a dream which greatly disturbed him, and on the power which he supposed was entrusted to men to interpret dreams. In common with the prevailing spirit of his times, and of all ancient times (notes, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-1.htm">Daniel 2:1</a>), he believed that dreams might be regarded as prognostics of future events; that they were under Divine direction; and that all that was necessary to make them safe guides in reference to what is to occur, was that they should be properly interpreted. In common, too, with all the people of ancient times, and with most of modern times, the king here referred to had an earnest desire to look into the future. There has been no desire in the human bosom stronger than this. We are so made that we wish to lift the mysterious veil which shrouds the future; to penetrate the deep darkness which rests on the unseen world.<p>Our great interests are there. The past is fixed, and cannot now affect us, except by the consequences of what we have done, and by teaching us lessons of value derived from our own observation, and that of others. But the future is not yet fixed. Man, so anxious to know what this is to be, finds himself in respect to it peculiarly unendowed. In relation to the past, he is endowed with the faculty of "memory," but with nothing corresponding to this pertaining to "the future." He can treasure up what has occurred, but he cannot in like manner make the future pass before his mind, that he may become wise by knowing what will take place in far distant times. There can be no doubt that God could have endowed the mind with one faculty as well as the other - for he has it himself - but there were obvious reasons why it should not be done. Destitute, then, as man was of this power, one great object of human inquiry has been to see whether the deficiency could be supplied, and whether something might not be found which would be to the future substantially what the memory is to the past. The efforts and results on this subject - one of which we have in the chapter before us - constitute one of the most instructive chapters of the history of our race, and show how effectually God has bounded the limits of human investigation in this respect. Among those methods of attempting to penetrate the future, and of laying open its deep mysteries, may be noticed the following:<p>(a) Astrology. It was supposed that the stars might exert an influence over the fates of men, and that by observing their positions, conjunctions, and oppositions, it might be ascertained what would be the destiny of individuals and nations. The belief of this has manifested itself more or less in every age; and in such instances as in the word "lunacy," and in the common apprehensions about the influence of the moon on health and on vegetation, may be still seen traces of that belief. Even Lord Bacon held that "astrology was a science not to be "rejected," but reformed;" and in the early periods of the world it was a "fair" subject of investigation whether the heavenly bodies actually exerted such an influence, and whether, if it were so, it was possible to ascertain the laws by which this was done. This was the so-called science of astrology.<p>(b) Necromancy. The belief of this also prevailed in nearly all ancient nations, and we find frequent reference to it in the Scriptures. This consisted in the belief that the dead must be acquainted with the world where they now dwell, so dark to the living, and that it might be possible to make a covenant or compact with them, by which they would be induced to disclose what they knew. It was extensively, if not universally, believed that they re-appeared to men, and that it was not an uncommon occurrence for them to leave their abodes, and to visit the earth again. It was, therefore, not an unnatural and not an unfair subject of inquiry, whether they would not disclose to the more favored among mortals what they knew of the secrets of the invisible world, and what they knew of events which were to come. Compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-19.htm">Isaiah 8:19</a>.<p>(c) The arts of divination. These were founded mainly on the investigations of science. It was at first a fair question whether, amidst the wonders which science was unfolding to the view, it might not contribute to lift the veil from the future, and reveal what was yet to come. It took long to ascertain what were the legitimate aims of science, and what might be hoped for from it. Hence, it was directed to the inquiry whether some substance might not be found which would transmute all things to gold; whether some elixir might not be discovered which would arrest all disease, and give immortality to man; and whether science would not disclose some means by which the future could be penetrated, and the mysteries of the invisible world be laid open to the view. It required centuries of investigation, a thousand failures, and the results of long and patient thought, to ascertain what were the true objects of science, and to convince the world that it was not its legitimate purpose to reveal the future to man.<p>(d) Pagan oracles. It was an early inquiry whether God would not, in some way, lift the veil from the future and disclose its secrets to man. The belief that this would be done seems to be natural to the mind of man; and in all ages, and in all countries, he has supposed that; the future would be thus disclosed. Hence, among the pagan, certain persons claimed to be divinely inspired; hence, such shrines as that at Delphi became celebrated; hence, ambiguous responses were uttered, so expressed as to support the credit of the oracle, whatever might be the result; hence, men were appointed to observe the flights of birds, to inspect the entrails of animals offered in sacrifice, to interpret any unusual phenomena in the clouds, to mark the direction of meteors, and, in general, to examine any unusual appearances in the heavens or the earth, which would seem to furnish any clew by which the future might be known. Much of all this undoubtedly became mere imposture, and justified the remark of Cicero, that he wondered that one augur could meet another without laughing; but there can be no doubt that by many these inquiries were honestly pursued, and that at first all this seemed to be a legitimate subject of inquiry. What forbade man to pursue it? And who could tell but that in some such ways the secrets of the mysterious future could be found out? It demanded long and patient inquiry and observation to show that this could not be so, and that whatever might be indicated by any of these things, it was never designed that they should be the means by which man could be made acquainted with the mysteries of the invisible world.<p>(e) Dreams. We have seen (notes, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-1.htm">Daniel 2:1</a>) that it was an early article of belief that through the medium of dreams the Divine will might be made known, and the secrets of the future disclosed. The "theory" on this subject seems to have been, that during sleep the ordinary laws of the mind are suspended; that the soul is abstracted from the visible world; that the thoughts which it has then must be originated by higher beings; and that in this state it has converse with an invisible world, and may be permitted to see much of what is yet to occur. Compare Intro. to Isaiah, Section VII. (2).<p>(f) Visions. Men supposed that there might be representations made to certain favored persons respecting the future, their senses being closed to surrounding objects, and that while in an ecstasy, or trance, the mind might have a view of future events. Such were the visions of Balaam; such, in a remarkable manner, were the visions of the true prophets; and so deeply was the conviction that this "might" occur engrafted in the human mind, that the belief of it seems to have had a place among the pagan nations. Compare Introduction to Isaiah, Section 7. (4).<p>Such were some of the ways by which it was supposed that the future might be penetrated by man, and its secrets disclosed. By allowing man to make trial of these methods, and to pursue them through a period of several thousand years, until he himself saw that they were fruitless, God was preparing the race to feel the necessity of direct communications from himself, and to welcome the true reve lations which he would make respecting things to come.<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/daniel/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>49.

Daniel was a chief counsellor of the king, and president over the governors of the different orders into which the Magi were divided.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/daniel/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> He substituted them as lieutenants for the king’s service, under Daniel, which, as the curious observe, was chiefly about agriculture, and gathering revenues and provisions for the court; but Daniel was as privy counsellor and lord chamberlain, about arduous affairs of the king and kingdom, sitting sometimes in judgment, and also admitting and conducting persons and causes to the king, as there was need, to whom there was difficult access, according to the magnificence and majesty of the kings of the East. Thus Daniel sat in the king’s gate, to be near and ready for the king’s chiefest business; and it notes honour, also high favour; but especially we must look upon Daniel’s promotion to be for the service and protection of his brethren in their present state of captivity, as Mordecai was, which shows that God doth remember his people in their low estate, and doth not leave himself without witness to them, in raising up nursing-fathers for them. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/daniel/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then Daniel requested of the king,.... Being in his favour, he improved it to the advantage of his friends, whom he did not forget in his elevated state; but made suit to the king for them to be put into places of trust and honour, which the king listened to: <p>and he set Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, over the affairs of the province of Babylon; that is, under Daniel, who was made ruler over it; these were deputies under him, appointed to take care of some affairs, which would have been too troublesome to him, and would have took up too much of his time from court; where he chose to be, to improve his interest on behalf of the church of God. De Dieu thinks, from the use of the word in Chaldee, and from what answers to it in the Arabic language, that it was agriculture, the fruits of the field, and the revenues arising from thence, which these men had the care of: this Daniel got for them; that as they had assisted him in their prayers to God, to obtain the dream, and the interpretation of it, so they might share with him in his honours and profits he had on the account thereof; and probably he might suggest this to Nebuchadnezzar, which the more easily engaged him to grant the request: <p>but Daniel sat in the gate of the king; either as judge there, or to introduce persons into the king's presence: or it may be rendered, "in the king's court" (t); he was chief man at court, and always resided there; he was prime minister and privy counsellor: it was usual with the eastern nations to call their court a "port", as the Turks do at this day; the Ottoman court is called "the Port". <p>(t)  "in aula regis", Grotius. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/daniel/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Then Daniel <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> requested of the king, and he set Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, over the affairs of the province of Babylon: but Daniel <i>sat</i> in the <span class="cverse3">{f}</span> gate of the king.</span><p>(e) He did not do this for their personal profit, but that the whole Church, which was then there in affliction, might have some release and ease by this benefit.<p>(f) Meaning that either he was a judge, or that he had the whole authority, so than no one could be admitted to the king's presence but by him.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/daniel/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">49</span>.

An exegetical study on <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-1.htm">Ezekiel 47:1-12</a>. Berlin, 1848.)<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-1.htm">Ezekiel 47:1</a>. And he led me back to the door of the house, and, behold, water flowed out from under the threshold of the house toward the east, for the front side of the house was toward the east; and the water flowed down from below, from the right shoulder of the house on the south of the altar. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-2.htm">Ezekiel 47:2</a>. And he led me out by the way of the north gate, and caused me to go round about on the outside, to the outer gate of the way to the (gate), looking toward the east; and, behold, waters rippled for the right shoulder of the gate. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-3.htm">Ezekiel 47:3</a>. When the man went out toward the east, he had a measuring line in his hand, and he measured a thousand cubits, and caused me to go through the water-water to the ankles. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-4.htm">Ezekiel 47:4</a>. And he measured a thousand, and caused me to go through the water-water to the knees; and he measured a thousand, and caused me to go through-water to the hips. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-5.htm">Ezekiel 47:5</a>. And he measured a thousand-a river through which I could not walk, for the water was high, water to swim in, a river which could not be forded. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-6.htm">Ezekiel 47:6</a>. And he said to me, Hast thou seen it, son of man? and he led me back again by the bank of the river. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-7.htm">Ezekiel 47:7</a>. When I returned, behold, there stood on the bank of the river very many trees on this side and on that. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-8.htm">Ezekiel 47:8</a>. And he said to me, This water flows out into the eastern circle, and runs down into the plain, and reaches the sea; into the sea is it carried out, that the waters may become wholesome. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-9.htm">Ezekiel 47:9</a>. And it will come to pass, every living thing with which it swarms everywhere, whither the double river comes, will live, and there will be very many fishes; for when this water comes thither they will become wholesome, and everything will live whither the river comes. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-10.htm">Ezekiel 47:10</a>. And fishermen will stand by it, from Engedi to Eneglaim they will spread out nets; after their kind will there be fishes therein, like the fishes of the great sea, very many. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-11.htm">Ezekiel 47:11</a>. Its marshes and its swamps, they will not become wholesome, they will be given up to salt. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-12.htm">Ezekiel 47:12</a>. And by the river will all kinds of trees of edible fruit grow on its bank, on this side and on that; their leaves will not wither, and their fruits will not fail; every moon they will bear ripe fruit, for its water flows out of its sanctuary. And their fruits will serve as food, and their leaves as medicine.<p>From the outer court, where Ezekiel had been shown the sacrificial kitchens for the people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-21.htm">Ezekiel 46:21</a>.), he is taken back to the front of the door of the temple house, to be shown a spring of water, flowing out from under the threshold of the temple, which has swollen in the short course of four thousand cubits from its source into a deep river in which men can swim, and which flows down to the Jordan valley, to empty itself into the Dead Sea. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-1.htm">Ezekiel 47:1</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-2.htm">Ezekiel 47:2</a>, the origin and course of this water are described; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-3.htm">Ezekiel 47:3</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-5.htm">Ezekiel 47:5</a>, its marvellous increase; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-6.htm">Ezekiel 47:6</a>, the growth of trees on its banks; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-7.htm">Ezekiel 47:7-12</a>, its emptying itself into the Arabah and into the Dead Sea, with the life-giving power of its water. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-1.htm">Ezekiel 47:1</a>. The door of the house is the entrance into the holy place of the temple, and &#1502;&#1508;&#1514;&#1468;&#1503; &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; the threshold of this door. &#1511;&#1491;&#1497;&#1502;&#1492;, not "in the east" (Hitzig), for the following sentence explaining the reason does not require this meaning; but "toward the east" of the threshold, which lay toward the east, for the front of the temple was in the east. &#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514; is not to be connected with &#1502;&#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1507;, but to be taken by itself, only not in the sense of downwards (Hitzig), but from beneath, namely, down from the right shoulder of the house. &#1497;&#1512;&#1491;, to flow down, because the temple stood on higher ground than the inner court. The right shoulder is the part of the eastern wall of the holy place between the door and the pillars, the breadth of which was five cubits (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-1.htm">Ezekiel 41:1</a>). The water therefore issued from the corner formed by the southern wall of the porch and the eastern wall of the holy place (see the sketch on Plate I), and flowed past the altar of burnt-offering on the south side, and crossed the court in an easterly direction, passing under its surrounding wall. It then flowed across the outer court and under the pavement and the eastern wall into the open country, where the prophet, on the outside in front of the gate, saw it rippling forth from the right shoulder of that gate. That he might do this, he was led out through the north gate, because the east gate was shut (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-1.htm">Ezekiel 44:1</a>), and round by the outside wall to the eastern outer gate. &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498; &#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509; is more minutely defined by &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512; &#1492;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509;, and this, again, by &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498; &#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1504;&#1492; &#1511;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501;, "by the way to the (gate) looking eastwards." The &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;. &#1468;&#1512;&#1498;&#787;&#768;&#1497;&#1504;&#1489;&#1500;&#894;, Piel of &#1508;&#1468;&#1499;&#1492;, related to &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1492;, most probably signifies to ripple, not to trickle. &#1502;&#1497;&#1501; has no article, because it is evident from the context that the water was the same as that which Ezekiel had seen in the inner court, issuing from the threshold of the temple. The right shoulder is that portion of the eastern wall which joined the south side of the gate. - <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-3.htm">Ezekiel 47:3-5</a>. The miraculous increase in the depth of the water. A thousand cubits from the wall, as one walked through, it reached to the ankles; a thousand cubits further, to the knees; a thousand cubits further, to the hips; and after going another thousand cubits it was impossible to wade through, one could only swim therein. The words &#1502;&#1497; &#1488;&#1508;&#1505;&#1497;&#1501; are a brief expression for "there was water which reached to the ankles." &#1488;&#1508;&#1505; is equivalent to &#1508;&#1468;&#1505;, an ankle, not the sole of the foot. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-13.htm">1 Chronicles 11:13</a>, on the other hand, we have &#1508;&#1468;&#1505; &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; for &#1488;&#1508;&#1505; &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; . The striking expression &#1502;&#1497;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1499;&#1497;&#1501; for &#1502;&#1497; &#1489;&#1512;&#1499;&#1497;&#1501; may possibly have been chosen because &#1502;&#1497; &#1489;&#1512;&#1499;&#1497;&#1501; had the same meaning as &#1502;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497; &#1512;&#1490;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-12.htm">Isaiah 36:12</a> (Keri). The measuring man directed the prophet's attention (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-6.htm">Ezekiel 47:6</a>) to this extraordinary increase in the stream of water, because the miraculous nature of the stream was exhibited therein. A natural river could not increase to such an extent within such short distances, unless, indeed, other streams emptied themselves into it on all sides, which was not he case here. He then directed him to go back again &#1506;&#1500; &#1513;&#1474;&#1508;&#1514;, along the bank, not "to the bank," as he had never left it. The purpose for which he had been led along the bank was accomplished after he had gone four thousand cubits. From the increase in the water, as measured up to this point, he could infer what depth it would reach in its further course. He is therefore now to return along the bank to see how it is covered with trees. &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497; cannot be explained in any other way than as an incorrect form for &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;, though there are no corresponding analogies to be found.<p>In <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-8.htm">Ezekiel 47:8-12</a> he gives him a still further explanation of the course of the river and the effect of its waters. The river flows out into &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500;&#1492; &#1492;&#1511;&#1468;&#1491;&#1502;&#1493;&#1504;&#1492;, the eastern circle, which is identical with &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514; &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1512;&#1491;&#1468;&#1503; htiw lacitne, the circle of the Jordan (<a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/22-10.htm">Joshua 22:10-11</a>), the region above the Dead Sea, where the Jordan valley (Ghor) widens out into a broad, deep basin. &#1492;&#1506;&#1512;&#1489;&#1492; is the deep valley of the Jordan, now called the Ghor (see the comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-1.htm">Deuteronomy 1:1</a>), of which Robinson says that the greater part remains a desolate wilderness. It was so described in ancient times (see Joseph. Bell. <a href="http://biblehub.com/jude/3.htm">Jude 3</a>.10. 7, iv. 8. 2), and we find it so to-day (compare v. Raumer, Pal. p. 58). &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; is the Dead Sea, called &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1501; &#1492;&#1511;&#1468;&#1491;&#1502;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-18.htm">Ezekiel 47:18</a>, and the sea of the Arabah in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-17.htm">Deuteronomy 3:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-49.htm">Deuteronomy 4:49</a>. We agree with Hengstenberg in taking the words &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1510;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501; as an emphatic summing up of the previous statement concerning the outflow of the water, to which the explanation concerning its effect upon the Dead Sea is attached, and supply &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; from the clause immediately preceding: "the waters of the river that have been brought out (come) to the sea, and the waters of the Dead Sea are healed." There is no need, therefore, for the emendation proposed by Hitzig, namely, &#1488;&#1500; &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1501; &#1492;&#1501; &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1510;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501;. So much, however, is beyond all doubt, that &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; is no other than the Dead Sea already mentioned. The supposition that it is the Mediterranean Sea (Chald., Ros., Ewald, and others) cannot be reconciled with the words, and has only been transferred to this passage from <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-8.htm">Zechariah 14:8</a>. &#1504;&#1512;&#1508;&#1468;&#1488; signifies, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-22.htm">2 Kings 2:22</a>, the healing or rendering wholesome of water that is injurious or destructive to life. The character of the Dead Sea, with which the ancients were also well acquainted, and of which Tacitus writes as follows: Lacus immenso ambitu, specie maris sapore corruptior, gravitate odoris accolis pestifer, neque vento impellitur neque pisces aut suetas aquis volucres patitur (Hist. v. c. 6), - a statement confirmed by all modern travellers (cf. v. Raumer, Pal. pp. 61ff., and Robinson, Physical Geography of the Holy Land), - is regarded as a disease of the water, which is healed or turned into wholesome water in which fishes can live, by the water of the river proceeding from the sanctuary. The healing and life-giving effect of this river upon the Dead Sea is described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-9.htm">Ezekiel 47:9</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-10.htm">Ezekiel 47:10</a>. Whithersoever the waters of the river come, all animated beings will come to life and flourish.<p>In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-9.htm">Ezekiel 47:9</a> the dual &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; occasions some difficulty. It is not likely that the dual should have been used merely for the sake of its resemblance to &#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, as Maurer imagines; and still less probable is it that there is any allusion to a junction of the river proceeding from the temple at some point in its course with the Kedron, which also flows into the Dead Sea (Hvernick), as the Kedron is not mentioned either before or afterwards. According to Kliefoth, the dual is intended to indicate a division which takes place in the waters of the river, that have hitherto flowed on together, as soon as they enter the sea. But this would certainly have been expressed more clearly. Hengstenberg takes the expression "double river" to mean a river with a strong current, and refers to <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-21.htm">Jeremiah 50:21</a> in support of this. This is probably the best explanation; for nothing is gained by altering the text into &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1501; (Ewald) or &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; (Hitzig), as &#1504;&#1495;&#1500; does not require definition by means of a suffix, nor doe the plural answer to the context.  is to be taken in connection with &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1509;: "wherewith it swarms whithersoever the river comes;" though &#1488;&#1500; does not stand for &#1506;&#1500; after <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/7-21.htm">Genesis 7:21</a>, as Hitzig supposes, but is to be explained from a species of attraction, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/20-13.htm">Genesis 20:13</a>. &#1497;&#1495;&#1497;&#1492; is a pregnant expression, to revive, to come to life. The words are not to be understood, however, as meaning that there were living creatures in the Dead Sea before the health-giving water flowed into it; the thought is simply, that whithersoever the waters of the river come, there come into existence living creatures in the Dead Sea, so that it swarms with them. In addition to the &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1509;, the quantity of fish is specially mentioned; and in the second hemistich the reason is assigned for the number of living creatures that come into existence by a second allusion to the health-giving power of the water of the river. The subject to &#1493;&#1497;&#1512;&#1508;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;, viz., the waters of the Dead Sea, is to be supplied from the context. The great abundance of fish in the Dead Sea produced by the river is still further depicted in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-10.htm">Ezekiel 47:10</a>. Fishermen will spread their nets along its coast from Engedi to Eneglaim; and as for their kind, there will be as many kinds of fish there as are to be found in the great or Mediterranean Sea. &#1506;&#1497;&#1503; &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497;, i.e., Goat's spring, now Ain-Jidi, a spring in the middle of the west coast of the Dead Sea, with ruins of several ancient buildings (see the comm. on <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/15-62.htm">Joshua 15:62</a>, and v. Raumer, Pal. p. 188). &#1506;&#1497;&#1503; &#1506;&#1490;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; has not yet been discovered, though, from the statement of Jerome, "Engallim is at the beginning of the Dead Sea, where the Jordan enters it," it has been conjectured that it is to be found in Ain el-Feshkhah, a spring at the northern end of the west coast, where there are also ruins of a small square tower and other buildings to be seen (vid., Robinson's Palestine, II pp. 491, 492), as none of the other springs on the west coast, of which there are but few, answer so well as this. &#1500;&#1502;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492; is pointed without Mappik, probably because the Masoretes did not regard the &#1492; as a suffix, as the noun to which it alludes does not follow till afterwards. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-11.htm">Ezekiel 47:11</a> introduces an exception, namely, that notwithstanding this the Dead Sea will still retain marshes or pools and swamps, which will not be made wholesome (&#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1468;&#1488;&#1514; for &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;, pools). An allusion to the natural character of the Dead Sea underlies the words. "In the rainy season, when the sea is full, its waters overspread many low tracts of marsh land, which remain after the receding of the water in the form of moist pools or basins; and as the water in these pools evaporates rapidly, the ground becomes covered with a thick crust of salt" (Robinson's Physical Geography, p. 215). &#1500;&#1502;&#1500;&#1495; &#1504;&#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, they are given up to salt, i.e., destined to remain salt, because the waters of the river do not reach them. The light in which the salt is regarded here is not that of its seasoning properties, but, in the words of Hengstenberg, "as the foe to all fruitfulness, all life and prosperity, as Pliny has said (Hist. Nat. xxxi. c. 7: Omnis locus, in quo reperitur sal, sterilis est nihilque gignit") (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-22.htm">Deuteronomy 29:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-6.htm">Jeremiah 17:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-9.htm">Zephaniah 2:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-34.htm">Psalm 107:34</a>). - In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-12.htm">Ezekiel 47:12</a> the effect of the water of the river upon the vegetation of the ground, already mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-7.htm">Ezekiel 47:7</a>, is still further described. On its coast grow all kinds of trees with edible fruits (&#1506;&#1509; &#1502;&#1488;&#1499;&#1500;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-23.htm">Leviticus 19:23</a>), whose leaves do not wither, and whose fruits do not fail, but ripen every month (&#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1468;&#1512;, or produce first-fruits, i.e., fresh fruits; and &#1500;&#1495;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; distributive, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/47-13.htm">Isaiah 47:13</a>), because the waters which moisten the soil proceed from the sanctuary, i.e., "directly and immediately from the dwelling-place of Him who is the author of all vital power and fruitfulness" (Hitzig). The leaves and fruits of these trees therefore possess supernatural powers. The fruits serve as food, i.e., for the maintenance of the life produced by the river of water; the leaves as medicine (&#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1492; from &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1507;  equals  &#1512;&#1508;&#1488;, healing), i.e., for the healing of the sick and corrupt (&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-2.htm">Revelation 22:2</a>).<p>In the effect of the water proceeding from the sanctuary upon the Dead Sea and the land on its shores, as described in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-8.htm">Ezekiel 47:8-12</a>, the significance of this stream of water in relation to the new kingdom of God is implied. If, then, the question be asked, what we are to understand by this water, whether we are to take it in a literal sense as the temple spring, or in a spiritual and symbolical sense, the complete answer can only be given in connection with the interpretation of the whole of the temple vision (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40.htm">Ezekiel 40-48</a>). Even if we assume for the moment, however, that the description of the new temple, with the worship appointed for it, and the fresh division of Canaan, is to be understood literally, and therefore that the building of an earthly temple upon a high mountain in the most holy terumah of the land set apart for Jehovah, and a renewal of the bleeding sacrifices in this temple by the twelve tribes of Israel, when restored to Palestine from the heathen lands, are to be taken for granted, it would be difficult to combine with this a literal interpretation of what is said concerning the effect of the temple spring. It is true that in Volck's opinion "we are to think of a glorification of nature;" but even this does not remove the difficulties which stand in the way of a literal interpretation of the temple spring. According to <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-12.htm">Ezekiel 47:12</a>, its waters posses the life-giving and healing power ascribed to them because they issue from the sanctuary. But how does the possession by the water of the power to effect the glorification of nature harmonize with its issuing from a temple in which bullocks, rams, calves, and goats are slaughtered and sacrificed? - Volck is still further of opinion that, with the spiritual interpretation of the temple spring, "nothing at all could be made of the fishermen;" because, for example, he cannot conceive of the spiritual interpretation in any other way than as an allegorical translation of all the separate features of the prophetic picture into spiritual things. But he has failed to consider that the fishermen with their nets on the shore of the sea, once dead, but now swarming with fish, are irreconcilably opposed to the assumption of a glorification of nature in the holy land, just because the inhabitants of the globe or holy land, in its paradisaically glorified state, will no more eat fish or other flesh, according to the teaching of Scripture, than the first men in Paradise. When once the wolf shall feed with the lamb, the leopard with the kid, the cow with the bear, and the lion shall eat straw like the ox, under the sceptre of the sprout from the stem of Jesse, then will men also cease their fishing, and no longer slaughter and eat either oxen or goats. To this the Israelites will form no exception in their glorified land of Canaan. - And if even these features in the vision before us decidedly favour the figurative or spiritual view of the temple spring, the necessity for this explanation is placed beyond the reach of doubt by a comparison of our picture with the parallel passages. According to <a href="http://biblehub.com/joel/4-18.htm">Joel 4:18</a>, at the time when a spring issues from the house of Jehovah and the vale of Shittim is watered, the mountains trickle with new wine, and the hills run with milk. If, then, in this case we understand what is affirmed of the temple spring literally, the trickling of the mountains with new wine and the flowing of the hills with milk must be taken literally as well. But we are unable to attain to the belief that in the glorified land of Israel the mountains will be turned into springs of new wine, and the hills into fountains of milk, and in the words of the whole verse we can discern nothing but a figurative description of the abundant streams of blessing which will then pour over the entire land. And just as in Joel the context points indisputably to a non-literal or figurative explanation, so also does the free manner in which Zechariah uses this prophecy of his predecessors, speaking only of living waters which issue from Jerusalem, and flow half into the eastern (i.e., the Dead) sea, and half into the western (i.e., the Mediterranean) sea (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-8.htm">Zechariah 14:8</a>), show that he was not thinking of an actual spring with earthly water. And here we are still provisionally passing by the application made of this feature in the prophetic descriptions of the glory of the new kingdom of God in the picture of the heavenly Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-1.htm">Revelation 22:1</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-2.htm">Revelation 22:2</a>).<p>The figurative interpretation, or spiritual explanation, is moreover favoured by the analogy of the Scriptures. "Water," which renders the unfruitful land fertile, and supplies refreshing drink to the thirsty, is used in Scripture as a figure denoting blessing and salvation, which had been represented even in Paradise in the form of watering (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/13-10.htm">Genesis 13:10</a>). In <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/12-3.htm">Isaiah 12:3</a>, "and with joy ye draw water from the wells of salvation," the figure is expressly interpreted. And so also in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-3.htm">Isaiah 44:3</a>, "I will pour water upon the thirsty one, and streams upon the desert; I will pour my Spirit upon thy seed, and my blessing upon thine offspring:" where the blessing answers to the water, the Spirit is named as the principal form in which the blessing is manifested, "the foundation of all other salvation for the people of God" (Hengstenberg). This salvation, which Joel had already described as a spring issuing from the house of Jehovah and watering the dry acacia valley, Ezekiel saw in a visionary embodiment as water, which sprang from under the threshold of the temple into which the glory of the Lord entered, and had swollen at a short distance off into so mighty a river that it was no longer possible to wade through. In this way the thought is symbolized, that the salvation which the Lord causes to flow down to His people from His throne will pour down from small beginnings in marvellously increasing fulness. The river flows on into the barren, desolate waste of the Ghor, and finally into the Dead Sea, and makes the waters thereof sound, so that it swarms with fishes. The waste is a figure denoting the spiritual drought and desolation, and the Dead Sea a symbol of the death caused by sin. The healing and quickening of the salt waters of that sea, so fatal to all life, set forth the power of that divine salvation which conquers death, and the calling to life of the world sunk in spiritual death. From this comes life in its creative fulness and manifold variety, as shown both by the figure of the fishermen who spread their nets along the shore, and by the reference to the kinds of fish, which are as manifold in their variety as those in the great sea. But life extends no further than the water of salvation flows. Wherever it cannot reach, the world continues to life in death. The pools and swamps of the Dead Sea are still given up to salt. And lastly, the water of salvation also possesses the power to produce trees with leaves and fruits, by which the life called forth from death can be sustained and cured of all diseases. This is the meaning, according to the express statement of the text, of the trees with their never withering leaves, upon the banks of the river, and their fruits ripening every month. </body></html>
