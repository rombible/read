This word is found only in the plural. The etymology is uncertain, but its meaning is not doubtful. The word president expresses it with sufficient accuracy, denoting a high officer that presided over others. It is not improbable that these presided over distinct departments, corresponding somewhat to what are now called "secretaries" - as Secretaries of State, of the Treasury, of Foreign Affairs, etc., though this is not particularly specified.<p>Of whom Daniel was first - First in rank. This office he probably held from the rank which he was known to have occupied under the kings of Babylon, and on account of his reputation for ability and integrity.<p>That the princes might give accounts unto them - Be immediately responsible to them; the accounts of their own administration, and of the state of the empire.<p>And the king should have no damage - Either in the loss of revenue, or in any maladministration of the affairs. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/4-13.htm">Ezra 4:13</a>. "They pay not toll, tribute, and custom, and so thou shalt endamage the revenue of the kings." The king was regarded as the source of all power, and as in fact the supreme proprietor of the realm, and any malfeasance or malversation in office was regarded as an injury to him. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/daniel/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 6<p>Da 6:1-28.

Darius&#8212;Grotefend has read it in the cuneiform inscriptions at Persepolis, as Darheush, that is, "Lord-King," a name applied to many of the Medo-Persian kings in common. Three of that name occur: Darius Hystaspes, 521 B.C., in whose reign the decree was carried into effect for rebuilding the temple (Ezr 4:5; Hag 1:1); Darius Codomanus, 336 B.C., whom Alexander overcame, called "the Persian" (Ne 12:22), an expression used after the rule of Macedon was set up; and Darius Cyaxares II, between Astyages and Cyrus [&AElig;SCHYLUS, The Persians, 762, 763].<p>hundred and twenty&#8212;satraps; set over the conquered provinces (including Babylon) by Cyrus [Xenophon, Cyrop&aelig;dia, 8.6.1].

To whom the hundred and twenty princes were accountable for their conduct, and to whom the people might apply for redress of grievances, if oppressed; perhaps the whole empire was divided into three greater parts, and each part had forty provinces in it, and over it a president or deputy of the king; to whom the princes of each province gave in the account of what they received for the king, and what use they made of it: <p>(of whom Daniel was the first:) or "one" (u), who was now an old man, having been about seventy years in Babylon, and had had a large experience of the affairs of civil government, being advanced in the times of Nebuchadnezzar to high posts; and very probably Darius had heard of the wisdom of Daniel before he came to the kingdom, as well as the king of Tyre, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-3.htm">Ezekiel 28:3</a> and might be informed of his prediction of Belshazzar's death, and the change of the empire: and of Belshazzar's promise to make him the third ruler in the kingdom; and he might also himself observe in him an uncommon sagacity and fitness for business of this sort. Josephus (w) says, that Darius took Daniel with him into Media, and made him one of the three presidents; and indeed no mention is made in this history of the nobles of Babylon, but only of the Medes and Persians: <p>that the princes might give account unto them, and the king should have no damage: or loss in his revenues, through the fraud and bad management of the princes of the provinces; since they might be discovered and checked by the presidents, who were to audit their accounts: or, "have no trouble" (x); in looking over and passing the accounts of the princes. <p>(u)  Sept.; "unus", V.

"We shall now discover what the youthful Daniel became, and what he continued to be to the end of the exile" (Klief.). The plur. &#1495;&#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; (dreams, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-1.htm">Daniel 2:1</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-2.htm">Daniel 2:2</a>), the singular of which occurs in <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/2-3.htm">Daniel 2:3</a>, is not the plur. of definite universality (Hv., Maur., Klief.), but of intensive fulness, implying that the dream in its parts contained a plurality of subjects. M('p@ft;hi (from &#1508;&#1468;&#1506;&#1501;, to thrust, to stroke, as &#1508;&#1468;&#1506;&#1501;, an anvil, teaches, to be tossed hither and thither) marks great internal disquietude. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-3.htm">Daniel 2:3</a> and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/41-8.htm">Genesis 41:8</a>, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/77-5.htm">Psalm 77:5</a>, it is in the Niphal form, but in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-1.htm">Daniel 2:1</a> it is in Hithp., on which Kran. finely remarks: "The Hithpael heightens the conception of internal unquiet lying in the Niphal to the idea that it makes itself outwardly manifest." His sleep was gone. This is evidenced without doubt by the last clause of <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/2-1.htm">Daniel 2:1</a>, &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; &#1504;&#1492;&#1497;&#1514;&#1492;. These interpretations are altogether wrong: - "His sleep came upon him, i.e., he began again to sleep" (Calvin); or "his sleep was against him," i.e., was an aversion to him, was troublesome (L. de Dieu); or, as Hv. also interprets it, "his sleep offended him, or was like a burden heavy upon him;" for &#1504;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492; does not mean to fall, and thus does not agree with the thought expressed. The Niph. &#1504;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492; means to have become, been, happened. The meaning has already been rightly expressed by Theodoret in the words &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0; &#787;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;, and in the Vulgate by the words "fugit ab illo;" and Berth., Ges., and others have with equal propriety remarked, that &#1504;&#1492;&#1497;&#1514;&#1492; &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1514;&#1493; corresponds in meaning with &#1504;&#1491;&#1468;&#1514; &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/6-19.htm">Daniel 6:19</a> (18), and &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1514; &#1504;&#1491;&#1491;&#1492;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/6-1.htm">Esther 6:1</a>. This sense, to have been, however, does not conduct to the meaning given by Klief.: his sleep had been upon him; it was therefore no more, it had gone; for "to have been" is not "to be no more," but "to be finished," past, gone. This meaning is confirmed by &#1504;&#1492;&#1497;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-27.htm">Daniel 8:27</a> : it was done with me, I was gone. The &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; stands not for the dative, but retains the meaning, over, upon, expressing the influence on the mind, as e.g., <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-18.htm">Jeremiah 8:18</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/11-8.htm">Hosea 11:8</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/42-6.htm">Psalm 42:6-7</a>, 12; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/43-5.htm">Psalm 43:5</a>, etc., which in German we express by the word bei or fr.<p>The reason of so great disquietude we may not seek in the circumstance that on awaking he could not remember the dream. This follows neither from <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/2-3.htm">Daniel 2:3</a>, nor is it psychologically probable that so impressive a dream, which on awaking he had forgotten, should have yet sorely disquieted his spirit during his waking hours. "The disquiet was created in him, as in Pharaoh (<a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/41.htm">Genesis 41</a>), by the specially striking incidents of the dream, and the fearful, alarming apprehensions with reference to his future fate connected therewith" (Kran.).</body></html>
