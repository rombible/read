In <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/6-16.htm" title="Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast him into the den of lions. Now the king spoke and said to Daniel, Your God whom you serve continually, he will deliver you.">Daniel 6:16</a> he expressed a vague hope that God would protect His servant. That hope seems now to have died out, though afterwards (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/6-26.htm" title="I make a decree, That in every dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel: for he is the living God, and steadfast for ever, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed, and his dominion shall be even to the end.">Daniel 6:26</a>) it appears stronger than that of Nebuchadnezzar. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-37.htm" title="Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honor the King of heaven, all whose works are truth, and his ways judgment: and those that walk in pride he is able to abase.">Daniel 4:37</a>.) The phrase “living God” is remarkable, coming as it does from a heathen king. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-36.htm" title="Your servant slew both the lion and the bear: and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he has defied the armies of the living God.">1Samuel 17:36</a>.)<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:18-24 The best way to have a good night, is to keep a good conscience. We are sure of what the king doubted, that the servants of the living God have a Master well able to protect them. See the power of God over the fiercest creatures, and believe his power to restrain the roaring lion that goeth about continually seeking to devour. Daniel was kept perfectly safe, because he believed in his God. Those who boldly and cheerfully trust in God to protect them in the way of duty, shall always find him a present help. Thus the righteous is delivered out of trouble, and the wicked cometh in his stead. The short triumph of the wicked will end in their ruin.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/daniel/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He cried with a lamentable voice - A voice full of anxious solicitude. Literally, "a voice of grief." Such a cry would be natural on such an occasion.<p>O Daniel, servant of the living God - The God who has life; who imparts life; and who can preserve life. This was the appellation, probably, which he had heard Daniel use in regard to God, and it is one which he would naturally employ on such an occasion as this; feeling that the question of life was entirely in his hands.<p>Whom thou servest continually - At all times, and in all circumstances: as a captive in a distant land; in places of honor and power; when surrounded by the great who worship other gods; and when threatened with death for your devotion to the service of God.

Expressing grief and sorrow his heart was full of; it was rather like howling than speaking; thus he cried before he saw Daniel, or heard him speak: <p>when he was near to the den (k), as it may be rendered; and he was between hope and fear about Daniel's safety; when within sight of the den, and hearing of Daniel, should he be alive to speak: but when he came nearer and saw him, then <p>the king spake and said to Daniel, O Daniel, servant of the living God; art thou alive? this is a plain case, that the God whom thou servest is the living God, since he has saved thee; and that thou art a true and faithful servant of his, seeing he has wrought such deliverance for thee: <p>is thy God, whom thou servest continually, able to deliver thee from the lions? has he made it to appear that he is able to deliver from them? has he really done the thing? he could scarcely believe for joy, being filled with amazement; for these words are not to be considered as expressive of any doubt or hesitation he had of the power of God to save him; for he had declared he had before, yea; his confidence that he would deliver him; but of his wonder and admiration at it, the thing being so extraordinary and amazing. <p>(k)  "cum appropinquasset ad foveam", Pagninus; "quumque appropinquaret ad foveam", Piscator. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/daniel/6.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And when he came to the den, he cried with a lamentable voice unto Daniel: <i>and</i> the king spake and said to Daniel, O Daniel, servant of the living God, is thy God, whom thou servest continually, <span class="cverse3">{g}</span> able to deliver thee from the lions?</span><p>(g) This declares that Darius was not touched with the true knowledge of God, because he doubted of his power.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/daniel/6.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">20</span>. <span class="ital">when he came</span>] <span class="bld">as he drew near</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">with a lamentable voice</span>] or, <span class="ital">with a</span> <span class="bld">pained</span> <span class="ital">voice</span>.

A vision of the night is not necessarily to be identified with a dream. In the case before us, Daniel does not speak of a dream; and the idea that he had dreamed precisely the same dream as Nebuchadnezzar is arbitrarily imported into the text by Hitz. in order to gain a "psychological impossibility," and to be able to cast suspicion on the historical character of the narrative. It is possible, indeed, that dreams may be, as the means of a divine revelation, dream-visions, and as such may be called visions of the night (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/7-1.htm">Daniel 7:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13</a>); but in itself a vision of the night is a vision simply which any one receives during the night whilst he is awake.<p>(Note: "Dream and vision do not constitute two separate categories. The dream-image is a vision, the vision while awake is a dreaming - only that in the latter case the consciousness of the relation between the inner and the outer maintains itself more easily. Intermediate between the two stand the night-visions, which, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/4-13.htm">Job 4:13</a>, either having risen up before the spirit, fade away from the mind in after-thought, or, as in the case of Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-29.htm">Daniel 2:29</a>), are an image before the imagination into which the thoughts of the night run out. Zechariah saw a number of visions in one night, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/1-7.htm">Daniel 1:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/6-15.htm">Daniel 6:15</a>. Also these which, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/1-8.htm">Daniel 1:8</a>, are called visions of the night are not, as Ew. and Hitz. suppose, dream-images, but are waking perceptions in the night. Just because the prophet did not sleep, he says, <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/4.htm">Daniel 4</a>, 'The angel awaked me as one is awaked out of sleep.'" - Tholuck's Die Propheten, u.s.w., p. 52.)</body></html>
