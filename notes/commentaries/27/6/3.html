"Because an excellent spirit was in him." This may refer alike to his wisdom and his integrity - both of which would be necessary in such an office. It was an office of great difficulty and responsibility to manage the affairs of the empire in a proper manner, and required the talents of an accomplished statesman, and, at the same time, as it was an office where confidence was reposed by the sovereign, it demanded integrity. The word "excellent" (&#1497;&#1514;&#1497;&#1512;&#1488;  yatt&#305;&#770;yra&#770;') means, properly, what hangs over, or which is abundant, or more than enough, and then anything that is very great, excellent, pre-eminent. Latin Vulgate, Spiritus Dei amplior - "the spirit of God more abundantly." Greek &#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd;  pneuma perisson. It is not said here to what trial of his abilities and integrity Daniel was subjected before he was thus exalted, but it is not necessary to suppose that any such trial occurred at once, or immediately on the accession of Darius. Probably, as he was found in office as appointed by Belshazzar, he was continued by Darius, and as a result of his tried integrity was in due time exalted to the premiership. "And the king thought to set him over the whole realm."<p>The whole kingdom over which he presided, embracing Media, Persia, Babylonia, and all the dependent, conquered provinces. This shows that the princes referred to in <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/6-1.htm">Daniel 6:1</a>, were those which were appointed over Babylonia, since Daniel Dan 6:2 was already placed at the head of all these princes. Yet, in consequence of his talents and fidelity the king was meditating the important measure of placing him over the whole united kingdom as premier. That he should form such a purpose in regard to an officer so talented and faithful as Daniel was, is by no means improbable. The Greek of Theodotion renders this as if it were actually done - &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, &#x3ba;.&#x3c4;.&#x3bb;.  kai ho basileus kateste&#772;sen auton, etc. - "And the king placed him over all his kingdom." But the Chaldee (&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514;  'a&#774;sh&#305;&#770;yth) indicates rather a purpose or intention to do it; or rather, perhaps, that he was actually making arrangements to do this. Probably it was the fact that this design was perceived, and that the arrangements were actually commenced, that aroused the envy and the ill-will of his fellow-officers, and induced them to determine on his ruin. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/daniel/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. Daniel was preferred&#8212;probably because of his having so wonderfully foretold the fall of Babylon. Hence the very expression used by the queen mother on that occasion (Da 5:12) is here used, "because an excellent spirit was in him."<p>king thought to set him over the whole realm&#8212;Agreeing with Darius' character, weak and averse to business, which he preferred to delegate to favorites. God overruled this to the good both of Daniel, and, through him, of His people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/daniel/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> There were three things that made Darius greatly favour Daniel. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. Because he prophesied the destruction of Belshazzar and his reign, for which cause the king of Babylon favoured Jeremiah the prophet, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-11.htm" title="Now Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon gave charge concerning Jeremiah to Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, saying,">Jeremiah 39:11</a></span>, &c. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. Because he saw so noble a spirit in him, the spirit of the holy gods. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. Because Darius himself was old and unfit for government, and therefore took Daniel with him into Media, Joseph. Antiq. 10. 12, whereby the Lord by advancing Daniel made careful provision for his church. This was an act of great wisdom in Darius, to prefer men for their parts and merit, and to make them that have most of God in them to be their chief favourites; a thing rarely minded by the princes of the world, who usually favour them most that do most gratify their lusts. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/daniel/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then this Daniel was preferred above the presidents and princes,.... Not only above the princes, but the presidents, being the first of them, as before: or, "he was victorious above them" (y); he got more credit and applause than they did, being more exact, diligent, and laborious, faithful, and conscientious: <p>because an excellent spirit was in him; meaning not a spirit of grace, piety, and religion, which the Heathen king was no judge of, nor valued him for it, though it was in him; but a spirit of knowledge of civil affairs, and of prudence in managing them, and of integrity throughout the whole of his conduct: <p>and the king thought to set him over the whole realm; or, "wherefore the king thought" (z), &amp;c.; because there was such a spirit in him, which so qualified him for public business, he began to think of abolishing his triumvirate of presidents, and making Daniel his viceroy over the whole empire, which very probably they had got some knowledge of; and this, as well as being above them, drew the envy of them on him, and put them upon the following scheme. <p>(y) "victorem se gerebat", Piscator, Michaelis.

The &#1495;&#1512;&#1496;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, who were found also in Egypt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-24.htm">Genesis 41:24</a>). They are so named from &#1495;&#1512;&#1496;, a "stylus" - those who went about with the stylus, the priestly class of the &#x3b9;&#788;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2;, those learned in the sacred writings and in literature. 2. The &#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1508;&#1497;&#1501;, conjurers, from &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1507; or &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1507;, to breathe, to blow, to whisper; for they practised their incantations by movements of the breath, as is shown by the Arabic nft, flavit ut praestigiator in nexos a se nodos, incantavit, with which it is compared by Hitz. and Kran. 3. The &#1502;&#1499;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1508;&#1497;&#1501;, magicians, found also in Egypt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-11.htm">Exodus 7:11</a>), and, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/47-9.htm">Isaiah 47:9</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/47-12.htm">Isaiah 47:12</a>, a powerful body in Babylon. 4. The &#1499;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, the priest caste of the Chaldeans, who are named, <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/2-4.htm">Daniel 2:4</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/2-10.htm">Daniel 2:10</a>, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/1-4.htm">Daniel 1:4</a>, instar omnium as the most distinguished class among the Babylonian wise men. According to Herod. i. 171, and Diod. Sic. ii. 24, the Chaldeans appear to have formed the priesthood in a special sense, or to have attended to the duties specially devolving on the priests. This circumstance, that amongst an Aramaic people the priests in a stricter sense were called Chaldeans, is explained, as at p. 78, from the fact of the ancient supremacy of the Chaldean people in Babylonia.<p>Besides these four classes there is also a fifth, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-27.htm">Daniel 2:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-4.htm">Daniel 4:4</a> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-7.htm">Daniel 4:7</a>), <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/5-7.htm">Daniel 5:7</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/5-11.htm">Daniel 5:11</a>, called the &#1490;&#1468;&#1494;&#1512;&#1497;&#1503;, the astrologers, not haruspices, from &#1490;&#1468;&#1494;&#1512;, "to cut flesh to pieces," but the determiners of the &#1490;&#1468;&#1494;&#1512;&#1492;, the fatum or the fata, who announced events by the appearances of the heavens (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/47-13.htm">Isaiah 47:13</a>), the forecasters of nativities, horoscopes, who determined the fate of men from the position and the movement of the stars at the time of their birth. These different classes of the priests and the learned are comprehended, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-12.htm">Daniel 2:12</a>., under the general designation of &#1495;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1503; (cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-25.htm">Isaiah 44:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-35.htm">Jeremiah 50:35</a>), and they formed a &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;, i.e., collegium (Diod. Sic. ii. 31), under a president (&#1505;&#1490;&#1504;&#1497;&#1503; &#1512;&#1489;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-48.htm">Daniel 2:48</a>), who occupied a high place in the state; see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-48.htm">Daniel 2:48</a>. These separate classes busied themselves, without doubt, with distinct branches of the Babylonian wisdom. While each class cultivated a separate department, yet it was not exclusively, but in such a manner that the activities of the several classes intermingled in many ways. This is clearly seen from what is said of Daniel and his companions, that they were trained in all the wisdom of the Chaldeans (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/1-17.htm">Daniel 1:17</a>), and is confirmed by the testimony of Diod. Sic. (ii. 29), that the Chaldeans, who held almost the same place in the state that the priests in Egypt did, while applying themselves to the service of the gods, sought their greatest glory in the study of astrology, and also devoted themselves much to prophecy, foretelling future things, and by means of lustrations, sacrifices, and incantations seeking to turn away evil and to secure that which was good. They possessed the knowledge of divination from omens, of expounding of dreams and prodigies, and of skilfully casting horoscopes.<p>That he might receive an explanation of his dream, Nebuchadnezzar commanded all the classes of the priests and men skilled in wisdom to be brought before him, because in an event which was to him so weighty he must not only ascertain the facts of the case, but should the dream announce some misfortune, he must also adopt the means for averting it. In order that the correctness of the explanation of the dream might be ascertained, the stars must be examined, and perhaps other means of divination must be resorted to. The proper priests could by means of sacrifices make the gods favourable, and the conjurers and magicians by their arts endeavour to avert the threatened misfortune.</body></html>
