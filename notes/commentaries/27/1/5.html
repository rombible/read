From this first captivity, most think the seventy years are to be dated. It is the interest of princes to employ wise men; and it is their wisdom to find out and train up such. Nebuchadnezzar ordered that these chosen youths should be taught. All their Hebrew names had something of God in them; but to make them forget the God of their fathers, the Guide of their youth, the heathen gave them names that savoured of idolatry. It is painful to reflect how often public education tends to corrupt the principles and morals.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/daniel/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And the king appointed them - Calvin supposes that this arrangement was resorted to in order to render them effeminate, and, by a course of luxurious living, to induce them gradually to forget their own country, and that with the same view their names were changed. But there is no evidence that this was the object. The purpose was manifestly to train them in the manner in which it was supposed they would be best fitted, in bodily health, in personal beauty, and in intellectual attainments, to appear at court; and it was presumed that the best style of living which the realm furnished would conduce to this end. That the design was not to make them effeminate, is apparent from <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/1-15.htm">Daniel 1:15</a>.<p>A daily provision - Hebrew, "The thing of a day in his day;" that is, he assigned to them each day a portion of what had been prepared for the royal meal.

The object was to prepare them to give as much dignity and ornament to the court as possible.<p>That at the end thereof they might stand before the king - Notes, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/1-4.htm">Daniel 1:4</a>. On the arrangements made to bring forward these youths, the editor of the "Pictorial Bible" makes the following remarks, showing the correspondence between these arrangements and what usually occurs in the East: "There is not a single intimation which may not be illustrated from the customs of the Turkish seraglio until some alterations were made in this, as in other matters, by the present sultan (Mahmoud). The pages of the seraglio, and officers of the court, as well as the greater part of the public functionaries and governors of provinces, were originally Christian boys, taken captive in war, or bought or stolen in time of peace. The finest and most capable of these were sent to the palace, and, if accepted, were placed under the charge of the chief of the white eunuchs. The lads did not themselves become eunuchs; which we notice, because it has been erroneously inferred, that Daniel and the other Hebrew youths "must" have been made eunuchs, "because" they were committed to the care of the chief eunuch.<p>The accepted lads were brought up in the religion of their masters; and there were schools in the palace where they received such complete instruction in Turkish learning and science as it was the lot of few others to obtain. Among their accomplishments we find it mentioned, that the greatest pains were taken to teach them to speak the Turkish language (a foreign one to them) with the greatest purity, as spoken at court. Compare this with "Teach them the learning and tongue of the Chaldeans." The lads were clothed very neatly, and well, but temperately dieted. They slept in large chambers, where there were rows of beds. Every one slept separately; and between every third or fourth bed lay a white eunuch, who served as a sort of guard, and was bound to keep a careful eye upon the lads near him, and report his observations to his superior. When any of them arrived at a proper age, they were instructed in military exercises, and pains taken to make them active, robust, and brave.<p>Every one, also, according to the custom of the country, was taught some mechanical or liberal art, to serve him as a resource in adversity. When their education was completed in all its branches, those who had displayed the most capacity and valor were employed about the person of the king, and the rest given to the service of the treasury, and the other offices of the extensive establishment to which they belonged. In due time the more talented or successful young men got promoted to the various high court offices which gave them access to the private apartments of the seraglio, so that they at almost any time could see and speak to their great master. This advantage soon paved the way for their promotion to the government of provinces, and to military commands; and it has often happened that favorite court officers have stepped at once into the post of grand vizier, or chief minister, and other high offices of state, without having previously been abroad in the world as pashas and military commanders. How well this agrees to, and illustrates the usage of the Babylonian court, will clearly appear to the reader without particular indication.

Conv</span>. VII. iv. 5; Athen. iv. 26, p. 145 e, f.). The word rendered ‘delicacies’ (<span class="ital">pathbâg</span>) is a peculiar one, found in the O.T. only in Dan.: it is of Persian origin, and passed (like many other Persian words) into Syriac (Payne Smit[180] <span class="ital">Thes. Syr.</span> col. 3086 f.), as well as into late Hebrew. The Persian original would be <span class="ital">patibâga</span>, ‘offering,’ ‘tribute’ (from <span class="ital">pati</span>, Sanskr. <span class="ital">prati</span>, Greek <span class="greekheb">ποτί</span>, <span class="greekheb">προτί</span>, to, and <span class="ital">bâg</span>, tribute, Sk. <span class="ital">bhâga</span>, portion). The Sansk. <span class="ital">pratibhâga</span> actually occurs, and means ‘a share of small articles, as fruit, flowers, &c., paid daily to the Rája for household expenditure[181].’ The Pers. <span class="ital">patibâga</span> originally, no doubt, denoted similarly choice food offered to the king[182], though in Heb. and Syriac <span class="ital">pathbâg</span> was used more widely of <span class="ital">choice food</span>, or <span class="ital">delicacies</span>, in general. The word recurs in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/1-8.htm" title="But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself.">Daniel 1:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/1-13.htm" title="Then let our countenances be looked on before you, and the countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king's meat: and as you see, deal with your servants.">Daniel 1:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/daniel/1-15.htm" title="And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the king's meat....">Daniel 1:15-16</a></span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-26.htm" title="And after three score and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off, but not for himself: and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary; and the end thereof shall be with a flood, and to the end of the war desolations are determined.">Daniel 9:26</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[180] yne Smith R.

The only thing to be noticed in the LXX. Version of this verse is the fact that <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> is taken to mean "give a portion" - a meaning which seems to be implied in <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-10.htm">Nehemiah 8:10</a>), hence the translation <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x2e;&#x2e;&#x2e;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>.

The mysterious <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x5be;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5d2;</span> (<span class="accented">path-bag</span>), translated "meat," has caused differences of rendering. The Syriac Peshitta transfers it. Professor Bevan speaks as if it were common in Syriac, but Castell gives no reference beyond Daniel. (Brockei-mann adds, Ephrem Syrus, Isaac Antiochenus, Bar Hebraeus). It is to be observed that the Syriac form of the word has <span class="accented">teth</span>, not <span class="accented">tan</span>, for the second radical. This is a change that would not likely take place had the Hebrew form been the original, whereas from the fact that <span class="accented">path</span> means in Hebrew "a portion," if the Hebrew were derived from the Syriac the change would be intelligible. It is confounded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/11-26.htm">Daniel 11:26</a> with <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> (<span class="accented">pathura</span>), "a table." It seems not improbable that both the LXX. and Theodotion read <span class="accented">pathura.</span> The word <span class="accented">path-bag</span> does not seem to have been known in Palestine; it does not occur in Chaldee, but does in Syriac. This is intelligible if the chapter before us is condensation from a Syriac original rendered into Hebrew: the word <span class="accented">path-bag</span>, being unintelligible, is transferred. The etymology of the word is alleged to be Persian, but on this assumption it is a matter of dispute what that etymology is. One derivation is from <span class="accented">pad</span> or fad, "father" or "prince," or <span class="accented">pat</span> or <span class="accented">fat</span>, idol,' and <span class="accented">bag</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1ff6;</span>), food; another is from <span class="accented">pati-bhagu</span>, "a portion." The question is complicated by the fact that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-7.htm">Ezekiel 25:7</a> we have in the K'tbib <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5d2;</span> (bag), meaning "food." In that case <span class="accented">path-bag</span> would mean "a portion of food." The reading of the K'thib is not supported by the versions. In Daniel the word simply means "food," such as was supplied to the king's table. We see in the slabs from the palace of  Kou-youn-jik the nature of a royal feast. Animal food predominated. We cannot avoid referring to a singular argumentative axiom implied in all the <span class="accented">discussions</span> on Daniel. Critics seem to think that when they prove that certain words in Daniel are Persian, they thus prove Daniel was written nearly a couple of centuries after the Persian domination had disappeared. <span class="accented">Of the wine which he drank.</span> It is to be noted that there is a restriction. The wine supplied was the wine which the king drank - wine of which an oblation had been offered to idols. In thus bringing up hostages at his own table, Nebuchadnezzar was following a practice which has continued down to our own day. The son of Theodore of Magdala was brought up at the court of our queen. It was the regular practice, as we know, in Imperial Rome. Sennacherib speaks of Belibus, whom he made deputy-king in Babylon, as brought up "as a little dog at his table" (Bellino Cylinder, Sehrader, vol. 2. p. 32, Engl, trans.). <span class="accented">So nourishing them three years.</span> This was the period during which the education of a Persian youth was continued. It is probable, as we have seen, that these youths were about sixteen or seventeen. At the end of three years they would still be very young. The grammatical connection of the word <span class="accented">legaddelam is</span> somewhat singular. The Septuagint reading probably had the first word in this verse in the infinitive also. This is more grammatical, as it brings the whole under the regimen of the opening clause of ver. 3. The force of the word before us is represented in "bringing up." The verb in its simple form means "to be strong," "to be great," hence in the intensive form before us, "to make great," "to bring up." <span class="accented">That at the end thereof they might stand before the king.</span> "Standing before the king" means usually becoming members of the council of the monarch, but in the present instance this does not seem to be the meaning. They were to be presented before the king, and in his presence they were to be examined. They were, then, possibly to be admitted into the college of astrologers and soothsayers, but only in lowly grade. Irrespective of the fact that they would at the latest be twenty or twenty-one when this season of education was over, an(t, even making all allowance for Eastern precocity, this is too young an age for being a member of a royal privy council. But the next chapter relates an event which appears to be the occasion when they stood before the king, for they were not summoned with the wise men to the king's presence to interpret his dream. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/44.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Requisites for the Administration of the Priests' Office, and the Obligations and Privileges of that Office. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-17.htm">Ezekiel 44:17</a>.

The meat-offering, and the sin-offering, and the trespass-offering, these shall they eat, and everything banned in Israel shall belong to them. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-30.htm">Ezekiel 44:30</a>. And the firstlings of all the first-fruits of everything, and every heave-offering of everything, of all your heave-offerings, shall belong to the priests; and the firstlings of all your ground meal shall ye give to the priest, that a blessing may come down upon thy house. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-31.htm">Ezekiel 44:31</a>. No carrion nor anything torn in pieces of fowl and of beast shall the priests eat. - To the directions, who are to perform the service in the new temple, there are appended corresponding instructions concerning the bodily condition in which this service is to be performed, as the bodily condition shadows forth the state of the soul, or the spiritual constitution of the servants of God. The dress prescribed in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/28.htm">Exodus 28</a> for the priests to wear during the holy service had this signification. The same rule is here presupposed as still in force; and it is simply renewed and partially emphasized by the enumeration of some of the leading points. At the service at the altar and in the holy place the priests are to wear linen clothes, and, after the performance of the service, they are to take them off again when they go into the outer court (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-17.htm">Ezekiel 44:17-19</a>). In the Mosaic law, &#1513;&#1473;&#1513;&#1473;, white byssus, or &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;, white linen, is mentioned as the material used for the priests' clothing (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/28-39.htm">Exodus 28:39</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-42.htm">Exodus 28:42</a>); here the material is more distinctly designated as &#1508;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, flax linen; and &#1510;&#1502;&#1512;, animal wool, is expressly forbidden, the motive being assigned for this regulation, namely, that the priest is not to cause himself to sweat by wearing woollen clothing. Sweat produces uncleanness; and the priest, by keeping his body clean, is to show even outwardly that he is clean and blameless. With regard to the putting on and off of the official clothes, the new thorah accords with the Mosaic. For we cannot agree with Kliefoth, who detects a deviation in the fact that, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/28-43.htm">Exodus 28:43</a>, the priests were to wear the official clothes only when they entered the tabernacle and when approaching the altar, and, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-4.htm">Leviticus 6:4</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-23.htm">Leviticus 16:23</a>, were to take them off when the service was ended; whereas, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-17.htm">Ezekiel 44:17</a> of the chapter before us, they were to put them on as soon as they entered the inner court, and were never to come before the people in the official costume. If, according to the Mosaic law, the priests were to go before the altar of burnt-offering in the court in their holy official dress, and not otherwise, they must have put on this dress on entering the court; for they could not wait till they were in front of the altar before they changed their clothes. For the expression &#1510;&#1488;&#1514; &#1488;&#1500; &#1492;&#1506;&#1501; does not imply that, according to Ezekiel, they were never to appear in the presence of the people in their official costume, as it does not mean "come before the people," but "go out to the people," or "walk among the people;" nor is this involved in the words '&#1493;&#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468; , they shall not sanctify the people in their clothes (by their clothes). The latter by no means affirms that they are to sanctify the people by intercourse with them, but are not to do this in official costume; the meaning is simply that they are not to move among the people in the outer court while wearing their official clothes, that they may not sanctify them by their holy clothes.<p>This sanctification cannot be understood in any other way than as analogous to the rule laid down in the law, that touching most holy sacrificial flesh would sanctify (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-11.htm">Leviticus 6:11</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-20.htm">Leviticus 6:20</a>), which Ezekiel repeats in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-20.htm">Ezekiel 46:20</a>, and which does not stand in anything like an isolated position in the law, but is also affirmed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-37.htm">Exodus 29:37</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-29.htm">Exodus 30:29</a> of the altar of burnt-offering and the vessels of the sanctuary. The same thing which applied to these vessels - namely, that their holiness passed from them to any one who touched them - is here predicated of the holy dresses of the priests; and the moving of the priests among the people in their holy clothes is forbidden, because such holiness, acquired by contact with holy objects, imposed upon the person to whom it had passed the obligation to guard against all defilement (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/21-1.htm">Leviticus 21:1-8</a>), which the people could not avoid in the ordinary relations of life, and thus a weakening or abolition of the distinction between things holy and common would inevitably have ensued. &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1493;&#1514; &#1492;&#1511;&#1468;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473; are the holy cell-buildings described in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-1.htm">Ezekiel 42:1-14</a>. - To the clothing there is simply appended in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-20.htm">Ezekiel 44:20</a> the direction concerning the hair of the head, the natural covering of the head, in relation to which excess on either side is prohibited, either shaving the head bald or wearing the hair uncut. Both of these were forbidden to the priests in the law: shaving in <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/21-5.htm">Leviticus 21:5</a>, and letting the hair grow freely in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-6.htm">Leviticus 10:6</a>; and the latter was simply imposed upon the Nazarites for the period of their vow (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/6-5.htm">Numbers 6:5</a>). &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1501; only occurs here; but its meaning, to cut the hair, is obvious from the context. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-21.htm">Ezekiel 44:21</a>. The prohibition of the drinking of wine when performing service agrees with <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-9.htm">Leviticus 10:9</a>; on the other hand, the instructions concerning the choice of wives are sharpened in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-22.htm">Ezekiel 44:22</a>, as that which only applied to the high priest in the law is here extended to all the priests. In fact, Ezekiel throughout makes no distinction between the high priest and the common priests. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/21-14.htm">Leviticus 21:14</a>, marrying a widow is only forbidden to the high priest, who was to marry a virgin of his own people, whereas no such restriction is laid down for the ordinary priests. Here, on the other hand, marrying a widow is forbidden to all the priests, marriage with the widow of a priest being the only one allowed. &#1502;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492;&#1503; belongs to &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492;, who has become the widow of a priest.<p>(Note: The Rabbins (Targ. Talm. and Masor. according to their accentuation) have endeavoured to obliterate this distinction, by applying the first hemistich to the high priest alone, and explaining the second thus: "The widow, who is really a widow, the priest may take," interpreting &#1502;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492;&#1503; by quidam sacerdotum, or aliqui ex ordine sacerdotali, or ceteri sacerdotes. But this is contrary to the usage of the language, as &#1502;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492;&#1503; cannot possibly be understood in a partitive sense in this passage, where the priests generally are spoken of, and the plural &#1497;&#1511;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468; follows.)<p>In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-23.htm">Ezekiel 44:23</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-24.htm">Ezekiel 44:24</a> the general official duties of the priests are mentioned, viz., to teach the people, and to instruct them concerning the difference between the holy and the unholy, the clean and the unclean, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-10.htm">Leviticus 10:10</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-10.htm">Deuteronomy 33:10</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-26.htm">Ezekiel 22:26</a>); also to administer justice in questions in dispute according to the rights of God-a duty which had already been committed to the priests in its highest form in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-8.htm">Deuteronomy 17:8</a>., <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-17.htm">Deuteronomy 19:17</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-5.htm">Deuteronomy 21:5</a>. &#1506;&#1500; &#1512;&#1497;&#1489;, concerning, in the case of, matters in dispute. &#1506;&#1502;&#1491; , to stand to judge, i.e., to appear or act as judge (compare &#1492;&#1506;&#1502;&#1497;&#1491; &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1496;&#1497;&#1501;, to appoint or institute judges, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/19-5.htm">2 Chronicles 19:5</a>). The Keri &#1500;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496; is a needless emendation after <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/19-8.htm">2 Chronicles 19:8</a>. The Chetib &#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1496;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;, on the other hand, is a copyist's error for &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1496;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;. Lastly, at all the feasts they are to observe the laws and statutes of Jehovah, that is to say, to perform all the priestly duties binding upon them at the feasts, and to sanctify the Sabbaths, not merely by offering the Sabbath sacrifices, but also by maintaining the Sabbath rest (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-3.htm">Leviticus 23:3</a>). - In <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-25.htm">Ezekiel 44:25-27</a> there follow regulations concerning defilement from the dead, and its removal. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-25.htm">Ezekiel 44:25</a> is a simple repetition of <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/21-1.htm">Leviticus 21:1-3</a>. But the instructions concerning the purification from defilement from the dead are sharpened, inasmuch as not only is the purification prescribed by the law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/19-1.htm">Numbers 19:1</a>.), and which lasted seven days, required (this is meant by &#1496;&#1492;&#1512;&#1514;&#1493;), but a further period of seven days is appointed after these, at the expiration of which the presentation of a sin-offering is demanded before the service in the sanctuary can be resumed. By this demand for a heightened purification, the approach to a corpse permitted to the priests, which was prohibited to the high priest in the Mosaic law, even in the case of father and mother (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/21-11.htm">Leviticus 21:11</a>), is tolerably equalized.<p>For these duties and obligations of service the priests are to receive corresponding emoluments. These are treated of in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-28.htm">Ezekiel 44:28-31</a>. They are not, indeed, to receive any share of the land as their property in time to come any more than in former times; but in the place of this Jehovah will be their property and possession, and give them the necessary room for their dwellings from His own property in the land (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-4.htm">Ezekiel 45:4</a>), and let them draw their maintenance from His altar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-29.htm">Ezekiel 44:29</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-30.htm">Ezekiel 44:30</a>). The promise that Jehovah will be the &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1492; and &#1488;&#1495;&#1494;&#1468;&#1492; of the priests is a simple repetition of the regulation in the law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-20.htm">Numbers 18:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-1.htm">Deuteronomy 18:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-9.htm">Deuteronomy 10:9</a>). So far as the construction in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-28.htm">Ezekiel 44:28</a> is concerned, the words &#1488;&#1504;&#1497; &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1514;&#1501; are really the subject to '&#1493;&#1492;&#1497;&#1514;&#1492; &#1500;&#1492;&#1501; &#1500;&#1503;, which we are obliged to render obliquely, "the inheritance for them shall be, I am their inheritance." For the proposal of Hitzig to take the words from &#1488;&#1504;&#1497; &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1514;&#1501; to the close of the verse as a parenthesis, and to regard '&#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1504;&#1495;&#1492; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-29.htm">Ezekiel 44:29</a> as the subject to '&#1493;&#1492;&#1497;&#1514;&#1492;, is untenable, not only on account of the great harshness which such a parenthesis would involve, but principally because these portions of the sacrifices and heave-offerings which belonged to the priest were not a &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1492;, and are never designated as &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1492;, inheritance, i.e., property in land. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-28.htm">Ezekiel 44:28</a> treats of the property in land, which God assigned to the Levites and priests under the Mosaic economy, by appointing them towns to dwell in, with meadows for the feeding of their cattle, within the territory of the other tribes, but would assign to them in future from the heave-offering set apart from the land for the sanctuary (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-4.htm">Ezekiel 45:4</a>). It is not till <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-29.htm">Ezekiel 44:29</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-30.htm">Ezekiel 44:30</a> that the means of support for the priests are spoken of. They are to be supported from the sacrifices and the tithes and first-fruits which Israel has to pay to Jehovah as the lord of the land, and which He transfers to His servants the priests. For the priests' share of the meat-offering, sin-offering, and trespass-offering, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-3.htm">Leviticus 2:3</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-9.htm">Leviticus 6:9</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-11.htm">Leviticus 6:11</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-19.htm">Leviticus 6:19</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-6.htm">Leviticus 7:6-7</a>; for that which is put under the ban, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/27-21.htm">Leviticus 27:21</a>; for the first-fruits, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-19.htm">Exodus 23:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-26.htm">Exodus 34:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-4.htm">Deuteronomy 18:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-13.htm">Numbers 18:13</a>; for the &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/15-19.htm">Numbers 15:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-19.htm">Numbers 18:19</a>; for the &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514; &#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1505;&#1493;&#1514;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/15-20.htm">Numbers 15:20-21</a>. In '&#1500;&#1492;&#1504;&#1497;&#1495;, "to cause a blessing to rest upon thy house," the individual Israelite is addressed. For the fact itself, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-10.htm">Malachi 3:10</a>. - To the enumeration of the means of support there is appended in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-31.htm">Ezekiel 44:31</a> an emphatic repetition of the command in <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/22-8.htm">Leviticus 22:8</a>, not to eat of any dead thing (i.e., anything that has died a natural death), or anything torn to pieces, either of birds or beasts, on account of its defiling (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/17-15.htm">Leviticus 17:15</a>). </body></html>
