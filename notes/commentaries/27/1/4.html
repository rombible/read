So elaborate a system of science as the Babylonian, whether theological, astronomical, or magical, would naturally require an early training. It is reasonable to suppose that these “children” were quite young. So much may be inferred from Nebuchadnezzar’s amazement at what he considered to be Daniel’s precocious genius (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-26.htm" title="The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, Are you able to make known to me the dream which I have seen, and the interpretation thereof?">Daniel 2:26</a>).<p><span class= "bld">To stand,</span> <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> to act as courtiers or servants.

Many more examples may be seen in the British Museum, and among them the large treatise on magic, which originally consisted of no less than two hundred tablets. It appears, from comparing this with <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/1-19.htm" title="And the king communed with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: therefore stood they before the king.">Daniel 1:19</a>, that some form of examination was held by the king, before he admitted the courtiers into his immediate service. The language of Chaldæa at this time was Semitic; but there was a sacred language in use besides, which probably belonged to the Turanian family. In both these languages was Daniel educated.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:1-7 Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, in the first year of his reign, took Jerusalem, and carried whom and what he pleased away. From this first captivity, most think the seventy years are to be dated. It is the interest of princes to employ wise men; and it is their wisdom to find out and train up such. Nebuchadnezzar ordered that these chosen youths should be taught. All their Hebrew names had something of God in them; but to make them forget the God of their fathers, the Guide of their youth, the heathen gave them names that savoured of idolatry. It is painful to reflect how often public education tends to corrupt the principles and morals.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/daniel/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Children in whom was no blemish - The word rendered "children" in this place (&#1497;&#1500;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501;  yela&#770;d&#305;&#770;ym) is different from that which is rendered "children" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-3.htm">Job 1:3</a> - &#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;  ba&#770;nn&#305;&#770;ym). That word denotes merely that they were "sons," or "descendants," of Israel, without implying anything in regard to their age; the word here used would be appropriate only to those who were at an early period of life, and makes it certain that the king meant that those who were selected should be youths. Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/4-23.htm">Genesis 4:23</a>, where the word is rendered "a young man." It is sometimes, indeed, used to denote a son, without reference to age, and is then synonymous with &#1489;&#1503;  be&#770;n, a "son." But it properly means "one born;" that is, "recently born;" a child, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/21-8.htm">Genesis 21:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/1-17.htm">Exodus 1:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/2-3.htm">Exodus 2:3</a>; and then one in early life. There can be no doubt that the monarch meant to designate youths. So the Vulgate, pueros, and the Greek, &#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;  neaniskous, and so the Syriac. All these words would be applicable to those who were in early life, or to young men. Compare Introduction to Daniel, Section I. The word "blemish" refers to bodily defect or imperfection. The object was to select those who were most perfect in form, perhaps partly because it was supposed that beautiful youths would most grace the court, and partly because it was supposed that such would be likely to have the brightest intellectual endowments. It was regarded as essential to personal beauty to be without blemish, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-25.htm">2 Samuel 14:25</a> : "But in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for beauty; from the sole of Iris foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him." Sol 4:7 : "thou art all fair, my love; there is no spot in thee." The word is sometimes used in a moral sense, to denote corruption of heart or life <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-5.htm">Deuteronomy 32:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/11-15.htm">Job 11:15</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/31-7.htm">Job 31:7</a>, but that is not the meaning here.<p>But well-favored - Hebrew, "good of appearance;" that is, beautiful.<p>And skillful in all wisdom - Intelligent, wise - that is, in all that was esteemed wise in their own country. The object was to bring forward the most talented and intelligent, as well as the most beautiful, among the Hebrew captives.<p>And cunning in knowledge - In all that could be known. The distinction between the word here rendered "knowledge" (&#1491;&#1506;&#1514;  da&#8219;ath) and the word rendered "science" (&#1502;&#1491;&#1506;  madda&#770;&#8219;) is not apparent. Both come from the word &#1497;&#1491;&#1506;  ya&#770;da&#8219;  to "know," and would be applicable to any kind of knowledge. The word rendered "cunning" is also derived from the same root, and means "knowing," or "skilled in." We more commonly apply the word to a particular kind of knowledge, meaning artful, shrewd, astute, sly, crafty, designing. But this was not the meaning of the word when the translation of the Bible was made, and it is not employed in that sense in the Scriptures. It is always used in a good sense, meaning intelligent, skillful, experienced, well-instructed. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-27.htm">Genesis 25:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/26-1.htm">Exodus 26:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-15.htm">Exodus 28:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/38-23.htm">Exodus 38:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-16.htm">1 Samuel 16:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/25-7.htm">1 Chronicles 25:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/137-5.htm">Psalm 137:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-3.htm">Isaiah 3:3</a>.<p>And understanding science - That is, the sciences which prevailed among the Hebrews. They were not a nation distinguished for "science," in the sense in which that term is now commonly understood - embracing astronomy, chemistry, geology, mathematics, electricity, etc.; but their science extended chiefly to music, architecture, natural history, agriculture, morals, theology, war, and the knowledge of future events; in all which they occupied an honorable distinction among the nations. In many of these respects they were, doubtless, far in advance of the Chaldeans; and it was probably the purpose of the Chaldean monarch to avail himself of what they knew.<p>And such as had ability in them to stand in the king's palace - Hebrew, "had strength" - &#1499;&#1495;  ko&#770;ach. Properly meaning, who had strength of body for the service which would be required of them in attending on the court. "A firm constitution of body is required for those protracted services of standing in the hall of the royal presence." - Grotius. The word "palace" here (&#1492;&#1497;&#1499;&#1500;  he&#770;yka&#770;l) is commonly used to denote the temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-13.htm">2 Kings 24:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/3-17.htm">2 Chronicles 3:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-28.htm">Jeremiah 50:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/2-15.htm">Haggai 2:15</a>. Its proper and primitive signification, however, is a large and magnificent building - a palace - and it was given to the temple as the "palace" of Jehovah, the abode where he dwelt as king of his people.<p>And whom they might teach - That they might be better qualified for the duties to which they might be called. The purpose was, doubtless (see analysis), to bring forward their talent, that it might contribute to the splendor of the Chaldean court; but as they were, doubtless, ignorant to a great extent of the language of the Chaldeans, and as there were sciences in which the Chaldeans were supposed to excel, it seemed desirable that they should have all the advantage which could be delayed from a careful training under the best masters.<p>The learning -  - &#1505;&#1508;&#1512;  se&#770;pher. literally, "writing" <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-11.htm">Isaiah 29:11-12</a>. Gesenius supposes that this means the "writing" of the Chaldeans; or that they might be able to read the language of the Chaldeans. But it, doubtless, included "the knowledge" of what was written, as well as the ability "to read" what was written; that is, the purpose was to instruct them in the sciences which were understood among the Chaldeans. They were distinguished chiefly for such sciences as these:<p>(1) Astronomy. This science is commonly supposed to have had its orion on the plains of Babylon, and it was early carried there to as high a degree of perfection as it attained in any of the ancient nations. Their mild climate, and their employment as shepherds, leading them to pass much of their time at night under the open heavens, gave them the opportunity of observing the stars, and they amused themselves in marking their positions and their changes, and in mapping out the heavens in a variety of fanciful figures, now called constellations.<p>(2) Astrology. This was at first a branch of astronomy, or was almost identical with it, for the stars were studied principally to endeavor to ascertain what influence they exerted over the fates of men, and especially what might be predicted from their position, on the birth of an individual, as to his future life. Astrology was then deemed a science whose laws were to be ascertained in the same way as the laws of any other science; and the world has been slow to disabuse itself of the notion that the stars exert an influence over the fates of men. Even Lord Bacon held that it was a science to be "reformed," not wholly rejected.<p>(3) Magic; soothsaying; divination; or whatever would contribute to lay open the future, or disclose the secrets of the invisible world. Hence, they applied themselves to the interpretation of dreams; they made use of magical arts, probably employing, as magicians do, some of the ascertained results of science in producing optical illusions, impressing the common with the belief that they were familiar with the secrets of the invisible world; and hence, the name "Chaldean" and "magician" became almost synonymous terms <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-2.htm">Daniel 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-7.htm">Daniel 4:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/5-7.htm">Daniel 5:7</a>.<p>(4) It is not improbable that they had made advances in other sciences, but of this we have little knowledge. They knew little of the true laws of astronomy, geology, cheministry, electricity, mathematics; and in these, and in kindred departments of science, they may be supposed to have been almost wholly ignorant.<p>And the tongue of the Chaldeans - In regard to the "Chaldeans," see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-17.htm">Job 1:17</a>; and the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/23-13.htm">Isaiah 23:13</a>. The kingdom of Babylon was composed mainly of Chaldeans, and that kingdom was called "the realm of the Chaldeans" <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-1.htm">Daniel 9:1</a>. Of that realm, or kingdom, Babylon was the capital. The origin of the Chaldeans has been a subject of great perplexity, on which there is still a considerable variety of opinions. According to Heeren, they came from the North; by Gesenius they are supposed to have come from the mountains of Kurdistan; and by Michaelis, from the steppes of Scythia. They seem to have been an extended race, and probably occupied the whole of the region adjacent to what became Babylonia. Heeren expresses his opinion as to their origin in the following language: "It cannot be doubted that, at some remote period, antecedent to the commencement of historical records. "one mighty race" possessed these vast plains, varying in character according to the country which they inhabited; in the deserts of Arabia, pursuing a nomad life; in Syria, applying themselves to agriculture, and taking up settled abodes; in Babylonia, erecting the most magnificent cities of ancient times; and in Phoenicia, opening the earliest ports, and constructing fleets, which secured to them the commerce of the known world."<p>There exists at the present time, in the vicinity of the Bahrein Islands, and along the Persian Gulf, in the neighborhood of the Astan River, an Arab tribe, of the name of the "Beni Khaled," who are probably the same people as the "Gens Chaldei" of Pliny, and doubtless the descendants of the ancient race of the Chaldeans. On the question when they became a kingdom, or realm, making Babylon their capital, see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/23-13.htm">Isaiah 23:13</a>. Compare, for an interesting discussion of the subject, "Forster's Historical Geography of Arabia," vol. i. pp. 49-56. The language of the Chaldeans, in which a considerable part of the book of Daniel is written (see the Introduction Section IV., III.), differed from the Hebrew, though it was a branch of the same Aramean family of languages. It was, indeed, very closely allied to the Hebrew, but was so different that those who were acquainted with only one of the two languages could not understand the other. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-8.htm">Nehemiah 8:8</a>. Both were the offspring of the original Shemitish language. This original language may be properly reduced to three great branches:<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/daniel/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. no blemish&#8212;A handsome form was connected, in Oriental ideas, with mental power.

That the heathen lore was not altogether valueless appears from the Egyptian magicians who opposed Moses; the Eastern Magi who sought Jesus, and who may have drawn the tradition as to the "King of the Jews" from Da 9:24, &c., written in the East. As Moses was trained in the learning of the Egyptian sages, so Daniel in that of the Chaldeans, to familiarize his mind with mysterious lore, and so develop his heaven-bestowed gift of understanding in visions (Da 1:4, 5, 17).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/daniel/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> If the princes are so curious in their choice, no marvel that God was cautious in his, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/21-17.htm" title="Speak to Aaron, saying, Whoever he be of your seed in their generations that has any blemish, let him not approach to offer the bread of his God....">Leviticus 21:17-21</a> 22:20-25</span>.

And although their magi or wise men did at last degenerate into curious and vain arts, yet Daniel had no further design to know their wisdom than to choose the good of it, and to shun and reject that which was unlawful. The Chaldean tongue differed from the Hebrew in dialect and in pronunciation, which they learned in the right tone and accent, that they might be the more acceptable to the king and court, by their conformity in garb, language, and manners; for which they had the space of three years allotted them. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/daniel/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Children in whom was no blemish,.... Not mere children, but young men of fifteen or twenty years of age; about which age Daniel is by Aben Ezra supposed to be when he was carried captive; and less than this be cannot well be thought to be, since, in a few years after, he was put into posts of the greatest eminence and importance: such were ordered to be selected that had no deformity or defect in any parts of their body, or wanted any, as an eye, or a hand, &amp;c.; or, "in whom was not anything" (h); vicious or immoral, or scandalous in their character: <p>but well favoured; of a good complexion, a ruddy countenance, and a healthful look. So Curtius (i) says, that, in all barbarous or uncivilized countries, the stateliness and size of the body is had in great veneration; nor do they think any capable of great services or actions, to whom nature has not vouchsafed to give a beautiful form and aspect. And Aristotle (k) says it was reported, that, in Ethiopia, civil offices of government or magistracy were distributed according to the bulk or beauty of men, the largeness and tallness of their bodies, or the comeliness of them; and not only among them, but this has always been the custom of the eastern nations, to choose such for their principal officers, or to wait on princes and great personages, and continues to this day. Sir Paul Ricaut (l) observes, <p>"that the youths that are designed for the great offices of the Turkish empire must be of admirable features and pleasing looks, well shaped in their bodies, and without any defects of nature; for it is conceived that a corrupt and sordid soul can scarce inhabit in a serene and ingenious aspect; and (says he) I have observed not only in the seraglio, but also in the courts of great men, their personal attendants have been of comely lusty youths well habited, deporting themselves with singular modesty and respect in the presence of their masters: so that when a pascha, aga, spahee, travels, he is always attended with a comely equipage, followed by flourishing youths, well clothed, and mounted in great numbers; that one may guess at the greatness of this empire by the retinue, pomp, and number of servants, which accompany persons of quality in their journeys.'' <p>And no doubt Nebuchadnezzar had some of these ends in view, in ordering such persons to be selected and brought up at his expense; that they might be both for service and usefulness, and for his grandeur and glory. <p>And skilful in all wisdom: in the wisdom of the Jews, or had a liberal education according to the custom of their country; or were young men of good capacities, capable of being instructed, and of improving themselves in all kind of wisdom: <p>and cunning in knowledge; or "knowing knowledge" (m); having a large share of the knowledge of their own country, customs, and laws, civil and religious: and understanding science; the liberal arts and sciences; or however were persons of a good genius, and of retentive memories; young men of capacity, diligence, industry, and application, and of great docility, and so very promising to make great and useful men: <p>and such as had ability in them to stand in the king's palace; not only strength of body, which was requisite to a long waiting there, as sometimes they were obliged to do; but strength of mind, courage, and undauntedness, to stand before the king and his nobles, without showing a rustic fear, and timidity of mind: <p>and whom they might teach the learning and tongue of the Chaldeans; or, "the book and language of the Chaldeans" (n); book for books; such as contained their literature, history, and philosophy, mathematics, the knowledge of the stars, in which they excelled, as well as architecture and military skill; and it was necessary they should learn the Chaldean language, which differed from the Hebrew chiefly in dialect and pronunciation, that they might be able to read those books of science, and to speak with a good accent, and readily, before the king and his nobles; or rather the sense is, that they might understand the Chaldean language, the manner of reading, writing, and pronouncing it  translated "learning", may signify the letters of the language, the Scripture or manner of writing, as Saadiah and Aben Ezra interpret it; which must be first learned in any language, in order to attain the knowledge of it; so it seems to be used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-12.htm">Isaiah 19:12</a>. "I am not learned, or know not a book or letters" see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-15.htm">John 7:15</a> and  translated "tongue", may signify the rules, idioms, and properties of the language; the nature, genius, and dialect of it, and signification of the words and phrases used in it to be learned, so as to be thorough masters of it, understand it, speak it, and pronounce it well. But here a difficulty arises, since the form and character of the letters of the Chaldee and Hebrew languages now in use are the same; it may seem unnecessary that Hebrew youths should be put to school to learn the Chaldean letters and language, though the dialect and idioms of the two languages might in some things differ; but let it be observed, that it might be, and it is not improbable, that the letters of the Chaldean language were not the same then as they are now; and Hottinger (o) expressly says, that the ancient Chaldee character is not known; not to say anything of the difference of the Hebrew letters then from what they are now, which some have surmised: besides, it is a clear case that the Chaldee and Syriac languages are the same, as appears from <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/2-4.htm">Daniel 2:4</a>, where the Chaldeans are said to speak to the king in Syriac; and yet, what follows is no other than Chaldee, their mother tongue, in which it was most proper and agreeable to speak to the king: and as it is the opinion of many learned men now that these languages are the same, so it was the sense of the ancient Jews. Says R. Samuel Bar Nachman (p), let not the Syriac language be mean in thine eyes, or lightly esteemed by thee; for in the law, in the prophets, and in the Hagiographa, the holy blessed God has imparted honour to it; in the law, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/31-47.htm">Genesis 31:47</a>, in the prophets, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-11.htm">Jeremiah 10:11</a>, in the Hagiographa, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-4.htm">Daniel 2:4</a> in all which places it is the Chaldee language that is used; and that which was spoken in Babylon, the head of the Chaldean empire, is called the Syriac; for Cyrus, when he took that city, ordered a proclamation to be made, by men skilled,  in the Syriac language, that the inhabitants should keep within doors, and that those that were found without should be slain (q); which orders were published in that language, that they might be universally understood, being the language of the common people. So Herodotus, speaking of the Assyrians, says (r), these by the Greeks are called Syrians, and by the barbarians Assyrians, among whom were the Chaldeans: and, as Strabo observes (s), the same language or dialect was used by those without Euphrates, and by those within; that is, by the Syrians, strictly so called, and by the Babylonians or Chaldeans: and elsewhere (t), the name of Syrians reached from Babylon to Sinus Issicus; and, formerly, from thence to the Euxine sea. Now it is certain that the form and character of the letters in the Syriac language are very different from the Hebrew, and difficult to be learned, and might be those which these Hebrew youths were to be taught at school, as well as the rudiments of it; and it is as evident that the language of the Jews, and that of the Syrians, Chaldeans, and Babylonians, were so different, that the common people of the former did not understand the language of the latter when spoke, as appears from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-26.htm">2 Kings 18:26</a> so that there was an apparent necessity for the one to be taught the language of the other, in order to understand it. <p>(h) "quidquam quod obstet", Gussetius.

The word has the same sense elsewhere in the Book of Daniel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-2.htm" title="Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the astrologers, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, for to show the king his dreams.

The literature on the subjects named is what is referred to in the present verse. The ‘tongue of the Chaldeans’ would be Babylonian, a Semitic language, but very different from Hebrew, so that it would have to be specially studied by a Jew. Many of the magical texts preserved in the cuneiform script are also written in the non-Semitic Sumerian (or ‘Accadian’); but it is hardly likely that the distinction between these two languages was present to the author.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/44.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Requisites for the Administration of the Priests' Office, and the Obligations and Privileges of that Office. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-17.htm">Ezekiel 44:17</a>.

No carrion nor anything torn in pieces of fowl and of beast shall the priests eat. - To the directions, who are to perform the service in the new temple, there are appended corresponding instructions concerning the bodily condition in which this service is to be performed, as the bodily condition shadows forth the state of the soul, or the spiritual constitution of the servants of God. The dress prescribed in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/28.htm">Exodus 28</a> for the priests to wear during the holy service had this signification. The same rule is here presupposed as still in force; and it is simply renewed and partially emphasized by the enumeration of some of the leading points. At the service at the altar and in the holy place the priests are to wear linen clothes, and, after the performance of the service, they are to take them off again when they go into the outer court (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-17.htm">Ezekiel 44:17-19</a>). In the Mosaic law, &#1513;&#1473;&#1513;&#1473;, white byssus, or &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;, white linen, is mentioned as the material used for the priests' clothing (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/28-39.htm">Exodus 28:39</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-42.htm">Exodus 28:42</a>); here the material is more distinctly designated as &#1508;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, flax linen; and &#1510;&#1502;&#1512;, animal wool, is expressly forbidden, the motive being assigned for this regulation, namely, that the priest is not to cause himself to sweat by wearing woollen clothing. Sweat produces uncleanness; and the priest, by keeping his body clean, is to show even outwardly that he is clean and blameless. With regard to the putting on and off of the official clothes, the new thorah accords with the Mosaic. For we cannot agree with Kliefoth, who detects a deviation in the fact that, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/28-43.htm">Exodus 28:43</a>, the priests were to wear the official clothes only when they entered the tabernacle and when approaching the altar, and, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-4.htm">Leviticus 6:4</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-23.htm">Leviticus 16:23</a>, were to take them off when the service was ended; whereas, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-17.htm">Ezekiel 44:17</a> of the chapter before us, they were to put them on as soon as they entered the inner court, and were never to come before the people in the official costume. If, according to the Mosaic law, the priests were to go before the altar of burnt-offering in the court in their holy official dress, and not otherwise, they must have put on this dress on entering the court; for they could not wait till they were in front of the altar before they changed their clothes. For the expression &#1510;&#1488;&#1514; &#1488;&#1500; &#1492;&#1506;&#1501; does not imply that, according to Ezekiel, they were never to appear in the presence of the people in their official costume, as it does not mean "come before the people," but "go out to the people," or "walk among the people;" nor is this involved in the words '&#1493;&#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468; , they shall not sanctify the people in their clothes (by their clothes). The latter by no means affirms that they are to sanctify the people by intercourse with them, but are not to do this in official costume; the meaning is simply that they are not to move among the people in the outer court while wearing their official clothes, that they may not sanctify them by their holy clothes.<p>This sanctification cannot be understood in any other way than as analogous to the rule laid down in the law, that touching most holy sacrificial flesh would sanctify (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-11.htm">Leviticus 6:11</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-20.htm">Leviticus 6:20</a>), which Ezekiel repeats in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-20.htm">Ezekiel 46:20</a>, and which does not stand in anything like an isolated position in the law, but is also affirmed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-37.htm">Exodus 29:37</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-29.htm">Exodus 30:29</a> of the altar of burnt-offering and the vessels of the sanctuary. The same thing which applied to these vessels - namely, that their holiness passed from them to any one who touched them - is here predicated of the holy dresses of the priests; and the moving of the priests among the people in their holy clothes is forbidden, because such holiness, acquired by contact with holy objects, imposed upon the person to whom it had passed the obligation to guard against all defilement (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/21-1.htm">Leviticus 21:1-8</a>), which the people could not avoid in the ordinary relations of life, and thus a weakening or abolition of the distinction between things holy and common would inevitably have ensued. &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1493;&#1514; &#1492;&#1511;&#1468;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473; are the holy cell-buildings described in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-1.htm">Ezekiel 42:1-14</a>. - To the clothing there is simply appended in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-20.htm">Ezekiel 44:20</a> the direction concerning the hair of the head, the natural covering of the head, in relation to which excess on either side is prohibited, either shaving the head bald or wearing the hair uncut. Both of these were forbidden to the priests in the law: shaving in <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/21-5.htm">Leviticus 21:5</a>, and letting the hair grow freely in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-6.htm">Leviticus 10:6</a>; and the latter was simply imposed upon the Nazarites for the period of their vow (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/6-5.htm">Numbers 6:5</a>). &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1501; only occurs here; but its meaning, to cut the hair, is obvious from the context. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-21.htm">Ezekiel 44:21</a>. The prohibition of the drinking of wine when performing service agrees with <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-9.htm">Leviticus 10:9</a>; on the other hand, the instructions concerning the choice of wives are sharpened in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-22.htm">Ezekiel 44:22</a>, as that which only applied to the high priest in the law is here extended to all the priests. In fact, Ezekiel throughout makes no distinction between the high priest and the common priests. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/21-14.htm">Leviticus 21:14</a>, marrying a widow is only forbidden to the high priest, who was to marry a virgin of his own people, whereas no such restriction is laid down for the ordinary priests. Here, on the other hand, marrying a widow is forbidden to all the priests, marriage with the widow of a priest being the only one allowed. &#1502;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492;&#1503; belongs to &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492;, who has become the widow of a priest.<p>(Note: The Rabbins (Targ. Talm. and Masor. according to their accentuation) have endeavoured to obliterate this distinction, by applying the first hemistich to the high priest alone, and explaining the second thus: "The widow, who is really a widow, the priest may take," interpreting &#1502;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492;&#1503; by quidam sacerdotum, or aliqui ex ordine sacerdotali, or ceteri sacerdotes. But this is contrary to the usage of the language, as &#1502;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492;&#1503; cannot possibly be understood in a partitive sense in this passage, where the priests generally are spoken of, and the plural &#1497;&#1511;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468; follows.)<p>In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-23.htm">Ezekiel 44:23</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-24.htm">Ezekiel 44:24</a> the general official duties of the priests are mentioned, viz., to teach the people, and to instruct them concerning the difference between the holy and the unholy, the clean and the unclean, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-10.htm">Leviticus 10:10</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-10.htm">Deuteronomy 33:10</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-26.htm">Ezekiel 22:26</a>); also to administer justice in questions in dispute according to the rights of God-a duty which had already been committed to the priests in its highest form in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-8.htm">Deuteronomy 17:8</a>., <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-17.htm">Deuteronomy 19:17</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-5.htm">Deuteronomy 21:5</a>. &#1506;&#1500; &#1512;&#1497;&#1489;, concerning, in the case of, matters in dispute. &#1506;&#1502;&#1491; , to stand to judge, i.e., to appear or act as judge (compare &#1492;&#1506;&#1502;&#1497;&#1491; &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1496;&#1497;&#1501;, to appoint or institute judges, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/19-5.htm">2 Chronicles 19:5</a>). The Keri &#1500;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496; is a needless emendation after <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/19-8.htm">2 Chronicles 19:8</a>. The Chetib &#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1496;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;, on the other hand, is a copyist's error for &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1496;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;. Lastly, at all the feasts they are to observe the laws and statutes of Jehovah, that is to say, to perform all the priestly duties binding upon them at the feasts, and to sanctify the Sabbaths, not merely by offering the Sabbath sacrifices, but also by maintaining the Sabbath rest (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-3.htm">Leviticus 23:3</a>). - In <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-25.htm">Ezekiel 44:25-27</a> there follow regulations concerning defilement from the dead, and its removal. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-25.htm">Ezekiel 44:25</a> is a simple repetition of <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/21-1.htm">Leviticus 21:1-3</a>. But the instructions concerning the purification from defilement from the dead are sharpened, inasmuch as not only is the purification prescribed by the law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/19-1.htm">Numbers 19:1</a>.), and which lasted seven days, required (this is meant by &#1496;&#1492;&#1512;&#1514;&#1493;), but a further period of seven days is appointed after these, at the expiration of which the presentation of a sin-offering is demanded before the service in the sanctuary can be resumed. By this demand for a heightened purification, the approach to a corpse permitted to the priests, which was prohibited to the high priest in the Mosaic law, even in the case of father and mother (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/21-11.htm">Leviticus 21:11</a>), is tolerably equalized.<p>For these duties and obligations of service the priests are to receive corresponding emoluments. These are treated of in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-28.htm">Ezekiel 44:28-31</a>. They are not, indeed, to receive any share of the land as their property in time to come any more than in former times; but in the place of this Jehovah will be their property and possession, and give them the necessary room for their dwellings from His own property in the land (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-4.htm">Ezekiel 45:4</a>), and let them draw their maintenance from His altar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-29.htm">Ezekiel 44:29</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-30.htm">Ezekiel 44:30</a>). The promise that Jehovah will be the &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1492; and &#1488;&#1495;&#1494;&#1468;&#1492; of the priests is a simple repetition of the regulation in the law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-20.htm">Numbers 18:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-1.htm">Deuteronomy 18:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-9.htm">Deuteronomy 10:9</a>). So far as the construction in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-28.htm">Ezekiel 44:28</a> is concerned, the words &#1488;&#1504;&#1497; &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1514;&#1501; are really the subject to '&#1493;&#1492;&#1497;&#1514;&#1492; &#1500;&#1492;&#1501; &#1500;&#1503;, which we are obliged to render obliquely, "the inheritance for them shall be, I am their inheritance." For the proposal of Hitzig to take the words from &#1488;&#1504;&#1497; &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1514;&#1501; to the close of the verse as a parenthesis, and to regard '&#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1504;&#1495;&#1492; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-29.htm">Ezekiel 44:29</a> as the subject to '&#1493;&#1492;&#1497;&#1514;&#1492;, is untenable, not only on account of the great harshness which such a parenthesis would involve, but principally because these portions of the sacrifices and heave-offerings which belonged to the priest were not a &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1492;, and are never designated as &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1492;, inheritance, i.e., property in land. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-28.htm">Ezekiel 44:28</a> treats of the property in land, which God assigned to the Levites and priests under the Mosaic economy, by appointing them towns to dwell in, with meadows for the feeding of their cattle, within the territory of the other tribes, but would assign to them in future from the heave-offering set apart from the land for the sanctuary (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-4.htm">Ezekiel 45:4</a>). It is not till <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-29.htm">Ezekiel 44:29</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-30.htm">Ezekiel 44:30</a> that the means of support for the priests are spoken of. They are to be supported from the sacrifices and the tithes and first-fruits which Israel has to pay to Jehovah as the lord of the land, and which He transfers to His servants the priests. For the priests' share of the meat-offering, sin-offering, and trespass-offering, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-3.htm">Leviticus 2:3</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-9.htm">Leviticus 6:9</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-11.htm">Leviticus 6:11</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-19.htm">Leviticus 6:19</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-6.htm">Leviticus 7:6-7</a>; for that which is put under the ban, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/27-21.htm">Leviticus 27:21</a>; for the first-fruits, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-19.htm">Exodus 23:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-26.htm">Exodus 34:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-4.htm">Deuteronomy 18:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-13.htm">Numbers 18:13</a>; for the &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/15-19.htm">Numbers 15:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-19.htm">Numbers 18:19</a>; for the &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514; &#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1505;&#1493;&#1514;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/15-20.htm">Numbers 15:20-21</a>. In '&#1500;&#1492;&#1504;&#1497;&#1495;, "to cause a blessing to rest upon thy house," the individual Israelite is addressed. For the fact itself, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-10.htm">Malachi 3:10</a>. - To the enumeration of the means of support there is appended in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-31.htm">Ezekiel 44:31</a> an emphatic repetition of the command in <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/22-8.htm">Leviticus 22:8</a>, not to eat of any dead thing (i.e., anything that has died a natural death), or anything torn to pieces, either of birds or beasts, on account of its defiling (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/17-15.htm">Leviticus 17:15</a>). </body></html>
