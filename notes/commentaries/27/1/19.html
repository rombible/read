Pious young persons should endeavour to do better than their fellows in useful things; not for the praise of man, but for the honour of the gospel, and that they may be qualified for usefulness. And it is well for a country, and for the honour of a prince, when he is able to judge who are best fitted to serve him, and prefers them on that account. Let young men steadily attend to this chapter; and let all remember that God will honour those who honour him, but those who despise him shall be lightly esteemed.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/daniel/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And the king communed with them - Hebrew, "spake with them." Probably he conversed with them on the points which had constituted the principal subjects of their studies; or he "examined" them. It is easy to imagine that this must have been to these young men a severe ordeal.<p>And among them all was found none like Daniel ... - Daniel and his three friends had pursued a course of strict temperance; they had come to their daily task with clear heads and pure hearts - free from the oppression and lethargy of surfeit, and the excitement of wine; they had prosecuted their studies in the enjoyment of fine health, and with the buoyousness and elasticity of spirit produced by temperance, and they now showed the result of such a course of training. Young men of temperance, other things being equal, will greatly surpass others in their preparation for the duties of life in any profession or calling.<p>Therefore stood they before the king - It is not said, indeed, that the others were not permitted also to stand before the monarch, but the object of the historian is to trace the means by which "these youths" rose to such eminence and virtue. It is clear, however, that whatever may have been the result on the others, the historian means to say that these young men rose to higher eminence than they did, and were permitted to stand nearer the throne. The phrase "stood before the king," is one which denotes elevated rank. They were employed in honorable offices at the court, and received peculiar marks of the royal favor. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/daniel/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19. stood &#8230; before the king&#8212;that is, were advanced to a position of favor near the throne.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/daniel/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Communed with them, </span> i.e. to try their proficiency: this argues the king’s ability and judgment, how else could he discern their fitness and their excellency above others?

He asked them several questions upon the several articles of literature in which they had been educated, to try and see what proficiency they had made; he discoursed with them on various topics of learning, that he might be able to form a judgment of them, and of their capacities, and what employments under him they would be most fit for, and capable of. This shows that the king was a man of learning and good sense, as well as prudence, to be capable of taking such a step as this: <p>and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah; for their learning and knowledge: after the king had gone through the examination of all the youths, these four appeared to be the greatest proficients, and were accordingly taken notice of and distinguished: <p>therefore stood they before the king; ministered unto him, became his servants, and even came to be of his privy council, especially Daniel; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/22-29.htm">Proverbs 22:29</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/daniel/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And the king communed with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: therefore stood they before the king.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/daniel/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">19</span>. <span class="ital">communed</span>] <span class="bld">talked</span>.

The Septuagint translates here <span class="greek">&#x1f65;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, which does mean "commune." Theodotion renders <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>. Jerome has <span class="accented">loeutus</span>; the Peshitta has <span class="accented">malel</span>; all these may be rendered "talked." From Nebuchadnezzar's great reverence for the national religion and for the national magic, we may be certain that much of the conversation would turn on those magical formulae which have been to such a large extent preserved to us. Even if, as we think, the immediate occasion of Daniel and his companions appearing before the king was his "dream," still he would not unnaturally examine them further. It is not unlikely that this conversational examination would involve naturally the languages they would have to be proficient in were they to be of the royal council. They would have to be acquainted with Accadian, the original tongue of all the most sacred magical formulae; with Assyrian, the language in which the royal annals were recorded; and with Aramaic, which was, as we have already said, the language of commerce and diplomacy. Hebrew, the language of the four in whom we are more especially interested, was spoken, not merely by the holy people, but also by the Edomites, Ammonites, Moabites, and the Phoenicians. Further, Egypt was a factor that had to be taken into account, and so, not unlikely, the tongue of Egypt would be known by some, at any rate, of the court officials in Babylon. The empire of the Hittites had certainly passed away, but, probably, their language was still known and spoken by a large number of the inhabitants of Nebuchadnezzar's extensive empire. Not only were the languages of peoples west of Babylon to be considered, but also those to the east; there were the Aryan tongues too. If the tradition is correct that Nebuchadnezzar married a Median wife, the Median tongue, which seems to have been the same with that of Persia, would be, above all, important, Not unlikely questions of policy  and statecraft would be submitted to these candidates, to see what they would say. Above all, in personal intercourse the King of Babylon would be able to form some estimate of the real worth of these youths, There probably would enter in a large measure of caprice, or even superstition, into his choice, yet not unlikely his strong practical sense would limit his superstition. The result of this examination is eminently satisfactory to the young Hebrews. They were found superior to all their competitors. <span class="accented">Therefore stood they before the king.</span> Professor Bevan would render this "became his personal attendants" - a very natural translation. We know, from the Ninevite marbles, that the king is always, alike on the field of battle, the hunting-field, and the council-chamber, attended by eunuchs. It may, however, be regarded as referring to the special subjects of their study. As they had been admitted to the class of magicians and astrologers, it would mean they were admitted to the number of those who were royal magicians and astrologers - those whom the king consulted. It is not to be understood that, even though they were admitted to this number, they were therefore necessarily admitted before the king in this capacity on ordinary occasions. They would occupy but a subordinate position in the huge Babylonian hierarchy. We must note here a variation in the Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, "they were." We, for our part, agree with Professor Bevan, in regarding this as a scribal blunder in the Greek, and that the original text was probably <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>. The only difficulty is that the blunder is also in Paulus Tellensis. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/45.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Holy Heave from the Land. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-1.htm">Ezekiel 45:1</a>. And when ye divide the land by lot for an inheritance, ye shall lift a heave for Jehovah as a holy (portion) from the land; five and twenty thousand the length, and the breadth ten (? twenty) thousand. It shall be holy in all its circumference round about. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-2.htm">Ezekiel 45:2</a>. Of this five hundred shall belong to the Holy by five hundred square round about, and fifty cubits open space thereto round about. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-3.htm">Ezekiel 45:3</a>. And from this measured space thou shalt measure a length of five and twenty thousand, and a breadth of ten thousand, and in this shall be the sanctuary, a holy of holies. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-4.htm">Ezekiel 45:4</a>. A holy (portion) of the land shall this be; to the priests, the servants of the sanctuary, shall it belong who draw near to serve Jehovah, and it shall be to them the place for houses and a sanctuary for the sanctuary. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-5.htm">Ezekiel 45:5</a>. And five and twenty thousand in length and ten thousand in breadth shall belong to the Levites, the servants of the house, for a possession to them as gates to dwell in. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-6.htm">Ezekiel 45:6</a>. And as a possession for the city, ye shall give five thousand in breadth and five and twenty thousand in length, parallel to the holy heave; it shall belong to the whole house of Israel. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-7.htm">Ezekiel 45:7</a>. And to the prince (ye shall give) on both sides of the holy heave and of the possession of the city, along the holy heave and along the possession of the city, on the west side westwards and on the east side eastwards, and in length parallel to one of the tribe-portions, from the western border to the eastern border. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-8.htm">Ezekiel 45:8</a>. It shall belong to him as land, as a possession in Israel; and my princes shall no more oppress my people, but shall leave the land to the house of Israel according to its tribes. - The domain to be first of all set apart from the land at the time of its distribution among the tribes is called &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492;, heave, not in the general sense of the lifting or taking of a portion from the whole, but as a portion lifted or taken by a person from his property as an offering for God; for &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492; comes from &#1492;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, which signifies in the case of the minchah the lifting of a portion which was burned upon the altar as &#1488;&#1494;&#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492; for Jehovah (see the comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-9.htm">Leviticus 2:9</a>). Consequently everything that was offered by the Israelites, either voluntarily or in consequence of a precept from the Lord for the erection and maintenance of the sanctuary and its servants, was called &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492; (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-2.htm">Exodus 25:2</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-15.htm">Ezekiel 30:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-14.htm">Leviticus 7:14</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/15-19.htm">Numbers 15:19</a>, etc.). Only the principal instructions concerning the heave from the land are given here, and these are repeated in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-8.htm">Ezekiel 48:8-22</a>, in the section concerning the division of the land, and to some extent expanded there. The introductory words, "when ye divide the land by lot for an inheritance," point to this. (See the map on Plate IV.) &#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;, sc. &#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;&#1500; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-14.htm">Proverbs 1:14</a>), to cast the lot, to divide by lot, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-6.htm">Joshua 13:6</a>. Then shall ye lift, set apart, a heave for Jehovah as a holy (portion) from the land. &#1502;&#1503;  is to be closely connected with &#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;, as shown by <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-4.htm">Ezekiel 45:4</a>. In the numbers mentioned the measure to be employed is not given. But it is obvious that cubits are not meant, as Bttcher, Hitzig, and others assume, but rods; partly from a comparison of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-2.htm">Ezekiel 45:2</a> with <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-16.htm">Ezekiel 42:16</a>, where the space of the sanctuary, which is given here as 500 by 500 square, is described as five hundred rods on every side; and partly also from the fact that the open space around the sanctuary is fixed at fifty cubits, and in this case &#1488;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; is added, because rods are not to be understood there as in connection with the other numbers. The correctness of this view, which we meet with in Jerome and Raschi, cannot be overthrown by appealing to the excessive magnitude of a &#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; of twenty-five thousand rods in length and ten thousand rods in breadth; for it will be seen in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48.htm">Ezekiel 48</a> that the measurements given answer to the circumstances in rods, but not in cubits. The &#1488;&#1512;&#1498; before and after the number is pleonastic: "as for the length, twenty-five thousand rods in length." Length here is the measurement from east to west, and breadth from north to south, as we may clearly see from <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-10.htm">Ezekiel 48:10</a>. No regard, therefore, is paid to the natural length and breadth of the land; and the greater extent of the portions to be measured is designated as length, the smaller as breadth. The expression &#1488;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1492; &#1488;&#1500;&#1507; is a remarkable one, as &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1514; &#1488;&#1500;&#1508;&#1497;&#1501; is constantly used, not only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-3.htm">Ezekiel 45:3</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-5.htm">Ezekiel 45:5</a>, but also in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-9.htm">Ezekiel 48:9-10</a>,<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-13.htm">Ezekiel 48:13</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-18.htm">Ezekiel 48:18</a>. The lxx have &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b9; &#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;, twenty thousand breadth. This reading appears more correct than the Masoretic, as it is demanded by <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-3.htm">Ezekiel 45:3</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-5.htm">Ezekiel 45:5</a>. For according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-3.htm">Ezekiel 45:3</a>, of the portion measured in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-1.htm">Ezekiel 45:1</a> twenty-five thousand rods in length and ten thousand in breadth were to be measured for the sanctuary and for the priests' land; and according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-5.htm">Ezekiel 45:5</a>, the Levites were also to receive twenty-five thousand rods in length and ten thousand in breadth for a possession. The first clause of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-3.htm">Ezekiel 45:3</a> is unintelligible if the breadth of the holy terumah is given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-1.htm">Ezekiel 45:1</a> as only ten thousand rods, inasmuch as one cannot measure off from an area of twenty-five thousand rods in length and ten thousand rods in breadth another space of the same length and breadth. Moreover, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-1.htm">Ezekiel 45:1</a> requires the reading &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1500;&#1507;, as the "holy terumah" is not only the portion set apart for the sanctuary and the priests' land, but also that which was set apart for the Levites.<p>According to <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-14.htm">Ezekiel 48:14</a>, this was also "holy to Jehovah;" whereas the portion measured off for the city was "common" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-15.htm">Ezekiel 48:15</a>). This is borne out by the fact that in the chapter before us the domain appointed for the city is distinguished from the land of the priests and Levites by the verb &#1514;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-6.htm">Ezekiel 45:6</a>), whilst the description of the size of the Levites' land in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-5.htm">Ezekiel 45:5</a> is closely connected with that of the land of the priests; and further, that in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-7.htm">Ezekiel 45:7</a>, in the description of the land of the prince, reference is made only to the holy terumah and the possession of the city, from which it also follows that the land of the Levites is included in the holy terumah. Consequently <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-1.htm">Ezekiel 45:1</a> treats of the whole of the &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1514; &#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;, i.e., the land of the priests and Levites, which was twenty-five thousand rods long and twenty thousand rods broad. This is designated in the last clause of the verse as a holy (portion) in its entire circumference, and then divided into two domains in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-2.htm">Ezekiel 45:2</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-3.htm">Ezekiel 45:3</a>. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-2.htm">Ezekiel 45:2</a>. Of this (&#1502;&#1494;&#1468;&#1492;, of the area measured in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-1.htm">Ezekiel 45:1</a>) there shall come, or belong, to the holy, i.e., to the holy temple domain, five hundred rods square, namely, the domain measured in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-15.htm">Ezekiel 42:15-20</a> round about the temple, for a separation between holy and common; and round this domain there is to be a &#1502;&#1490;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;, i.e., an open space of fifty cubits on every side, that the dwellings to the priests may not be built too near to the holy square of the temple building. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-3.htm">Ezekiel 45:3</a>. &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1492;, this measure (i.e., this measured piece of land), also points back to <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-1.htm">Ezekiel 45:1</a>, and &#1502;&#1503; cannot be taken in any other sense than in &#1502;&#1494;&#1468;&#1492; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-2.htm">Ezekiel 45:2</a>). From the whole tract of land measured in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-1.htm">Ezekiel 45:1</a> a portion is to be measured off twenty-five thousand rods in length and ten thousand rods in breadth, in which the sanctuary, i.e., the temple with its courts, is to stand as a holy of holies. This domain, in the midst of which is the temple, is to belong to the priests, as the sanctified portion of the land, as the place or space for their houses, and is to be a sanctuary for the sanctuary, i.e., for the temple. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-5.htm">Ezekiel 45:5</a>. A portion equally large is to be measured off to the Levites, as the temple servants, for their possession. The Keri &#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492; is formed after the &#1493;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492; of <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-4.htm">Ezekiel 45:4</a>, and the Chetib &#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492; is indisputably correct. There is great difficulty in the last words of this verse, &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1514;, "for a possession to them twenty cells;" for which the lxx give &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;, and which they have therefore read, or for which they have substituted by conjecture, &#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1514;. We cannot, in fact, obtain from the &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1514; of the Masoretic text any meaning that will harmonize with the context, even if we render the words, as Rosenmller does, in opposition to the grammar, cum viginti cubiculis, and understand by &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1514; capacious cell-buildings. For we neither expect to find in this connection a description of the number and character of the buildings in which the Levites lived, nor can any reason be imagined why the Levites, with a domain of twenty-five thousand rods in length and ten thousand rods in breadth assigned to them, should live together in twenty cell-buildings. Still less can we think of the "twenty cells" as having any connection with the thirty cells in the outer court near to the gate-buildings (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-17.htm">Ezekiel 40:17-18</a>), as these temple cells, even though they were appointed for the Levites during their service in the temple, were not connected in any way with the holy terumah spoken of here. Hvernick's remark, that "the prophet has in his eye the priests' cells in the sanctuary, - and the dwellings of the Levites during their service, which were only on the outside of the sanctuary, were to correspond to these," is not indicated in the slightest degree by the words, but is a mere conjecture. There is no other course open, therefore, than to acknowledge a corruption of the text, and either to alter &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1514; `srym &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; into &#1500;&#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1514;, as Hitzig proposes (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/35-2.htm">Numbers 35:2-3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/21-2.htm">Joshua 21:2</a>), or to take &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; as a mistake for &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;: "for a possession to them as gates to dwell in," according to the frequent use of &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, gates, for &#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, cities, e.g., in what was almost a standing phrase, "the Levites who is in thy gates" ( equals  cities; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-18.htm">Deuteronomy 12:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-27.htm">Deuteronomy 14:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-11.htm">Deuteronomy 16:11</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-10.htm">Exodus 20:10</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-14.htm">Deuteronomy 5:14</a>, etc.). In that case the faulty reading would have arisen from the transposition of &#1506;&#1513; into &#1513;&#1506;, and the change of &#1489; into &#1499;.<p>Beside the holy terumah for sanctuary, priests, and Levites, they are also (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-6.htm">Ezekiel 45:6</a>) to give a tract of twenty-five thousand rods in length and five thousand rods in breadth as the property of the city (i.e., of the capital). &#1500;&#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1514;: parallel to the holy heave, i.e., running by the longer side of it. This portion of land, which was set apart for the city, was to belong to all Israel, and not to any single tribe. The more precise directions concerning this, and concerning the situation of the whole terumah in the land, are not given till <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-8.htm">Ezekiel 48:8-22</a>. Here, in the present chapter, this heave is simply mentioned in connection with the privileges which the servants of the Lord and of His sanctuary were to enjoy. These included, in a certain sense, also the property assigned to the prince in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-7.htm">Ezekiel 45:7</a> as the head of the nation, on whom the provision of the sacrifices for the nation devolved, and who, apart from this, also needed for his subsistence a portion of the land, which should be peculiarly his own, in accordance with his rank. They were to give him as his property (the verb &#1514;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; is to be supplied to &#1500;&#1504;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1488; from <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-6.htm">Ezekiel 45:6</a>) the land on this side and that side of the holy terumah and of the city-possession, and that in front (&#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;) of these two tracts of land, that is to say, adjoining them, extending to their boundaries, '&#1502;&#1508;&#1468;&#1488;&#1514; &#1497;&#1501; , "from" (i.e., according to our view, "upon") the west side westward, and from (upon) the east side eastward; in other words, the land which remained on the eastern and western boundary of the holy terumah and of the city domain, both toward the west as far as the Mediterranean Sea, and toward the east as far as the Jordan, the two boundaries of the future Canaan. The further definition '&#1493;&#1488;&#1512;&#1498; &#1500;&#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; is not quite clear; but the meaning of the words is, that "the length of the portions of land to be given to the prince on the east and west side of the terumah shall be equal to the length of one of the tribe-portions," and not that the portions of land belonging to the prince are to be just as long from north to south as the length of one of the twelve tribe-possessions. "Length" throughout this section is the extent from east to west. It is so in the case of all the tribe-territories (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-8.htm">Ezekiel 48:8</a>), and must be taken in this sense in connection with the portion of land belonging to the prince also. The meaning is therefore this: in length (from east to west) these portions shall be parallel to the inheritance of one of the twelve tribes from the western boundary to the eastern. Two things are stated here: first, that the prince's portion is to extend on the eastern and western sides of the terumah as far as the boundary of the land allotted to the tribes, i.e., on the east to the Jordan, and on the west to the Mediterranean (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-8.htm">Ezekiel 48:8</a>); and secondly, that on the east and west it is to run parallel (&#1500;&#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;) to the length of the separate tribe-territories, i.e., not to reach farther toward either north or south than the terumah lying between, but to be bounded by the long sides of the tribe-territories which bound the terumah on the north and south. &#1488;&#1512;&#1498; is the accusative of direction; &#1488;&#1495;&#1491;, some one (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/16-7.htm">Judges 16:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/82-7.htm">Psalm 82:7</a>). - In <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-8.htm">Ezekiel 45:8</a>, &#1500;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; with the article is to be retained, contrary to Hitzig's conjecture &#1500;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509;: "to the land belonging to him as a possession shall it (the portion marked off in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-7.htm">Ezekiel 45:7</a>) be to him." &#1488;&#1512;&#1509;, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-18.htm">1 Kings 11:18</a>, of property in land. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-8.htm">Ezekiel 45:8</a>, the motive for these instructions is given. The former kings of Israel had no land of their own, no domain; and this had driven them to acquire private property by violence and extortion. That this may not occur any more in the future, and all inducement to such oppression of the people may be taken from the princes, in the new kingdom of God the portion of land more precisely defined in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-7.htm">Ezekiel 45:7</a> is to be given to the prince as his own property. The plural, "my princes," does not refer to several contemporaneous princes, nor can it be understood of the king and his sons, i.e., of the royal family, on account of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-16.htm">Ezekiel 46:16</a>; but it is to be traced to the simple fact "that Ezekiel was also thinking of the past kings, and that the whole series of princes, who had ruled over Israel, and still would rule, was passing before his mind" (Kliefoth), without our being able to conclude from this that there would be a plurality of princes succeeding one another in time to come, in contradiction to <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-25.htm">Ezekiel 37:25</a>. -  "And the land shall they (the princes) leave to the people of Israel" (&#1504;&#1514;&#1503; in the sense of concedere; and &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509;, the land, with the exception of the portion set apart from it in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-1.htm">Ezekiel 45:1-7</a>). - The warning against oppression and extortion, implied in the reason thus assigned, is expanded into a general exhortation in the following verses.</body></html>
