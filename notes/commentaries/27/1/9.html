Each finds favour with his master, and afterwards with a foreign monarch. The grace of God enables each to overcome the temptations into which his circumstances lead him. The acute natural faculties of each are miraculously increased by God; and, lastly, each is sent into a foreign land to comfort exiled Israel. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/39-21.htm" title="But the LORD was with Joseph, and showed him mercy, and gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison.">Genesis 39:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-50.htm" title="And forgive your people that have sinned against you, and all their transgressions wherein they have transgressed against you, and give them compassion before them who carried them captive, that they may have compassion on them:">1Kings 8:50</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/1-11.htm" title="O LORD, I beseech you, let now your ear be attentive to the prayer of your servant, and to the prayer of your servants, who desire to fear your name: and prosper, I pray you, your servant this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man.

And, considering what important consequences frequently follow upon it, we may, with great reason, acknowledge the hand of God in it, whenever it takes place.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:8-16 The interest we think we make for ourselves, we must acknowledge to be God's gift. Daniel was still firm to his religion. Whatever they called him, he still held fast the spirit of an Israelite. These youths scrupled concerning the meat, lest it should be sinful. When God's people are in Babylon they need take special care that they partake not of her sins. It is much to the praise of young people, not to covet or seek the delights of sense. Those who would excel in wisdom and piety, must learn betimes to keep the body under. Daniel avoided defiling himself with sin; and we should more fear that than any outward trouble. It is easier to keep temptation at a distance, than to resist it when near. And we cannot better improve our interest in any with whom we have found favour, than to use it to keep us from sin. People will not believe the benefit of avoiding excess, and of a spare diet, nor how much they contribute to the health of the body, unless they try. Conscientious temperance will always do more, even for the comfort of this life, than sinful indulgence.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/daniel/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Now God had brought Daniel into favor - Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/39-21.htm">Genesis 39:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-7.htm">Proverbs 16:7</a>. By what means this had been done is not mentioned. It may be presumed, however, that it was by the attractiveness of his person and manners, and by the evidence of promising talent which he had evinced. Whatever were the means, however, two things are worthy of notice:<p>(1) The effect of this on the subsequent fortunes of Daniel. It was to him a great advantage, that by the friendship of this man he was enabled to carry out the purposes of temperance and religion which he had formed, without coming in conflict with those who were in power.<p>(2) God was the author of the favor which was thus shown to Daniel. It was by a controlling influence which he exerted, that this result had been secured, and Daniel traced it directly to him. We may hence learn that the favor of others toward us is to be traced to the hand of God, and if we are prospered in the world, and are permitted to enjoy the friendship of those who have it in their power to benefit us, though it may be on account of our personal qualifications, we should learn to attribute it all to God. There would have been great reason to apprehend beforehand, that the refusal of Daniel and his companions to partake of the food prepared for them would have been construed as an affront offered to the king, especially if it was understood to be on the ground that they regarded it as "defilement" or "pollution" to partake of it; but God overruled it all so as to secure the favor of those in power. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/daniel/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9.

Even before this request was made; as he gave to Joseph favour in the sight of Potiphar, and of the keeper of the prison; for whatever favour is shown to good men by bad men is from the Lord; for though Daniel's ingenuity, the goodness of his temper, and his modest behaviour, his excellent natural parts, and other accomplishments, might be a means of ingratiating him into the favour of this officer; yet all would have been insufficient to recommend him to him, or to overcome his prejudices on account of religion, if the Lord had not wrought upon his heart to show kindness and tenderness to him; which appeared not only by his past usage of him; but, when he presented his supplication to him, he did not put on a stern countenance, and answer him roughly, and threaten him if he did not comply with the king's orders; but in a mild and gentle manner, as follows: <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/daniel/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Now God had brought Daniel into favour and tender love with the prince of the eunuchs.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/daniel/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">9</span>. <span class="bld">And</span> <span class="ital">God</span> <span class="bld">made</span> <span class="ital">Daniel</span> <span class="bld">to find kindness</span> <span class="ital">and</span> <span class="bld">compassion in the sight</span> <span class="ital">of</span>, &c.] lit. ‘<span class="ital">gave</span> Daniel <span class="ital">to</span> kindness and compassion <span class="ital">before</span>’: exactly the same idiom which occurs (without ‘kindness and’) in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-50.htm" title="And forgive your people that have sinned against you, and all their transgressions wherein they have transgressed against you, and give them compassion before them who carried them captive, that they may have compassion on them:">1 Kings 8:50</a> (whence <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-46.htm" title="He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them captives.">Psalm 106:46</a>). The pluperfect (‘had brought’) is grammatically incorrect: the meaning is that the kindness was experienced immediately after the request. Cf., though the expressions are different, the similar case of Joseph, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/39-21.htm" title="But the LORD was with Joseph, and showed him mercy, and gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison.">Genesis 39:21</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now God had brought Daniel into favour and tender love with the prince of the eunuchs.</span> The word here translated "tender love" really means "bowels," and then "mercy" or "compassion." Hence the Apostle Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-1.htm">Philippians 2:1</a>) combines the two meanings, "If there be any bowels and mercies." The Revised Version is here to be preferred, "favour and compassion,' as the Authorized exaggerates the affection the prince of the eunuchs had for Daniel. The versions in this verse do not afford any marked variations. The Septuagint has <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "Lord," usually employed to translate <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5d4;</span>, Jehovah, instead of <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5dc;&#x5d4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>). It is not impossible that the original reading may have been <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5d4;</span>, though it is to be admitted not likely. <span class="accented">Rahameem</span> is translated <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>," favour," in the Septuagint, which is a weak rendering; Theodotion renders <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, which may be regarded as practically equivalent to our Revised Version. While the third verse speaks of the "chief" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;</span>) of the eunuchs, a Babylonian and Assyrian title, the more usual Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span> replaces it in this verse and in that which precedes it. From this root the Assyrian and Babylonian word for "king," <span class="accented">sat</span> or <span class="accented">sarru</span>, was derived, while <span class="accented">tab</span> fell on evil days. Among the later Jews it became equivalent to mr doctors of divinity. Before the word for "God" (<span class="accented">Elohim</span>) there is the article. So far as the form stands, it might be plural, and therefore be capable of being translated "the gods," but the verb being singular renders that translation impossible. The affection with which the chief of the eunuchs regarded Daniel is notified to us as the result of God's goodness, who had thus given him favour in the eyes of him set over him. The Hebrew never failed to recognize, in his devouter moments, that the hearts of all men are in the hands of God; that by him kings reign and princes decree wisdom. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/44.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Requisites for the Administration of the Priests' Office, and the Obligations and Privileges of that Office. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-17.htm">Ezekiel 44:17</a>.

The dress prescribed in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/28.htm">Exodus 28</a> for the priests to wear during the holy service had this signification. The same rule is here presupposed as still in force; and it is simply renewed and partially emphasized by the enumeration of some of the leading points. At the service at the altar and in the holy place the priests are to wear linen clothes, and, after the performance of the service, they are to take them off again when they go into the outer court (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-17.htm">Ezekiel 44:17-19</a>). In the Mosaic law, &#1513;&#1473;&#1513;&#1473;, white byssus, or &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;, white linen, is mentioned as the material used for the priests' clothing (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/28-39.htm">Exodus 28:39</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-42.htm">Exodus 28:42</a>); here the material is more distinctly designated as &#1508;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, flax linen; and &#1510;&#1502;&#1512;, animal wool, is expressly forbidden, the motive being assigned for this regulation, namely, that the priest is not to cause himself to sweat by wearing woollen clothing. Sweat produces uncleanness; and the priest, by keeping his body clean, is to show even outwardly that he is clean and blameless. With regard to the putting on and off of the official clothes, the new thorah accords with the Mosaic. For we cannot agree with Kliefoth, who detects a deviation in the fact that, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/28-43.htm">Exodus 28:43</a>, the priests were to wear the official clothes only when they entered the tabernacle and when approaching the altar, and, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-4.htm">Leviticus 6:4</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-23.htm">Leviticus 16:23</a>, were to take them off when the service was ended; whereas, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-17.htm">Ezekiel 44:17</a> of the chapter before us, they were to put them on as soon as they entered the inner court, and were never to come before the people in the official costume. If, according to the Mosaic law, the priests were to go before the altar of burnt-offering in the court in their holy official dress, and not otherwise, they must have put on this dress on entering the court; for they could not wait till they were in front of the altar before they changed their clothes. For the expression &#1510;&#1488;&#1514; &#1488;&#1500; &#1492;&#1506;&#1501; does not imply that, according to Ezekiel, they were never to appear in the presence of the people in their official costume, as it does not mean "come before the people," but "go out to the people," or "walk among the people;" nor is this involved in the words '&#1493;&#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468; , they shall not sanctify the people in their clothes (by their clothes). The latter by no means affirms that they are to sanctify the people by intercourse with them, but are not to do this in official costume; the meaning is simply that they are not to move among the people in the outer court while wearing their official clothes, that they may not sanctify them by their holy clothes.<p>This sanctification cannot be understood in any other way than as analogous to the rule laid down in the law, that touching most holy sacrificial flesh would sanctify (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-11.htm">Leviticus 6:11</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-20.htm">Leviticus 6:20</a>), which Ezekiel repeats in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-20.htm">Ezekiel 46:20</a>, and which does not stand in anything like an isolated position in the law, but is also affirmed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-37.htm">Exodus 29:37</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-29.htm">Exodus 30:29</a> of the altar of burnt-offering and the vessels of the sanctuary. The same thing which applied to these vessels - namely, that their holiness passed from them to any one who touched them - is here predicated of the holy dresses of the priests; and the moving of the priests among the people in their holy clothes is forbidden, because such holiness, acquired by contact with holy objects, imposed upon the person to whom it had passed the obligation to guard against all defilement (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/21-1.htm">Leviticus 21:1-8</a>), which the people could not avoid in the ordinary relations of life, and thus a weakening or abolition of the distinction between things holy and common would inevitably have ensued. &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1493;&#1514; &#1492;&#1511;&#1468;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473; are the holy cell-buildings described in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-1.htm">Ezekiel 42:1-14</a>. - To the clothing there is simply appended in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-20.htm">Ezekiel 44:20</a> the direction concerning the hair of the head, the natural covering of the head, in relation to which excess on either side is prohibited, either shaving the head bald or wearing the hair uncut. Both of these were forbidden to the priests in the law: shaving in <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/21-5.htm">Leviticus 21:5</a>, and letting the hair grow freely in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-6.htm">Leviticus 10:6</a>; and the latter was simply imposed upon the Nazarites for the period of their vow (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/6-5.htm">Numbers 6:5</a>). &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1501; only occurs here; but its meaning, to cut the hair, is obvious from the context. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-21.htm">Ezekiel 44:21</a>. The prohibition of the drinking of wine when performing service agrees with <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-9.htm">Leviticus 10:9</a>; on the other hand, the instructions concerning the choice of wives are sharpened in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-22.htm">Ezekiel 44:22</a>, as that which only applied to the high priest in the law is here extended to all the priests. In fact, Ezekiel throughout makes no distinction between the high priest and the common priests. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/21-14.htm">Leviticus 21:14</a>, marrying a widow is only forbidden to the high priest, who was to marry a virgin of his own people, whereas no such restriction is laid down for the ordinary priests. Here, on the other hand, marrying a widow is forbidden to all the priests, marriage with the widow of a priest being the only one allowed. &#1502;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492;&#1503; belongs to &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492;, who has become the widow of a priest.<p>(Note: The Rabbins (Targ. Talm. and Masor. according to their accentuation) have endeavoured to obliterate this distinction, by applying the first hemistich to the high priest alone, and explaining the second thus: "The widow, who is really a widow, the priest may take," interpreting &#1502;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492;&#1503; by quidam sacerdotum, or aliqui ex ordine sacerdotali, or ceteri sacerdotes. But this is contrary to the usage of the language, as &#1502;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492;&#1503; cannot possibly be understood in a partitive sense in this passage, where the priests generally are spoken of, and the plural &#1497;&#1511;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468; follows.)<p>In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-23.htm">Ezekiel 44:23</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-24.htm">Ezekiel 44:24</a> the general official duties of the priests are mentioned, viz., to teach the people, and to instruct them concerning the difference between the holy and the unholy, the clean and the unclean, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-10.htm">Leviticus 10:10</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-10.htm">Deuteronomy 33:10</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-26.htm">Ezekiel 22:26</a>); also to administer justice in questions in dispute according to the rights of God-a duty which had already been committed to the priests in its highest form in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-8.htm">Deuteronomy 17:8</a>., <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-17.htm">Deuteronomy 19:17</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-5.htm">Deuteronomy 21:5</a>. &#1506;&#1500; &#1512;&#1497;&#1489;, concerning, in the case of, matters in dispute. &#1506;&#1502;&#1491; , to stand to judge, i.e., to appear or act as judge (compare &#1492;&#1506;&#1502;&#1497;&#1491; &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1496;&#1497;&#1501;, to appoint or institute judges, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/19-5.htm">2 Chronicles 19:5</a>).

Lastly, at all the feasts they are to observe the laws and statutes of Jehovah, that is to say, to perform all the priestly duties binding upon them at the feasts, and to sanctify the Sabbaths, not merely by offering the Sabbath sacrifices, but also by maintaining the Sabbath rest (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-3.htm">Leviticus 23:3</a>). - In <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-25.htm">Ezekiel 44:25-27</a> there follow regulations concerning defilement from the dead, and its removal. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-25.htm">Ezekiel 44:25</a> is a simple repetition of <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/21-1.htm">Leviticus 21:1-3</a>. But the instructions concerning the purification from defilement from the dead are sharpened, inasmuch as not only is the purification prescribed by the law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/19-1.htm">Numbers 19:1</a>.), and which lasted seven days, required (this is meant by &#1496;&#1492;&#1512;&#1514;&#1493;), but a further period of seven days is appointed after these, at the expiration of which the presentation of a sin-offering is demanded before the service in the sanctuary can be resumed. By this demand for a heightened purification, the approach to a corpse permitted to the priests, which was prohibited to the high priest in the Mosaic law, even in the case of father and mother (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/21-11.htm">Leviticus 21:11</a>), is tolerably equalized.<p>For these duties and obligations of service the priests are to receive corresponding emoluments. These are treated of in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-28.htm">Ezekiel 44:28-31</a>. They are not, indeed, to receive any share of the land as their property in time to come any more than in former times; but in the place of this Jehovah will be their property and possession, and give them the necessary room for their dwellings from His own property in the land (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-4.htm">Ezekiel 45:4</a>), and let them draw their maintenance from His altar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-29.htm">Ezekiel 44:29</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-30.htm">Ezekiel 44:30</a>). The promise that Jehovah will be the &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1492; and &#1488;&#1495;&#1494;&#1468;&#1492; of the priests is a simple repetition of the regulation in the law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-20.htm">Numbers 18:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-1.htm">Deuteronomy 18:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-9.htm">Deuteronomy 10:9</a>). So far as the construction in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-28.htm">Ezekiel 44:28</a> is concerned, the words &#1488;&#1504;&#1497; &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1514;&#1501; are really the subject to '&#1493;&#1492;&#1497;&#1514;&#1492; &#1500;&#1492;&#1501; &#1500;&#1503;, which we are obliged to render obliquely, "the inheritance for them shall be, I am their inheritance." For the proposal of Hitzig to take the words from &#1488;&#1504;&#1497; &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1514;&#1501; to the close of the verse as a parenthesis, and to regard '&#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1504;&#1495;&#1492; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-29.htm">Ezekiel 44:29</a> as the subject to '&#1493;&#1492;&#1497;&#1514;&#1492;, is untenable, not only on account of the great harshness which such a parenthesis would involve, but principally because these portions of the sacrifices and heave-offerings which belonged to the priest were not a &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1492;, and are never designated as &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1492;, inheritance, i.e., property in land. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-28.htm">Ezekiel 44:28</a> treats of the property in land, which God assigned to the Levites and priests under the Mosaic economy, by appointing them towns to dwell in, with meadows for the feeding of their cattle, within the territory of the other tribes, but would assign to them in future from the heave-offering set apart from the land for the sanctuary (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-4.htm">Ezekiel 45:4</a>). It is not till <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-29.htm">Ezekiel 44:29</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-30.htm">Ezekiel 44:30</a> that the means of support for the priests are spoken of. They are to be supported from the sacrifices and the tithes and first-fruits which Israel has to pay to Jehovah as the lord of the land, and which He transfers to His servants the priests. For the priests' share of the meat-offering, sin-offering, and trespass-offering, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-3.htm">Leviticus 2:3</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-9.htm">Leviticus 6:9</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-11.htm">Leviticus 6:11</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-19.htm">Leviticus 6:19</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-6.htm">Leviticus 7:6-7</a>; for that which is put under the ban, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/27-21.htm">Leviticus 27:21</a>; for the first-fruits, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-19.htm">Exodus 23:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-26.htm">Exodus 34:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-4.htm">Deuteronomy 18:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-13.htm">Numbers 18:13</a>; for the &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/15-19.htm">Numbers 15:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-19.htm">Numbers 18:19</a>; for the &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514; &#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1505;&#1493;&#1514;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/15-20.htm">Numbers 15:20-21</a>. In '&#1500;&#1492;&#1504;&#1497;&#1495;, "to cause a blessing to rest upon thy house," the individual Israelite is addressed. For the fact itself, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-10.htm">Malachi 3:10</a>. - To the enumeration of the means of support there is appended in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-31.htm">Ezekiel 44:31</a> an emphatic repetition of the command in <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/22-8.htm">Leviticus 22:8</a>, not to eat of any dead thing (i.e., anything that has died a natural death), or anything torn to pieces, either of birds or beasts, on account of its defiling (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/17-15.htm">Leviticus 17:15</a>). </body></html>
