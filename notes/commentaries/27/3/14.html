Is it designedly and deliberately done, or was it only through inadvertency, that you have not served my gods? What! you that I have nourished and brought up; that have been educated and maintained at my charge; that I have been so kind to, and done so much for; you that have been in such reputation for wisdom, and therefore should better have known your duty to your prince; what! do not you serve my gods, nor worship the golden image which I have set up?

But, 2d, The king is resolved, if they persist in their refusal, that they shall immediately be cast into the fiery furnace, and shall not have so much as an hour’s reprieve. Thus does the matter lie in a little compass; <span class="ital">Turn or burn, </span>is the king’s language. And because he knew they buoyed themselves up in their refusal with a confidence in their God, he insolently sets him at defiance, saying, <span class="ital">And who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands? </span>Let him deliver you if he can.

The matter is put into a little compass, Turn, or burn. Proud men are still ready to say, as Nebuchadnezzar, Who is the Lord, that I should fear his power? Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego did not hesitate whether they should comply or not. Life or death were not to be considered. Those that would avoid sin, must not parley with temptation when that to which we are allured or affrighted is manifestly evil. Stand not to pause about it, but say, as Christ did, Get thee behind me, Satan. They did not contrive an evasive answer, when a direct answer was expected. Those who make their duty their main care, need not be anxious or fearful concerning the event. The faithful servants of God find him able to control and overrule all the powers armed against them. Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst. If He be for us, we need not fear what man can do unto us. God will deliver us, either from death or in death. They must obey God rather than man; they must rather suffer than sin; and must not do evil that good may come. Therefore none of these things moved them. The saving them from sinful compliance, was as great a miracle in the kingdom of grace, as the saving them out of the fiery furnace was in the kingdom of nature. Fear of man and love of the world, especially want of faith, make men yield to temptation, while a firm persuasion of the truth will deliver them from denying Christ, or being ashamed of him. We are to be meek in our replies, but we must be decided that we will obey God rather than man.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/daniel/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them, Is it true - Margin, "of purpose;" that is, have you done this intentionally? Wintle renders this, "Is it insultingly?" Jacchiades says that the word is used to denote admiration or wonder, as if the king could not believe that it was possible that they could disregard so plain a command, when disobedience was accompanied with such a threat. De Dieu renders it, "Is it a joke?" That is, can you possibly be serious or in earnest that you disobey so positive a command? Aben Ezra, Theodotion, and Sandias render it as it is in margin, "Have you done this of set purpose and design?" as if the king had regarded it as possible that there had been a misunderstanding, and as if he was not unwilling to find that they could make an apology for their conduct. The Chaldee word (&#1510;&#1491;&#1488;  tseda&#770;') occurs nowhere else. It is rendered by Gesenius, "purpose, design." That is, "Is it on purpose?" The corresponding Hebrew word (&#1510;&#1491;&#1492;  tsa&#770;da&#770;h) means, "to lie in wait, to waylay," <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-13.htm">Exodus 21:13</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-11.htm">1 Samuel 24:11</a>, (12).

The true meaning seems to be, "Is it your "determined purpose" not to worship my gods? Have you deliberately made up your minds to this, and do you mean to abide by this resolution?" That this is the meaning is apparent from the fact that he immediately proposes to try them on the point, giving them still an opportunity to comply with his command to worship the image if they would, or to show whether they were finally resolved not to do it.<p>Do not ye serve my gods? - It was one of the charges against them that they did not do it, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/3-12.htm">Daniel 3:12</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/daniel/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14.

Notwithstanding his "fury," his past favor for them disposes him to give them the opportunity of excusing themselves on the ground that their disobedience had not been intentional; so he gives them another trial to see whether they would still worship the image.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/daniel/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Now when these men were brought before the king, though in rage, yet he doth not presently throw them into the fire, but makes inquiry by interrogatories, that he might see first if they were guilty, by hearing them speak for themselves, and telling them he expected obedience and conformity to his laws from them, and it was in vain to look for any indulgence from him, he would bate them nothing, they should be burned. What! do ye make a jest of my gods, and my religion, and my commands? so the word <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">tseda</span> in the Syriac doth signify, to scoff or deride, as if he had said, Is it true indeed that ye refuse to worship my gods? do ye do it in earnest, or in jest? it seems by your carriage, if it be true what I hear of you, that ye slight my gods, and make a mock of my authority, but ye shall know there is no jesting with these edge-tools. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/daniel/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them, is it true,.... What I have heard of you, what you are charged with and accused of; surely it cannot be; so Aben Ezra and Saadiah interpret the word as we do, and all the Oriental versions: it is only used in this place: it is expressed by way of admiration, as Jacchiades observes; it being incredible to the king, what he could never believe, unless it appeared plain in his own eyes. Some (o) render it, is it a "desolation?" so Jarchi; is my decree such? or should you not obey it? was this suffered, nothing but disorder and desolation would follow in the kingdom: or, "is it of purpose?" as others (p); have you done this willingly and knowingly, or through imprudence and inadvertency? if the latter, it is pardonable; if not, it cannot be borne with. De Dieu, from the Syriac use of the word, renders it, "is it a joke?" are you serious, and in good earnest, or in joke, "that ye worship not my gods? or do you mock me and them?" <p>O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego; on whom I have conferred so many favours, raised from a low to a high estate, and yet used by you in this manner: <p>do ye not serve my gods; one would think he had no need to have asked this question; since he must needs know, that, by their nation and religion, they served only one God, and could serve no other; and that by their daily practice they never did, in which they were indulged: <p>nor worship the golden image that I have set up? it is for the sake of this the question is put; this was the thing his heart was set upon; and such was his pride, that he could not bear any control in it. <p>(o) "nunquid desolatio?"

There seems to have been a difference of reading here. The first words must have been read as <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5df;&#x20;&#x5e2;&#x5dc;&#x5d9;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">behon</span> '<span class="accented">aleehon</span>), and the mysterious word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e6;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> (<span class="accented">hatzeda</span>) <span class="accented">had</span> occupied a position before, not after <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5de;&#x5e8;</span>. The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> in the aphel in Syriac means "to look steadily." This interpretation of the word shows that the translator had before him a document in which Syriac meanings might be expected. Theodotion renders the last clause, "If truly (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span>) Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, my gods ye do not worship, and before the golden image which I have set up ye do not prostrate yourselves?" - a construction that shows a slavish following of the Aramaic. The sense here is really the same as that of the Authorized Version. The Peshitta renders the opening word of this latter portion of the verse, "in truth" - a rendering with which Jerome agrees. Professor Bevan suggests another reading, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5d6;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span>, followed by Behrmann. Unfortunately, the meaning of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5d6;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> is very doubtful. The common rendering is "of set purpose." So Furst, Gesenius, Winer, among lexicographers, and Bertholdt, Ewald, Aben Ezra, Wordsworth, among commentators; Keil, Kliefoth, Kra-nichfeld, hold it to mean "with evil intent." It is suggested also that it may mean "in mockery." The reading suggested by Professor Bevan and supported by Behrmann is not to be thought of; they appeal to Theodotion, but when this word occurs in the previous chapter (ver. 5), Theodotion translates <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;</span>, which makes it evident that <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d6;&#x5d3;&#x5d0;</span> (<span class="accented">azda</span>) did not mean "truth" to him. More may be said for the Peshitta, only that, though <span class="accented">azda</span> does seem to mean "truth," the translation is not the same in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-5.htm">Daniel 2:5</a> and the present verse. If there is to be a change of reading, that indicated by the Septuagint translation is preferable. The Septuagint translator has had <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5d3;&#x5d0;</span> before him, and there is no evidence that Theodotion had not. The change in the arrangement of the words is a simpler variation than any other, and it retains the word in its Syriac meaning; otherwise we should be inclined to follow the lexicographers, and translate "of set purpose." If we take the view of this word indicated above, then we may imagine Nebuchadnezzar looking steadfastly on those youths who had dared to oppose him, hoping, it may be, to see them shrink from his gaze, as he had seen so many of the kings he had conquered do.  If this is correct, it gives a point to what the youths begin their answer with in ver. 16. If we take the more common rendering, we see the generosity of the king. Full of rage and fury as he is, he will give them an opening to say that it was of inadvertence that they failed to obey his decree. This is fully borne out by the next verse. If Nebuchadnezzar was full of fury at the crime against the gods, he yet was careful that the envy of the Chaldeans should not hinder him from giving the Jews who had been accused to him a chance to defend themselves. This mental fairness it was which, despite his outbursts of capricious rage, drew the affection of those about him to Nebuchadnezzar. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/47.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Boundaries of the Land to be Divided among the Tribes of Israel.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-13.htm">Ezekiel 47:13</a>.

And ye shall receive it for an inheritance, one as well as another, because I lifted up my hand to give it to your fathers; and thus shall this land fall to you for an inheritance. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-15.htm">Ezekiel 47:15</a>. And this is the boundary of the land: toward the north side, from the great sea onwards by the way to Chetlon, in the direction of Zedad; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-16.htm">Ezekiel 47:16</a>. Hamath, Berotah, Sibraim, which is between the boundary of Damascus and the boundary of Hamath, the central Hazer, which is on the boundary of Haruan. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-17.htm">Ezekiel 47:17</a>. And the boundary from the sea shall be Hazar-Enon, the boundary town of Damascus; and as for the north northwards, Hamath is the boundary. This, the north side. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-18.htm">Ezekiel 47:18</a>. And the east side between Hauran and Damascus and Gilead and the land of Israel, shall be the Jordan; from the boundary to the eastern sea ye shall measure.

This land shall ye divide among you according to the tribes of Israel. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-22.htm">Ezekiel 47:22</a>. And it shall come to pass, ye shall divide it by lot among yourselves for an inheritance, and among the foreigners who dwell in the midst of you, who have begotten sons in the midst of you; they shall be to you like natives born among the sons of Israel; they shall cast lots with you for an inheritance among the tribes of Israel. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-23.htm">Ezekiel 47:23</a>. And it shall come to pass, in the tribe in which the foreigner dwells, there shall ye give him his inheritance, is the saying of the Lord Jehovah.<p>The fixing of the boundary of the land which Israel was to divide in future according to its twelve tribes is commenced (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-13.htm">Ezekiel 47:13</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-14.htm">Ezekiel 47:14</a>) and concluded (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-22.htm">Ezekiel 47:22</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-23.htm">Ezekiel 47:23</a>) with certain general statements concerning the distribution. The introductory statements are attached to the heading "this is the boundary," which is therefore repeated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-15.htm">Ezekiel 47:15</a>. &#1490;&#1468;&#1492; is evidently a copyist's error for &#1494;&#1492;, which is adopted by all the older translators, contained in some Codd., and demanded by &#1493;&#1494;&#1492; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-15.htm">Ezekiel 47:15</a>. &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500; stands here for the whole of the boundary of the land to be distributed; and &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; which follows is an accusative, "according to which." - "According to the twelve tribes," - for all Israel is to return and dwell as one people of God under one prince in its own land (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-24.htm">Ezekiel 36:24</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-21.htm">Ezekiel 37:21</a>.). But the division among the twelve tribes is more precisely defined immediately afterwards by the clause abruptly appended, "Joseph portions," i.e., two portions for Joseph. There can be no doubt that this is the meaning of the words in accordance with <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/48-22.htm">Genesis 48:22</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/17-14.htm">Joshua 17:14</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/17-17.htm">Joshua 17:17</a>. Hence the notice-like form of the expression, which should not be obliterated by pointing &#1495;&#1489;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; as a dual, &#1495;&#1489;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;. If the land was to be divided by lot according to twelve tribes, and the tribe of Levi was to receive its portion from the terumah which was set apart, Joseph must necessarily receive two hereditary portions for his sons Ephraim and Manasseh, in accordance with the appointment of the patriarch in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/48-22.htm">Genesis 48:22</a>. The commencement of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-14.htm">Ezekiel 47:14</a> is not at variance with this, as Hitzig imagines; for the words, "ye shall receive it for an inheritance, one as another," simply affirm, that of the twelve tribes reckoned by Israel in relation to the &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1492;, all were to receive equal shares, the one as much as the other. As the reason for this command to divide the land, allusion is made to the oath with which God promised to give this land to the fathers (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-28.htm">Ezekiel 20:28</a>).<p>The definition of the boundaries commences with <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-15.htm">Ezekiel 47:15</a>. In form it differs in many points from <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/34-1.htm">Numbers 34:1-5</a>, but in actual fact it is in harmony with the Mosaic definition. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/34.htm">Numbers 34</a> the description commences with the southern boundary, then proceeds to the western and northern boundaries, and closes with the eastern. In Ezekiel it commences with the northern boundary and proceeds to the east, the south, and the west. This difference may be explained in a very simple manner, from the fact that the Israelites in the time of Moses came from Egypt i.e., marching from the south, and stood by the south-eastern boundary of the land, whereas at this time they were carried away into the northern lands Assyria and Babylon, and were regarded as returning thence. Again, in Ezekiel the boundaries are described much more briefly than in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/34.htm">Numbers 34</a>, the northern boundary alone being somewhat more circumstantially described. The course which it takes is represented in a general manner in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-15.htm">Ezekiel 47:15</a> as running from the great sea, i.e., the Mediterranean, by the way to Chetlon, in the direction toward Zedad. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-16.htm">Ezekiel 47:16</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-17.htm">Ezekiel 47:17</a> there follow the places which formed the boundary. The starting-point on the Mediterranean Sea can only be approximately determined, as the places mentioned, Chetlon and Zedad, are still unknown. Not only Chetlon, but Zedad also, has not yet been discovered. The city of Sadad (Sudud), to the east of the road leading from Damascus to Hums (Emesa), which Robinson and Wetzstein suppose to be the same, lies much too far toward the east to be used in defining the boundary either here or in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/34-8.htm">Numbers 34:8</a> (see the comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/34-8.htm">Numbers 34:8</a>). Among the names enumerated in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-16.htm">Ezekiel 47:16</a>, &#1495;&#1502;&#1514; is not the city of Hamah on the Orontes, which lay much too far to the north, but the kingdom of Hamath, the southern boundary of which formed the northern boundary of Canaan, though it cannot be given with exactness. Berothah is probably identical with Berothai in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-8.htm">2 Samuel 8:8</a>, a city of the king of Zobah; but the situation of it is still unknown. Sibraim may perhaps be identical with Ziphron in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/34-9.htm">Numbers 34:9</a>, which has also not yet been discovered, and is not to be sought for in the ruins of Zifran, to the north-east of Damascus, near the road to Palmyra; for that place could not form the boundary of Damascus and Hamath. The situation of the "central Hazer" has also not yet been determined. Hauran, on the boundary of which it stood, is used here in a more comprehensive sense that  &#787;&#x391;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; in Josephus and other Greek authors, and includes the later Auranitis, together with Gaulanitis (Golan) and Batanaea (Bashan), and probably also Ituraea, as only Damascus and Gilead are named in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-18.htm">Ezekiel 47:18</a> in addition to Hauran, on the east side of the Jordan; so that the whole tract of land between the territory of Damascus and the country of Gilead is embraced by the name Hauran. &#1495;&#1493;&#1512;&#1503;, Arab. Hawra&#770;n, is derived from the number of caves (&#1495;&#1493;&#1512;, &#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;) in that district, to which Wetzstein (Reiseber. p. 92) indeed raises the objection that with the exception of the eastern and south-eastern Hauran, where no doubt most of the volcanic hills have been perforated by troglodytes, the dwellings in caves are by no means common in that region. But the name may have originated in this eastern district, and possibly have included even that portion of Gilead which was situated to the north of the Jabbok, namely, Erbed and Sut, the true cave-country. For further remarks concerning these districts, see the comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-4.htm">Deuteronomy 3:4</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-10.htm">Deuteronomy 3:10</a>. The statement in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-17.htm">Ezekiel 47:17</a>, "the boundary from the sea shall be Hazar-Enon, the boundary of Damascus," cannot have any other meaning than that the northern boundary, which started from the Mediterranean Sea, stretched as far as Hazar-Enon, the frontier city of Damascus, or that Hazar-Enon formed the terminal point on the east, toward the boundary of Damascus, for the northern boundary proceeding from the sea. &#1495;&#1510;&#1512; &#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1503; or &#1495;&#1510;&#1512; &#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1503; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/34-9.htm">Numbers 34:9</a>), i.e., spring-court, we have endeavoured to identify in the comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/34-3.htm">Numbers 34:3</a> with the spring Lebweh, which lies in the Beka at the watershed between the Orontes and the Leontes; and the designation "the boundary of Damascus" suits the situation very well. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-17.htm">Ezekiel 47:17</a> has been aptly explained by Hitzig thus, in accordance with the literal meaning of the words, "and as for the north north-wards, Hamath is the boundary," which he further elucidates by observing that &#1510;&#1508;&#1493;&#1504;&#1492; is intended as a supplementary note to the boundary line from west to east, which is indicated just before. &#1493;&#1488;&#1514; &#1508;&#1468;&#1488;&#1514; &#1510;&#1508;&#1493;&#1503; is a concluding formula: "this, the north side." But &#1493;&#1488;&#1514; (here and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-18.htm">Ezekiel 47:18</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-19.htm">Ezekiel 47:19</a>) is not to be altered into &#1494;&#1488;&#1514; after <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-20.htm">Ezekiel 47:20</a> and the Syriac version, as Hitzig supposes, but to be explained, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-18.htm">Ezekiel 47:18</a> clearly shows, on the supposition that Ezekiel had &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;, "ye shall measure," floating before his mind, to which '&#1493;&#1488;&#1514; &#1508;, "and that the northern boundary," would form a correct logical sequel.<p>The eastern boundary is defined in v. 18 in the same manner as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/34-10.htm">Numbers 34:10-12</a>, except that in the latter it is more minutely described above the Lake of Gennesaret by the mention of several localities, whereas Ezekiel only names the Jordan as the boundary. - &#1508;&#1468;&#1488;&#1514; , with supplementary remarks, is not to be taken as the predicate to the subject &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1512;&#1491;&#1468;&#1503;, as Hitzig has correctly observed; for the meaning of &#1508;&#1468;&#1488;&#1492; does not allow of this. The explanation is rather this: as for the east side, between Hauran, etc. and the land of Israel, is the Jordan. Hauran, Damascus, and Gilead lie on the east side of the Jordan, the land of Israel on the west side. The striking circumstance that Ezekiel commences with Hauran, which lay in the middle between Damascus and Gilead, - Hauran, Damascus, and Gilead, instead of Damascus, Hauran, and Gilead, - may probably be explained from the fact that the Jordan, which he names as the boundary, for the sake of brevity, did not extend so far upwards as to the territory of Damascus, but simply formed the boundary of the land of Israel between Hauran and Gilead. &#1502;&#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500; points back to the northern boundary already mentioned. From this boundary, the eastern terminal point of which was Hazar-Enon, they are to measure to the eastern sea, i.e., to the Dead Sea.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-19.htm">Ezekiel 47:19</a>. The southern boundary toward the south is to proceed from Tamar to the water of strife, Kadesh, (and thence) along the brook to the great (i.e., Mediterranean) sea. Tamar, a different place from Hazazon-tamar, called Engedi in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-10.htm">Ezekiel 47:10</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-2.htm">2 Chronicles 20:2</a>), is supposed to be the Thamara (&#x398;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;),<p>(Note: The statement runs thus: &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#769; &#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x398;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769; &#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b7; &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1; &#x39c;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c8;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#788;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;, &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3a7;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x391;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bc;, &#x3b7;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;. In Jerome: est et aliud castellum, unius diei itinere a Mampsis oppido separatum, pergentibus Ailiam de Chebron, ubi nunc romanum praesidium positum est. But on account of the &#x39c;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c8;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; (Mampsis), which is evidently a corruption, the passage is obscure. Robinson's conjecture concerning Thamara is founded upon the assumption that the reading should be &#x39c;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, and that this is the Malatha mentioned by later writers as the station of a Roman cohort.)<p>which was a day's journey on the road from Hebron to Aelam (Aelath, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-8.htm">Deuteronomy 2:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-26.htm">1 Kings 9:26</a>), according to Eusebius in the Onomast. ed. Lars. p. 68, and had a Roman garrison; and Robinson (Pal. III pp. 178 and 186ff.) accordingly conjectures that it is to be found in the ruins of Kurnub, which lie six hours' journey to the south of Milh, toward the pass of es-Sufh. But this conjecture is bound up with various assumptions of a very questionable character, and the situation of Hurnub hardly suits the Tamar of our passage, which should be sought, not to the west of the southern point of the Dead Sea, but, according to the southern boundary of Canaan as drawn in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/34-3.htm">Numbers 34:3-5</a>, to the south of the Dead Sea. The waters of strife of Kadesh (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/20-1.htm">Numbers 20:1-13</a>), in the desert of Zin, were near Kadesh-barnea, which was in the neighbourhood of the spring Ain Kades, discovered by Rowland to the south of Bir-Seba and Khalasa by the fore-courts of Jebel Helal, i.e., at the north-west corner of the mountain land of the Azazimeh (see the comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/10-12.htm">Numbers 10:12</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/12-16.htm">Numbers 12:16</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-16.htm">Numbers 20:16</a>). Instead of &#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514; we have the singular &#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1489;&#1514; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-28.htm">Ezekiel 48:28</a>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/27-14.htm">Numbers 27:14</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-51.htm">Deuteronomy 32:51</a>. &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1492; is to be pointed &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1492;, from &#1504;&#1495;&#1500; with &#1492; loc.; and the reference is to the brook of Egypt; the great wady el-Arish ( &#788;&#x3a1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;), along which the southern boundary of Canaan ran from Kadesh to the Mediterranean Sea (see the comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-5.htm">Ezekiel 34:5</a>). - <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-20.htm">Ezekiel 47:20</a>. The Mediterranean Sea formed the western boundary. &#1502;&#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;, i.e., from the southern boundary mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-19.htm">Ezekiel 47:19</a> till opposite (&#1506;&#1491;) to the coming to Hamath, i.e., till opposite to the point at which one enters the territory of Hamath (Hitzig), i.e., the spot mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-20.htm">Ezekiel 47:20</a> (? 17) as the commencement of the northern boundary in the neighbourhood of the promontory of esh-Shkah between Byblus (Gebal) and Tripolis. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-21.htm">Ezekiel 47:21</a>. This land they are to divide among them according to their tribes. With this remark, which points back to <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-13.htm">Ezekiel 47:13</a>, the definition of the boundaries is brought to a close. There is simply added in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-22.htm">Ezekiel 47:22</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-23.htm">Ezekiel 47:23</a> a further regulation concerning the foreigners living in Israel. The law of Moses had already repeatedly urged upon the Israelites affectionate treatment of them, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-34.htm">Leviticus 19:34</a> the command is given to treat them like natives in this respect, and to love them. But the full right of citizenship was not thereby conceded to them, so that they could also acquire property in land. The land was given to the Israelites alone for an hereditary possession. Foreigners could only be incorporated into the congregation of Israel under the limitations laid down in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-2.htm">Deuteronomy 23:2-9</a>, by the reception of circumcision. But in the future distribution of the land, on the contrary, the &#1490;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; were to receive hereditary property like native-born Israelites; and in this respect no difference was to exist between the members of the people of God born of Abraham's seed and those born of the heathen. At the same time, this right was not to be conferred upon every foreigner who might be only temporarily living in Israel, but to those alone who should beget sons in the midst of Israel, i.e., settle permanently in the holy land. The Kal &#1497;&#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468; is not to be altered into the Hiphil &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;, as Hitzig proposes, but is used in the sense of receiving by lot, derived from the Hiphil signification, "to apportion by lot." </body></html>
