Probably Nebuchadnezzar thought that He stood to Jehovah in the same relation that he himself did to Merodach. His conceptions of the power of Jehovah were evidently raised by what he had witnessed, though as yet he does not recognise Him as being more than a chief among gods. He has not risen to that conception of the unity of God which is essential to His absolute supremacy. But still the question has to be answered, What did the king see? The early Patristic interpretation was that. it was none other than Christ Himself. We have no means of ascertaining anything further, and must be content with knowing that the same “Angel of God’s presence” who was with Israel in the wilderness watched over the people in Babylon.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:19-27 Let Nebuchadnezzar heat his furnace as hot as he can, a few minutes will finish the torment of those cast into it; but hell-fire tortures, and yet does not kill. Those who worshipped the beast and his image, have no rest, no pause, no moment free from pain, Re 14:10,11. Now was fulfilled in the letter that great promise, Isa 43:2, When thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned. Leaving it to that God who preserved them in the fire, to bring them out, they walked up and down in the midst, supported and encouraged by the presence of the Son of God. Those who suffer for Christ, have his presence in their sufferings, even in the fiery furnace, and in the valley of the shadow of death. Nebuchadnezzar owns them for servants of the most high God; a God able to deliver them out of his hand. It is our God only is the consuming fire, Heb 12:29. Could we but see into the eternal world, we should behold the persecuted believer safe from the malice of his foes, while they are exposed to the wrath of God, and tormented in unquenchable fires.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/daniel/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose - From the fact that he saw these men now loose, and that this filled him with so much surprise, it may be presumed that they had been bound with something that was not combustible - with some sort of fetters or chains. In that case it would be a matter of surprise that they should be "loose," even though they could survive the action of the fire. The "fourth" personage now so mysteriously added to their number, it is evident, assumed the appearance of a "man," and not the appearance of a celestial being, though it was the aspect of a man so noble and majestic that he deserved to be called a son of God.<p>Walking in the midst of the fire - The furnace, therefore, was large, so that those who were in it could walk about. The vision must have been sublime; and it is a beautiful image of the children of God often walking unhurt amidst dangers, safe beneath the Divine protection.<p>And they have no hurt - Margin, "There is no hurt in them." They walk unharmed amidst the flames. Of course, the king judged in this only from appearances, but the result <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/3-27.htm">Daniel 3:27</a> showed that it was really so.<p>And the form of the fourth - Chaldee, (&#1512;&#1493;&#1492;  re&#772;ve&#772;h) - "his appearance" (from &#1512;&#1488;&#1492;  ra&#770;'a&#770;h - "to see"); that is, he "seemed" to be a son of God; he "looked" like a son of God. The word does not refer to anything special or peculiar in his "form" or "figure," but it may be supposed to denote something that was noble or majestic in his mien; something in his countenance and demeanour that declared him to be of heavenly origin.<p>Like the son of God - There are two inquiries which arise in regard to this expression: one is, what was the idea denoted by the phrase as used by the king, or who did he take this personage to be? the other, who he actually was? In regard to the former inquiry, it may be observed, that there is no evidence that the king referred to him to whom this title is so frequently applied in the New Testament, the Lord Jesus Christ. This is clear<p>(1) because there is no reason to believe that the king had "any" knowledge whatever that there would be on earth one to whom this title might be appropriately given;<p>(2) there is no evidence that the title was then commonly given to the Messiah by the Jews, or, if it was, that the king of Babylon was so versed in Jewish theology as to be acquainted with it; and<p>(3) the language which he uses does not necessarily imply that, even "if" he were acquainted with the fact that there was a prevailing expectation that such a being would appear on the earth, he designed so to use it.<p>The insertion of the article "the," which is not in the Chaldee, gives a different impression from what the original would if literally interpreted. There is nothing in the Chaldee to limit it to "any" "son of God," or to designate anyone to whom that term could be applied as peculiarly intended. It would seem probable that our translators meant to convey the idea that ""the" Son of God" peculiarly was intended, and doubtless they regarded this as one of his appearances to men before his incarnation; but it is clear that no such conception entered into the mind of the king of Babylon. The Chaldee is simply, &#1500;&#1489;&#1512;&#1470;&#1488;&#1500;&#1495;&#1497;&#1503; &#1491;&#1502;&#1492;  da&#770;me&#772;h lebar 'e&#774;la&#770;h&#305;&#770;yn - "like to A son of God," or to a son of the gods - since the word &#1488;&#1500;&#1495;&#1497;&#1503;  'e&#774;la&#770;h&#305;&#770;yn (Chaldee), or &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501;  'e&#774;loh&#305;&#770;ym (Hebrew), though often, and indeed usually applied to the true God, is in the plural number, and in the mouth of a pagan would properly be used to denote the gods that he worshipped.<p>The article is not prefixed to the word "son," and the language would apply to anyone who might properly be called a son of God. The Vulgate has literally rendered it, "like to A son of God" - similis filio Dei; the Greek in the same way - &#x3bf;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;  homoia huio&#772; theou; the Syriac is like the Chaldee; Castellio renders it, quartus formam habet Deo nati similem - "the fourth has a form resembling one born of God;" Coverdale "the fourth is like an angel to look upon;" Luther, more definitely, und der vierte ist gleich, als ware er ein Sohn der Gotter - "and the fourth as if he might be "a" son of the gods." It is clear that the authors of none of the other versions had the idea which our translators supposed to be conveyed by the text, and which implies that the Babylonian monarch "supposed" that the person whom he saw was the one who afterward became incarnate for our redemption.<p>In accordance with the common well-known usage of the word "son" in the Hebrew and Chaldee languages, it would denote anyone who had a "resemblance" to another, and would be applied to any being who was of a majestic or dignified appearance, and who seemed worthy to be ranked among the gods. It was usual among the pagan to suppose that the gods often appeared in a human form, and probably Nebuchadnezzar regarded this as some such celestial appearance. If it be supposed that he regarded it as some manifestation connected with the "Hebrew" form of religion, the most that would probably occur to him would be, that it was some "angelic" being appearing now for the protection of these worshippers of Jehovah. But a second inquiry, and one that is not so easily answered, in regard to this mysterious personage, arises. Who in fact "was" this being that appeared in the furnace for the protection of these three persecuted men?<p>Was it an angel, or was it the second person of the Trinity, "the" Son of God? That this was the Son of God - the second person of the Trinity, who afterward became incarnate, has been quite a common opinion of expositors. So it was held by Tertullian, by Augustine, and by Hilary, among the fathers; and so it has been held by Gill, Clarius, and others, among the moderns. Of those who have maintained that it was Christ, some have supposed that Nebuchadnezzar had been made acquainted with the belief of the Hebrews in regard to the Messiah; others, that he spoke under the influence of the Holy Spirit, without being fully aware of what his words imported, as Caiaphas, Saul, Pilate, and others have done. - Poole's "Synopsis." The Jewish writers Jarchi, Saadias, and Jacchiades suppose that it was an angel, called a son of God, in accordance with the usual custom in the Scriptures. That this latter is the correct opinion, will appear evident, though there cannot be exact certainty, from the following considerations:<p>(1) The language used implies necessarily nothing more. Though it "might" indeed be applicable to the Messiah - the second person of the Trinity, if it could be determined from other sources that it was he, yet there is nothing in the language which necessarily suggests this.<p>(2) In the explanation of the matter by Nebuchadnezzar himself <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/3-28.htm">Daniel 3:28</a>, he understood it to be an angel - "Blessed be the God of Shadrach, etc., "who hath sent his angel,"" etc. This shows that he had had no other view of the subject, and that he had no higher knowledge in the case than to suppose that he was an angel of God. The knowledge of the existence of angels was so common among the ancients, that there is no improbability in supposing that Nebuchadnezzar was sufficiently instructed on this point to know that they were sent for the protection of the good.<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/daniel/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>25. four&#8212;whereas but three had been cast in.<p>loose&#8212;whereas they had been cast in "bound." Nebuchadnezzar's question, in Da 3:24, is as if he can scarcely trust his own memory as to a fact so recent, now that he sees through an aperture in the furnace what seems to contradict it.<p>walking in &#8230; midst of &#8230; fire&#8212;image of the godly unhurt, and at large (Joh 8:36), "in the midst of trouble" (Ps 138:7; compare Ps 23:3, 4). They walked up and down in the fire, not leaving it, but waiting for God's time to bring them out, just as Jesus waited in the tomb as God's prisoner, till God should let Him out (Ac 2:26, 27). So Paul (2Co 12:8, 9). So Noah waited in the ark, after the flood, till God brought him forth (Ge 8:12-18).<p>like the Son of God&#8212;Unconsciously, like Saul, Caiaphas (Joh 11:49-52), and Pilate, he is made to utter divine truths. "Son of God" in his mouth means only an "angel" from heaven, as Da 3:28 proves. Compare Job 1:6; 38:7; Ps 34:7, 8; and the probably heathen centurion's exclamation (Mt 27:54). The Chaldeans believed in families of gods: Bel, the supreme god, accompanied by the goddess Mylitta, being the father of the gods; thus the expression he meant: one sprung from and sent by the gods. Really it was the "messenger of the covenant," who herein gave a prelude to His incarnation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/daniel/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">I see; </span> the fire gave light to see them, though it had no power of heat to burn them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Like the Son of God; </span> a Divine, most beautiful, and glorious countenance; either of a mere angel, or rather of Jesus Christ, the Angel of the covenant, who did sometimes appear in the Old Testament before his incarnation, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-7.htm" title="And the LORD appeared to Abram, and said, To your seed will I give this land: and there built he an altar to the LORD, who appeared to him.">Genesis 12:7</a> 18:10,13,17,20 Exo 23:23 33:2 <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/joshua/5-13.htm" title="And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand: and Joshua went to him, and said to him, Are you for us, or for our adversaries?...">Joshua 5:13-15</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-31.htm" title="Rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth; and my delights were with the sons of men.">Proverbs 8:31</a></span>; in all which places it is Jehovah; <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-24.htm" title="Then the LORD rained on Sodom and on Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the LORD out of heaven;">Genesis 19:24</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-2.htm" title="And the angel of the LORD appeared to him in a flame of fire out of the middle of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed.">Exodus 3:2</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-30.htm" title="And when forty years were expired, there appeared to him in the wilderness of mount Sina an angel of the Lord in a flame of fire in a bush.">Acts 7:30</a>,32,33,38</span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/daniel/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>He answered and said, lo, I see four men loose,.... Not bound as the three were, when cast in; but quite at liberty in their hands and feet, and separate from one another. As this fiery furnace may be an emblem of the fiery trials and afflictive dispensations the children of God pass through in this world, being not joyous, but grievous to the flesh, though useful to purge and purify; so this and some other circumstances attending these good men in the furnace are applicable to the saints in such cases; for though afflictions are sometimes themselves called cords, with which men are said to be bound, yet by means of them they are loosed from other things from the power and prevalence of sin over them; from the world, and the things of it, they sometimes too much cleave and are glued unto; from a spirit of bondage, and from doubts and fears; their hearts under them being comforted and enlarged with the love of God; he knowing, visiting, and choosing them in the furnace of affliction; or making known himself to them, his love and choice of them; whereby their souls are set at liberty, and the graces of his Spirit are drawn forth into a lively exercise, through his love being shed abroad in them. <p>Walking in the midst of the fire; the furnace being large enough to walk in, and where they took their walks as in a garden; nor were they concerned to come out of it; nor uneasy at being in it; the violence of the fire being quenched, as the apostle says, referring to this instance, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-34.htm">Hebrews 11:34</a>. Saadiah says, the angel Gabriel, who is over the hail, came and cooled the fire of the furnace. So afflictions are a path to walk in, the narrow way to eternal life, through which all must enter the kingdom of heaven, of which there will be an end. Walking in it supposes strength, which God gives his people at such seasons; and when they have his presence they are unconcerned; none or these things move them, nor can they separate them from the love of Christ; they walk on with pleasure and delight, sing the praises of God, as did Paul and Silas in a prison, and as many martyrs have done in the flames: conversing with Christ, and with his people, they pass on, and pass through the more cheerfully, and are not anxious about their deliverance, but leave it with God to work it in his own time and way; nay, are ready to say with the disciples, it is good for them to be here; and indeed it was better for these good men to be with Christ in the fiery furnace, than to be with Nebuchadnezzar in his palace without him. <p>And they have no hurt; either in their bodies, or in their garments, neither of them being burnt; they suffered no pain in the one, nor loss in the other. Afflictions do no hurt to the people of God; not to their persons, which are safe in Christ, and to whom he is a hiding place and covert, as from the storm and tempest, so from the force of fire, that it shall not kindle upon them to hurt them; nor to their graces, which are tried, refined, and brightened hereby; faith is strengthened, hope is encouraged, and love made to abound. All the afflictions of the saints are in love, and are designed for good, and do work together for good to them that love God; they are sometimes for their temporal, and often for their spiritual good, and always work for them an exceeding weight of glory. <p>And the form of the fourth is like the Son of God; like one of the angels, who are called the sons of God; so Jarchi, Saadiah, and Jacchiades; but many of the ancient Christian writers interpret it of Christ the Son of God, whom Nebuchadnezzar, though a Heathen prince, might have some knowledge of from Daniel and other Jews in his court, of whom he had heard them speak as a glorious Person; and this being such an one, he might conclude it was he, or one like to him; and it is highly probable it was he, since it was not unusual for him to appear in a human form, and to be present with his people, as he often is with them, and even in the furnace of affliction; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-2.htm">Isaiah 43:2</a>, to sympathize with them; to revive and comfort them; to bear them up and support them; to teach and instruct them, and at last to deliver them out of their afflictions. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/daniel/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the form of the fourth is like the <span class="cverse3">{k}</span> Son of God.</span><p>(k) For the angels were called the sons of God because of their excellency.

From the fact that ver. 24 ends with <span class="accented">malka</span>, it may have been dropped out of the Masse-retie text. The insertion of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5e0;&#x5d4;</span> ('<span class="accented">ana</span>), "answered," may be due to the frequent recurrence of this phrase. The Peshitta omits "four," otherwise agreeing with the Massoretic. The phrase," the Son of God," is clearly wrong; the correct translation is, "The appearance of the fourth is like a son of the gods." Along with the three victims of his superstition was seen a fourth figure, like one of the figures portrayed on his palace walls as belonging to the demi-gods. This is the culmination of the king's astonishment. It was astonishing to see those men loose that had been east into the furnace bound; still more so to see them walking, and none showing signs of having received any hurt; but most awe-inspiring of all is the vision of the fourth figure, like a son of the gods. We must not interpret this on Hebrew lines, as does Mr. Bevan, and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-2.htm">Genesis 6:2</a>. He knows the usage in the Tar-gums is to retain the Hebrew plural in <span class="hebrew">&#x5be;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> when "God" is meant, as in the Peshitta Version of the passage he refers to. As in most heathen mythologies, there were not only gods, but demi-gods, of several different classes. The god Nebuchadnezzar specially worshipped, Silik-Moulou-ki (Marduk), was regarded as the son of Hea. There was a god of fire also, who was associated with these. The suggestion of Dr. Fuller, that here in <span class="accented">bar</span> we have not the word for "son," but rather a truncated form of this god of fire, Iz-bar, is worthy of consideration. It is impossible to say whether Ibis vision of a divine being was vouchsafed to those standing about Nebuchadnezzar as well as to himself. While we ought to guard against ascribing to the Babylonian monarch the idea that this appearance was that of the Second Person of the Christian Trinity, we are ourselves at liberty to maintain this, or to hold that it was an angel who strengthened these servants of God in the furnace.

And on the boundary of Judah from the east side to the west side shall be the heave, which ye shall lift (heave) off, five and twenty thousand (rods) in breadth, and the length like every tribe portion from the east side to the west side; and the sanctuary shall be in the midst of it. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-9.htm">Ezekiel 48:9</a>. The heave which ye shall lift (heave) for Jehovah shall be five and twenty thousand in length and ten thousand in breadth. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-10.htm">Ezekiel 48:10</a>. And to these shall the holy heave belong, to the priests, toward the north, five and twenty thousand; toward the west, breadth ten thousand; toward the east, breadth ten thousand; and toward the south, length five and twenty thousand; and the sanctuary of Jehovah shall be in the middle of it. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-11.htm">Ezekiel 48:11</a>.

And the five thousand which remain in the breadth along the five and twenty thousand are common land for the city for dwellings and for open space; and the city shall be in the centre of it. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-16.htm">Ezekiel 48:16</a>. And these are its measures: the north side four thousand five hundred, the south side four thousand five hundred, the east side four thousand five hundred, and the west side four thousand five hundred. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-17.htm">Ezekiel 48:17</a>.

And the remainder in length parallel with the holy heave, ten thousand toward the east and ten thousand toward the west, this shall be beside the holy heave, and its produce shall serve the workmen of the city for food. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-19.htm">Ezekiel 48:19</a>. And as for the workmen of the city, they shall cultivate it from all the tribes. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-20.htm">Ezekiel 48:20</a>. The whole of the heave is five and twenty thousand by five and twenty thousand; a fourth of the holy heave shall ye take for the possession of the city. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-21.htm">Ezekiel 48:21</a>. And the remainder shall belong to the prince on this side and on that side of the holy heave and of the city possession; along the five and twenty thousand of the heave to the eastern boundary, and toward the west along the five and twenty thousand to the western boundary parallel with the tribe portions, it shall belong to the prince; and the holy heave and the sanctuary of the house shall be in the midst. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-22.htm">Ezekiel 48:22</a>. Thus from the possession of the Levites (as) from the possession of the city shall that which lies in the midst of what belongs to the prince between the territory of Judah and the territory of Benjamin belong to the prince. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-23.htm">Ezekiel 48:23</a>. And the rest of the tribes are from the east side to the west side: Benjamin one. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-24.htm">Ezekiel 48:24</a>. And on the boundary of Benjamin from the east side to the west side: Simeon one. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-25.htm">Ezekiel 48:25</a>. And on the boundary of Simeon from the east side to the west side: Issachar one. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-26.htm">Ezekiel 48:26</a>.

And on the boundary of Zebulon from the east side to the west side: Gad one. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-28.htm">Ezekiel 48:28</a>. And on the boundary of Gad on the south side toward the south, the boundary shall be from Tamar to the water of strife from Kadesh along the brook to the great sea. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-29.htm">Ezekiel 48:29</a>. This is the land which ye shall divide by lot for inheritance to the tribes of Israel; these are their portions, is the saying of the Lord Jehovah.<p>The new division of the land differs from the former one effected in the time of Joshua, in the first place, in the fact that all the tribe-portions were to extend uniformly across the entire breadth of the land from the eastern boundary to the Mediterranean Sea on the west, so that they were to form parallel tracts of country; whereas in the distribution made in the time of Joshua, several of the tribe-territories covered only half the breadth of the land. For example, Dan received his inheritance on the west of Benjamin; and the territories of half Manasseh and Asher ran up from the northern boundary of Ephraim to the northern boundary of Canaan; while Issachar, Naphtali, and Zebulon received their portions on the east of these; and lastly, Simeon received his possession within the boundaries of the tribe of Judah. And secondly, it also differs from the former, in the fact that not only are all the twelve tribes located in Canaan proper, between the Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea; whereas previously two tribes and a half had received from Moses, at their own request, the conquered land of Bashan and Gilead on the eastern side of the Jordan, so that the land of Canaan could be divided among the remaining nine tribes and a half. But besides this, the central tract of land, about the fifth part of the whole, was separated for the holy heave, the city domain, and the prince's land, so that only the northern and southern portions, about four-fifths of the whole, remained for distribution among the twelve tribes, seven tribes receiving their hereditary portions to the north of the heave and five to the south, because the heave was so selected that the city with its territory lay near the ancient Jerusalem. - In <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-1.htm">Ezekiel 48:1-7</a> the seven tribes which were to dwell on the north of the heave are enumerated. The principal points of the northern boundary, viz., the way to Chetlon and Hazar-Enon, the boundary of Damascus, are repeated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-1.htm">Ezekiel 48:1</a> from <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-15.htm">Ezekiel 47:15</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-17.htm">Ezekiel 47:17</a>, as the starting and terminal points of the northern boundary running from west to east. The words &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1497;&#1491; &#1495;&#1502;&#1514; fix the northern boundary more precisely in relation to the adjoining territory; and in '&#1493;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468;  the enumeration of the tribe-lots begins with that of the tribe of Dan, which was to receive its territory against the northern boundary. &#1500;&#1493; refers to the name &#1491;&#1468;&#1503; which follows, and which Ezekiel already had in his mind. &#1508;&#1468;&#1488;&#1514; &#1511;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1501; is constructed asyndeto&#770;s; and &#1508;&#1468;&#1488;&#1514; is to be repeated in thought before &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1501;: the east side (and) the west (side) are to belong to it, i.e., the tract of land toward its west and its east side. The words which follow, &#1491;&#1468;&#1503; &#1488;&#1495;&#1491;, are attached in an anacoluthistic manner: "Dan (is to receive) one portion," for "one shall belong to Dan." To &#1488;&#1495;&#1491; we are to supply in thought the substantive &#1495;&#1489;&#1500;, tribe-lot, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-13.htm">Ezekiel 47:13</a>. "The assumption that one tribe was to receive as much as another (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-14.htm">Ezekiel 47:14</a>), leads to the conclusion that each tribe-lot was to be taken as a monas" (Kliefoth). In this way the names in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-2.htm">Ezekiel 48:2-7</a>, with the constantly repeated &#1488;&#1495;&#1491;, must also be taken. The same form of description is repeated in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-23.htm">Ezekiel 48:23-28</a> in the case of the five tribes placed to the south of the heave. - In the order of the several tribe-territories it is impossible to discover any universal principle of arrangement. All that is clear is, that in the case of Dan, Asher, Naphtali, Manasseh, and Ephraim, regard is had to the former position of these tribe-territories as far as the altered circumstances allowed. In the time of the Judges a portion of the Danites had migrated to the north, conquered the city of Laish, and given it the name of Dan, so that from that time forward Dan is generally named as the northern boundary of the land (e.g., as early as <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-10.htm">2 Samuel 3:10</a>, and in other passages). Accordingly Dan receives the tract of land along the northern boundary. Asher and Naphtali, which formerly occupied the most northerly portions of the land, follow next. Then comes Manasseh, as half Manasseh had formerly dwelt on the east of Naphtali; and Ephraim joins Manasseh, as it formerly joined the western half of Manasseh. The reason for placing Reuben between Ephraim and Judah appears to be, that Reuben was the first-born of Jacob's sons. The position of the termuah between Judah and Benjamin is probably connected with the circumstance that Jerusalem formerly stood on the boundary of these two tribes, and so also in the future was to skirt Benjamin with its territory. The other tribes had then to be located on the south of Benjamin; Simeon, whose territory formerly lay to the south; Issachar and Zebulon, for which no room was left in the north; and Gad, which had to be brought over from Gilead to Canaan.<p>In <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-8.htm">Ezekiel 48:8-22</a>, the terumah, which has already been described in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-1.htm">Ezekiel 45:1-7</a> for a different purpose, is more precisely defined: first of all, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-8.htm">Ezekiel 48:8</a>, according to its whole extent - viz. twenty-five thousand rods in breadth (from north to south), and the length the same as any one ( equals  every one) of the tribe-lots, i.e., reaching from the Jordan to the Mediterranean Sea (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-7.htm">Ezekiel 45:7</a>). In the centre of this separated territory the sanctuary (the temple) was to stand. &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493;&#1499;&#1493;, the suffix of which refers ad sensum to &#1495;&#1500;&#1511; instead of &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492;, has not the indefinite meaning "therein," but signifies "in the centre;" for the priests' portion, in the middle of which the temple was to stand, occupied the central position between the portion of the Levites and the city possession, as is evident from <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-22.htm">Ezekiel 48:22</a>. The circumstance that here, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-1.htm">Ezekiel 45:1</a>., in the division of the terumah, the priests' portion is mentioned first, then the portion of the Levites, and after this the city possession, proves nothing so far as the local order in which these three portions followed one another is concerned; but the enumeration is regulated by their spiritual significance, so that first of all the most holy land for the temple and priests is defined, then the holy portion of the Levites, and lastly, the common land for the city. The command, that the sanctuary is to occupy the centre of the whole terumah, leads to a more minute description in the first place (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-9.htm">Ezekiel 48:9-12</a>) of the priests' portion, in which the sanctuary was situated, than of the heave to be lifted off for Jehovah. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-10.htm">Ezekiel 48:10</a>, &#1500;&#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;, which stands at the head, is explained by &#1500;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; which follows. The extent of this holy terumah on all four sides is then given; and lastly, the command is repeated, that the sanctuary of Jehovah is to be in the centre of it. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-11.htm">Ezekiel 48:11</a>, &#1492;&#1502;&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473; is rendered in the plural by the lxx, Chald. and Syr., and is taken in a distributive sense by Kimchi and others: to the priests whoever is sanctified of the sons of Zadok. This is required by the position of the participle between &#1500;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; and &#1502;&#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1510;&#1491;&#1493;&#1511; (compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-18.htm">2 Chronicles 26:18</a>, and for the singular of the participle after a previous plural, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/8-9.htm">Psalm 8:9</a>). The other rendering, "for the priests is it sanctified, those of the sons of Zadok," is at variance not only with the position of the words, but also with the fact, namely, that the assignment to the priests of a heave set apart for Jehovah is never designated as &#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;, and from the nature of the case could not be so designated. The apodosis to <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-11.htm">Ezekiel 48:11</a> follows in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-12.htm">Ezekiel 48:12</a>, where &#1500;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; is resumed in &#1500;&#1492;&#1501;. &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; is an adjective formation derived from &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492;, with the signification of an abstract: that which is lifted (the lifting) from the heave, as it were "a terumah in the second potency" (for these formations, see Ewald, 164 and 165). This terumiyah is called most holy, in contrast with the Levites' portion of the terumah, which was &#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-14.htm">Ezekiel 48:14</a>). The priests' portion is to be beside the territory of the Levites, whether on the southern or northern side cannot be gathered from these words any more than from the definition in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-13.htm">Ezekiel 48:13</a> : "and the Levites beside (parallel with) the territory of the priests." Both statements simply affirm that the portions of the priests and Levites were to lie side by side, and not to be separated by the town possession. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-13.htm">Ezekiel 48:13</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-14.htm">Ezekiel 48:14</a> treat of the Levites' portion: <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-13.htm">Ezekiel 48:13</a>, of its situation and extent; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-14.htm">Ezekiel 48:14</a>, of its law of tenure. The seemingly tautological repetition of the measurement of the length and breadth, as "all the length and the breadth," is occasioned by the fact "that Ezekiel intends to express himself more briefly here, and not, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-10.htm">Ezekiel 48:10</a>, to take all the four points of the compass singly; in 'all the length' he embraces the two long sides of the oblong, and in '(all) the breadth' the two broad sides, and affirms that 'all the length,' i.e., of both the north and south sides, is to be twenty-five thousand rods, and 'all the breadth,' i.e., of both the east and west sides, is to be ten thousand rods" (Kliefoth). Hitzig has missed the sense, and therefore proposes to alter the text. With regard to the possession of the Levites, the instructions given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-34.htm">Leviticus 25:34</a> for the field of the Levites' cities - namely, that none of it was to be sold - are extended to the whole of the territory of the Levites: no part of it is to be alienated by sale or barter. And the character of the possession is assigned as the reason: the first-fruit of the land, i.e., the land lifted off (separated) as first-fruit, is not to pass into the possession of others, because as such it is holy to the Lord. The Chetib ya`abowr &#1497;&#1506;&#1489;&#1493;&#1512; is the correct reading: to pass over, sc. to others, to non-Levites.<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-15.htm">Ezekiel 48:15-18</a> treat of the city possession. As the terumah was twenty-five thousand rods in breadth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-8.htm">Ezekiel 48:8</a>), after measuring off ten thousand rods in breadth for the priests and ten thousand rods in breadth for the Levites from the entire breadth, there still remain five thousand rods &#1506;&#1500;, in front of, i.e., along, the long side, which was twenty-five thousand rods. This remnant was to be &#1495;&#1500;, i.e., common (not holy) land for the city (Jerusalem). &#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;, for dwelling-places, i.e., for building dwelling-houses upon; and &#1500;&#1502;&#1490;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;, for open space, the precinct around the city. The city was to stand in the centre of this oblong. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-16.htm">Ezekiel 48:16</a> gives the size of the city: on each of the four sides, four thousand five hundred rods (the &#1495;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;, designated by the Masoretes as &#1499;&#1514;&#1497;&#1489; &#1493;&#1500;&#1488; &#1511;&#1512;&#1497;, has crept into the text through a copyist's error); and <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-17.htm">Ezekiel 48:17</a>, the extent of the open space surrounding it: on each side two hundred and fifty rods. This gives for the city, together with the open space, a square of five thousand rods on every side; so that the city with its precinct filled the entire breadth of the space left for it, and there only remained on the east and west an open space of ten thousand rods in length and five thousand rods in breadth along the holy terumah. This is noticed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-18.htm">Ezekiel 48:18</a>; its produce was to serve for bread, i.e., for maintenance, for the labourers of the city (the masculine suffix in &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1514;&#1492; refers grammatically to &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;&#1512;). By &#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1497; &#1492;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512; Hitzig would understand the inhabitants of the city, because one cultivates a piece of land even by dwelling on it. But this use of &#1506;&#1489;&#1491; cannot be established. Nor are &#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1497; &#1492;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512; the workmen employed in building the city, as Gesenius, Hvernick, and others suppose; for the city was not perpetually being built, so that there should be any necessity for setting apart a particular piece of land for the builders; but they are the working men of the city, the labouring class living in the city. They are not to be without possession in the future Jerusalem, but are to receive a possession in land for their maintenance. We are told in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-19.htm">Ezekiel 48:19</a> who these workmen are. Here &#1492;&#1506;&#1489;&#1491; is used collectively: as for the labouring class of the city, people out of all the tribes of Israel shall work upon the land belonging to the city. The suffix in &#1497;&#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; points back to &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;&#1512;. The transitive explanation, to employ a person in work, has nothing in the language to confirm it. The fact itself is in harmony with the statement in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-6.htm">Ezekiel 45:6</a>, that the city was to belong to all Israel. Lastly, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-20.htm">Ezekiel 48:20</a> the dimensions of the whole terumah, and the relation of the city possession to the holy terumah, are given. &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492; is the whole heave, so far as it has hitherto been described, embracing the property of the priests, of the Levites, and of the city. In this extent it is twenty-five thousand rods long and the same broad. If, however, we add the property of the prince, which is not treated of till <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-21.htm">Ezekiel 48:21-23</a>, it is considerably longer, and reaches, as has been stated in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-8.htm">Ezekiel 48:8</a>, to the boundaries of the land both on the east and west, the Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea, as the several tribe-territories do. But if we omit the prince's land, the space set apart fro the city possession occupied the fourth part of the holy terumah, i.e., of the portion of the priests and Levites. This is the meaning of the second half of <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-20.htm">Ezekiel 48:20</a>, which literally reads thus: "to a fourth shall ye lift off the holy terumah for the city possession." This is not to be understood as meaning that a fourth was to be taken from the holy terumah for the city possession; for that would yield an incorrect proportion, as the twenty thousand rods in breadth would be reduced to fifteen thousand rods by the subtraction of the fourth part, which would be opposed to <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-9.htm">Ezekiel 48:9</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-15.htm">Ezekiel 48:15</a>. The meaning is rather the following: from the whole terumah the fourth part of the area of the holy terumah is to be taken off for the city possession, i.e., five thousand rods for twenty thousand. According to <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-15.htm">Ezekiel 48:15</a>, this was the size of the domain set apart for the city.<p>In <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-21.htm">Ezekiel 48:21-23</a> the situation and extent of the prince's possession are described. For <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-21.htm">Ezekiel 48:21</a>, vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-7.htm">Ezekiel 45:7</a>. &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;&#1512;, the rest of the terumah, as it has been defined in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-8.htm">Ezekiel 48:8</a>, reaching in length from the Jordan to the Mediterranean. As the holy terumah and the city possession were only twenty-five thousand rods in length, and did not reach to the Jordan on the east, or to the sea on the west, there still remained an area on either side whose length or extent toward the east and west is not given in rods, but may be calculated from the proportion which the intervening terumah bore to the length of the land (from east to west). &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; and &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;, in front of, or along, the front of the twenty-five thousand rods, refer to the eastern and western boundaries of the terumah, which was twenty-five thousand rods in length. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-21.htm">Ezekiel 48:21</a> the statement is repeated, that the holy terumah and the sanctuary were to lie in the centre of it, i.e., between the portions of land appointed for the prince on either side; and lastly, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-22.htm">Ezekiel 48:22</a> it is still further stated, with regard to the prince's land on both sides of the terumah, that it was to lie between the adjoining tribe-territories of Judah (to the north) and Benjamin (to the south), so that it was to be bounded by these two. But this is expressed in a heavy and therefore obscure manner. The words &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493;&#1498; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1500;&#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1488; &#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492;, "in the centre of that which belongs to the prince," belong to &#1492;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512;... &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1488;&#1495;&#1494;&#1468;&#1514;, and form together with the latter the subject, which is written absolutely; so that &#1502;&#1503; is not used in a partitive, but in a local sense (from), and the whole is to be rendered thus: And as for that which lies on the side of the possession of the Levites, and of the possession of the city in the centre of what belongs to the prince, (that which lies) between the territory of Judah and the territory of Benjamin shall belong to the prince. Hitzig's explanation - what remains between Judah and Benjamin, from the city territory to the priests' domain, both inclusive, shall belong to the prince - is arbitrary, and perverts the sense. The periphrastic designation of the terumah bounded off between the prince's land by the two portions named together without a copula, viz., "possession of the Levites and possession of the city," is worthy of notice. This periphrasis of the whole by two portions, shows that the portions named formed the boundaries of the whole, that the third portion, which is not mentioned, was enclosed within the two, so that the priests' portion with the sanctuary lay between them. - In <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-23.htm">Ezekiel 48:23-27</a> the rest of the tribes located to the south of the terumah are mentioned in order; and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-28.htm">Ezekiel 48:28</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-29.htm">Ezekiel 48:29</a> the account of the division of the land is brought to a close with a repetition of the statement as to the southern boundary (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-19.htm">Ezekiel 47:19</a>), and a comprehensive concluding formula.<p>If now we attempt, in order to form a clear idea of the relation in which this prophetic division of the land stands to the actual size of Canaan according to the boundaries described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-15.htm">Ezekiel 47:15</a>., to determine the length and breadth of the terumah given here by their geographical dimensions, twenty-five thousand rods, according to the metrological calculations of Boeckh and Bertheau, would be 1070 geographical miles, or, according to the estimate of the Hebrew cubit by Thenius, only 975 geographical miles.<p>(Note: According to Boeckh, one sacred cubit was equal to 234-1/3 Paris lines  equals  528.62 millimtres; according to Thenius  equals  214-1/2 P. l.  equals  481.62 millim. Now as one geographical mile, the 5400th part of the circumference of the globe, which is 40,000,000 metres, is equivalent to 7407.398 metres  equals  22, 803.290 old Paris feet, the geographical mile according to Boeckh is 14, 012-1/10 cubits  equals  2335-1/2 rods (sacred measure); according to Thenius, 15, 380-1/6 cubits  equals  2563-1/3 roads (s. m.), from which the numbers given in the text may easily be calculated.)<p>The extent of Canaan from Beersheba, or Kadesh, up to a line running across from Rs esh-Shukah to the spring El Lebweh, is 3 1/3 degrees, i.e., fifty geographical miles, ten of which are occupied by the terumah, and forty remain for the twelve tribe-territories, so that each tribe-lot would be 3 1/3 geographical miles in breadth. If, now, we reckon three geographical miles as the breadth of each of the five tribe-lots to the south of the terumah, and as the land becomes broader toward the south a breadth of 3-4/7 geographical miles for the seven tribe-lots to the north, the terumah set apart in the centre of the land would extend from the site of Jerusalem to Dothan or Jenin. If, however, we take into consideration the breadth of the land from east to west in the neighbourhood of Jerusalem, or where the Jordan enters the Dead Sea, Canaan is eleven geographical miles in breadth, whereas at Jenin it is hardly ten geographical miles broad. If, therefore, the length of the terumah (from east to west) was fully ten geographical miles, there would only remain a piece of land of half a mile in breadth on the east and west at the southern boundary, and nothing at all at the northern, for prince's land. We have therefore given to the terumah upon the map (Plate IV) the length and breadth of eight geographical miles, which leaves a tract of two miles on the average for the prince's land, so that it would occupy a fifth of the area of the holy terumah, whereas the city possession covered a fourth. No doubt the breadth of the terumah from south to north is also diminished thereby, so that it cannot have reached quite down to Jerusalem or quite up to Jenin. - If, now, we consider that the distances of places, and therefore also the measurements of a land in length and breadth, are greater in reality than those given upon the map, on account partly of the mountains and valleys and partly of the windings of the roads, and, still further, that our calculations of the Hebrew cubit are not quite certain, and that even the smaller estimates of Thenius are possibly still too high, the measurements of the terumah given by Ezekiel correspond as exactly to the actual size of the land of Canaan as could be expected with a knowledge of its extent obtained not by trigonometrical measurement, but from a simple calculation of the length of the roads. - But this furnishes a confirmation by no means slight of our assumption, that the lengths and breadths indicated here are measured by rods and not by cubits. Reckoned by cubits, the terumah would be only a mile and a half or a mile and two-thirds in length and breadth, and the city possession would be only a third of a mile broad; whereas the prince's land would be more than six times as larg</body></html>
