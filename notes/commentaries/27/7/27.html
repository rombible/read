The angel told Daniel plainly. He especially desired to know respecting the little horn, which made war with the saints, and prevailed against them. Here is foretold the rage of papal Rome against true Christians. St. John, in his visions and prophecies, which point in the first place at Rome, has plain reference to these visions. Daniel had a joyful prospect of the prevalence of God's kingdom among men. This refers to the second coming of our blessed Lord, when the saints shall triumph in the complete fall of Satan's kingdom. The saints of the Most High shall possess the kingdom for ever. Far be it from us to infer from hence, that dominion is founded on grace. It promises that the gospel kingdom shall be set up; a kingdom of light, holiness, and love; a kingdom of grace, the privileges and comforts of which shall be the earnest and first-fruits of the kingdom of glory. But the full accomplishment will be in the everlasting happiness of the saints, the kingdom that cannot be moved. The gathering together the whole family of God will be a blessedness of Christ's coming.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/daniel/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thus he said ... - That is, in explanation of the fourth symbol which appeared - the fourth beast, and of the events connected with his appearing. This explanation embraces the remainder of the chapter; and as the whole subject appeared difficult and momentous to Daniel before the explanation, so it may be said to be in many respects difficult, and in all respects momentous still. It is a question on which expositors of the Scriptures are by no means agreed, to what it refers, and whether it has been already accomplished, or whether it extends still into the future; and it is of importance, therefore, to determine, if possible, what is its true meaning. The two points of inquiry which are properly before us are, first, What do the words of explanation as used by the angel fairly imply - that is, what, according to the fair interpretation of these words, would be the course of events referred to, or what should we naturally expect to find as actually occurring on the earth in the fulfillment of this? and, secondly, To what events the prophecy is actually to be applied - whether to what has already occurred, or what is yet to occur; whether we can find anything in what is now past which would be an accomplishment of this, or whether it is to be applied to events a part of which are yet future? This will lead us into a statement of the points which it is affirmed would occur in regard to this kingdom: and then into an inquiry respecting the application.<p>What is fairly implied in the explanation of the angel? This would embrace the following points:<p>(1) There was to be a fourth kingdom on the earth: "the fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth," <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-23.htm">Daniel 7:23</a>. This was to succeed the other three, symbolized by the lion, the bear, and the leopard. No further reference is made to them, but the characteristics of this are fully stated. Those characteristics, which have been explained in the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/7-7.htm">Daniel 7:7</a>, are, as here repeated,<p>(a) that it would be in important respects different from the others;<p>(b) that it would devour, or subdue the whole earth;<p>(c) that it would tread it down and break it in pieces; that is, it would be a universal dynasty, of a fierce and warlike character, that would keep the whole world subdued and subject by power.<p>(2) out of this sovereignty or dominion, ten powers would arise <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-24.htm">Daniel 7:24</a> : "and the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall arise." Compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-7.htm">Daniel 7:7</a>. That is, they would spring out of this one dominion, or it would be broken up into these minor sovereignties, yet all manifestly springing from the one kingdom, and wielding the same power. We should not naturally look for the fulfillment of this in a succession of kings, for that would have been symbolized by the beast itself representing the entire dominion or dynasty, but rather to a number of contemporaneous powers that had somehow sprung out of the one power, or that now possessed and wielded the power of that one dominion. If the kingdom here referred to should be broken up into such a number of powers, or if in any way these powers became possessed of this authority, and wielded it, such a fact would express what we are to expect to find in this kingdom.<p>(3) From the midst of these sovereignties or kingdoms there was to spring up another one of peculiar characteristics, <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/7-24.htm">Daniel 7:24-25</a>. These characteristics are the following:<p>(a) That it would spring out of the others, or be, as it were, one form of the administration of the same power - as the eleventh horn sprang from the same source as the ten, and we are, therefore, to look for the exercise of this power somehow in connection with the same kingdom or dynasty.<p>(b) This would not spring up contemporaneously with the ten, but would arise "after them" - and we are to look for the power as in some sense succeeding them.<p>(c) It would be small at first - as was the horn <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/7-8.htm">Daniel 7:8</a>, and we are to look for the fulfillment in some power that would be feeble at first.<p>(d) It would grow to be a mighty power for the little horn became so powerful as to pluck up three of the others <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/7-8.htm">Daniel 7:8</a>, and it is said in the explanation <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/7-24.htm">Daniel 7:24</a>, that he would subdue three of the kings.<p>(e) It would subdue "three kings;" that is, three of the ten, and we are to look for the fulfillment in some manifestation of that power by which, either literally three of them were overthrown, or by which about one-third of their power was taken away. The mention of the exact number of "three," however, would rather seem to imply that we are to expect some such exact fulfillment, or some prostration of three sovereignties by the new power that would arise.<p>(f) It would be proud, and ambitious, and particularly arrogant against God: "and he shall speak great words against the Most High," <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-25.htm">Daniel 7:25</a>. The Chaldee here rendered against - &#1500;&#1510;&#1491;  letsad - means, literally, at, or against the part of it, and then against. Vulgate contra; Greek &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2;  pros. This would be fulfilled in one who would blaspheme God directly; or who would be rebellious against his government and authority; or who would complain of his administration and laws; or who would give utterance to harsh and reproachful words against his real claims. It would find a fulfillment obviously in an open opposer of the claims and the authority of the true God; or in one the whole spirit and bearing of whose pretensions might be fairly construed as in fact an utterance of great words against him.<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/daniel/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>27. greatness of the kingdom under &#8230; whole heaven&#8212;The power, which those several kingdoms had possessed, shall all be conferred on Messiah's kingdom. "Under &#8230; heaven" shows it is a kingdom on earth, not in heaven.<p>people of &#8230; saints of &#8230; Most High&#8212;"the people of the saints," or "holy ones" (Da 8:24, Margin): the Jews, the people to whom the saints stand in a peculiar relation. The saints are gathered out of Jews and Gentiles, but the stock of the Church is Jewish (Ro 9:24; 11:24); God's faithfulness to this election Church is thus virtually faithfulness to Israel, and a pledge of their future national blessing. Christ confirms this fact, while withholding the date (Ac 1:6, 7).<p>everlasting kingdom&#8212;If everlasting, how can the kingdom here refer to the millennial one? Answer: Daniel saw the whole time of future blessedness as one period. The clearer light of the New Testament distinguishes, in the whole period, the millennium and the time of the new heaven and new earth (compare Re 20:4 with Re 21:1 and Re 22:5). Christ's kingdom is "everlasting." Not even the last judgment shall end it, but only give it a more glorious appearance, the new Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven, with the throne of God and the Lamb in it (compare Re 5:9, 10; 11:15).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/daniel/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div><span class="bld">Verse 27</span>.

Not only the dominion that shall be taken away from the little horn or antichrist, and from all the antichristian states, but the dominion of all others throughout all the earth, and under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of God, and the true professors of faith in Christ. The kingdoms of this world will become Christ's, and Christian princes will be kings of them everywhere; and not only the royal power and authority will be vested with them, but all the grandeur and state belonging to them will be theirs; as well as all the saints in general shall reign in a spiritual manner with Christ, enjoying all ordinances, and all religious liberties, as well as civil, and be free from all persecutions. <p>Whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him; the people of the saints of the most High, all shall be subject to them, all dominions, and the governors of them; or Christ the head of them, under and with whom they reign.

Finally, all &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1496;&#1504;&#1497;, rulers, i.e., governors of provinces, prefects, who were subordinate to the chief governor, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/2-48.htm">Daniel 2:48-49</a>.<p>All these officers were summoned "to come (&#1502;&#1514;&#1488; from &#1488;&#1514;&#1488;, with the rejection of the initial )&#1488; to the dedication of the image." The objection of v. Leng. and Hitz., that this call would "put a stop to the government of the country," only shows their ignorance of the departments of the state-government, and by no means makes the narrative doubtful. The affairs of the state did not lie so exclusively in the hands of the presidents of the different branches of the government, as that their temporary absence should cause a suspension of all the affairs of government. &#1495;&#1504;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492; is used of the dedication of a house (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/20-5.htm">Deuteronomy 20:5</a>) as well as of the temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-63.htm">1 Kings 8:63</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-5.htm">2 Chronicles 7:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/6-16.htm">Ezra 6:16</a>), and here undoubtedly denotes an act connected with religious usages, by means of which the image, when the great officers of the kingdom fell down before it, was solemnly consecrated as the symbol of the world-power and (in the heathen sense) of its divine glory. This act is described (<a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/3-3.htm">Daniel 3:3-7</a>) in so far as the object contemplated rendered it necessary.<p>When all the great officers of state were assembled, a herald proclaimed that as soon as the sound of the music was heard, all who were present should, on pain of death by being cast into the fire, fall down before the image and offer homage to it; which they all did as soon as the signal was given. The form &#1511;&#1488;&#1502;&#1497;&#1503;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/3-3.htm">Daniel 3:3</a>, corresponds to the sing. &#1511;&#1488;&#1501; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-31.htm">Daniel 2:31</a>) as it is written in Syr., but is read &#1511;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1503;.

The expression &#1500;&#1511;&#1489;&#1500;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/3-3.htm">Daniel 3:3</a>, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/4-16.htm">Ezra 4:16</a>, is founded on &#1511;&#1489;&#1500;, the semi-vowel of the preceding sound being absorbed, as in the Syr. l-kebel.

The expression of the passive by means of a plural form of the active used impersonally, either participially or by 3rd pers. perf. plur., is found in Hebr., but is quite common in Chald.; cf. Ewald, Lehr. d. hebr. Spr. 128, b, and Winer, Chald. Gram. 49, 3. The proclamation of the herald refers not only to the officers who were summoned to the festival, but to all who were present, since besides the officers there was certainly present a great crowd of people from all parts of the kingdom, as M. Geier has rightly remarked, so that the assembly consisted of persons of various races and languages. &#1488;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488; denotes tribes of people, as the Hebr. &#1488;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492;, &#1488;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/25-16.htm">Genesis 25:16</a>, denotes the several tribes of Ishmael, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/25-15.htm">Numbers 25:15</a> the separate tribes of the Midianites, and is thus not so extensive in its import as &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503;, peoples. &#1500;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;, corresponding to &#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1514;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-18.htm">Isaiah 66:18</a>, designates (vide <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/10-5.htm">Genesis 10:5</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/10-20.htm">Genesis 10:20</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-31.htm">Genesis 10:31</a>) communities of men of the same language, and is not a tautology, since the distinctions of nation and of language are in the course of history frequently found. The placing together of the three words denotes all nations, however they may have widely branched off into tribes with different languages, and expresses the sense that no one in the whole kingdom should be exempted from the command. It is a mode of expression (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/3-7.htm">Daniel 3:7</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/3-29.htm">Daniel 3:29</a>, 31[4:1], and <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/6-26.htm">Daniel 6:26</a>[25]) specially characterizing the pathetic style of the herald and the official language of the world-kingdom, which Daniel also (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/5-19.htm">Daniel 5:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-14.htm">Daniel 7:14</a>) makes use of, and which from the latter passage is transferred to the Apocalypse, and by the union of these passages in Daniel with <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-18.htm">Isaiah 66:18</a> is increased to &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b7; (&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501; in Isa.), &#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;,&#769; &#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b3;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-9.htm">Revelation 5:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-7.htm">Revelation 13:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-6.htm">Revelation 14:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-15.htm">Revelation 17:15</a>).<p>In the same passage &#1494;&#1502;&#1504;&#1488; &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/3-7.htm">Daniel 3:7</a> (cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/3-8.htm">Daniel 3:8</a>), is interchanged with &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1491;&#1468;&#1504;&#1488;, at the time (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/3-5.htm">Daniel 3:5</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/3-15.htm">Daniel 3:15</a>); but it is to be distinguished from &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468;&#1470;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1488;, at the same moment, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/3-6.htm">Daniel 3:6</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/3-15.htm">Daniel 3:15</a>; for &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1488; or &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1492; has in the Bib.

In the enumeration also of the six names of the musical instruments with the addition: and all kinds of music, the pompous language of the world-ruler and of the herald of his power is well expressed. Regarding the Greek names of three of these instruments see p. 507. The great delight of the Babylonians in music and stringed instruments appears from <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-11.htm">Isaiah 14:11</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/137-3.htm">Psalm 137:3</a>, and is confirmed by the testimony of Herod. i. 191, and Curtius, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/3-3.htm">Daniel 3:3</a>. &#1511;&#1512;&#1504;&#1488;, horn, is the far-sounding tuba of the ancients, the &#1511;&#1512;&#1503; or &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1508;&#1512; of the Hebr.; see under <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/6-5.htm">Joshua 6:5</a>. &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1493;&#1511;&#1497;&#1514;&#1488;, from &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1511;, to hiss, to whistle, is the reed-flute, translated by the lxx and Theodot. &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3be;, the shepherd's or Pan's pipes, which consisted of several reeds of different thicknesses and of different lengths bound together, and, according to a Greek tradition (Pollux, iv. 9, 15), was invented by two Medes. &#1511;&#1497;&#1514;&#1514;&#1505; (according to the Kethiv; but the Keri and the Targ. and Rabbin. give the form &#1511;&#1514;&#1512;&#1505;) is the Greek &#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1; or &#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, harp, for the Greek ending &#x3b9;&#x3c2; becomes &#x3bf;&#x3c2; in the Aramaic, as in many similar cases; cf. Ges. Thes. p. 1215. &#1505;&#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1488;, corresponding to the Greek &#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;, but a Syrian invention, is, according to Athen. iv. p. 175, a four-stringed instrument, having a sharp, clear tone; cf. Ges. Thes. p. 935. &#1508;&#1468;&#1505;&#1504;&#1502;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1503; (in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/3-7.htm">Daniel 3:7</a> written with a  &#1496;instead of  &#1514;and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/3-10.htm">Daniel 3:10</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/3-15.htm">Daniel 3:15</a> pointed with a Tsere under the )&#1514; is the Greek &#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, of which the Greek ending &#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; becomes abbreviated in the Aram. into &#1497;&#1503;  (cf. Ges. Thes. p. 1116). The word has no etymology in the Semitic. It was an instrument like a harp, which according to Augustin (on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-2.htm">Psalm 33:2</a> [<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/32-2.htm">Psalm 32:2</a>] and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/43-4.htm">Psalm 43:4</a> [<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-4.htm">Psalm 42:4</a>) was distinguished from the cithara in this particular, that while the strings of the cithara passed over the sounding-board, those of the psalterium (or organon) were placed under it. Such harps are found on Egyptian (see Rosellini) and also on Assyrian monuments (cf. Layard, Ninev. and Bab., Table xiii. 4). &#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492;, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/3-10.htm">Daniel 3:10</a> &#1505;&#1497;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492;, is not derived from &#1505;&#1508;&#1503;, contignare, but is the Aramaic form of &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;, bag-pipes, which is called in Italy at the present day sampogna, and derives its Greek name from the accord of two pipes placed in the bag; cf. Ges. Thes. p. 941. &#1494;&#1502;&#1512;&#1488; signifies, not "song," but musical playing, from reemaz, to play the strings, &#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;; and because the music of the instrument was accompanied with song, it means also the song accompanying the music. The explanation of &#1494;&#1502;&#1512;&#1488; by singing stands here in opposition to the &#1494;&#1504;&#1497; &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;, since all sorts of songs could only be sung after one another, but the herald speaks of the simultaneous rise of the sound. The limiting of the word also to the playing on a stringed instrument does not fit the context, inasmuch as wind instruments are also named. Plainly in the words &#1494;&#1502;&#1512;&#1488; &#1494;&#1504;&#1497; &#1499;&#1468;&#1500; all the other instruments not particularly named are comprehended, so that &#1494;&#1502;&#1512;&#1488; is to be understood generally of playing on musical instruments. &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468;&#1470;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1488;, in the same instant. The frequent pleonastic use in the later Aramaic of the union of the preposition with a suffix anticipating the following noun, whereby the preposition is frequently repeated before the noun, as e.g., &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;&#1500; &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/5-12.htm">Daniel 5:12</a>, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/5-30.htm">Daniel 5:30</a>, has in the Bibl. Chald. generally a certain emphasis, for the pronominal suffix is manifestly used demonstratively, in the sense even this, even that.<p>Homage was commanded to be shown to the image under the pain of death to those who refused. Since "the dominion of Nebuchadnezzar was founded not by right, but by the might of conquest" (Klief.), and the homage which he commanded to be shown to the image was regarded not only as a proof of subjection under the power of the king, but comprehended in it also the recognition of his gods as the gods of the kingdom, instances of refusal were to be expected. In the demand of the king there was certainly a kind of religious oppression, but by no means, as Bleek, v. Leng., and other critics maintain, a religious persecution, as among heathen rulers Antiochus Epiphanes practised it. For so tolerant was heathenism, that it recognised the gods of the different nations; but all heathen kings required that the nations subdued by them should also recognise the gods of their kingdom, which they held to be more powerful than were the gods of the vanquished nations. A refusal to yield homage to the gods of the kingdom they regarded as an act of hostility against the kingdom and its monarch, while every one might at the same time honour his own national god. This acknowledgement, that the gods of the kingdom were the more powerful, every heathen could grant; and thus Nebuchadnezzar demanded nothing in a religious point of view which every one of his subjects could not yield. To him, therefore, the refusal of the Jews could not but appear as opposition to the greatness of his kingdom. But the Jews, or Israelites, could not do homage to the gods of Nebuchadnezzar without rejecting their faith that Jehovah alone was God, and that besides Him there were no gods. Therefore Nebuchadnezzar practised towards them, without, from his polytheistic standpoint, designing it, an intolerable religious coercion, which, whoever, is fundamentally different from the persecution of Judaism by Antiochus Epiphanes, who forbade the Jews on pain of death to serve their God, and endeavoured utterly to destroy the Jewish religion. - Regarding the structure of the fiery furnace, see under <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/3-22.htm">Daniel 3:22</a>.</body></html>
