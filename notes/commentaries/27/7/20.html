The angel told Daniel plainly. He especially desired to know respecting the little horn, which made war with the saints, and prevailed against them. Here is foretold the rage of papal Rome against true Christians. St. John, in his visions and prophecies, which point in the first place at Rome, has plain reference to these visions. Daniel had a joyful prospect of the prevalence of God's kingdom among men. This refers to the second coming of our blessed Lord, when the saints shall triumph in the complete fall of Satan's kingdom. The saints of the Most High shall possess the kingdom for ever. Far be it from us to infer from hence, that dominion is founded on grace. It promises that the gospel kingdom shall be set up; a kingdom of light, holiness, and love; a kingdom of grace, the privileges and comforts of which shall be the earnest and first-fruits of the kingdom of glory. But the full accomplishment will be in the everlasting happiness of the saints, the kingdom that cannot be moved. The gathering together the whole family of God will be a blessedness of Christ's coming.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/daniel/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And of the ten horns ... - See the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/7-7.htm">Daniel 7:7-8</a>.<p>Whose look was more stout than his fellows - literally, "whose aspect was greater than that of its companions." This does not mean that its look or aspect was more fierce or severe than that of the others, but that the appearance of the horn was greater - &#1512;&#1489;  rab. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/7-8.htm">Daniel 7:8</a>, this is described as a "little horn;" and to understand this, and reconcile the two, we must suppose that the seer watched this as it grew until it became the largest of the number. Three fell before it, and it outgrew in size all the others until it became the most prominent. This would clearly denote that the kingdom or the authority referred to by this eleventh horn would be more distinct and prominent than either of the others - would become so conspicuous and important as in fact to concentrate and embody all the power of the beast. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/daniel/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20. look &#8230; more stout than &#8230; fellows&#8212;namely, than that of the other horns.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/daniel/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">And of the ten horns; </span> what they meant. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Whose look was more stout than his fellows, </span> i.e. he had more power and more fierceness.

To the Chaldean king, Daniel appeared as a man in whom the gods manifested themselves; therefore he shows to him divine honour, such as was shown by Cornelius to the Apostle Peter, and at Lystra was shown to Paul and Barnabas, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-25.htm">Acts 10:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-13.htm">Acts 14:13</a>. &#1502;&#1504;&#1495;&#1492;, an unbloody sacrifice, and &#1504;&#1497;&#1495;&#1495;&#1497;&#1503;, are not burnt sacrifices or offerings of pieces of fat (Hitz.), but incensings, the offering of incense; cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/30-9.htm">Exodus 30:9</a>, where the &#1511;&#1496;&#1512;&#1514; is particularly mentioned along with the &#1506;&#1500;&#1492; and the &#1502;&#1504;&#1495;&#1492;. &#1504;&#1505;&#1468;&#1498; is, with Hitz., to be taken after the Arabic in the general signification sacrificare, but is transferred zeugmatically from the pouring out of a drink-offering to the offering of a sacrifice. <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/2-47.htm">Daniel 2:47</a>, where Nebuchadnezzar praises the God of the Jews as the God of gods, does not stand in contradiction to the rendering of divine honour to Daniel in such a way that, with Hitz., in the conduct of the king we miss consistency and propriety, and find it improbable. For Nebuchadnezzar did not pray to the man Daniel, but in the person of Daniel to his God, i.e., to the God of the Jews; and he did this because this God had manifested Himself to him through Daniel as the supreme God, who rules over kings, and reveals hidden things which the gods of the Chaldean wise men were not able to reveal. Moreover, in this, Nebuchadnezzar did not abandon his heathen standpoint. He did not recognise the God of the Jews as the only, or the alone true God, but only as God of gods, as the highest or the most exalted of the gods, who excelled the other gods in might and in wisdom, and was a Lord of kings, and as such must be honoured along with the gods of his own country. &#1502;&#1503;&#1470;&#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1496; &#1491;&#1468;&#1497;, of truth (it is) that, stands adverbially for truly. </body></html>
