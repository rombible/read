The reason why these monarchies, which were represented to Nebuchadnezzar in the form of a great image, formed of gold and silver, brass and iron, are here exhibited by fierce and savage beasts, has been observed in the note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-31.htm" title="You, O king, saw, and behold a great image.

The great sea agitated by the winds, represented the earth and the dwellers on it troubled by ambitious princes and conquerors. The four beasts signified the same four empires, as the four parts of Nebuchadnezzar's image. Mighty conquerors are but instruments of God's vengeance on a guilty world. The savage beast represents the hateful features of their characters. But the dominion given to each has a limit; their wrath shall be made to praise the Lord, and the remainder of it he will restrain.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/daniel/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Daniel spake and said - That is, he spake and said in the manner intimated in the previous verse. It was by a record made at the time, and thus he might be said to speak to his own generation and to all future times.<p>I saw in my vision by night - I beheld in the vision; that is, he saw represented to him the scene which he proceeds to describe. He seemed to see the sea in a tempest, and these monsters come up from it, and the strange succession of events which followed.<p>And behold, the four winds of the heaven - The winds that blow under the heaven, or that seem to come from the heaven - or the air. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-36.htm">Jeremiah 49:36</a>. The number of the winds is here referred to as four as they are now, as blowing mainly from the four quarters of the earth. Nothing is more common now than to designate them in this manner - as the east, the south, the west, the north wind. So the Latins - Eurus, Auster, Zephyrus, Boreas.<p>Strove - &#1502;&#1490;&#1497;&#1495;&#1503;  meg&#305;&#770;ycha&#770;n. Burst, or rushed forth; seemed to conflict together. The winds burst, rushed from all quarters, and seemed to meet on the sea, throwing it into wild commotion. The Hebrew word (&#1490;&#1497;&#1495;  g&#305;&#770;yach) means to break or burst forth, as a fountain or stream of waters, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/40-23.htm">Job 40:23</a>; an infant breaking forth from the womb, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-8.htm">Job 38:8</a>; a warrior rushing forth to battle, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-2.htm">Ezekiel 32:2</a>. Hence, the Chaldean to break forth; to rush forth as the winds. The symbol here would naturally denote some wild commotion among the nations, as if the winds of heaven should rush together in confusion.<p>Upon the great sea - This expression would properly apply to any great sea or ocean, but it is probable that the one that would occur to Daniel would be the Mediterranean Sea, as that was best known to him and his contemporaries. A heaving ocean - or an ocean tossed with storms - would be a natural emblem to denote a nation, or nations, agitated with internal conflicts, or nations in the midst of revolutions. Among the sacred poets and the prophets, hosts of armies invading a land are compared to overflowing waters, and mighty changes among the nations to the heaving billows of the ocean in a storm. Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-7.htm">Jeremiah 46:7-8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/47-2.htm">Jeremiah 47:2</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-7.htm">Isaiah 8:7-8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/17-12.htm">Isaiah 17:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-19.htm">Isaiah 59:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/11-40.htm">Daniel 11:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-1.htm">Revelation 13:1</a>. The classic reader will be reminded in the description here of the words of Virgil, AEn. I. 82, following:<p>"Ac venti, velut agmine facto<p>Qua data porta ruunt, et terras turbine perflant.<p>Incubuere mari, totumque a sedibus imis<p>Una Eurusque, Notusque ruunt, creberquc procellis.<p>Africus, et vastos volvunt ad littora fluctus."<p>Compare also Ovid, Trist. I. 2, 25, following. It was from this agitated sea that the beasts that Daniel saw, representing successive kingdoms, seemed to rise; and the fair interpretation of this part of the symbol is, that there was, or would be, as it appeared in vision to Daniel, commotions among the nations resembling the sea driven by storms, and that from these commotions there would arise successive kingdoms having the characteristics specified by the appearance of the four beasts. We naturally look, in the fulfillment of this, to some state of things in which the nations were agitated and convulsed; in which they struggled against each other, as the winds strove upon the sea; a state of things which preceded the rise of these four successive kingdoms. Without now pretending to determine whether that was the time denoted by this, it is certain that all that is here said would find a counterpart in the period which immediately preceded the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, or the kingdom which he founded and adorned. His rapid and extensive conquests; the agitation of the nations in self-defense, and their wars against one another, would be well denoted by the agitation of the ocean as seen in vision by Daniel. It is true that there have been many other periods of the world to which the image would be applicable, but no one can doubt that it was applicable to this period, and that would be all that would be necessary if the design was to represent a series of kingdoms commencing with that of Nebuchadnezzar. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/daniel/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. the four winds&#8212;answering to the "four beasts"; their several conflicts in the four quarters or directions of the world.<p>strove&#8212;burst forth (from the abyss) [Maurer].<p>sea&#8212;The world powers rise out of the agitations of the political sea (Jer 46:7, 8; Lu 21:25; compare Re 13:1; 17:15; 21:1); the kingdom of God and the Son of man from the clouds of heaven (Da 7:13; compare Joh 8:23). Tregelles takes "the great sea" to mean, as always elsewhere in Scripture (Jos 1:4; 9:1), the Mediterranean, the center territorially of the four kingdoms of the vision, which all border on it and have Jerusalem subject to them. Babylon did not border on the Mediterranean, nor rule Jerusalem, till Nebuchadnezzar's time, when both things took place simultaneously. Persia encircled more of this sea, namely, from the Hellespont to Cyrene. Greece did not become a monarchy before Alexander's time, but then, succeeding to Persia, it became mistress of Jerusalem. It surrounded still more of the Mediterranean, adding the coasts of Greece to the part held by Persia. Rome, under Augustus, realized three things at once&#8212;it became a monarchy; it became mistress of the last of the four parts of Alexander's empire (symbolized by the four heads of the third beast), and of Jerusalem; it surrounded all the Mediterranean.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/daniel/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Because Daniel doth not expound what is meant by <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">winds, </span> expositors think there is room left for every one’s conjecture; wherein this seems most likely, that by the four winds of the great sea is signified commotions of contrary nations and factions, striving together by wars, and producing these four beasts successively.

A.V. <span class="ital">strove</span> is to be explained from the sense which the word has in the Targums.

The Septuagint omits the introductory clause, and renders, "On my couch I saw in my night-sleep, and, behold, the four winds of heaven fell upon the great sea." Theodotion, like the LXX., omits the introductory clause, and renders, "I Daniel beheld, and, lo, the four winds of the heaven rushed upon (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f73;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) the great sea." The Peshitta seems as if transferred from the Massoretic text, the resemblance is so close. The variations in the Greek Version may be due to condensation of a fuller narrative. The verb translated "strove" in our Authorized Version is better rendered, as in the Revised, "brake forth upon." Luther's version is, "sturmeten wider einander." This, like the Authorized Version, seems to be the result of the Vulgate <span class="accented">pugnabant.</span> The only objection to this is that it ought to be followed by a preposition (Bevan). The translation suggested by Levy, "stirred up," appears still better. The sea referred to is naturally to be taken as the Mediterranean; it is "the great sea" of the prophets (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-10.htm">Ezekiel 47:10</a>). Jerusalem is not so far from the sea but that Daniel might have seen it in his boyhood. The symbolic meaning of the sea is the mass of heathen nations (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/65-7.htm">Psalm 65:7</a>). The "four winds of heaven" usually stand for the points of the compass (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-34.htm">Jeremiah 49:34</a>). Here, however, the winds are pictured as actual forces dashing down upon the sea, and stirring it up to its depths. It may be objected that this is an impossible picture. It might be replied that Virgil, in the first book of the 'AEneid,' 84-86, and Milton, in 'Paradise Regained,' has the same thing. Daniel has more freedom, for he narrates a vision, and, further, to him the winds (<span class="accented">rucheen</span>) were under the guidance of angels. Hitzig denies that the winds can be <span class="accented">angelicae potestates</span>, as Jerome maintains; and, when Jerome supports his position by a quotation from the Septuagint Version of <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-8.htm">Deuteronomy 32:8</a>, gives as answer a mark of exclamation. The passage, "He set the nations according to the number of the angels of God," represents a phase of thought in regard to angelology, which Daniel elsewhere obviously has. The double meaning of the word <span class="accented">ruach</span> made the transition easy. We see the same double meaning in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/6-5.htm">Zechariah 6:5</a>. The sea, then, is to be regarded as the great mass of Gentile nations, and the winds are, therefore, the spiritual agencies by which God carries on the history of the world. As there are four winds, there are also four empires. There are angelic princes of at least two of these empires referred to later. May we not argue that these empires had, according to the thought of Daniel, each an angelic head? It may be doubted whether the most advanced critics know more of angelology than Daniel, or can be certain that his view was a mistaken one. Moreover, the Mediterranean Sea was the centre round which the epic of history, as revealed to Daniel, unfolded itself. Nebuchadnezzar marched along the eastern shores of that midland sea; the Persian monarchs essayed to command it by their fleets; across a branch of that sea came Alexander; and from yet further across its blue waters came the Romans. The Mediterranean saw most of the history  transacted that took place between the time of Daniel and that of our Lord. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/daniel/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The pronoun &#1488;&#1504;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; (as for thee), as Daniel everywhere writes it, while the Keri substitutes for it the later Targ. form &#1488;&#1504;&#1514;&#1468;, is absolute, and forms the contrast to the &#1493;&#1488;&#1504;&#1492; (as for me) of <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-30.htm">Daniel 2:30</a>. The thoughts of the king are not his dream (Hitz.), but thoughts about the future of his kingdom which filled his mind as he lay upon his bed, and to which God gave him an answer in the dream (v. Leng., Maur., Kran., Klief.). Therefore they are to be distinguished from the thoughts of thy heart, <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/2-30.htm">Daniel 2:30</a>, for these are the thoughts that troubled the king, which arose from the revelations of the dream to him. The contrast in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-30.htm">Daniel 2:30</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-30.htm">Daniel 2:30</a> is not this: "not for my wisdom before all that live to show," but "for the sake of the king to explain the dream;" for  &#1489;is not the preposition of the object, but of the means, thus: "not by the wisdom which might be in me." The supernatural revelation (&#1500;&#1497; (&lt;) &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;) forms the contrast, and the object to which &#1491;&#1468;&#1497; &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1514; points is comprehended implicite in &#1502;&#1503;&#1470;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;, for in the words, "the wisdom which may be in me before all living," lies the unexpressed thought: that I should be enlightened by such superhuman wisdom. &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1491;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;, "that they might make it known:" the plur. of undefined generality, cf.

The idea of Aben Ezra, Vatke, and others, that angels are the subject of the verb, is altogether untenable.</body></html>
