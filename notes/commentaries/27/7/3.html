Other instances of beasts being taken as emblems of kingdoms may be found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/27-1.htm" title="In that day the LORD with his sore and great and strong sword shall punish leviathan the piercing serpent, even leviathan that crooked serpent; and he shall slay the dragon that is in the sea.">Isaiah 27:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/29-3.htm" title="Speak, and say, Thus said the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against you, Pharaoh king of Egypt, the great dragon that lies in the middle of his rivers, which has said, My river is my own, and I have made it for myself.">Ezekiel 29:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-2.htm" title="Son of man, take up a lamentation for Pharaoh king of Egypt, and say to him, You are like a young lion of the nations, and you are as a whale in the seas: and you came forth with your rivers, and troubled the waters with your feet, and fouled their rivers.">Ezekiel 32:2</a>. It must be observed that the beasts do not rise up simultaneously, but in succession to each other. In this way, and in the difference of their character, they form a parallel to the subject-matter of the vision recorded in Daniel 2.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:1-8 This vision contains the same prophetic representations with Nebuchadnezzar's dream. The great sea agitated by the winds, represented the earth and the dwellers on it troubled by ambitious princes and conquerors. The four beasts signified the same four empires, as the four parts of Nebuchadnezzar's image. Mighty conquerors are but instruments of God's vengeance on a guilty world. The savage beast represents the hateful features of their characters. But the dominion given to each has a limit; their wrath shall be made to praise the Lord, and the remainder of it he will restrain.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/daniel/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And four great beasts came up from the sea - Not at once, but in succession. See the following verses. Their particular form is described in the subsequent verses. The design of mentioning them here, as coming up from, the sea, seems to have been to show that this succession of kingdoms sprang from the agitations and commotions among the nations represented by the heaving ocean. It is not uncommon for the prophets to make use of animals to represent or symbolize kingdoms and nations - usually by some animal which was in a manner peculiar to the land that was symbolized, or which abounded there. Thus in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/27-1.htm">Isaiah 27:1</a>, leviathan, or the dragon, or crocodile, is used to represent Babylon. See the note at that passage. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/29-3.htm">Ezekiel 29:3-5</a>, the dragon or the crocodile of the Nile is put for Pharaoh; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-2.htm">Ezekiel 32:2</a>, Pharaoh is compared to a young lion, and to a whale in the seas. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/74-13.htm">Psalm 74:13-14</a>, the kingdom of Egypt is compared to the dragon and the leviathan.<p>So on ancient coins, animals are often used as emblems of kingdoms, as it may be added, the lion and the unicorn represent Great Britain now, and the eagle the United States. It is well remarked by Lengerke (in loc.), that when the prophets design to represent kingdoms that are made up of other kingdoms, or that are combined by being brought by conquest under the power of others, they do this, not by any single animal as actually found in nature, but by monsters - fabulous beings that are compounded of others, in which the peculiar qualities of different animals are brought together - as in the case of the lion with eagle's wings. Thus in <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/13-1.htm">Revelation 13:1</a>, the Romish power is represented by a beast coming out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, Compare it. Ezra (Apocry.) 11:1, where an eagle is represented as coming from the sea with twelve feathered wings and three heads. As an illustration of the attempts made in the apocryphal writings to imitate the prophets, the whole of chapter 11 and chapter 12 of the second book of Ezra may be referred to.<p>Diverse one from another - Though they all came up from the same abyss, yet they differed from each other - denoting, doubtless, that though the successive kingdoms referred to would all rise out of the nations represented by the agitated sea, yet that in important respects they would differ from each other. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/daniel/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. beasts&#8212;not living animals, as the cherubic four in Re 4:7 (for the original is a different word from "beasts," and ought to be there translated, living animals). The cherubic living animals represent redeemed man, combining in himself the highest forms of animal life. But the "beasts" here represent the world powers, in their beast-like, grovelling character. It is on the fundamental harmony between nature and spirit, between the three kingdoms of nature, history, and revelation, that Scripture symbolism rests. The selection of symbols is not arbitrary, but based on the essence of things.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/daniel/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> That is, four great monarchies, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">great</span> in comparison of particular kingdoms that were little to them; beasts for their idolatry, and tyrannical oppressions and depredations. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/daniel/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And four great beasts came up from the sea,....

The Septuagint rendering omits "great;" otherwise it is a closely accurate representation of the Massoretic text, save that the translator seems to have had, not <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5d0;&#x20;&#x5de;&#x5df;&#x5d0;&#x5bc;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5d0;</span>, but as in the Syriac, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5d3;&#x5d0;&#x20;&#x5de;&#x5df;&#x5be;&#x5d7;&#x5d3;&#x5d0;</span>, as he renders <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x7b;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f15;&#x3bd;</span>. Theodotion has <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;</span>, but does not so slavishly follow the Aramaic construction at the end. The Peshitta is very close to the Massoretic, save that in the last clause it agrees with the LXX. The number four is, in apocalyptic writings, significant of the world; "the four winds" mean the whole world. Here it is human history that is summed up in the four beasts. So in Zechariah we have "four horns" that symbolize the oppressors of the people of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/1-18.htm">Daniel 1:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-1.htm">Daniel 2:1</a>). We have "four" chariots in the sixth chapter of Zechariah, which seem to be symbols of the same thing. <span class="accented">Beasts.</span> Animals of one sort or another are used of nations in the prophets; thus Egypt is symbolized in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/27.htm">Isaiah 27</a>, as "leviathan," presumably a crocodile (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-7.htm">Isaiah 51:7</a>), as "a dragon" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/29-3.htm">Ezekiel 29:3</a> Babylonia is figured as an eagle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-3.htm">Ezekiel 17:3</a>). Composite beings are used as symbols also, as Tyro is addressed as a '"covering cherub." In the Book of Revelation Rome is figured as a beast with seven heads and ten horns (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-1.htm">Revelation 13:1</a>). In the Book of Enoch (85. - 90.) we find this figurative use of animals carried much further. Assyria and Babylonia and, following them, Persia made great use of composite, monstrous animal forms as symbols, not so much, however, of political as of spiritual powers. This distinction is the less important, that political events were regarded as the production of spiritual activity. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/daniel/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The pronoun &#1488;&#1504;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; (as for thee), as Daniel everywhere writes it, while the Keri substitutes for it the later Targ. form &#1488;&#1504;&#1514;&#1468;, is absolute, and forms the contrast to the &#1493;&#1488;&#1504;&#1492; (as for me) of <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-30.htm">Daniel 2:30</a>. The thoughts of the king are not his dream (Hitz.), but thoughts about the future of his kingdom which filled his mind as he lay upon his bed, and to which God gave him an answer in the dream (v. Leng., Maur., Kran., Klief.). Therefore they are to be distinguished from the thoughts of thy heart, <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/2-30.htm">Daniel 2:30</a>, for these are the thoughts that troubled the king, which arose from the revelations of the dream to him. The contrast in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-30.htm">Daniel 2:30</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-30.htm">Daniel 2:30</a> is not this: "not for my wisdom before all that live to show," but "for the sake of the king to explain the dream;" for  &#1489;is not the preposition of the object, but of the means, thus: "not by the wisdom which might be in me." The supernatural revelation (&#1500;&#1497; (&lt;) &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;) forms the contrast, and the object to which &#1491;&#1468;&#1497; &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1514; points is comprehended implicite in &#1502;&#1503;&#1470;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;, for in the words, "the wisdom which may be in me before all living," lies the unexpressed thought: that I should be enlightened by such superhuman wisdom. &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1491;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;, "that they might make it known:" the plur. of undefined generality, cf. Winer, 49, 3. The impersonal form of expression is chosen in order that his own person might not be brought into view. The idea of Aben Ezra, Vatke, and others, that angels are the subject of the verb, is altogether untenable.</body></html>
