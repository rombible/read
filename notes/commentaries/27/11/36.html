Though there can be no doubt that the northern king is still spoken of, it must be remarked that the features of Antiochus are gradually fading away from the portrait. In no sense can Antiochus be called an Atheist; nor does the language of the writer of <a href="http://apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/9-12.htm" title="And when he himself could not abide his own smell, he said these words, It is meet to be subject unto God, and that a man that is mortal should not proudly think of himself if he were God.">2 Maccabees 9:12</a>, “think of himself as if he were God,” correspond with the words of this verse. Antiochus’ main object was to Hellenise the Jewish religion, and to force the Greek gods upon the Jews. The character of the northern king, on the contrary, finds a parallel in St. Paul’s description of Antichrist (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-4.htm" title="Who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God sits in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God.">2Thessalonians 2:4</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Marvellous things.—</span>That is, his utterances and blasphemies against the true God will be astounding. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-8.htm" title="I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them another little horn, before whom there were three of the first horns plucked up by the roots: and, behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of man, and a mouth speaking great things.">Daniel 7:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-11.htm" title="I beheld then because of the voice of the great words which the horn spoke: I beheld even till the beast was slain, and his body destroyed, and given to the burning flame.">Daniel 7:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-20.htm" title="And of the ten horns that were in his head, and of the other which came up, and before whom three fell; even of that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spoke very great things, whose look was more stout than his fellows.">Daniel 7:20</a>.)

Many of the things that follow may be applied, by way of accommodation, to antichrist, of whom Antiochus was an eminent type; but they seem principally to refer to Antiochus himself.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/11.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>11:31-45 The remainder of this prophecy is very difficult, and commentators differ much respecting it. From Antiochus the account seems to pass to antichrist. Reference seems to be made to the Roman empire, the fourth monarchy, in its pagan, early Christian, and papal states. The end of the Lord's anger against his people approaches, as well as the end of his patience towards his enemies. If we would escape the ruin of the infidel, the idolater, the superstitious and cruel persecutor, as well as that of the profane, let us make the oracles of God our standard of truth and of duty, the foundation of our hope, and the light of our paths through this dark world, to the glorious inheritance above.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/daniel/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And the king shall do according to his will - Shall be absolute and supreme, and shall accomplish his purposes. This refers, it seems to me, beyond question, to Antiochus Epiphanes, and was exactly fulfilled in him. He accomplished his purposes in regard to the city and temple in the most arbitrary manner, and was, in every respect, an absolute despot. It should be said, however, here, that most Christian interpreters suppose that the allusion here to Antiochus ceases, and that henceforward, it refers to Antichrist. So Jerome, Gill, Bp. Newton, and others; and so Jerome says many of the Jews understood it. The only reason alleged for this is, that there are things affirmed here of the "king" which could not be true of Antiochus. But, in opposition to this, it may be observed<p>(a) that the allusion in the previous verses is undoubtedly to Antiochus Epiphanes.<p>(b) There is no indication of any "change," for the prophetic narrative seems to proceed as if the allusion to the same person continued.<p>(c) The word "king" is not a word to be applied to Antichrist, it being nowhere used of him.<p>(d) Such a transition, without anymore decided marks of it, would not be in accordance with the usual method in the prophetic writings, leaving a plain prediction in the very midst of the description, and passing on at once to a representation of one who would arise after many hundreds of years, and of whom the former could be considered as in no way the type. The most obvious and honest way, therefore, of interpreting this is, to refer it to Antiochus, and perhaps we shall find that the difficulty of applying it to him is not insuperable.<p>And he shall exalt himself - No one can doubt that this will agree with Antiochus Epiphanes - a proud, haughty, absolute, and stern monarch, the purpose of whose reign was to exalt himself, and to extend the limits of his empire.<p>And magnify himself above every god - That is, by directing what gods should or should not be worshipped; attempting to displace the claim of all those who were worshipped as gods at his pleasure, and establishing the worship of other gods in their place. Thus he assumed the right to determine what god should be worshipped in Jerusalem, abolishing the worship of Jehovah, and setting up that of Jupiter Olympius in the stead; and so throughout his whole dominion, by a proclamation, he forbade the worship of any god but his, 1 Macc. 1:44-51; Jos. Ant. b. xii. ch. v. Section 4, 5. One who assumes or claims the right to forbid the adoration of any particular god, and to order divine homage to be rendered to anyone which he chooses, exalts himself above the gods, as he in this way denies the right which they must be supposed to claim to prescribe their own worship.<p>And shall speak marvelous things - The Hebrew word &#1504;&#1508;&#1500;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514;  n&#305;&#770;pela&#770;'o&#770;th would properly denote things wonderful, or fitted to excite astonishment; things that are unusual and extraordinary: and the meaning here is, that the things spoken would be so impious and atrocious - so amazing and wonderful for their wickedness, as to produce amazement.<p>Against the God of gods - The true God, Jehovah; he is supreme, and is superior to all that is called God, or that is worshipped as such. Nothing could be better descriptive of Antiochus than this; nothing was ever more strikingly fulfilled than this was in him.<p>And shall prosper until the indignation be accomplished - Referring still to the fact that there was an appointed time during which this was to continue. That time might well be called a time of "indignation," for the Lord seemed to be angry against his temple and people, and suffered this pagan king to pour out his wrath without measure against the temple, the city, and the whole land.<p>For that that is determined shall be done - What is purposed in regard to the city and temple, and to all other things, must be accomplished. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-21.htm">Daniel 10:21</a>. The angel here states a general truth - that all that God has ordained will come to pass. The application of this truth here is, that the series of events must be suffered to run on, and that it could not be expected that they would be arrested until all that had been determined in the Divine mind should be effected. They who would suffer, therefore, in those times must wait with patience until the Divine purposes should be brought about, and when the period should arrive, the calamities would cease. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/daniel/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>36. The wilful king here, though primarily Antiochus, is antitypically and mainly Antichrist, the seventh head of the seven-headed and ten-horned beast of Re 13:1-18, and the "beast" of Armageddon (Re 16:13, 16; 19:19). Some identify him with the revived French emperorship, the eighth head of the beast (Re 17:11), who is to usurp the kingly, as the Pope has the priestly, dignity of Christ&#8212;the false Messiah of the Jews, who will "plant his tabernacle between the seas in the holy mountain," "exalting himself above every god" (2Th 2:4; Re 13:5, 6). This last clause only in part holds good of Antiochus; for though he assumed divine honors, identifying himself with Jupiter Olympius, yet it was for that god he claimed them; still it applies to him as the type.<p>speak marvellous things against &#8230; God of gods&#8212;so Da 7:25, as to the "little horn," which seemingly identifies the two (compare Da 8:25). Antiochus forbade the worship of Jehovah by a decree "marvellous" for its wickedness: thus he was a type of Antichrist. Compare Da 7:8, "a mouth speaking great things."<p>indignation &#8230; accomplished&#8212;God's visitation of wrath on the Jews for their sins (Da 8:19).<p>that &#8230; determined&#8212;(Da 9:26, 27; 10:21).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/daniel/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The king, </span> i.e. the Roman government, whether by the senate, or by emperors, or by the bishop of Rome, who shall shove out the imperial power not only from Rome, but from Italy and all the western empire, as far as he could, by striking in with the barbarous nations that invaded it, who are called ten kings.

The sum is this: Though it is granted some of these things are applicable to Antiochus, yet the angel speaks of him here and henceforward but by the by and very lightly; his main scope is antichrist, as will appear in the interpretation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Shall do according to his will; </span> Antiochus did according to his will: he shall be arbitrary in his actions, notwithstanding any checks of Divine and human laws: the cause follows. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Shall speak marvellous things against the God of gods:</span> this is true of the Romans, who would deify what they please, and defy it or ungod it; most true of the persecutors of Christ and Christians in the time of the emperors, but most notoriously of the Roman antichrist.

Not Antiochus, for he could not do as he would, being curbed by the Romans, as has been observed; and there are many things which follow that cannot be applied to him; rather the Roman people, under the name of a king or kingdom, rising up to universal monarchy, upon the decline of the Grecian empire, are meant; and who did what they would, subdued kingdoms at pleasure, and gave laws to the whole world; and particularly in the little horn, or Rome Papal, antichrist, <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/7-8.htm">Daniel 7:8</a>, of which Antiochus was a type, and is called by the same name, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-9.htm">Daniel 8:9</a> and the transition is easy from the type to the antitype, with whom everything said agrees: for the pope of Rome, claiming infallibility, does, or has done, whatsoever he pleases; regarding neither the laws of God nor man, but dispensing with both at his pleasure; coining new doctrines; appointing new ordinances; setting himself up above councils and princes; taking upon him a power to depose kings and set them up as he pleases; with many other things done by him in an arbitrary and despotic way, both civil and religious; and with none does the character agree as with him, as well as what follows: <p>and magnify himself above every god; that is so called, whether angels whom he commands, or the kings of the earth he claims an authority over, those gods in heaven, and gods on earth; which is the exact description of antichrist, as given by the apostle, who has manifestly a reference to this passage; see Gill on <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-4.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:4</a>, <p>and shall speak marvellous things against the God of gods; the true God, to whom angels and civil magistrates are subject, being his creatures, and acting under him; but such is the arrogance of the man of sin, that he takes upon him to speak against God, and such things as are astonishing; and it may be extremely wondered at that he should dare to speak them, as to call himself God on earth; to take such things to himself, which only belong to God, as by claiming all power in heaven, earth, and hell; power to bind the consciences of men, and impose what he pleases on them; to make new articles of faith; to pardon the sins of men; to open and shut the gates of heaven when he pleases; with other blasphemies against God, his mouth, given him to speak, utters; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/13-5.htm">Revelation 13:5</a>, <p>and shall prosper until the indignation be accomplished;

This is particularly evident, as Babelon has pointed out[386], on his coins. His best portraits appear to be those on the coins of his early years, which bear simply the inscription ‘King Antiochus.’ At a later period of his reign a star appears on his forehead, implying that he has assumed divine honours. Then in coins with the legend, ‘King Antiochus, God’ (or ‘God Manifest’ [Epiphanes]), the star disappears, but the portrait is idealized, the features approximating in type to those of Apollo. Other coins of the same type exhibit the head surrounded by a diadem with rays,—another mark of divine rank[387]. Lastly, on coins with the legend ‘King Antiochus, God Manifest, Victory-bearer,’ the head approximates even to that of Zeus Olympios, whose distinctive epithet <span class="greekheb">Νικηφόρος</span> (‘Victory-bearer’) the king himself assumes, see also the evidence collected from inscriptions by E.

The LXX. does not differ greatly from this, "And the king shall do according to his will, and shall be enraged, and be exalted above every god, and against the God of gods shall he speak marvellous things (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;</span>) and shall prosper until the wrath be accomplished; for on him (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>) there is an end." The difference in the last clause is considerable between the LXX, and not easily explicable. Theodotion differs somewhat more, "And he shall do according to his will; and the king shall be exalted, and be magnified, and he shall speak marvellous things, and he shall prosper until the wrath is ended; for it is to a determined end (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>)." The Peshitta is closely related to the Massoretic, even in the last clause, where a difference is manifested in the others. The Vulgate affords no occasion of remark. The question that has to be settled here is - Who is the king who shall do according to his pleasure? Aben Ezra maintained the reference  was to Constantine the Great. Rashi, followed by Calvin, would make it the Roman Empire personified. He notices the Rabbins' referring this to Titus and Vespasian. As above mentioned, his own view is that the 'Monarchia Romana' is here intended. Jephet-ibn-Ali sees in this a prophecy of Mohammed; others, Wordsworth and Rule, following Jerome and Luther, think the reference here is to the antichrist of the New Testament. For our own part, we see no necessity for supposing any other monarch than Epiphanes is referred to. While Livy and Polybius remark on the piety of Epiphanes, it may seem strange to refer what is said here to him; but his ruthless plundering of temples proved that his piety was merely a political expedient. <span class="accented">Speak marvellous things against the God of gods.</span> We have no record of any proclamations of Antiochus which exactly suit this; but then we must bear in mind that we have only compendious accounts of what he did proclaim. To the heathen, moreover, as to Polybius and Livy, words of contempt against Jehovah would seem nothing worse than impolitic; but to the Jew, blasphemous words would be so horrible that they would not be recorded, as being a contamination: hence it is not extraordinary that we hear nothing of blasphemy in the history of Antiochus. The forbidding of sacrifices and of circumcision, while clearly enough dishonouring to God and to the Jewish nation, do not contain enough to justify the statement. <span class="accented">Shall prosper till the indignation be accomplished.</span> If by the indignation (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5e2;&#x5dd;</span>, <span class="accented">za'am</span>) is meant the sufferings endured by the Jewish people, then the prosperity of Epiphanes - his life, indeed - did not last so long as the sufferings inflicted on the Jews; for these continued for some time after his death. There is probably here an indication that the writer's horizon did not reach to the death of Antiochus. Certain, by his faith in God, that Antiochus would perish, he thinks that until that time he may prosper. <span class="accented">For that that is determined shall be do</span>,<span class="accented">to.</span> There is considerable difficulty as to the text here, but all the various forms convey the same meaning - a definite limit to oppression. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/daniel/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>After Daniel had been thrown into the lions' den, its mouth was covered with a flat stone, and the stone was sealed with the king's seal and that of the great officers of state, that nothing might change or be changed (&#1489;&#1468;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;&#1500; &#1510;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;) concerning Daniel (&#1510;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;, affair, matter), not that the device against Daniel might not be frustrated (Hv., v. Leng., Maur., Klief.). This thought required the stat. emphat. &#1510;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1488;, and also does not correspond with the application of a double seal. The old translator Theodot. is correct in his rendering: &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3c2; &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#834;&#837; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x394;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bb;, and the lxx paraphrasing: &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3c2; &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3b1;&#x3c0; &#787;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; (&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;) &#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#834;&#837; &#x3bf;&#788; &#x394;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bb;, &#x3b7;&#787;&#769; &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#837; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;. Similarly also Ephr. Syr. and others.<p>The den of lions is designated by &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1488;, which the Targg. use for the Hebr. &#1489;&#1493;&#1512;, a cistern. From this v. Leng., Maur., and Hitzig infer that the writer had in view a funnel-shaped cistern dug out in the ground, with a moderately small opening or mouth from above, which could be covered with a stone, so that for this one night the lions had to be shut in, while generally no stone lay on the opening. The pit also into which Joseph, the type of Daniel, was let down was a cistern (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/37-24.htm">Genesis 37:24</a>), and the mouth of the cistern was usually covered with a stone (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/29-3.htm">Genesis 29:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-53.htm">Lamentations 3:53</a>). It can hence scarcely be conceived how the lions, over which no angel watched, could have remained in such a subterranean cavern covered with a stone. "The den must certainly have been very capacious if, as it appears, 122 men with their wives and children could have been thrown into it immediately after one another (v. 25 [<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/6-24.htm">Daniel 6:24</a>]); but this statement itself only shows again the deficiency of every view of the matter," - and thus the whole history is a fiction fabricated after the type of the history of Joseph! But these critics who speak thus have themselves fabricated the idea of the throwing into the den of 122 men with women and children - for the text states no number - in order that they might make the whole narrative appear absurd.<p>We have no account by the ancients of the construction of lions' dens. Ge. Hst, in his work on Fez and Morocco, p. 77, describes the lions' dens as they have been found in Morocco. According to his account, they consist of a large square cavern under the earth, having a partition-wall in the middle of it, which is furnished with a door, which the keeper can open and close from above. By throwing in food they can entice the lions from the one chamber into the other, and then, having shut the door, they enter the vacant space for the purpose of cleaning it. The cavern is open above, its mouth being surrounded by a wall of a yard and a half high, over which one can look down into the den. This description agrees perfectly with that which is here given in the text regarding the lions' den. Finally, &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1488; does not denote common cisterns. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/41-7.htm">Jeremiah 41:7</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/41-9.htm">Jeremiah 41:9</a>, &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1488; (Hebr. &#1489;&#1493;&#1512;) is a subterranean chamber into which seventy dead bodies were cast; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-15.htm">Isaiah 14:15</a>, the place of Sheol is called &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1489;. No reason, therefore, exists for supposing that it is a funnel-formed cistern. The mouth (&#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;) of the den is not its free opening above by which one may look down into it, but an opening made in its side, through which not only the lions were brought into it, but by which also the keepers entered for the purpose of cleansing the den and of attending to the beasts, and could reach the door in the partition-wall (cf. Hst, p. 270). This opening was covered with a great flat stone, which was sealed, the free air entering to the lions from above. This also explains how, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/6-20.htm">Daniel 6:20</a> ff., the king was able to converse with Daniel before the removal of the stone (namely, by the opening above).<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/6-19.htm">Daniel 6:19-21</a> (<a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/6-18.htm">Daniel 6:18-20</a>)<p>Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting: neither were any of his concubines brought before him; and this sleep went from him. The king spent a sleepless night in sorrow on account of Daniel. &#1496;&#1493;&#1514;, used adverbially, in fasting, i.e., without partaking of food in the evening. &#1491;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1492;, concubina; cf. The Arab. daha&#770; and daha&#770; equals , subigere faeminam, and Gesen. Thes. p. 333. On the following morning (v. 20 [<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/6-19.htm">Daniel 6:19</a>]) the king rose early, at the dawn of day, and went to the den of lions, and with lamentable voice called to him feebly hoping that Daniel might be delivered by his God whom he continually served. Daniel answered the king, thereby showing that he had been preserved; whereupon the king was exceeding glad. The future or imperf. &#1497;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/6-19.htm">Daniel 6:19</a>) is not to be interpreted with Kranichfeld hypothetically, he thought to rise early, seeing he did actually rise early, but is used instead of the perf. to place the clause in relation to the following, meaning: the king, as soon as he arose at morning dawn, went hastily by the early light. &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1490;&#1492;&#1488;, at the shining of the light, serves for a nearer determination of the &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1512;&#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;, at the morning dawn, namely, as soon as the first rays of the rising sun appeared. The predicate the living God is occasioned by the preservation of life, which the king regarded as possible, and probably was made known to the king in previous conversations with Daniel; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-3.htm">Psalm 42:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/84-3.htm">Psalm 84:3</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-36.htm">1 Samuel 17:36</a>, etc.<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/6-22.htm">Daniel 6:22-24</a> (<a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/6-21.htm">Daniel 6:21-23</a>)<p>In his answer Daniel declares his innocence, which God had recognised, and on that account had sent His angel (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-8.htm">Psalm 34:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/91-11.htm">Psalm 91:11</a>.) to shut the mouths of the lions; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-33.htm">Hebrews 10:33</a>. &#1493;&#1488;&#1507;, and also (concluding from the innocence actually testified to by God) before the king, i.e., according to the king's judgment, he had done nothing wrong or hurtful. By his transgression of the edict he had not done evil against the king's person. This Daniel could the more certainly say, the more he perceived how the king was troubled and concerned about his preservation, because in Daniel's transgression he himself had seen no conspiracy against his person, but only fidelity toward his own God. The king hereupon immediately gave command that he should be brought out of the den of lions. The Aph. &#1492;&#1504;&#1505;&#1511;&#1492; and the Hoph. &#1492;&#1505;&#1468;&#1511;, to not come from &#1504;&#1505;&#1511;, but from &#1505;&#1500;&#1511;; the  &#1504;is merely compensative. &#1505;&#1500;&#1511;, to mount up, Aph. to bring out; by which, however, we are not to understand a being drawn up by ropes through the opening of the den from above. The bringing out was by the opened passage in the side of the den, for which purpose the stone with the seals was removed. To make the miracle of his preservation manifest, and to show the reason of it, v. 24 (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/6-23.htm">Daniel 6:23</a>) states that Daniel was found without any injury, because he had trusted in his God.</body></html>
