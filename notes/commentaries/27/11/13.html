On the hypothesis that these chapters refer to this period, it is surprising that there should be no allusion to the religious persecutions to which the Jews in Egypt had been subjected by Ptolemy Philopator, who, after his victory at Raphia, attempted to enter the Holy Place, as is mentioned in the Third Book of Maccabees. It should be remembered that the Jews suffered considerably from both parties during the whole of this period; but though the prophecy is supposed to have been written for their comfort and encouragement at this very juncture, yet not a word is said which bears allusion to them.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/daniel/11.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/11-13.htm" title="For the king of the north shall return, and shall set forth a multitude greater than the former, and shall certainly come after certain years with a great army and with much riches.">Daniel 11:13</a></span>. <span class="ital">For the king of the north shall return </span>— It is here foretold that the war should be renewed between the two kings of the north and south, and that it should be begun by the former, who should attempt another invasion of Egypt. This came to pass accordingly, about fourteen years after. For Antiochus, having taken and slain the rebel Achæus, and put an end to the Asiatic war in which he had been engaged, and during which, by his martial exploits against the Medes, Parthians, and others, he had acquired a distinguished reputation throughout Asia and Europe; and having also reduced and settled the eastern parts in their obedience, he found himself at leisure to prosecute any enterprise he might think proper to undertake. And Ptolemy Philopater having died of intemperance and debauchery, and being succeeded by his son Ptolemy Epiphanes, now a child of only four or five years old, he judged it a favourable opportunity for recovering his lost provinces. Taking advantage, therefore, of the infancy of Ptolemy, he returned to invade Egypt, and <span class="ital">set forth a multitude greater than the former, </span>engaging Philip, king of Macedon, in his interest, and bringing with him powerful forces from the east; <span class="ital">with much riches — </span>With abundant supplies of all necessary provisions for his army; and especially with beasts of burden for removing their baggage, for that is the proper sense of the word <span class="greekheb">רכושׂ</span>, here rendered <span class="ital">riches. </span>Polybius informs us, that from the king of Bactria, and from the king of India, he received so many elephants as made up his number one hundred and fifty, besides provisions and riches. Jerome affirms, from ancient authors, that he gathered together an incredible army out of the countries beyond Babylon; and, contrary to the league, he marched with his army, Ptolemy Philopater being dead, against his son, who was then a child.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/11.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>11:1-30 The angel shows Daniel the succession of the Persian and Grecian empires.

From ver. 5-30, is generally considered to relate to the events which came to pass during the continuance of these governments; and from ver. 21, to relate to Antiochus Epiphanes, who was a cruel and violent persecutor of the Jews. See what decaying, perishing things worldly pomp and possessions are, and the power by which they are gotten. God, in his providence, sets up one, and pulls down another, as he pleases. This world is full of wars and fightings, which come from men's lusts. All changes and revolutions of states and kingdoms, and every event, are plainly and perfectly foreseen by God. No word of God shall fall to the ground; but what he has designed, what he has declared, shall infallibly come to pass.

The fact was, that Antiochus, in this expedition, brought with him the forces with which he had successfully invaded the East, and the army had been raised for that purpose, and was much larger than that with which he had formerly attacked Ptolemy.

Twelve years after the battle of Raphia, in 205, Ptolemy Philopator died, leaving a son aged 4 years, who succeeded him on the throne as Ptolemy V. (Epiphanes). Antiochus had meanwhile been gaining the series of successes in Persia, Bactria, Asia Minor, and even in India, which earned him the epithet of the ‘Great.’ Returning from the East, in the same year in which Philopator died, he concluded an alliance with Philip, king of Macedon, for a joint attack upon the infant king of Egypt, and partition of his foreign possessions between them (Polyb. xv. 20; cf. Jer. <span class="ital">ad loc.</span>). Details of the war are not known, the part of Polybius’ history which described it being lost. We only learn from Justin (xxxi. 1) that he invaded Phœnicia and Syria; and from Polybius (xvi. 18, 40) that he captured Gaza, after a stout resistance.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">shall return</span>, &c.] <span class="ital">shall</span> <span class="bld">again raise</span> <span class="ital">a multitude, greater than the former</span>, with allusion to the forces by which he achieved his successes in Persia and the East.

The LXX. does not differ essentially from this, only <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> comes in unnecessarily by a blunder - the less to be understood, as there seems no word which can have occasioned the misreading, unless it is simply a blunder of hearing for <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>; but against this is the fact that Paulus Tellensis has <span class="accented">medeenatha.</span> There is also the limitation of the period after which the king of the north will return to "one year" (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>), "a period of a year." Theodotion is closer to the Massoretic . The Peshitta is closer than either of the Greek versions, as neither of them attempts to give, "coming he shall come," which it does. The Vulgate is like Theodotion. The reference here is to the second expedition against Egypt, undertaken by Antiochus after the death of Philopator. After his victory at Raphia, Ptolemy resumed his life of self-indulgence. Antiochus endeavoured to build up his empire by curbing the Parthians; then, after an interval of fourteen years, he once more invaded the territories of the Egyptian monarch. This second invasion resulted in Antiochus gaining possession of all Palestine. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/daniel/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Daniel now read the writing (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/5-25.htm">Daniel 5:25</a>), and gave its interpretation (<a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/5-26.htm">Daniel 5:26-28</a>). The writing bears the mysterious character of the oracle. &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1505;, &#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1500;, &#1502;&#1504;&#1488; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/5-28.htm">Daniel 5:28</a>) are partic. Piel, and the forms &#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1500; and &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1505;, instead of &#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1497;&#1500; and &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1505;, are chosen on account of their symphony with &#1502;&#1504;&#1488;. &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1505;&#1497;&#1503; is generally regarded as partic. plur., but that would be &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1505;&#1497;&#1503;; it much rather appears to be a noun form, and plur. of &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1505;  equals  Hebr. &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1505; (cf. &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1505;&#1497;&#1492;&#1503;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/11-16.htm">Zechariah 11:16</a>), in the sense of broken pieces, fragments, for &#1508;&#1512;&#1505; signifies to divide, to break in pieces, not only in the Hebr. (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-4.htm">Leviticus 11:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-7.htm">Isaiah 58:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-32.htm">Psalm 69:32</a>), but also in the Chald., <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-39.htm">2 Kings 4:39</a> (Targ.), although in the Targg. The meaning to spread out prevails. In all the three words there lies a double sense, which is brought out in the interpretation. &#1502;&#1504;&#1488;, for the sake of the impression, or perhaps only of the parallelism, is twice given, so as to maintain two members of the verse, each of two words. In the numbering lies the determination and the completion, or the conclusion of a manner, a space of time. Daniel accordingly interprets &#1502;&#1504;&#1488; thus: God has numbered (&#1502;&#1504;&#1492; for &#1502;&#1504;&#1488;, perf. act.) thy kingdom, i.e., its duration or its days, &#1493;&#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1502;&#1492;&#1468;, and has finished it, i.e., its duration is so counted out that it is full, that it now comes to an end. In &#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1500; there lies the double sense that the word &#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1500;, to weigh, accords with the Niphal of &#1511;&#1500;&#1500;, to be light, to be found light (cf. &#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1500;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/16-4.htm">Genesis 16:4</a>). The interpretation presents this double meaning: Thou art weighed in the balances (&#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1488;) and art found too light (like the &#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1500;). &#1495;&#1505;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;, wanting in necessary weight, i.e., deficient in moral worth. &#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1488;, a perf. formed from the partic. Piel; cf. Winer, 13, 2. As to the figure of the balance, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-6.htm">Job 31:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/62-10.htm">Psalm 62:10</a> (9).<p>For &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1505;&#1497;&#1503; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/5-25.htm">Daniel 5:25</a>) Daniel uses in the interpretation the sing. &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1505;, which, after the analogy of &#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1500;, may be regarded as partic. Piel, and he interprets it accordingly, so that he brings out, along with the meaning lying in the word, also the allusion to &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1505;, Persian: thy kingdom is divided, or broken into pieces, and given to the Medes and Persians. The meaning is not that the kingdom was to be divided into two equal parts, and the one part given to the Medes and the other to the Persians; but &#1508;&#1512;&#1505; is to divide into pieces, to destroy, to dissolve the kingdom. This shall be effected by the Medes and Persians, and was so brought about when the Persian Cyrus with the united power of the Medes and Persians destroyed Babylon, and thus put an end to the Chaldean kingdom, whereby the kingdom was transferred first to the Median Darius (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/6-1.htm">Daniel 6:1</a> [<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/5-31.htm">Daniel 5:31</a>]), and after him to the Persian Cyrus. In the naming of the Median before the Persian there lies, as already remarked in the Introduction, a notable proof of the genuineness of this narrative, and with it of the whole book; for the hegemony of the Medes was of a very short duration, and after its overthrow by the Persians the form of expression used is always "Persians and Medes," as is found in the book of Esther. </body></html>
