This, from the character of Antiochus, we may well suppose he would do; and if Physcon stood in need of his assistance, he could not gainsay him. Polybius giving an account of the wealth of Antiochus in gold, silver, and precious stones, adds, “Part of this he took from Egypt, breaking the covenant which he had made with Ptolemy Philometor.” This testimony seems strongly to confirm, that what is said here is spoken of Antiochus: for the historian relates exactly the same thing that Daniel here foretels. <span class="ital">And the Lybians and the Ethiopians shall be at his steps — </span>Or, follow him; that is, as captives, being overcome in war; for that seems to be the meaning of the expression, <span class="ital">be at his steps. </span>It is very probable that Antiochus, from Egypt, made an incursion against those people, and gained some victories over them. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/11.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>11:31-45 The remainder of this prophecy is very difficult, and commentators differ much respecting it. From Antiochus the account seems to pass to antichrist. Reference seems to be made to the Roman empire, the fourth monarchy, in its pagan, early Christian, and papal states. The end of the Lord's anger against his people approaches, as well as the end of his patience towards his enemies. If we would escape the ruin of the infidel, the idolater, the superstitious and cruel persecutor, as well as that of the profane, let us make the oracles of God our standard of truth and of duty, the foundation of our hope, and the light of our paths through this dark world, to the glorious inheritance above.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/daniel/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He shall stretch forth his hand also upon the countries - Margin, send forth.

The Septuagint rendering is, "And he shall send forth his hand upon the countries, and in the land of Egypt there shall not be a saviour in it." The first part of this verse is marked with an asterisk. Evidently the text before the translators had <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x20;&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b5;&#x5d8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">lah pelaytah</span>), "to her deliverance," and "deliverance" in the abstract became "deliverer" in the concrete. Theodotion renders in a different sense, "And he shall stretch his hand upon the land, and the land of Egypt shall not be for salvation." The idea here is that for the land of Palestine, Egypt shall not be a deliverer. This, probably, is the true reading. The Peshitta agrees with the Massoretic pretty closely, "He shall stretch  his hand over the countries, and the land of Egypt shall escape from his hands." The Vulgate has nothing to justify remark. Probably this verse, in the way it is rendered by Theodotion, is a portion of the lost vision of Daniel. The vagueness of "countries" stands in contrast to the definiteness of Edom, Moab, and Ammon, and is thus suspicious. Help was always expected from Egypt in the time when Assyria and Babylonia successively claimed the subjection of the Holy Land. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/daniel/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(<a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/6-25.htm">Daniel 6:25-27</a>)<p>The consequences of this occurrence.<p>As Nebuchadnezzar, after the wonderful deliverance of Daniel's friends from the burning fiery furnace, issued an edict to all the nations of his kingdom forbidding them on pain of death from doing any injury to these men of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/3-29.htm">Daniel 3:29</a>), so now Darius, in consequence of this wonderful preservation of Daniel in the den of lions, gave forth an edict commanding all the nations of his whole kingdom to fear and reverence Daniel's God. But as Nebuchadnezzar by his edict, so also Darius, did not depart from the polytheistic standpoint. Darius acknowledged the God of Daniel, indeed, as the living God, whose kingdom and dominion were everlasting, but not as the only true God, and he commanded Him to be reverenced only as a God who does wonders in heaven and on earth, without prejudice to the honour of his own gods and of the gods of his subjects. Both of these kings, it is true, raised the God of Judea above all other gods, and praised the everlasting duration of His dominion (see <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/3-29.htm">Daniel 3:29</a>, 32 [<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-2.htm">Daniel 4:2</a>]f., and <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/3-31.htm">Daniel 3:31</a> [<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/3-28.htm">Daniel 3:28</a>]ff., <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/6-27.htm">Daniel 6:27</a> [<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/6-26.htm">Daniel 6:26</a>]f.), but they did not confess Him as the one only God. This edict, the, shows neither the conversion of Darius to the worship of the God of the Jews, nor does it show intolerance toward the gods of his subjects. On v. 26 (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/6-25.htm">Daniel 6:25</a>) cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/3-31.htm">Daniel 3:31</a> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-1.htm">Daniel 4:1</a>). As Nebuchadnezzar, so also Darius, regarded his kingdom as a world-kingdom. On 27a (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/6-26.htm">Daniel 6:26</a>) cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/3-29.htm">Daniel 3:29</a>. The reverence which all the nations were commanded to show to Daniel's God is described in the same words as is the fear and reverence which the might and greatness of Nebuchadnezzar inspired in all the nations that were subject to him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/5-19.htm">Daniel 5:19</a>), which has led Hitzig justly to remark, that the words &#1500;&#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1492;&#1468; &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1495;&#1497;&#1503; &#1500;&#1492;&#1493;&#1503; (they must worship his God) are not used. God is described as living (cf. v. 21 [<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/6-20.htm">Daniel 6:20</a>]) and eternal, with which is connected the praise of the everlasting duration of His dominion, and of His rule in heaven and on earth; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-44.htm">Daniel 2:44</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/3-33.htm">Daniel 3:33</a> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-3.htm">Daniel 4:3</a>). The &#1491;&#1468;&#1497; after &#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1492;&#1468; is not a conjunction, but is the relative, and the expression briefly denotes that His kingdom is a kingdom which is not destroyed; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-31.htm">Daniel 4:31</a> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-34.htm">Daniel 4:34</a>). &#1505;&#1493;&#1508;&#1488; &#1506;&#1491;, to the end - not merely of all heathen kingdoms which arise on the earth, i.e., to their final destruction by the kingdom of the Messiah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-44.htm">Daniel 2:44</a> (Kranichfeld), for there is no thought of the Messiah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-44.htm">Daniel 2:44</a> (Kranichfeld), for there is no thought of the Messianic kingdom here at all, but to the end of all things, to eternity. In v. 28 (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/6-27.htm">Daniel 6:27</a>) this God is lauded as the deliverer and wonder-worker, because in the case of Daniel He had showed Himself as such; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/3-32.htm">Daniel 3:32</a> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-2.htm">Daniel 4:2</a>). &#1497;&#1491; &#1502;&#1503;, from the hand, i.e., from the power of; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-21.htm">Psalm 22:21</a>. </body></html>
