Some read it, He shall commit the munitions of strength, that is, the city of Jerusalem, to a strange god: or, he shall put it under the protection of Jupiter Olympus. This god he shall not only <span class="ital">acknowledge, </span>but <span class="ital">shall increase with glory — </span>Setting his image even upon God’s altar. <span class="ital">And he shall cause them — </span>That minister to this idol; <span class="ital">to rule over many — </span>Shall put them into places of power and trust; <span class="ital">and </span>they <span class="ital">shall divide the land for gain — </span>Shall be maintained richly out of the profits of the country. Thus we find Antiochus’s officers promising Mattathias, that if he would do according to the king’s commandment, he and his house should be in the number of the king’s friends, and should be honoured with silver and gold, and many rewards, <a href="http://apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/2-18.htm" title="Now therefore come thou first, and fulfil the king's commandment, like as all the heathen have done, yea, and the men of Juda also, and such as remain at Jerusalem: so shalt thou and thy house be in the number of the king's friends, and thou and thy children shall be honoured with silver and gold, and many rewards.">1Ma 2:18</a>. The learned Mr. Mede, Bishop Newton, and many other interpreters, think that St. Paul refers to this prophecy, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_thessalonians/2-3.htm" title="Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;...">2 Thessalonians 2:3-12</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_timothy/4-1.htm" title="Now the Spirit speaks expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;...">1 Timothy 4:1-3</a>. And it must be acknowledged that much of what is here said is very applicable to antichrist, or the Papacy, termed by the apostle, <span class="ital">the man of sin, that exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped, forbidding to marry, </span>pretending not to regard <span class="ital">the desire of women, </span>and honouring saints and angels, whom his followers take for their protectors, (as the heathen of old depended on their demons,) making them presidents of several countries. But however applicable this may be to the idolatry, superstition, and tyranny of the Church of Rome, and however Antiochus might be intended to be a type of that antichristian power, the prophecy does not appear to have been primarily designed to be understood of it, but to have been meant of Antiochus himself, that great enemy of God’s ancient church. For it would be a vast transition, and not at all according to the regular series or order of time, for the prophecy to pass at once from Antiochus to antichrist. And as these prophecies, or visions, are expressly said by the angel who was sent to explain them, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/11-10.htm" title="But his sons shall be stirred up, and shall assemble a multitude of great forces: and one shall certainly come, and overflow, and pass through: then shall he return, and be stirred up, even to his fortress.">Daniel 11:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/11-14.htm" title="And in those times there shall many stand up against the king of the south: also the robbers of your people shall exalt themselves to establish the vision; but they shall fall.">Daniel 11:14</a>,) to relate to the Jewish people, or to be <span class="ital">concerning </span>WHAT SHOULD BEFALL THEM, and antichrist does not concern them in particular, therefore it seems most consistent with reason to interpret what is said here of Antiochus, as there is not the least appearance of the subject of the prophecy being changed. Every one, who reads this chapter without prepossession, must conclude, that the very same person is intended in this paragraph that is spoken of from <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/11-21.htm" title="And in his estate shall stand up a vile person, to whom they shall not give the honor of the kingdom: but he shall come in peaceably, and obtain the kingdom by flatteries.">Daniel 11:21</a>; and that there is no intimation in any one of these verses that any other person is primarily intended.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/11.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>11:31-45 The remainder of this prophecy is very difficult, and commentators differ much respecting it. From Antiochus the account seems to pass to antichrist. Reference seems to be made to the Roman empire, the fourth monarchy, in its pagan, early Christian, and papal states. The end of the Lord's anger against his people approaches, as well as the end of his patience towards his enemies. If we would escape the ruin of the infidel, the idolater, the superstitious and cruel persecutor, as well as that of the profane, let us make the oracles of God our standard of truth and of duty, the foundation of our hope, and the light of our paths through this dark world, to the glorious inheritance above.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/daniel/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thus shall he do in, the most strong holds - Margin, "fortresses of munitions." The reference is to strongly fortified places; to those places which bad been made strong for purposes of defense. The idea is, that he would carry on his purposes against these places, as it were, under the auspices of this strange god. It was a fact, that in his wars Antiochus came into possession of the strong places, or the fortified towns of the nations which he attacked - Jerusalem, Sidon, Peluslum, Memphis - then among the strongest places in the world.<p>With a strange god - A foreign god whom his fathers did not acknowledge; that is, according to the supposition above, and according to the fact, with the god whom he had adored at Rome, and whose worship he was ambitious to transfer to his own empire - the Jupiter of the Capitol. He seemed to be acting under the auspices of this foreign god.<p>Whom he shall acknowledge - By building temples and altars to him. "And increase with glory." That is, with honor. He would seem to increase or extend his dominion in the world, by introducing his worship in his own county and in the lands which he would conquer. Before, his dominion appeared to be only at Rome; Antiochus sought that it might be extended farther, over his own kingdom, and over the countries that he would conquer.<p>And he shall cause them to rule over many - That is, the foreign gods. Mention had been made before of only one god; but the introduction of the worship of Jupiter would be naturally connected with that of the other gods of Rome, and they are, therefore, referred to in this manner. The conquests of Antiochus would seem to be a setting up of the dominion of these gods over the lands which he subdued.<p>And shall divide the land for gain - Margin, "a price." The reference here is, probably, to the holy land, and the idea is that it would be partitioned out among his followers for a price, or with a view to gain; that is, perhaps, that it would be "farmed out" for the purpose of raising revenue, and that with this view, as often occurred, it would be set up for sale to the highest bidder. This was a common way of raising revenue, by "farming out" a conquered province; that is, by disposing of the privilege of raising a revenue in it to the one who would offer most for it, and the consequence was, that it gave rise to vast rapacity in extorting funds from the people. Compare 1 Macc. 3:35, 36, where, speaking of Lysias, whom Antiochus had "set to oversee the affairs of the king from the river Euphrates unto the borders of Egypt," it is said of Antiochus that he "gave him (Lysias) charge of all things that he would have done, as also concerning them that dwelt in Judea and Jerusalem: to wit, that he should send an army against them, to destroy and root out the strength of Israel, and the remnant of Jerusalem, and to take away their memorial from that place; and that he should place strangers in all their quarters, 'and divide their land by lot.

Newton translates, "to be defenders of Mahuzzim (the monks and priests who uphold saint worship), together with the strange god whom he shall acknowledge, he shall multiply honor." English Version is better: He shall do (exploits) in the most strongholds (that is, shall succeed against them) with a strange god (under the auspices of a god which he worshipped not before, namely, Jupiter Capitolinus, whose worship he imported into his empire from Rome). Antiochus succeeded against Jerusalem, Sidon, Pelusium, Memphis.<p>cause them&#8212;Antiochus "caused" his followers and the apostates "to rule over many" Jews, having "divided their land" (Judea), "for gain" (that is, as a reward for their compliance).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/daniel/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> A confirmation and ingemination of what he said before, he shall use all art and authority to propagate this idolatrous worship. We have laid by the interpretation of these things of Antiochus, though Polanus, Junius, and others apply all to him; but the angel speaks of the Romans, and it is plainly verified of antichrist, who did not only take upon him to dispose of kingdoms and provinces by usurped power, for his profit, drawing incredible masses of money from them, but upon a pretended religious account appointing tutelar saints over them. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/daniel/11.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Thus shall he do in the most strong holds with a strange god,....

But the Heb. is strange; and the sense obtained connects badly with what follows. Hitz., Meinh., and Bevan, changing a point, render, ‘And he shall procure for the fortresses of strongholds <span class="ital">the people of</span> a strange god,’ supposing the reference to be to the heathen soldiers and colonists settled by Antiochus in the citadel in Jerusalem, and other parts, of Judah (<a href="http://apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/1-33.htm" title="Then builded they the city of David with a great and strong wall, and with mighty towers, and made it a strong hold for them.">1Ma 1:33</a>; <a href="http://apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/3-36.htm" title="And that he should place strangers in all their quarters, and divide their land by lot.">1Ma 3:36</a>; <a href="http://apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/3-45.htm" title="Now Jerusalem lay void as a wilderness, there was none of her children that went in or out: the sanctuary also was trodden down, and aliens kept the strong hold; the heathen had their habitation in that place; and joy was taken from Jacob, and the pipe with the harp ceased.">1Ma 3:45</a>). The rendering ‘procure’ for <span class="greekheb">עשׂה</span> is, however, not very probable here, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-1.htm" title="And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him.">2 Samuel 15:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-5.htm" title="Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, I will be king: and he prepared him chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him.">1 Kings 1:5</a>, which are quoted in support of it, being hardly parallel.

An allusion to Antiochus’ methods of government, and to the means by which he filled his empty treasuries; perhaps, also, in particular, to renegade Jews who had been thus rewarded for their apostasy. Jason, and after him Menelaus, both purchased the high-priesthood from Antiochus (<a href="http://apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/4-8.htm" title="Promising unto the king by intercession three hundred and threescore talents of silver, and of another revenue eighty talents:...">2Ma 4:8-10</a>; <a href="http://apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/4-24.htm" title="But he being brought to the presence of the king, when he had magnified him for the glorious appearance of his power, got the priesthood to himself, offering more than Jason by three hundred talents of silver.">2Ma 4:24</a>); and Bacchides (<span class="ital">ib.</span> <a href="http://apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/9-25.htm" title="Again, considering how that the princes that are borderers and neighbours unto my kingdom wait for opportunities, and expect what shall be the event.

The first words of this belong to the previous verse, and at the same time there has been some confusion with the opening words of the present verse according to the Massoretic division. Theodotion is not much closer to the received text, "And he shall act in strongholds of refuge with a strange god, and shall increase glory, and subject many to them, and shall divide the land in gifts." The sense of this last, as given in the Greek versions, is illustrated by <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16-4.htm">Psalm 16:4</a>. The Peshitta renders, "He shall pass over to the strong cities, on account of ('<span class="accented">al</span>) the strange gods which he shall see, and he shall rule over many, and the land he shall divide for gain" The Vulgate renders more in accordance with Theodotion than with the Massoretic yet independently, "And he shall do (<span class="accented">faciet</span>) that he may fortify <span class="accented">Maozim</span> with a foreign god, whom he knew not, and shall multiply glory, and shall give to them power in many (things), and shall divide the land gratuitously" This verse as it stands is nearly unintelligible. The suggestion of Hitzig and yon Lengerke, followed by Bevan, that we should read <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;</span> ('am), "people," instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">eem</span>), "with," is very plausible. The only objection is that none of the versions have it. As, however, it seems to us the only way out of the difficulty, we shall take this reading, and render, with Professor Bevan, "He shall procure for the strong fortresses the people of a strange god." For this use of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5d4;</span> Professor Bevan refers to <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-1.htm">2 Samuel 15:1</a>, "Absalom procured for himself chariot and horses;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-5.htm">1 Kings 1:5</a>, so of Adonijah. <span class="accented">Whom he shall acknowledge and increase with glory.</span> This we should render, "who have acknowledged him," making the antecedent to the relative, not the king, but "the people of the strange god;" the reference being to the mercenaries of the Syrian army, who were the people of a god strange to the Israelites, and not impossibly made less difficulty in giving up their national gods, and recognizing the gods of Greece as their gods. The K'thib here is the preterite instead of the imperfect, which occurs in the following clause, the reading which we accept here. <span class="accented">He shall increase with glory</span>; or rather, <span class="accented">he shall multiply in glory.</span> These mercenaries of his he would increase, and give ever more honour to them. <span class="accented">And he shall cause them to rule over many</span>. These mercenaries placed in fenced cities were formed into Hellenic communities, and received many of the natives as subjects. The reference is not merely to garrisons being placed in fortresses, but to a chain of Hellenic cities, which, in imitation of the Romans, Antiochus placed in Palestine. <span class="accented">And shall divide the land for gain.</span> As will be seen, the Greek versions and the Vulgate reverse the idea here, and render - the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;</span>, "<span class="accented">gratuitously</span>;" Theodotion, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, "in gifts;" the Vulgate, <span class="accented">gratuito</span>, which is due to reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">meheer</span>) instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">meheer</span>). The word may mean, as it is taken by the English versions and the Peshitta to mean, "for a price;" as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-24.htm">2 Samuel 24:24</a>, David purchased the threshing-floor of Araunah <span class="accented">bimeheer</span>, "<span class="accented">at</span> a price;" but it also means "<span class="accented">wages</span>," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/3-11.htm">Micah 3:11</a>, "Her priests teach for hire wages (<span class="accented">bimeheer</span>)." The reference, then, is to the fact that in the deplenished state of his treasury, Antiochus divided the land of Palestine to his mercenaries, in lieu of the wages he could not pay. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/daniel/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>After Daniel had been thrown into the lions' den, its mouth was covered with a flat stone, and the stone was sealed with the king's seal and that of the great officers of state, that nothing might change or be changed (&#1489;&#1468;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;&#1500; &#1510;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;) concerning Daniel (&#1510;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;, affair, matter), not that the device against Daniel might not be frustrated (Hv., v.

Similarly also Ephr. Syr. and others.<p>The den of lions is designated by &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1488;, which the Targg. use for the Hebr. &#1489;&#1493;&#1512;, a cistern. From this v. Leng., Maur., and Hitzig infer that the writer had in view a funnel-shaped cistern dug out in the ground, with a moderately small opening or mouth from above, which could be covered with a stone, so that for this one night the lions had to be shut in, while generally no stone lay on the opening. The pit also into which Joseph, the type of Daniel, was let down was a cistern (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/37-24.htm">Genesis 37:24</a>), and the mouth of the cistern was usually covered with a stone (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/29-3.htm">Genesis 29:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-53.htm">Lamentations 3:53</a>). It can hence scarcely be conceived how the lions, over which no angel watched, could have remained in such a subterranean cavern covered with a stone. "The den must certainly have been very capacious if, as it appears, 122 men with their wives and children could have been thrown into it immediately after one another (v. 25 [<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/6-24.htm">Daniel 6:24</a>]); but this statement itself only shows again the deficiency of every view of the matter," - and thus the whole history is a fiction fabricated after the type of the history of Joseph! But these critics who speak thus have themselves fabricated the idea of the throwing into the den of 122 men with women and children - for the text states no number - in order that they might make the whole narrative appear absurd.<p>We have no account by the ancients of the construction of lions' dens. Ge. Hst, in his work on Fez and Morocco, p. 77, describes the lions' dens as they have been found in Morocco. According to his account, they consist of a large square cavern under the earth, having a partition-wall in the middle of it, which is furnished with a door, which the keeper can open and close from above. By throwing in food they can entice the lions from the one chamber into the other, and then, having shut the door, they enter the vacant space for the purpose of cleaning it. The cavern is open above, its mouth being surrounded by a wall of a yard and a half high, over which one can look down into the den. This description agrees perfectly with that which is here given in the text regarding the lions' den. Finally, &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1488; does not denote common cisterns. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/41-7.htm">Jeremiah 41:7</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/41-9.htm">Jeremiah 41:9</a>, &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1488; (Hebr. &#1489;&#1493;&#1512;) is a subterranean chamber into which seventy dead bodies were cast; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-15.htm">Isaiah 14:15</a>, the place of Sheol is called &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1489;. No reason, therefore, exists for supposing that it is a funnel-formed cistern. The mouth (&#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;) of the den is not its free opening above by which one may look down into it, but an opening made in its side, through which not only the lions were brought into it, but by which also the keepers entered for the purpose of cleansing the den and of attending to the beasts, and could reach the door in the partition-wall (cf. Hst, p. 270). This opening was covered with a great flat stone, which was sealed, the free air entering to the lions from above. This also explains how, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/6-20.htm">Daniel 6:20</a> ff., the king was able to converse with Daniel before the removal of the stone (namely, by the opening above).<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/6-19.htm">Daniel 6:19-21</a> (<a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/6-18.htm">Daniel 6:18-20</a>)<p>Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting: neither were any of his concubines brought before him; and this sleep went from him. The king spent a sleepless night in sorrow on account of Daniel. &#1496;&#1493;&#1514;, used adverbially, in fasting, i.e., without partaking of food in the evening. &#1491;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1492;, concubina; cf. The Arab. daha&#770; and daha&#770; equals , subigere faeminam, and Gesen. Thes. p. 333. On the following morning (v. 20 [<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/6-19.htm">Daniel 6:19</a>]) the king rose early, at the dawn of day, and went to the den of lions, and with lamentable voice called to him feebly hoping that Daniel might be delivered by his God whom he continually served. Daniel answered the king, thereby showing that he had been preserved; whereupon the king was exceeding glad. The future or imperf. &#1497;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/6-19.htm">Daniel 6:19</a>) is not to be interpreted with Kranichfeld hypothetically, he thought to rise early, seeing he did actually rise early, but is used instead of the perf. to place the clause in relation to the following, meaning: the king, as soon as he arose at morning dawn, went hastily by the early light. &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1490;&#1492;&#1488;, at the shining of the light, serves for a nearer determination of the &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1512;&#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;, at the morning dawn, namely, as soon as the first rays of the rising sun appeared. The predicate the living God is occasioned by the preservation of life, which the king regarded as possible, and probably was made known to the king in previous conversations with Daniel; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-3.htm">Psalm 42:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/84-3.htm">Psalm 84:3</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-36.htm">1 Samuel 17:36</a>, etc.<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/6-22.htm">Daniel 6:22-24</a> (<a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/6-21.htm">Daniel 6:21-23</a>)<p>In his answer Daniel declares his innocence, which God had recognised, and on that account had sent His angel (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-8.htm">Psalm 34:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/91-11.htm">Psalm 91:11</a>.) to shut the mouths of the lions; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-33.htm">Hebrews 10:33</a>. &#1493;&#1488;&#1507;, and also (concluding from the innocence actually testified to by God) before the king, i.e., according to the king's judgment, he had done nothing wrong or hurtful. By his transgression of the edict he had not done evil against the king's person. This Daniel could the more certainly say, the more he perceived how the king was troubled and concerned about his preservation, because in Daniel's transgression he himself had seen no conspiracy against his person, but only fidelity toward his own God. The king hereupon immediately gave command that he should be brought out of the den of lions. The Aph. &#1492;&#1504;&#1505;&#1511;&#1492; and the Hoph. &#1492;&#1505;&#1468;&#1511;, to not come from &#1504;&#1505;&#1511;, but from &#1505;&#1500;&#1511;; the  &#1504;is merely compensative. &#1505;&#1500;&#1511;, to mount up, Aph. to bring out; by which, however, we are not to understand a being drawn up by ropes through the opening of the den from above. The bringing out was by the opened passage in the side of the den, for which purpose the stone with the seals was removed. To make the miracle of his preservation manifest, and to show the reason of it, v. 24 (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/6-23.htm">Daniel 6:23</a>) states that Daniel was found without any injury, because he had trusted in his God.</body></html>
