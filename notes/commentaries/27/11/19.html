Being under great difficulties how to raise the money which he had stipulated to pay to the Romans, he marched into the eastern provinces, to collect there the arrears of tribute, and amass what treasure he could; and attempting to plunder the rich temple of Jupiter Belus in Elymais. he was assaulted by the inhabitants of the country, and slain, together with his attendants. Such is the account given of the circumstances of his death by Diodorus Siculus, Strabo, Justin, and Jerome.

From ver. 5-30, is generally considered to relate to the events which came to pass during the continuance of these governments; and from ver. 21, to relate to Antiochus Epiphanes, who was a cruel and violent persecutor of the Jews. See what decaying, perishing things worldly pomp and possessions are, and the power by which they are gotten. God, in his providence, sets up one, and pulls down another, as he pleases. This world is full of wars and fightings, which come from men's lusts. All changes and revolutions of states and kingdoms, and every event, are plainly and perfectly foreseen by God. No word of God shall fall to the ground; but what he has designed, what he has declared, shall infallibly come to pass. While the potsherds of the earth strive with each other, they prevail and are prevailed against, deceive and are deceived; but those who know God will trust in him, and he will enable them to stand their ground, bear their cross, and maintain their conflict.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/daniel/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Then he shall turn his face toward the fort of his own land - The strong fortifications of his own land - for the Hebrew word is in the plural. This he would do, of course, for protection. He would cease his attempts at conquest, and endeavor to find security in his own fortresses. As a matter of fact, after this defeat, Antiochus, in order to replenish his exhausted coffers, and to find the means of meeting the claims of the Romans, went into certain provinces of his empire. He attempted no other foreign wars, but sought security in his own dominions.<p>But he shall stumble and fall, and not be found - He died in an attempt to plunder the temple of Elymais. In this he provoked the people to an insurrection, and was slain, together with the soldiers who were with him. What was his "motive" for plundering that temple is uncertain, whether it was to meet the demands of the Romans, or whether it was avarice (Justin, xxxii. 2); but it was in this way that he "stumbled and fell," and passed away. - Jerome, "Com. in loc.;" Diod. Sic., "Fragmenta," xxvi. 30, 49; Justin, xxxii. 2; Strabo, p. 744.

After his defeat he fled with a few to Sardis, and from thence to Apamea, so Livy; and to Susa, and to the further parts of his dominions, as Jerom; or rather he betook himself to Antioch his capital city, called here "the fort of his own land", where he was obliged to continue: <p>but he shall stumble and fall, and not be found; the expenses of the war which Antiochus agreed to pay being reckoned at fifteen thousand Euboean talents, five hundred talents were to be paid down; two thousand five hundred at the ratification of the treaty by the senate of Rome; and the other twelve thousand to be paid yearly, at a thousand talents each year: now, being either in want of money, or through covetousness, he attempted to rob the temple of Jupiter Elymaeus, and went by night thither with his army for that purpose; but the thing being betrayed, the inhabitants got together, and slew him, with all his soldiers, as Justin (l) relates. Strabo (m) says, that Antiochus the great endeavouring to rob the temple of Bel, the barbarians near to (Elymais) rose of themselves, and slew him; and so never returned to Syria any more, but died in the province of Elymais, being slain by the Persians there, as related, and was never found more, or was buried; and this was the end of this great man, of whom so many things are said in this prophecy, and others follow concerning his successors.

After his discomfiture at Magnesia he was obliged to retire east of the Taurus, and confine himself to the ‘strongholds of his own land.’ To meet the heavy fine imposed upon him by the Romans[368] (Polyb. xxi. 14; Livy xxxvii. 45), he had to levy contributions where he could, and deemed sacrilege excusable under the circumstances. Having plundered for this purpose a wealthy temple of Bel in Elymais (Persia), he quickly met, says Diodorus (xxix. 15), <span class="greekheb">τῆς προσηκούσης ἐκ θεῶν κολάσεως</span>, being attacked by the inhabitants and slain (cf. Justin xxxii. 2).

After his defeat, Antiochus was not only compelled to submit to the loss of much of his empire, but was adjudged to pay all the expenses of the war, estimated at eighteen thousand Euboeic talents. Justin relates thus the death of Antiochus: "Meanwhile in Syria King Antiochus, being loaded with heavy tribute after his defeat by the Romans, whether urged by want of money or impelled by avarice, flattering himself that, under the plea of necessity, he might with fair excuse commit sacrilege, assaulted with an armed force by night the temple of Jove (Bel) in Elymais But the attempt having been discovered, there was a concourse of the inhabitants, and he was slain with all his forces." The resemblance here between the fate of Antiochus the Great and that of his son Epiphanes is so striking as to throw suspicion on one or other of them. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/daniel/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(<a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/5-31.htm">Daniel 5:31-6:9</a>)<p>Transference of the kingdom to Darius the Mede; appointment of the regency; envy of the satraps against Daniel, and their attempt to destroy him.<p>The narrative of this chapter is connected by the copula &#1493; with the occurrence recorded in the preceding; yet <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/6-1.htm">Daniel 6:1</a> does not, as in the old versions and with many interpreters, belong to the fifth chapter, but to the sixth, and forms not merely the bond of connection between the events narrated in the fifth and sixth chapters, but furnishes at the same time the historical basis for the following narrative, vv. 2-29 (vv. 1-28). The statement of the verse, that Darius the Mede received the kingdom when he was about sixty-two years old, connects itself essentially with <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/5-30.htm">Daniel 5:30</a>, so far as it joins to the fulfilment, there reported, of the first part of the sacred writing interpreted by Daniel to Belshazzar, the fulfilment also the second part of that writing, but not so closely that the designation of time, in that same night (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/5-30.htm">Daniel 5:30</a>), is applicable also to the fact mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/6-1.htm">Daniel 6:1</a> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/5-31.htm">Daniel 5:31</a>), and as warranting the supposition that the transference of the kingdom to Darius the Mede took place on the night in which Belshazzar was slain. Against such a chronological connection of these two verses, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/5-30.htm">Daniel 5:30</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/6-1.htm">Daniel 6:1</a> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/5-31.htm">Daniel 5:31</a>), we adduce in the second half of v. 1((<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/5-31.htm">Daniel 5:31</a>) the statement of the age of Darius, in addition to the reasons already adduced. This is not to make it remarkable that, instead of the young mad debauchee (Belshazzar), with whom, according to prophecy, the Chaldean bondage of Israel was brought to an end, a man of mature judgment seized the reigns of government (Delitzsch); for this supposition fails not only with the hypothesis, already confuted, on which it rests, but is quite foreign to the text, for Darius in what follows does not show himself to be a ruler of matured experience. The remark of Kliefoth has much more in its favour, that by the statement of the age it is designed to be made prominent that the government of Darius the Mede did not last long, soon giving place to that of Cyrus the Persian, v. 29 (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/6-28.htm">Daniel 6:28</a>), whereby the divine writing, that the Chaldean kingdom would be given to the Medes and Persians, was fully accomplished. Regarding Darjawesch, Darius, see the preliminary remarks. The addition of &#1502;&#1491;&#1497;&#1488; (Kethiv) forms on the one hand a contrast to the expression "the king of the Chaldeans" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/5-30.htm">Daniel 5:30</a>), and on the other it points forward to &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1505;&#1497;&#1488;, v. 29 (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/6-28.htm">Daniel 6:28</a>); it, however, furnishes no proof that Daniel distinguished the Median kingdom from the Persian; for the kingdom is not called a Median kingdom, but it is only said of Darius that he was of Median descent, and, v. 29 (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/6-28.htm">Daniel 6:28</a>), that Cyrus the Persian succeeded him in the kingdom. In &#1511;&#1489;&#1468;&#1500;, he received the kingdom, it is indicated that Darius did not conquer it, but received it from the conqueror. The &#1499; in &#1499;&#1489;&#1512; intimates that the statement of the age rests only on a probable estimate.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/6-2.htm">Daniel 6:2</a> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/6-1.htm">Daniel 6:1</a>)<p>For the government of the affairs of the kingdom he had received, and especially for regulating the gathering in of the tribute of the different provinces, Darius placed 120 satraps over the whole kingdom, and over these satraps three chiefs, to whom the satraps should give an account. Regarding &#1488;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488; (satraps), see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/3-2.htm">Daniel 3:2</a>. &#1505;&#1512;&#1499;&#1497;&#1503;, plur. of &#1505;&#1512;&#1498;; &#1505;&#1512;&#1499;&#1488; has in the Semitic no right etymology, and is derived from the Aryan, from the Zend. sara, ara, head, with the syllable ach. In the Targg., in use for the Hebr. &#1513;&#1473;&#1496;&#1512;, it denotes a president, of whom the three named in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/6-2.htm">Daniel 6:2</a> (1), by their position over the satraps, held the rank of chief governors or ministers, for which the Targg. use &#1505;&#1512;&#1499;&#1503;, while &#1505;&#1512;&#1499;&#1497;&#1503; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/6-8.htm">Daniel 6:8</a> denotes all the military and civil prefects of the kingdom.<p>The modern critics have derived from this arrangement for the government of the kingdom made by Darius an argument against the credibility of the narrative, which Hitzig has thus formulated: - According to Xenophon, Cyrus first appointed satraps over the conquered regions, and in all to the number of six (Cyrop. viii. 6, 1, 7); according to the historian Herodotus, on the contrary (iii. 89ff.), Darius Hystaspes first divided the kingdom into twenty satrapies for the sake of the administration of the taxes. With this statement agrees the number of the peoples mentioned on the Inscription at Bisutun; and if elsewhere (Insc. J. and Nakschi Rustam) at least twenty-four and also twenty-nine are mentioned, we know that several regions or nations might be placed under one satrap (Herod. l.c.). The kingdom was too small for 120 satraps in the Persian sense. On the other hand, one may not appeal to the 127 provinces (&#1502;&#1491;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514;) of king Ahasuerus  equals  Xerxes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/1-1.htm">Esther 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/9-30.htm">Esther 9:30</a>); for the ruler of the &#1502;&#1491;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492; is not the same as (<a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/8-9.htm">Esther 8:9</a>) the satrap. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/3-12.htm">Esther 3:12</a> it is the &#1508;&#1468;&#1495;&#1492;, as e.g., of the province of Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/1-1.htm">Haggai 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/1-8.htm">Malachi 1:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/5-14.htm">Nehemiah 5:14</a>). It is true there were also greater provinces, such e.g., as of Media and Babylonia (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/6-2.htm">Ezra 6:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-49.htm">Daniel 2:49</a>), and perhaps also pecha (&#1508;&#1468;&#1495;&#1492;) might be loosely used to designate a satrap (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/5-3.htm">Ezra 5:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/6-6.htm">Ezra 6:6</a>); yet the 127 provinces were not such, nor is a satrap interchangeably called a pecha. When Daniel thus mentions so large a number of satraps, it is the Grecian satrapy that is apparently before his mind. Under Seleucus Nicator there were seventy-two of these.<p>The foundation of this argument, viz., that Darius Hystaspes, "according to the historian Herodotus," first divided the kingdom into satrapies, and, of course, also that the statement by Xenophon of the sending of six satraps into the countries subdued by Cyrus is worthy of no credit, is altogether unhistorical, resting only on the misinterpretation and distortion of the testimonies adduced. Neither Herodotus nor Xenophon represents the appointment of satraps by Cyrus and Darius as an entirely new and hitherto untried method of governing the kingdom; still less does Xenophon say that Cyrus sent in all only six satraps into the subjugated countries. It is true he mentions by name (<a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/8-6.htm">Daniel 8:6-7</a>) only six satraps, but he mentions also the provinces into which they were sent, viz., one to Arabia, and the other five to Asia Minor, with the exception, however, of Cilicia, Cyprus, and Paphlagonia, to which he did not send any &#x3a0;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;, because they had voluntarily joined him in fighting against Babylon. Hence it is clear as noonday that Xenophon speaks only of those satraps whom Cyrus sent to Asia Minor and to Arabia, and says nothing of the satrapies of the other parts of the kingdom, such as Judea, Syria, Babylonia, Assyria, Media, etc., so that no one can affirm that Cyrus sent in all only six satraps into the conquered countries. As little does Herodotus, l.c., say that Darius Hystaspes was the first to introduce the government of the kingdom by satraps: he only says that Darius Hystaspes divided the whole kingdom into twenty &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769; which were called &#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3b9;&#836;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, appointed &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;, and regulated the tribute; for he numbers these satrapies simply with regard to the tribute with which each was chargeable, while under Cyrus and Cambyses no tribute was imposed, but presents only were contributed. Consequently, Herod. speaks only of a regulation for the administration of the different provinces of the kingdom for the special purpose of the certain payment of the tribute which Darius Hystaspes had appointed. Thus the historian M. Duncker also understands this statement; for he says (Gesch. des Alterth. ii. p. 891) regarding it: - "About the year 515 Darius established fixed government-districts in place of the vice-regencies which Cyrus and Cambyses had appointed and changed according to existing exigencies. He divided the kingdom into twenty satrapies." Then at p. 893 he further shows how this division also of the kingdom by Darius was not fixed unchangeably, but was altered according to circumstances. Hitzig's assertion, that the kingdom was too small for 120 satrapies in the Persian sense, is altogether groundless. From <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/8-9.htm">Esther 8:9</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/8-3.htm">Esther 8:3</a> :19 it follows not remotely, that not satraps but the &#1508;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514; represent the &#1502;&#1491;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514;. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-9.htm">Daniel 8:9</a> satraps, &#1508;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514;, and &#1492;&#1502;&#1491;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; &#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497; are named, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/3-12.htm">Daniel 3:12</a> they are called the king's satraps and &#1502;&#1491;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492; &#1506;&#1500; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1508;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514;. On <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/3-12.htm">Esther 3:12</a> Bertheau remarks: "The pechas, who are named along with the satraps, are probably the officers of the circles within the separate satrapies;" and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-9.htm">Daniel 8:9</a> satraps and pechas are named as &#1492;&#1502;&#1491;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; &#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;, i.e., presidents, superintendents of the 127 provinces of the kingdom from India to Ethiopia, from which nothing can be concluded regarding the relation of the satraps to the pechas. Berth. makes the same remark on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/8-36.htm">Ezra 8:36</a> : - "The relation of the king's satraps to the pachavoth abar nahara (governors on this side the river) we cannot certainly determine; the former were probably chiefly military rulers, and the latter government officials." For the assertion that pecha is perhaps loosely used for satrap, but that interchangeably a satrap cannot be called a pecha, rests, unproved, on the authority of Hitzig.<p>From the book of Esther it cannot certainly be proved that so many satraps were placed over the 127 provinces into which Xerxes divided the kingdom, but only that these provinces were ruled by satraps and pechas. But the division of the whole kingdom into 127 provinces nevertheless shows that the kingdom might have been previously divided under Darius the Mede into 120 provinces, whose prefects might be called in this verse &#1488;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1503;, i.e., kschatrapavan, protectors of the kingdom or of the provinces, since this title is derived from the Sanscrit and Old Persian, and is not for the first time used under Darius Hystaspes of Cyrus. The Median Darius might be led to appoint one satrap, i.e., a prefect clothed with military power, over each district of his kingdom, since the kingdom was but newly conquered, that he might be able at once to suppress every attempt at insurrection among the nations coming under his dominion. The separation of the civil government, particularly in the matter of the raising of tribute, from the military government, or the appointment of satraps &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#788; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;.&#x3c4;.&#x3bb;., along with the &#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; and the &#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;, for the protection of the boundaries of the kingdom, was first adopted, according to Xenophon l.c., by Cyrus, who next appointed satraps for the provinces of Asia Minor and of Arabia, which were newly brought under his sceptre; while in the older provinces which had formed the Babylonian kingdom, satrapies which were under civil and military rulers already existed from the time of Nebuchadnezzar; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-32.htm">Daniel 2:32</a>. This arrangement, then, did not originate with Darius Hystaspes in the dividing of the whole kingdom into twenty satrapies mentioned by Herodotus. Thus the statements of Herodotus and Xenophon harmonize perfectly with those of the Scriptures, and every reason for regarding with suspicion the testimony of Daniel wholly fails.<a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/6-2.htm">Daniel 6:2-3</a> (<a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/6-1.htm">Daniel 6:1-2</a>)<p>According to v. 2, Darius not only appointed 120 satraps for all the provinces and districts of his kingdom, but he also placed the whole body of the satraps under a government consisting of three presidents, who should reckon with the individual satraps. &#1506;&#1500;&#1468;&#1488;, in the Targg. &#1506;&#1497;&#1500;&#1488;, the height, with the adverb &#1502;&#1503;, higher than, above. &#1496;&#1506;&#1502;&#1488; &#1497;&#1492;&#1489;, to give reckoning, to account. &#1504;&#1494;&#1511;, part. of &#1504;&#1494;&#1511;, to suffer loss, particularly with reference to the revenue. This triumvirate, or higher authority of three, was also no new institution by Darius, but according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/5-7.htm">Daniel 5:7</a>, already existed in the Chaldean kingdom under Belshazzar, and was only continued by Darius; and the satraps or the district rulers of the several provinces of the kingdom were subordinated to them. Daniel was one of the triumvirate. Since it is not mentioned that Darius first appointed him to this office, we may certainly conclude that he only confirmed him in the office to which Belshazzar had promoted him.</body></html>
