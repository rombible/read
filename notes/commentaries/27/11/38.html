The Greek version, the Vulgate, and several other translations, retain the original word, without interpreting it. The word imports <span class="ital">protection, </span>or <span class="ital">a protector, </span>and is often rendered by the LXX., <span class="greekheb">υπερασπιστης</span>, <span class="ital">a defender, </span>or <span class="ital">champion.

And the god spoken of here, as honoured and ornamented by Antiochus, seems to have been <span class="ital">Baal- Semon, </span>the chief god of the Phenicians, who is with propriety said to be a god whom Antiochus’s father knew not; because there was no god of such name, nor supposed with the same power and attributes, among the Greeks, till (probably by Antiochus’s means) they followed the example of the Phenicians in worshipping such a god.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/11.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>11:31-45 The remainder of this prophecy is very difficult, and commentators differ much respecting it. From Antiochus the account seems to pass to antichrist. Reference seems to be made to the Roman empire, the fourth monarchy, in its pagan, early Christian, and papal states. The end of the Lord's anger against his people approaches, as well as the end of his patience towards his enemies. If we would escape the ruin of the infidel, the idolater, the superstitious and cruel persecutor, as well as that of the profane, let us make the oracles of God our standard of truth and of duty, the foundation of our hope, and the light of our paths through this dark world, to the glorious inheritance above.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/daniel/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But in his estate - The marginal reading here is, "As for the Almighty God, in his seat he shall honor, yea, he shall honor a god," etc. The more correct rendering, however, is that in the text, and the reference is to some god which he would honor, or for which he would show respect. The rendering proposed by Lengerke is the true rendering, "But the god of forces (firm places, fastnesses - der Vesten) he shall honor in their foundation" (auf seinem Gestelle). The Vulgate renders this, "But the god Maozim shall he honor in his place." So also the Greek. The phrase "in his estate" - &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1499;&#1504;&#1493;  'al-kano&#770; - means, properly, "upon his base," or foundation. It occurs in <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/11-20.htm">Daniel 11:20-21</a>, where it is applied to a monarch who would succeed another - occupying the same place, or the same seat or throne. See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/11-2.htm">Daniel 11:2</a>. Here it seems to mean that he would honor the god referred to in the place which he occupied, or, as it were, on his own throne, or in his own temple. The margin is, "or stead;" but the idea is not that he would honor this god instead of another, but that he would do it in his own place. If, however, as Gesenius and De Wette suppose, the sense is, "in his place, or stead," the correct interpretation is, that he would honor this "god of forces," in the stead of honoring the god of his fathers, or any other god. The general idea is clear, that he would show disrespect or contempt for all other gods, and pay his devotions to this god alone.<p>Shall he honor - Pay respect to; worship; obey. This would be his god. He would show no respect to the god of his fathers, nor to any of the idols usually worshipped, but would honor this god exclusively.<p>The God of forces - Margin, Mauzzim, or gods protectors; or, munitions. Hebrew, &#1502;&#1506;&#1494;&#1497;&#1501;  ma&#770;&#8219;uzym; Latin Vulgate, Maozim; Greek, &#x39c;&#x3b1;&#x3c9;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#768;&#x3bc;  Mao&#772;xeim; Syriac, "the strong God;" Luther, Mausim; Lengerke, der Vesten - fastnesses, fortresses. The Hebrew word &#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1494;  ma&#770;&#8219;o&#770;z means, properly, a strong or fortified place, a fortress; and Gesenius (Lexicon) supposes that the reference here is to "the god of fortresses, a deity of the Syrians obtruded upon the Jews, perhaps Mars." So also Grotius, C. B. Michaelis, Staudlin, Bertholdt, and Winer. Dereser, Havernick, and Lengerke explain it as referring to the Jupiter Capitolinus that Antiochus had learned to worship by his long residence in Rome, and whose worship he transferred to his own country. There has been no little speculation as to the meaning of this passage, and as to the god here referred to; but it would seem that the general idea is plain.<p>It is, that the only god which he would acknowledge would be force, or power, or dominion. He would set at nought the worship of the god of his fathers, and all the usual obligations and restraints of religion; he would discard and despise all the pleadings of humanity and kindness, as if they were the weaknesses of women, and he would depend solely on force. He would, as it were, adore only the "god of force," and carry his purposes, not by right, or by the claims of religion, but by arms. The meaning is not, I apprehend, that he would formally set up this "god of forces," and adore him, but that this would be, in fact, the only god that he would practically acknowledge. In selecting such a god as would properly represent his feelings he would choose such an one as would denote force or dominion. Such a god would be the god of war, or the Roman Jupiter, who, as being supreme, and ruling the world by his mere power, would be a fit representative of the prevailing purpose of the monarch.<p>The general sentiment is, that all obligations of religion, and justice, and compassion, would be disregarded, and he would carry his purposes by mere power, with the idea, perhaps, included, as seems to be implied in the remainder of the verse, that he would set up and adore such a foreign god as would be a suitable representation of this purpose. It is hardly necessary to say that this was eminently true of Antiochus Epiphanes; and it may be equally said to be true of all the great heroes and conquerors of the world. Mars, the god of war, was thus adored openly in ancient times, and the devotion of heroes and conquerors to that idol god, though less open and formal, has not been less real by the heroes and conquerors of modern times; and, as we say now of an avaricious or covetous man that he is a worshipper of mammon, though he in fact formally worships no god, and has no altar, so it might be affirmed of Antiochus, and may be of heroes and conquerors in general, that the only god that is honored is the god of war, of power, of force; and that setting at nought all the obligations of religion, and of worship of the true God, they pay their devotions to this god alone.<p>Next to mammon, the god that is most adored in this world is the "god of force" - this Mauzzim that Antiochus so faithfully served. In illustration of the fact that seems here to be implied, that he would introduce such a god as would be a fit representative of this purpose of his life, it may be remarked that, when in Rome, where Antiochus spent his early years, he had learned to worship the Jupiter of the Capitol, and that he endeavored to introduce the worship of that foreign god into Syria. Of this fact there can be no doubt. It was one of the characteristics of Antiochus that he imitated the manners and customs of the Romans to a ridiculous extent (Diod. Sic. Frag, xxvi. 65); and it was a fact that he sent rich gifts to Rome in honor of the Jupiter worshipped there (Livy, lxii. 6), and that he purposed to erect a magnificent temple in honor of Jupiter Capitolinus in Antioch - Livy, xli. 20.<p>This temple, however, was not completed. It will be remembered, also, that he caused an altar to Jupiter to be erected over the altar of burnt-sacrifice in Jerusalem. It should be added, that they who apply this to Anti-christ, or the Pope, refer it to idol or image worship. Elliott (Apocalypse, iv. 153) supposes that it relates to the homage paid to the saints and martyrs under the Papacy, and says that an appellation answering to the word Mahuzzim was actually given to the departed martyrs and saints under the Papal apostasy. Thus he remarks: "As to what is said of the willful king's honoring the god Mahuzzim (a god whom his fathers knew not) in place of his ancestors' god, and the true God, it seems to me to have been well and consistently explained, by a reference to those saints, and their relics and images, which the apostasy from its first development regarded and worshipped as the Mahuzzim, or fortresses of the places where they were deposited." - Apoc. iv. 157. But all this appears forced and unnatural; and if it be not supposed that it was designed to refer to Antichrist or the Papacy, no application of the language can be found so obvious and appropriate as that which supposes that it refers to Antiochus, and to his reliance on force rather than on justice and right.<p>And a god whom his fathers knew not - This foreign god, Jupiter, whom he had learned to worship at Rome.<p>Shall he honor with gold, and silver, and with precious stones ... - That is, he shall lavish these things on building a temple for him, or on his image. This accords with the account which Livy gives (xli. 20) of the temple which he commenced at Antioch in honor of Jupiter. Livy says that, although in his conduct he was profligate, and although in many things it was supposed that he was deranged - "Quidam hand dubie insanire aiebunt" - yet that in two respects he was distinguished for having a noble mind - for his worship of the gods, and for his favor toward cities in adorning them: "In duabus tamen magnis honestisque rebus vere regius erat animus, in urbium donis, et deorum cultu." He then adds, in words that are all the commentary which we need on the passage before us: "Magnificentiae vero in deos vel Jovis Olympii ternplum Athenis, unum in terris inchoatum pro magnitudine dei, potest testis esse. Sed et Delon aris insignibus statuarumque copia exornavit; et Antiochiae Joyis capitolini magnificum templum, non laqueatum auro tantum, sed parietibus totis lamina inauratum, et alia multa in aliis locis pollicita, quia perbreve tempus regni ejus fuit, non perfecited."<p>And pleasant things - Margin, "things desired." That is, with ornaments, or statuary, or perhaps pictures. Compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-16.htm">Isaiah 2:16</a>. e meant that the temple should be beautified and adorned in the highest degree.

The Phoenicians worshipped Mars the God of wars, which Antiochus did worship; but we are come to the Romans; and though many have conjectured several senses of this Mynem translated god of forces, yet none comes nearer than Mr. Mede, who interprets it of demons, or tutelar gods, which the Romans should worship with Christ, supposing them to be angels or saints. This is not to be thought a novel opinion, for many of the fathers say that this Mauzzim is the idol that antichrist should worship. So the meaning is, that in Christ’s seat, or place, the temple, they should worship saints and angels with Christ, as the preposition imports, together with Christ; which it is notorious they do. That which, made this place obscure was, that men generally took this strange god for an idol, which indeed the Jews call the Gentiles’ gods, and so doth the Old Testament often, because foreign to the true God, which was their God; but the true God was foreign and strange to the Romans, because their gods were idols. Therefore the philosophers called Christ Xenon daimonion, a strange god. This god they should <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">honour with gold, and silver, and precious stones.</span> The Vulgate translates <span class="ital">Mauzzim, protector</span>, and we know too well how the Romanists adorn the churches and shrines of these their patrons and tutelar saints, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-1.htm" title="The LORD is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the LORD is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?">Psalm 27:1</a> 28:8 31:3</span>.

Or, "with God he shall honour" (u); these along with him, or besides him; these shall be the objects of religious worship and honour, as they are: and that "in his estate"; or in his room and stead, that is, of the true God, our Lord Jesus Christ, the only Mediator between God and man; and yet angels and departed saints are set up as mediators in his stead: <p>and a god whom his fathers knew not shall he honour; the host, the wafer, the breaden god, made a god by the words of a muttering priest; this is such a god as the apostles, and Peter particularly, from whom the popes of Rome pretend to, derive their succession, never knew, nor once dreamed of; and yet this is received as a god, bowed unto, and worshipped, and honoured: <p>with gold, silver, and with precious stones, and pleasant things; with rich and costly ornaments, with which the pyxis or box, in which it is carried in procession, is adorned. <p>(q)  "deum Mahuzim", V.

There is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;</span> in the Massoretic, where <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;</span> has been in the reading followed by the Septuagint. After this clause the Septuagint proceeds, "And to his place he shall move, and a god whom his fathers knew not he shall honour with gold, and silver, and precious stones." It is possible that <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5d3;&#x5d3;</span> (<span class="accented">nadad</span>)," to flee or move," was read instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5d1;&#x5d3;</span> (<span class="accented">kabad</span>)," to honour;" for though <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;</span> is usually active and transitive, there is no object here. Theodotion has, "And the God of Maozeim he shall honour in his place, and a god whom his father knew not he shall honour with gold, silver, and precious stones, and with offerings." The Peshitta rendering is freer, "The mighty god he shall honour in his possession, and a god whom his fathers have not known shall he honour with gold and with silver, with precious gems and desirable things." The Vulgate adopts the transliteration <span class="accented">Maozim. In his estate shall he honour the god of forces.</span> There are a number of questions here. To whom does the prenominal suffix refer? The English translators have arranged the words so that we cannot escape the view that "the estate" is the king's, but the natural meaning of the Hebrew order is that it is "on the place" or "pedestal" of the god. The word translated "estate" is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/40-13.htm">Genesis 40:13</a> for "office." It is used of the "base" of the "laver." It may mean "place." The next point - What Deity is meant by "the god of strong holds"? There is absolutely nothing to guide us in the matter. Some have supposed that the reference is to Jupiter Olympius, whose statue Antiochus is reported to have set np in the temple. Others, that the reference is to Jupiter Capitolinus. Were there any evidences that Antiochus worshipped the genius of Rome, something might be urged for this; but we have no evidence of this. In the absence of anything to fix a definite meaning on this word, we feel inclined to suggest that Jehovah is meant by the <span class="accented">slosh mauzzeem.</span> Repeatedly in the Psalms is God declared to be the Strength of the saint; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-1.htm">Psalm 27:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/43-2.htm">Psalm 43:2</a> Of Jehovah it might be said that the ancestors of Antiochus - Greek and Syrian - knew him not. <span class="accented">Honour with gold</span>, etc. The repeated defeats of the armies of Antiochus and the spoiling of their camps by the followers of Jehovah, was giving honour to Jehovah, however unwittingly and unwillingly it was done. God "gat him honour upon Pharaoh," and so now he was honoured upon Epiphanes. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/daniel/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>After Daniel had been thrown into the lions' den, its mouth was covered with a flat stone, and the stone was sealed with the king's seal and that of the great officers of state, that nothing might change or be changed (&#1489;&#1468;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;&#1500; &#1510;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;) concerning Daniel (&#1510;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;, affair, matter), not that the device against Daniel might not be frustrated (Hv., v. Leng., Maur., Klief.). This thought required the stat. emphat. &#1510;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1488;, and also does not correspond with the application of a double seal. The old translator Theodot. is correct in his rendering: &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3c2; &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#834;&#837; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x394;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bb;, and the lxx paraphrasing: &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3c2; &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3b1;&#x3c0; &#787;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; (&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;) &#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#834;&#837; &#x3bf;&#788; &#x394;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bb;, &#x3b7;&#787;&#769; &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#837; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;. Similarly also Ephr. Syr. and others.<p>The den of lions is designated by &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1488;, which the Targg. use for the Hebr. &#1489;&#1493;&#1512;, a cistern. From this v. Leng., Maur., and Hitzig infer that the writer had in view a funnel-shaped cistern dug out in the ground, with a moderately small opening or mouth from above, which could be covered with a stone, so that for this one night the lions had to be shut in, while generally no stone lay on the opening. The pit also into which Joseph, the type of Daniel, was let down was a cistern (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/37-24.htm">Genesis 37:24</a>), and the mouth of the cistern was usually covered with a stone (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/29-3.htm">Genesis 29:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-53.htm">Lamentations 3:53</a>). It can hence scarcely be conceived how the lions, over which no angel watched, could have remained in such a subterranean cavern covered with a stone. "The den must certainly have been very capacious if, as it appears, 122 men with their wives and children could have been thrown into it immediately after one another (v. 25 [<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/6-24.htm">Daniel 6:24</a>]); but this statement itself only shows again the deficiency of every view of the matter," - and thus the whole history is a fiction fabricated after the type of the history of Joseph! But these critics who speak thus have themselves fabricated the idea of the throwing into the den of 122 men with women and children - for the text states no number - in order that they might make the whole narrative appear absurd.<p>We have no account by the ancients of the construction of lions' dens. Ge. Hst, in his work on Fez and Morocco, p. 77, describes the lions' dens as they have been found in Morocco. According to his account, they consist of a large square cavern under the earth, having a partition-wall in the middle of it, which is furnished with a door, which the keeper can open and close from above. By throwing in food they can entice the lions from the one chamber into the other, and then, having shut the door, they enter the vacant space for the purpose of cleaning it. The cavern is open above, its mouth being surrounded by a wall of a yard and a half high, over which one can look down into the den. This description agrees perfectly with that which is here given in the text regarding the lions' den. Finally, &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1488; does not denote common cisterns. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/41-7.htm">Jeremiah 41:7</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/41-9.htm">Jeremiah 41:9</a>, &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1488; (Hebr. &#1489;&#1493;&#1512;) is a subterranean chamber into which seventy dead bodies were cast; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-15.htm">Isaiah 14:15</a>, the place of Sheol is called &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1489;. No reason, therefore, exists for supposing that it is a funnel-formed cistern. The mouth (&#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;) of the den is not its free opening above by which one may look down into it, but an opening made in its side, through which not only the lions were brought into it, but by which also the keepers entered for the purpose of cleansing the den and of attending to the beasts, and could reach the door in the partition-wall (cf. Hst, p. 270). This opening was covered with a great flat stone, which was sealed, the free air entering to the lions from above. This also explains how, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/6-20.htm">Daniel 6:20</a> ff., the king was able to converse with Daniel before the removal of the stone (namely, by the opening above).<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/6-19.htm">Daniel 6:19-21</a> (<a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/6-18.htm">Daniel 6:18-20</a>)<p>Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting: neither were any of his concubines brought before him; and this sleep went from him. The king spent a sleepless night in sorrow on account of Daniel. &#1496;&#1493;&#1514;, used adverbially, in fasting, i.e., without partaking of food in the evening. &#1491;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1492;, concubina; cf. The Arab. daha&#770; and daha&#770; equals , subigere faeminam, and Gesen. Thes. p. 333. On the following morning (v. 20 [<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/6-19.htm">Daniel 6:19</a>]) the king rose early, at the dawn of day, and went to the den of lions, and with lamentable voice called to him feebly hoping that Daniel might be delivered by his God whom he continually served. Daniel answered the king, thereby showing that he had been preserved; whereupon the king was exceeding glad. The future or imperf. &#1497;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/6-19.htm">Daniel 6:19</a>) is not to be interpreted with Kranichfeld hypothetically, he thought to rise early, seeing he did actually rise early, but is used instead of the perf. to place the clause in relation to the following, meaning: the king, as soon as he arose at morning dawn, went hastily by the early light. &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1490;&#1492;&#1488;, at the shining of the light, serves for a nearer determination of the &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1512;&#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;, at the morning dawn, namely, as soon as the first rays of the rising sun appeared. The predicate the living God is occasioned by the preservation of life, which the king regarded as possible, and probably was made known to the king in previous conversations with Daniel; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-3.htm">Psalm 42:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/84-3.htm">Psalm 84:3</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-36.htm">1 Samuel 17:36</a>, etc.<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/6-22.htm">Daniel 6:22-24</a> (<a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/6-21.htm">Daniel 6:21-23</a>)<p>In his answer Daniel declares his innocence, which God had recognised, and on that account had sent His angel (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-8.htm">Psalm 34:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/91-11.htm">Psalm 91:11</a>.) to shut the mouths of the lions; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-33.htm">Hebrews 10:33</a>. &#1493;&#1488;&#1507;, and also (concluding from the innocence actually testified to by God) before the king, i.e., according to the king's judgment, he had done nothing wrong or hurtful. By his transgression of the edict he had not done evil against the king's person. This Daniel could the more certainly say, the more he perceived how the king was troubled and concerned about his preservation, because in Daniel's transgression he himself had seen no conspiracy against his person, but only fidelity toward his own God. The king hereupon immediately gave command that he should be brought out of the den of lions. The Aph. &#1492;&#1504;&#1505;&#1511;&#1492; and the Hoph. &#1492;&#1505;&#1468;&#1511;, to not come from &#1504;&#1505;&#1511;, but from &#1505;&#1500;&#1511;; the  &#1504;is merely compensative. &#1505;&#1500;&#1511;, to mount up, Aph. to bring out; by which, however, we are not to understand a being drawn up by ropes through the opening of the den from above. The bringing out was by the opened passage in the side of the den, for which purpose the stone with the seals was removed. To make the miracle of his preservation manifest, and to show the reason of it, v. 24 (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/6-23.htm">Daniel 6:23</a>) states that Daniel was found without any injury, because he had trusted in his God.</body></html>
