Jason and Menelaus, who were made high-priests by Antiochus for a sum of money, afterward became his instruments, and consented to the setting up of this idol: see <a href="http://apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/1-52.htm" title="Then many of the people were gathered unto them, to wit every one that forsook the law; and so they committed evils in the land;">1Ma 1:52</a>; <a href="http://apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/4-13.htm" title="Now such was the height of Greek fashions, and increase of heathenish manners, through the exceeding profaneness of Jason, that ungodly wretch, and no high priest;...">2Ma 4:13-15</a>; and <a href="http://apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/5-15.htm" title="Yet was he not content with this, but presumed to go into the most holy temple of all the world; Menelaus, that traitor to the laws, and to his own country, being his guide:">2Ma 5:15</a>; and <a href="http://apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/6-21.htm" title="But they that had the charge of that wicked feast, for the old acquaintance they had with the man, taking him aside, besought him to bring flesh of his own provision, such as was lawful for him to use, and make as if he did eat of the flesh taken from the sacrifice commanded by the king;">2Ma 6:21</a>. <span class="ital">But the people that do know their God — </span>That are savingly acquainted with him, and adhere to his true worship and service, <span class="ital">shall be strong and do exploits — </span>When others yield to the tyrant’s demands, and surrender their consciences to his impositions, these shall bravely keep their ground, resist the temptation, and make the tyrant himself ashamed of his attempt upon them. Good old Eleazar, one of the principal scribes, was one of these, rather choosing to suffer torments and death than defile himself by eating any thing unclean: see <a href="http://apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/6-19.htm" title="But he, choosing rather to die gloriously, than to live stained with such an abomination, spit it forth, and came of his own accord to the torment,">2Ma 6:19</a>. The mother and her seven sons resolutely adhered to their religion, though they knew they must be put to death for so doing, 2 Maccabees 7. This might well be called doing exploits; for to choose to suffer rather than to sin is a great exploit. And it was by being strong in faith that they did those exploits; and bore to be <span class="ital">tortured, not accepting deliverance, </span>as the apostle speaks, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-25.htm" title="Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season;">Hebrews 11:25</a>. “And many in Israel were fully resolved and confirmed in themselves not to eat any thing unclean, whereupon they chose rather to die, that they might not be defiled with meats, and that they might not profane the holy covenant,” <a href="http://apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/1-62.htm" title="Howbeit many in Israel were fully resolved and confirmed in themselves not to eat any unclean thing....">1Ma 1:62-63</a>.

The end of the Lord's anger against his people approaches, as well as the end of his patience towards his enemies. If we would escape the ruin of the infidel, the idolater, the superstitious and cruel persecutor, as well as that of the profane, let us make the oracles of God our standard of truth and of duty, the foundation of our hope, and the light of our paths through this dark world, to the glorious inheritance above.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/daniel/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And such as do wickedly against the covenant - That is, among the Jews.

The execution of the sentence was carried out, according to Oriental custom, on the evening of the day in which the accusation was made; this does not, however, imply that it was on the evening in which, at the ninth hour, he had prayed, as Hitzig affirms, in order that he may thereby make the whole matter improbable. In giving up Daniel to punishment, the king gave expression to the wish, "May thy God whom thou servest continually, deliver thee!" not "He will deliver thee;" for Darius could not have this confidence, but he may have had the feeble hope of the possibility of the deliverance which from his heart he wished, inasmuch as he may have heard of the miracles of the Almighty God whom Daniel served in the days of Belshazzar and Nebuchadnezzar.</body></html>
