The kings of Egypt and Syria are noticed: Judea was between their dominions, and affected by their contests. From ver. 5-30, is generally considered to relate to the events which came to pass during the continuance of these governments; and from ver. 21, to relate to Antiochus Epiphanes, who was a cruel and violent persecutor of the Jews. See what decaying, perishing things worldly pomp and possessions are, and the power by which they are gotten. God, in his providence, sets up one, and pulls down another, as he pleases. This world is full of wars and fightings, which come from men's lusts. All changes and revolutions of states and kingdoms, and every event, are plainly and perfectly foreseen by God. No word of God shall fall to the ground; but what he has designed, what he has declared, shall infallibly come to pass. While the potsherds of the earth strive with each other, they prevail and are prevailed against, deceive and are deceived; but those who know God will trust in him, and he will enable them to stand their ground, bear their cross, and maintain their conflict.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/daniel/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And shall also carry captives into Egypt their gods ... - That is, their idols.

These Ptolemy restored to the temple to which they belonged, and by this much endeared himself to his people. It was on account of the service which he thus rendered to his country that he was called Euergetes, that is, the Benefactor. - Prideaux, iii. 121.

Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/46-1.htm" title="Bel bows down, Nebo stoops, their idols were on the beasts, and on the cattle: your carriages were heavy laden; they are a burden to the weary beast....">Isaiah 46:1-2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-7.htm" title="For because you have trusted in your works and in your treasures, you shall also be taken: and Chemosh shall go forth into captivity with his priests and his princes together.">Jeremiah 48:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-3.htm" title="Howl, O Heshbon, for Ai is spoiled: cry, you daughters of Rabbah, gird you with sackcloth; lament, and run to and fro by the hedges; for their king shall go into captivity, and his priests and his princes together.">Jeremiah 49:3</a>. On the present occasion Jerome, following Porphyry, states that Ptolemy brought back with him 40,000 talents of silver and 2,500 precious vessels and images of gods, among the latter being those which Cambyses had carried off from Egypt 280 years before (cf. the Canopus decree, ll. 9–10: Mahaffy, p. 230). In consequence of the recovery of these images, it was said, the Egyptians conferred upon him the title of Euergetes (‘Benefactor’).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">precious vessels</span>] lit. <span class="ital">vessels of desire</span>: the same expression, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-27.htm" title="And Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honor: and he made himself treasuries for silver, and for gold, and for precious stones, and for spices, and for shields, and for all manner of pleasant jewels;">2 Chronicles 32:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-10.htm" title="And when the year was expired, king Nebuchadnezzar sent, and brought him to Babylon, with the goodly vessels of the house of the LORD, and made Zedekiah his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem.">2 Chronicles 36:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/13-15.htm" title="Though he be fruitful among his brothers, an east wind shall come, the wind of the LORD shall come up from the wilderness, and his spring shall become dry, and his fountain shall be dried up: he shall spoil the treasure of all pleasant vessels.">Hosea 13:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-9.htm" title="Then I came to the governors beyond the river, and gave them the king's letters.

Theodotion. as so frequently is the case, takes a place intermediate between the Massoretic and the version of the LXX. His rendering is, "And their gods, with those that moulded them, all their desirable vessels of gold and silver, he shall carry with the captivity into Egypt, and he shall prevail over the king of the north." Both the Greek versions take <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5e1;&#x5b4;&#x5db;&#x5b5;&#x5d4;&#x5b6;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">nesikhayhem</span>) as derived from <span class="accented">nasak</span>, "to pour out," hence "to mould," "to form a molten image," reading the word <span class="accented">noskeem.</span> The Syriac differs from both the Greek renderings and also from the Massoretic, "And even he shall terrify them, and their desirable vessels of silver and gold and the captives he shall carry down to Egypt, and twice (literally, 'one, two') shall rise against the king of the north." The Vulgate differs in meaning from all the preceding, but the text it is drawn from does not differ consonantly from that of the Massoretes, "And besides their gods. and their graven images, precious vessels too of silver and gold, he shall lead captive into Egypt, he shall prevail against the king of the north." The word <span class="accented">n'sikhayeem</span> is rendered, in the Revised Version, 'molten images' - a meaning given to the word by Furst, Gesenius, and Winer, with reference to this verse. The meaning assigned to the word in the Authorized is drawn from Rashi, and is in accordance with the usage of Ezekiel (Ezekiel 32:30). <span class="accented">And shall also carry caprices into Egypt their gods</span>, <span class="accented">with their princes.</span> As we have said, Ptolemy Euergetes conquered all Syria and Mesopotamia to beyond the Tigris. From this we learn he carried off immense booty, and among the articles taken were images of their gods. And not only the gods of Syria, but the images of the Egyptian gods, which had been carried into Syria from Egypt by Cambyses, nearly three centuries before. If this doubtful word, <span class="accented">nasakeem</span>, is taken to mean "images," it is difficult to see the reference of the prenominal suffix. Does it mean that the gods themselves, and the images of these gods, were taken? That is to say, does it mean that gods of the Syrians were taken, and also their images, as if the images and the gods were different? From this, notwithstanding the general consensus of interpreters, we feel ourselves necessitated to differ, and to make the word mean "princes," although there is no prominence, in the few accounts we have of this expedition, to any captives of such rank as to be called princes. <span class="accented">And with their precious vessels of silver and of gold.</span> This rendering, although retained in the Revised, is scarcely grammatically accurate, as the noun for "vessels" is already defined by the prenominal suffix. On the other hand, this word cannot readily be in apposition, as the article would be needed. Professor Bevan would make it "in silver and gold." We feel inclined to regard this as a somewhat irregular construction, as if a <span class="accented">ray</span> had dropped out before <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b6;&#x5e1;&#x5b4;&#x5e4;</span>, "silver," though most of the versions regard these nouns as in the genitive after "vessels." <span class="accented">And he shall continue more years than the king of the north</span> It is a matter of fact that Euergetes survived Seleueus Callinicus, his sister's stepson, about four years. Hitzig and Ewald would render," He shall refrain for some years from attacking the king of the north." This rendering has the advantage that it escapes from the purely unimportant personal statement that Ptolemy should survive Callinicus. That the king of the north was allotted to regain the greater part of the dominions which had been wrested from him, without any counter effort on the part of Ptolemy, is more important. Keil objects to this that the emphatic position of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d0;</span> is against this, and would support the rendering of the Vulgate, <span class="accented">Ipse prevalebit adversus regem Aquilouis.</span> Both versions are so far grammatically defensible; yet both are a little strained: both are in accordance with history.  <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/daniel/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Daniel now turns to Belshazzar.
