Daniel's fainting and astonishment at the prospect of evils he saw coming on his people and the church, confirm the opinion that long-continued calamities were foretold. The vision being ended, a charge was given to Daniel to keep it private for the present. He kept it to himself, and went on to do the duty of his place. As long as we live in this world we must have something to do in it; and even those whom God has most honoured, must not think themselves above their business. Nor must the pleasure of communion with God take us from the duties of our callings, but we must in them abide with God. All who are intrusted with public business must discharge their trust uprightly; and, amidst all doubts and discouragements, they may, if true believers, look forward to a happy issue. Thus should we endeavour to compose our minds for attending to the duties to which each is appointed, in the church and in the world.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/daniel/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And I heard a man's voice between the banks of Ulai - See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-2.htm">Daniel 8:2</a>.

Gabriel is also often mentioned in non-canonical Jewish writings. In Enoch ix. 1 and xx. 7, he is one of the four (or seven) principal angels or ‘archangels’ (see their names on <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-13.htm" title="But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days: but, see, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me; and I remained there with the kings of Persia.">Daniel 10:13</a>); in xl. 3–7, 9, he is one of the four ‘presences’ (Michael, Raphael, Gabriel, and Phanuel; so liv. 6, lxxi. 8, 9, 13), who bless, or make intercession, or ward off the accusing ‘Satans,’ before God (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-19.htm" title="And the angel answering said to him, I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God; and am sent to speak to you, and to show you these glad tidings.">Luke 1:19</a>, ‘I am Gabriel, that <span class="ital">stand in the presence of God</span>’); in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-9.htm" title="Yet heard I the voice of his words: and when I heard the voice of his words, then was I in a deep sleep on my face, and my face toward the ground.">Daniel 10:9</a> he is commissioned to destroy the wicked giants. Gabriel is also mentioned not unfrequently in the later (post-Christian) Jewish literature (Weber, <span class="ital">System der altsynag. Theologie</span>, pp. 162, 163–4, 167–8, 306): so, for instance, in the Targ. of Pseudo-Jon. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/37-15.htm" title="And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in the field: and the man asked him, saying, What seek you?">Genesis 37:15</a>, he is the ‘man’ who shews Joseph the way to his brethren, and in the Targ. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/25-2.htm" title="Dominion and fear are with him, he makes peace in his high places.">Job 25:2</a> he is said to stand on God’s left hand, while Michael is at His right. See, further, on <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-13.htm" title="But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days: but, see, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me; and I remained there with the kings of Persia.">Daniel 10:13</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I heard a man's voice between the hanks of Ulai, which called, and said, Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision</span>. The Septuagint has an addition, "And the man called out, saying, To that purpose is the <span class="accented">vision."</span> This seems to be a gloss. Theodotion and the Peshita agree with the Massoretic, only that Theodotion does not indicate the difference of the word used for "man" in this verse from that in ver 15, and renders Ulai "<span class="accented">Oubeh"</span> "<span class="accented">Between</span> Ulai" is a singular phrase. The versions do not attempt any solution. The preposition <span class="accented">bayin</span> means usually "between." If we assume that the river Ulai is here meant, and that it divided into two branches, the thing is explicable. Only it would have been more in accordance with usage to have put "Ulai" in the plural. It may, perhaps refer to the marsh, in which case it might be between the citadel and the marsh. Daniel had seen the appearance of a man; now he hears a voice addressing the man, and naming him <span class="accented">Gabriel</span>, "Hero of God." It is to be noted that this is the earliest instance of the naming of angels in Scripture. In the tenth chapter Michael is also named. These are the only angelic names in the whole of Scripture. These two names, and these alone, recur in the New Testament, the first of them in the first chapter of Luke, and the second in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-7.htm">Revelation 12:7</a> and Jude. The Book of Tobit added another angelic name on the same lines, Raphael. When we <span class="accented">pass</span> to the Books of Enoch, we have moat elaborate hierarchies of angels, in all of which, however much they may otherwise differ, occur the two angels mentioned here and Raphael. The difference in atmosphere between the elaborate angelology of Enoch and the reticent accounts in the book before us is great. It is hardly possible to imagine so great a difference between the works of men that were all but contemporaries. The function assigned to Gabriel here is in accordance with that he fulfils in the New Testament - he is to make Daniel "understand the vision." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/daniel/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>&#1491;&#1468;&#1497; &#1502;&#1503; (because that), a further explanatory expression added to &#1491;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492; &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1511;&#1489;&#1500; (wholly for this cause): because the word of the king was sharp, and in consequence of it (&#1493;), the furnace was heated beyond measure for that reason. The words &#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1498; &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488; (these mighty men) stand here in the status absol., and are again taken up in the pronoun &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1503; after the verb &#1511;&#1496;&#1468;&#1500;. If the three were brought up to the furnace, it must have had a mouth above, through which the victims could be cast into it. When heated to an ordinary degree, this could be done without danger to the men who performed this service; but in the present case the heat of the fire was so great, that the servants themselves perished by it. This circumstance also is mentioned to show the greatness of the miracle by which the three were preserved unhurt in the midst of the furnace. The same thing is intended by the repetition of the word &#1502;&#1499;&#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497;&#1503;, bound, <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/3-23.htm">Daniel 3:23</a>, which, moreover, is purposely placed at the close of the passage to prepare for the contrast &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1503;, at liberty, free from the bonds, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/3-25.htm">Daniel 3:25</a>.<p>(Note: Between <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/3-23.htm">Daniel 3:23</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/3-24.htm">Daniel 3:24</a> the lxx have introduced the Prayer of Azariah and the Song of the three men in the fiery furnace; and these two hymns are connected together by a narrative which explains the death of the Chaldeans who threw the three into the furnace, and the miracle of the deliverance of Daniel's friends.
