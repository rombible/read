Could we foresee the changes that shall be when we are gone, we should be less affected with changes in our own day. The ram with two horns was the second empire, that of Media and Persia. He saw this ram overcome by a he-goat. This was Alexander the Great. Alexander, when about thirty-three years of age, and in his full strength, died, and showed the vanity of worldly pomp and power, and that they cannot make a man happy. While men dispute, as in the case of Alexander, respecting the death of some prosperous warrior, it is plain that the great First Cause of all had no more of his plan for him to execute, and therefore cut him off. Instead of that one great horn, there came up four notable ones, Alexander's four chief captains. A little horn became a great persecutor of the church and people of God. It seems that the Mohammedan delusion is here pointed out. It prospered, and at one time nearly destroyed the holy religion God's right hand had planted. It is just with God to deprive those of the privileges of his house who despise and profane them; and to make those know the worth of ordinances by the want of them, who would not know it by the enjoyment of them. Daniel heard the time of this calamity limited and determined; but not the time when it should come. If we would know the mind of God, we must apply to Christ, in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge; not hid from us, but hid for us. There is much difficulty as to the precise time here stated, but the end of it cannot be very distant. God will, for his own glory, see to the cleansing of the church in due time. Christ died to cleanse his church; and he will so cleanse it as to present it blameless to himself.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/daniel/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And out of one of them, came forth a little horn - Emblematic of new power that should spring up. Compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-8.htm">Daniel 7:8</a>. This little horn sprang, up out of one of the others; it did not spring up in the midst of the others as the little horn, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/7-8.htm">Daniel 7:8</a>, did among the ten others. This seemed to grow out of one of the four, and the meaning cannot be misunderstood. From one of the four powers or kingdoms into which the empire of Alexander would be divided, there would spring up this ambitions and persecuting power.<p>Which waxed exceeding great - Which became exceedingly powerful. It was comparatively small at first, but ultimately became mighty. There can be no doubt that Antiochus Epiphanes is denoted here. All the circumstances of the prediction find a fulfillment in him; and if it were supposed that this was written after he had lived, and that it was the design of the writer to describe him by this symbol, he could not have found a symbol that would have been more striking or appropriate than this. The Syriac version has inserted here, in the Syriae text, the words "Antiochus Epiphanes," and almost without exception expositors have been agreed in the opinion that he is referred to. For a general account of him, see the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/7-24.htm">Daniel 7:24</a>, following The author of the book of Maccabees, after noticing, in the passage above quoted, the death of Alexander, and the distractions that followed his death, says, "And there came out of them a wicked root, Antiochus, surnamed Epiphanes, son of Antiochus the king, who had been a hostage at Rome, and he reigned in the hundred and thirty and seventh year of the kingdom of the Greeks," 1 Macc. 1:10. A few expositors have supposed that this passage refers to Antichrist - what will not expositors of the Bible suppose? But the great body of interpreters have understood it to refer to Antiochus. This prince was a successor of Seleucus Nicator, who, in the division of the empire of Alexander, obtained Syria, Babylonia, Media, etc. (see above the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-8.htm">Daniel 8:8</a>), and whose capital was Antioch. The succession of princes who reigned in Antioch, from Seleucus to Antiochus Epiphanes, were as follows:<p>(1) Seleucus Nicator, 312-280 b.c.<p>(2) Antiochus Soter, his son, 280-261.<p>(3) Antiochus Theos, his son, 261-247.<p>(4) Seleucus Callinicus, his son, 247-226.<p>(5) (Alexander), or Seleucus Ceraunus, his son, 226-223.<p>(6) Antiochus the Great, his brother, 223-187.<p>(7) Seleucus Philopater, his son, 187-176.<p>(8) Antiochus Epiphanes, his brother, 176-164.<p> - Clinton's Fasti Hellenici, vol. iii. Appendix, ch. iii.<p>The succession of the Syrian kings reigning in Antioch was continued until Syria was reduced to the form of a Roman province by Pompey, 63 b.c. Seleucus Philopater, the immediate predecessor of Antiochus, having been assassinated by one of his courtiers, his brother Antiochus hastened to occupy the vacant throne, although the natural heir, Demetrius, son of Seleucus, was yet alive, but a hostage at Rome. Antiochus assumed the name of Epiphanes, or Illustrious. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/11-21.htm">Daniel 11:21</a>, it is intimated that he gained the kingdom by flatteries; and there can be no doubt that bribery, and the promise of reward to others, was made use of to secure his power. See Kitto's Cyclo., i.-168-170. Of the acts of this prince there will be occasion for a fuller detail in the notes on the remainder of this chapter, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/11.htm">Daniel 11</a>.<p>Toward the south - Toward the country of Egypt, etc. In the year 171 b.c., he declared war against Ptolemy Philometer, and in the year 170 he conquered Egypt, and plundered Jerusalem. 1 Macc. 1:16-19: "Now when the kingdom was established before Antiochus, he thought to reign over Egypt, that he might have the dominion of two realms. Wherefore he entered Egypt with a great multitude, with chariots, and elephants, and horsemen, and a great navy. And made war against Ptolemee king of Egypt: but Ptolemee was afraid of him, and fled; and many were wounded to death. Thus they got the strong cities in the land of Egypt, and he took the spoils thereof."<p>And toward the east - Toward Persia and the countries of the East. He went there - these countries being nominally subject to him - according to the author of the book of Maccabees (1 Macc. 3:21-37), in order to replenish his exhausted treasury, that he might carry on his wars with the Jews, and that he might keep up the splendor and liberality of his court: "He saw that the money of his treasures failed, and that the tributes in the country were small, because of the dissension and plague which he had brought upon the land, and he feared that he should not be able to bear the charges any longer, nor to have such gifts to give so liberally as he did before; wherefore, being greatly perplexed in his mind, he determined to go into Persia, there to take the tributes of the countries, and to gather much money. So the king departed from Antioch, his royal city, the hundred forty and seventh year; and having passed the river Euphrates, he went through the high countries."<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/daniel/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. little horn&#8212;not to be confounded with the little horn of the fourth kingdom in Da 7:8. The little horn in Da 7:8 comes as an eleventh horn after ten preceding horns. In Da 8:9 it is not an independent fifth horn, after the four previous ones, but it arises out of one of the four existing horns. This horn is explained (Da 8:23) to be "a king of fierce countenance," &c. Antiochus Epiphanes is meant. Greece with all its refinement produces the first, that is, the Old Testament Antichrist. Antiochus had an extraordinary love of art, which expressed itself in grand temples. He wished to substitute Zeus Olympius for Jehovah at Jerusalem. Thus first heathen civilization from below, and revealed religion from above, came into collision. Identifying himself with Jupiter, his aim was to make his own worship universal (compare Da 8:25 with Da 11:36); so mad was he in this that he was called Epimanes (maniac) instead of Epiphanes. None of the previous world rulers, Nebuchadnezzar (Da 4:31-34), Darius (Da 6:27, 28), Cyrus (Ezr 1:2-4), Artaxerxes Longimanus (Ezr 7:12), had systematically opposed the Jews' religious worship. Hence the need of prophecy to prepare them for Antiochus. The struggle of the Maccabees was a fruit of Daniel's prophecy (1 Maccabees 2:59). He is the forerunner of the final Antichrist, standing in the same relation to the first advent of Christ that Antichrist does to His second coming. The sins in Israel which gave rise to the Greek Antichrist were that some Jews adopted Hellenic customs (compare Da 11:30, 32), erecting theaters, and regarding all religions alike, sacrificing to Jehovah, but at the same time sending money for sacrifices to Hercules. Such shall be the state of the world when ripe for Antichrist. At Da 8:9 and Da 8:23 the description passes from the literal Antiochus to features which, though partially attributed to him, hold good in their fullest sense only of his antitype, the New Testament Antichrist. The Mohammedan Antichrist may also be included; answering to the Euphratean (Turk) horsemen (Re 9:14-21), loosed "an hour, a day, a month, a year" (391 years, in the year-day theory), to scourge corrupted, idolatrous Christianity. In A.D. 637 the Saracen Moslem mosque of Omar was founded on the site of the temple, "treading under foot the sanctuary" (Da 8:11-13); and there it still remains. The first conquest of the Turks over Christians was in A.D. 1281; and 391 years after they reached their zenith of power and began to decline, Sobieski defeating them at Vienna. Mohammed II, called "the conqueror," reigned A.D. 1451-1481, in which period Constantinople fell; 391 years after brings us to our own day, in which Turkey's fall is imminent.<p>waxed &#8230; great, toward &#8230; south&#8212;(Da 11:25).

(1 Maccabees 3:31) <p>"1 About that time king Antiochus travelling through the high countries heard say, that Elymais in the country of Persia was a city greatly renowned for riches, silver, and gold; 2 And that there was in it a very rich temple, wherein were coverings of gold, and breastplates, and shields, which Alexander, son of Philip, the Macedonian king, who reigned first among the Grecians, had left there.''

The Arabic version reads "toward the west"; no mention is made of the north, because there he himself reigned; Syria being north to Egypt, as that was south to Syria; hence afterwards the king of Egypt is called the king of the south, and the king of Syria the king of the north. <p>(c) See Joseph.

The Greek versions here differ considerably from the Massoretic text. The LXX. is as follows: "And out of one there sprang a strong horn, and it prevailed and smote toward the south, toward the south-west  (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>), and toward the east, and toward the north." In this case, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> is clearly a doublet - an alternative rendering that has got into the text from the margin. <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x1fe5;&#x1fe4;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;</span> results from reading <span class="accented">tzephonah</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5d5;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>) instead of <span class="accented">tzebee</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>). Theodotion renders, "From one of them went forth a strong horn, and was magnified exceedingly to the south and to the power" - reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> (<span class="accented">tzaba</span>), "host," for <span class="accented">tzebee.</span> It is to be observed that both translate <span class="accented">mitztze'eeroth</span> as "strong" (<span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>) instead of "little." The reason of this is that they have taken <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;</span> as equivalent to <span class="accented">ex</span>, therefore equivalent to a negative. The Peshitta agrees with the Authorized in reading <span class="accented">mitztzeeroth as</span> "little," but leaves out the difficult final word rendered "the pleasant land" in our Authorized Version. Jerome translates <span class="accented">mitztze'eeroth</span> by <span class="accented">modicum</span>, and <span class="accented">tzebee</span> by <span class="accented">fortitudinem</span> - a combination of Theodotion and the Massoretic; he must have had <span class="accented">tzaba</span> in his text instead of <span class="accented">tzebee</span>,  - this may have been due to the fact that <span class="accented">tzaba</span> occurs in the next verse. The reference is sufficiently obvious to Antiochus. The description is accurate; he sprang from one of the four horns or dynasties that succeeded the great conqueror. He carried his arms to the east, but mainly to the south against Egypt. The great difficulties are in the two Hebrew words <span class="accented">mitztz"</span><span class="accented">eeroth</span> and <span class="accented">tzebee.</span> As to the first word, the fact that the two Greek versions have read it are conclusive against the suggestion of Gratz and Hitzig, supported by Bevan, that we should omit <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5df;</span>. (<span class="accented">min</span>). Jephet-ibn-Ali takes <span class="accented">min</span> as denoting the origin of the horn, "from a little one." The further suggestion of Gratz, that we should adopt the reading of the LXX., is rightly combatted by Professor Bevan. The readings alike of the LXX. and Theodotion could have sprung from the Massoretic reading, whereas neither of these could so readily be the original reading. It was necessary that Israel should be prominent in this part of the prophecy; it all leads up to the persecution the Jews endured at the hands of Epiphanes. It is necessary, then, to hold that this word, whatever reading we adopt, and whatever immediate meaning we assign to it, must refer to Palestine. Ewald renders it "ornament;" Bevan, "glory." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/daniel/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>&#1506;&#1514;&#1497;&#1491;&#1497;&#1503; taken with the following clause, &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503; ... &#1491;&#1468;&#1497;, is not a circumlocution for the future (according to Winer, Chald. Gram. 45, 2). This does not follow from the use of the simple future in contrast, but it retains its peculiar meaning ready. The conclusion to the first clause is omitted, because it is self-evident from the conclusion of the second, opposed passage: then ye will not be cast into the fiery furnace. Similar omissions are found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-32.htm">Exodus 32:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/13-9.htm">Luke 13:9</a>. For the purpose of giving strength to his threatening, Nebuchadnezzar adds that no god would deliver them out of his hand. In this Hitz. is not justified in supposing there is included a blaspheming of Jehovah like that of Sennacherib, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-10.htm">Isaiah 37:10</a>. The case is different. Sennacherib raised his gods above Jehovah, the God of the Jews; Nebuchadnezzar only declares that deliverance out of the fiery furnace is a work which no god can accomplish, and in this he only indirectly likens the God of the Jews to the gods of the heathen.</body></html>
