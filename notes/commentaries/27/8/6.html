Could we foresee the changes that shall be when we are gone, we should be less affected with changes in our own day. The ram with two horns was the second empire, that of Media and Persia. He saw this ram overcome by a he-goat. This was Alexander the Great. Alexander, when about thirty-three years of age, and in his full strength, died, and showed the vanity of worldly pomp and power, and that they cannot make a man happy. While men dispute, as in the case of Alexander, respecting the death of some prosperous warrior, it is plain that the great First Cause of all had no more of his plan for him to execute, and therefore cut him off. Instead of that one great horn, there came up four notable ones, Alexander's four chief captains. A little horn became a great persecutor of the church and people of God. It seems that the Mohammedan delusion is here pointed out. It prospered, and at one time nearly destroyed the holy religion God's right hand had planted. It is just with God to deprive those of the privileges of his house who despise and profane them; and to make those know the worth of ordinances by the want of them, who would not know it by the enjoyment of them. Daniel heard the time of this calamity limited and determined; but not the time when it should come. If we would know the mind of God, we must apply to Christ, in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge; not hid from us, but hid for us. There is much difficulty as to the precise time here stated, but the end of it cannot be very distant. God will, for his own glory, see to the cleansing of the church in due time. Christ died to cleanse his church; and he will so cleanse it as to present it blameless to himself.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/daniel/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And he came to the ram ... - Representing the Medo-Persian power.<p>And ran unto him in the fury of his power - Representing the fierceness and fury with which Alexander attacked the Persians at the Granicus, at Issus, and at Arbela, with which he invaded and overthrew them in their own country.

Alexander being chosen and made by the states of Greece captain general of all Greece against the Persians, marched from thence with his army, passed the Hellespont, and entered into the kingdom of the Medes and Persians, signified by the ram with two horns, and came up to Darius Codomannus, possessed of this large monarchy, and at the head of a numerous army: <p>which I had seen standing before the river; the river Ulai, near to Shushan, the royal seat of the kings of Persia; here Darius stood in his royal majesty and dignity, as the defender of his empire, and unconcerned at the attempt of Alexander, having nothing to fear, as he thought, from such a puny adversary: <p>and ran unto him in the fury of his power; or, "heat of his power" (b); which denotes the haste Alexander made with his army into Asia; his eager desire, and the fervour of his mind to engage with the Persians: the historian says, that he passed the Hellespont into Asia, "incredibli ardore mentis accensus"; fired with an incredible ardour of mind: and a little after, having conquered the rebels of Pisidia, he marched against Darius, "summo mentis ardore"; with the greatest ardour of mind, and with no less alacrity (c); which exactly agrees with the sacred text.

That they did not do so is not expressly said, but is expressed in what follows. &#1499;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1491;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;&#1503; &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1503; are not Chaldeans as astrologers of magi (&#1499;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;), but members of the Chaldean nation, in contrast to &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497;&#1488;, the Jews. &#1511;&#1512;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;, they came near to the king. &#1491;&#1468;&#1497; &#1511;&#1512;&#1510;&#1497; &#1488;&#1499;&#1500;, literally, to eat the flesh of any one, is in Aramaic the common expression for to calumniate, to denounce. That which was odious in their report was, that they used this instance of disobedience to the king's command on the part of the Jewish officers as an occasion of removing them from their offices, - that their denunciation of them arose from their envying the Jews their position of influence, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/6-5.htm">Daniel 6:5</a> (4)f. Therefore they give prominence to the fact that the king had raised these Jews to places of rule in the province of Babylon.<p>With this form of address in <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/3-9.htm">Daniel 3:9</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-4.htm">Daniel 2:4</a>. &#1496;&#1506;&#1501; &#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1501; signifies in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/3-12.htm">Daniel 3:12</a> rationem reddere, to attend to, to have regard for. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/3-10.htm">Daniel 3:10</a>, as frequently, the expression signifies, on the contrary, to give an opinion, a judgment, i.e., to publish a command. The Keth. &#1500;&#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1498; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/3-12.htm">Daniel 3:12</a>), for which the Keri prefers the sing. form &#1500;&#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1498;, in sound the same as the contracted plur., is to be maintained as correct; for the Keri here, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/3-18.htm">Daniel 3:18</a>, supporting itself on &#1500;&#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/3-14.htm">Daniel 3:14</a>, rests on the idea that by the honouring of his god only the doing of homage to the image is meant, while the not doing homage to the image only gives proof of this, that they altogether refused to honour the gods of Nebuchadnezzar. This is placed in the foreground by the accusers, so as to arouse the indignation of the king. "These Chaldeans," Hitz. remarks quite justly, "knew the three Jews, who were so placed as to be well known, and at the same time envied, before this. They had long known that they did not worship idols; but on this occasion, when their religion made it necessary for the Jews to disobey the king's command, they make use of their knowledge."</body></html>
