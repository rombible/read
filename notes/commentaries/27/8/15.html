Daniel's fainting and astonishment at the prospect of evils he saw coming on his people and the church, confirm the opinion that long-continued calamities were foretold. The vision being ended, a charge was given to Daniel to keep it private for the present. He kept it to himself, and went on to do the duty of his place. As long as we live in this world we must have something to do in it; and even those whom God has most honoured, must not think themselves above their business. Nor must the pleasure of communion with God take us from the duties of our callings, but we must in them abide with God. All who are intrusted with public business must discharge their trust uprightly; and, amidst all doubts and discouragements, they may, if true believers, look forward to a happy issue. Thus should we endeavour to compose our minds for attending to the duties to which each is appointed, in the church and in the world.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/daniel/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And it came to pass ... - Daniel saw the vision, but was unable to explain it.<p>And sought for the meaning - Evidently by meditating on it, or endeavoring in his own mind to make it out.<p>There stood before me as the appearance of a man - One having the appearance of a man.

For holy men are in Scripture represented as having attendant angels, with whom they are in a way identified in interests. If the conversation had been limited to the angels, it could have been of no use to us. But God conveys it to prophetical men, for our good, through the ministry of angels.<p>two thousand &#8230; three hundred days&#8212;literally, "mornings and evenings," specified in connection with the morning and evening sacrifice. Compare Ge 1:5. Six years and a hundred ten days. This includes not only the three and a half years during which the daily sacrifice was forbidden by Antiochus [Josephus, Wars of the Jews, 1:1.1], but the whole series of events whereby it was practically interrupted: beginning with the "little horn waxing great toward the pleasant land," and "casting down some of the host" (Da 8:9, 10); namely, when in 171 B.C., or the month Sivan in the year 142 of the era of the Seleucid&aelig;, the sacrifices began to be neglected, owing to the high priest Jason introducing at Jerusalem Grecian customs and amusements, the pal&aelig;stra and gymnasium; ending with the death of Antiochus, 165 B.C., or the month Shebath, in the year 148 of the Seleucid era. Compare 1 Maccabees 1:11-15; 2 Maccabees 4:9, &c. The reason for the greater minuteness of historical facts and dates, given in Daniel's prophecies, than in those of the New Testament, is that Israel, not having yet the clear views which Christians have of immortality and the heavenly inheritance, could only be directed to the earthly future: for it was on earth the looked-for Messiah was to appear, and the sum and subject of Old Testament prophecy was the kingdom of God upon earth. The minuteness of the revelation of Israel's earthly destiny was to compensate for the absence, in the Old Testament, of views of heavenly glory. Thus, in Da 9:24-27, the times of Messiah are foretold to the very year; in Da 8:14 the times of Antiochus, even to the day; and in Da 11:5-20 the Syro-Egyptian struggles in most minute detail. Tregelles thinks the twenty-three hundred "days" answer to the week of years (Da 9:27), during which the destroying prince (Da 9:26) makes a covenant, which he breaks in the midst of the week (namely, at the end of three and a half years). The seven years exceed the twenty-three hundred days by considerably more than a half year. This period of the seven years' excess above the twenty-three hundred days may be allotted to the preparations needed for setting up the temple-worship, with Antichrist's permission to the restored Jews, according to his "covenant" with them; and the twenty-three hundred days may date from the actual setting up of the worship. But, says Auberlen, the more accurate to a day the dates as to Antiochus are given, the less should we say the 1290, or 1335 days (Da 12:11, 12) correspond to the half week (roughly), and the twenty-three hundred to the whole. The event, however, may, in the case of Antichrist, show a correspondence between the days here given and Da 9:27, such as is not yet discernible. The term of twenty-three hundred days cannot refer twenty-three hundred years of the treading down of Christianity by Mohammedanism, as this would leave the greater portion of the time yet future. If the twenty-three hundred days mean years, dating from Alexander's conquests, 334 B.C. to 323, we should arrive at about the close of the sixth thousand years of the world, just as the 1260 years (Da 7:25) from Justinian's decree arrive at the same terminus. The Jews' tradition represents the seventh thousand as the millennium. Cumming remarks, 480 B.C. is the date of the waning of the Persian empire before Greece; deducting 480 from 2300, we have 1820; and in 1821, Turkey, the successor of the Greek empire, began to wane, and Greece became a separate kingdom. See on [1095]Da 12:11.<p>cleansed&#8212;literally, "justified," vindicated from profanation. Judas Maccabeus celebrated the feast of dedication after the cleansing, on the twenty-fifth of the ninth month, Kisleu (1 Maccabees 4:51-58; 2 Maccabees 10:1-7; Joh 10:22). As to the antitypical dedication of the new temple, see Eze 43:1-27, &c.; also Am 9:11, 12.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/daniel/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Having obtained the favour of knowing something, he longed for a more clear discovery of those things; and he had his desire granted. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">As the appearance of a man; </span> either the angel Gabriel or Michael, who appeared often in the shape of men, and are the messengers of God in the great things concerning his church, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-14.htm" title="Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation?">Hebrews 1:14</a></span>; others will have this angel to be Christ. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/daniel/8.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And it came to pass, when I, even I Daniel, had seen the vision,....

Daniel desires to understand the meaning of this vision. From this we see that, at the time when this book was written, it was understood that prophets might be ignorant of the meaning of the revelations made to them. This is at variance with the assumption of even believing critics, that if a prophecy were given to a prophet, he must have understood the reference of the message. On the accuracy of this assumption, they found the rejection of any interpretation of a prophecy which sees more in it than the prophet could have seen. This latest critical date of Daniel is separated by approximately two centuries and a half from prophecy in actual existence in Malachi. The tradition of the conditions of the phenomenon would still be vital. The phrase before us probably means that Daniel applied the various Babylonian formulae to the dream, to find the interpretation , but, suspicious of them, he still continued his search. In answer to Daniel's search, there stood before him one having "the appearance of a man (<span class="accented">gaber</span>)" - an angelic being in human form. The H,.brew word translated "man" is <span class="accented">gaber</span>, which suggests the name given to the angel, "Gabriel." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/daniel/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Of the different parts of clothing named, &#1505;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1503; are not hose, short stockings, from which Hitz. concludes that the enumeration proceeds from the inner to the outer clothing.

Regarding &#x3a3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1; Theodoret remarks: &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9; &#x3a0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;.

This confounding of the two words was authorized by the Greek scholiasts, to which the admission of the Persian shalwa&#770;r into the Arabic saravilu may have contributed. In Suidas we find the right interpretation along with the false one when he says: &#x3a3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3a0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9; &#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;. Hesychius, on the other hand, briefly explains &#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1; by &#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;, &#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;, &#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;. Hence the word in the forms sarabara, siravara, saravara or saraballa, sarabela, is commonly used in the middle ages for hose, and has been transferred into various modern languages; cf. Gesen.

We have here, then, the threefold clothing which, according to Herodotus, i. 195, the Babylonians wore, namely, the &#1505;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1503;, the &#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, the &#1508;&#1468;&#1496;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488; worn above it, &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;, and the &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488; thrown above that, &#x3c7;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;; while under the word &#1500;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1503; the other articles of clothing, coverings for the feet and the head, are to be understood.<p>(Note: With the setting aside of the false interpretation we have disposed of the objection against the historical character of the narrative which v. Leng. and Hitz. have founded on the statement of Herodotus l.c., that the Babylonians wore no hose, but that they were first worn by the Persians, who adopted them from the Medes.)<p>The separate articles of clothing, consisting of easily inflammable material, are doubtlessly mentioned with reference to the miracle that followed, that even these remained unchanged (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/3-27.htm">Daniel 3:27</a>) in the fiery furnace. In the easily inflammable nature of these materials, namely, of the fine &#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, we have perhaps to seek the reason on account of which the accused were bound in their clothes, and not, as Theodoret and most others think, in the haste with which the sentence against them was carried out. </body></html>
