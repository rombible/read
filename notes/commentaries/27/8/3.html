The <span class="ital">first </span>of the four empires, that is, the Babylonian, is wholly omitted here; for its fate was sufficiently known, and it was now drawing very near to a conclusion. The second empire in the former vision is the first in this; and what is there compared to a <span class="ital">bear, </span>is here prefigured by a <span class="ital">ram. </span>This <span class="ital">ram had two horns; </span>and, according to the explication of the angel Gabriel, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-20.htm" title="The ram which you saw having two horns are the kings of Media and Persia.">Daniel 8:20</a>, it was the empire of the Medes and Persians. The source of this figure of <span class="ital">horns </span>for <span class="ital">kingdoms, </span>must be derived from the hieroglyphics of Egypt, from which most of the metaphors and figures in the oriental languages were originally derived; and in these languages the same word signifies a <span class="ital">horn, </span>a <span class="ital">crown, power, </span>and <span class="ital">splendour, </span>whence a <span class="ital">horn </span>was an ensign of royalty among the Phenicians; and the Hebrew word <span class="greekheb">קרן</span>, <span class="ital">keren, </span>signifying a <span class="ital">horn, </span>is several times by the Chaldeans rendered <span class="greekheb">מלכותא</span>, <span class="ital">malchutha, </span>or a <span class="ital">kingdom; </span>and horns are frequently used for <span class="ital">kings </span>and <span class="ital">kingdoms </span>in the Old Testament. This empire, therefore, which was formed by the conjunction of the Medes and Persians, was not unfitly represented by a <span class="ital">ram with two horns. </span>Cyrus, the founder of this empire, was the son of Cambyses, king of Persia, and, by his mother Mandane, was grandson of Astyages, king of Media; and afterward marrying the daughter and only child of his uncle Cyaxares, king of Media, he succeeded to both crowns, and united the kingdoms of Media and Persia. It was a coalition of two very formidable powers, and therefore it is said that <span class="ital">the two horns were high; but one, </span>it is added, <span class="ital">was higher than the other, and the higher came up last. </span>The kingdom of Media was the more ancient of the two, and more famous in history. Persia was of little note or account till the time of Cyrus; but under him the Persians gained and maintained the ascendant. But a question remains, why that empire, which was before likened to a <span class="ital">bear </span>for its cruelty, should now be represented by a <span class="ital">ram? </span>Now the Hebrew word for a <span class="ital">ram, </span>which is <span class="greekheb">איל</span>, <span class="ital">ail, </span>and <span class="greekheb">עילם</span>, <span class="ital">eelam, </span>which is the Hebrew word for <span class="ital">Persia, </span>both sprang from the same root; and both implying something of strength, the one is not improperly made the type of the other. The propriety of it appears further from hence, that it was usual for the king of Persia to wear <span class="ital">a ram’s head </span>made of gold, and set with precious stones, instead of a diadem. We may add, that <span class="ital">a ram’s head with horns, </span>one <span class="ital">higher </span>and the other <span class="ital">lower, </span>was the royal ensign of the Persians, and is still to be seen on the pillars of Persepolis: see Bishop Newton.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/daniel/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:1-14 God gives Daniel a foresight of the destruction of other kingdoms, which in their day were as powerful as that of Babylon. Could we foresee the changes that shall be when we are gone, we should be less affected with changes in our own day. The ram with two horns was the second empire, that of Media and Persia. He saw this ram overcome by a he-goat. This was Alexander the Great. Alexander, when about thirty-three years of age, and in his full strength, died, and showed the vanity of worldly pomp and power, and that they cannot make a man happy. While men dispute, as in the case of Alexander, respecting the death of some prosperous warrior, it is plain that the great First Cause of all had no more of his plan for him to execute, and therefore cut him off. Instead of that one great horn, there came up four notable ones, Alexander's four chief captains. A little horn became a great persecutor of the church and people of God. It seems that the Mohammedan delusion is here pointed out. It prospered, and at one time nearly destroyed the holy religion God's right hand had planted. It is just with God to deprive those of the privileges of his house who despise and profane them; and to make those know the worth of ordinances by the want of them, who would not know it by the enjoyment of them. Daniel heard the time of this calamity limited and determined; but not the time when it should come. If we would know the mind of God, we must apply to Christ, in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge; not hid from us, but hid for us. There is much difficulty as to the precise time here stated, but the end of it cannot be very distant. God will, for his own glory, see to the cleansing of the church in due time. Christ died to cleanse his church; and he will so cleanse it as to present it blameless to himself.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/daniel/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Then I lifted up mine eyes and saw - And saw in vision, or there seemed to be before me.<p>There stood before the river - On the bank of the river.<p>A ram which had two horns - There can be no error in explaining the design of this symbol, for in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-20.htm">Daniel 8:20</a> it is expressly said that it denoted the two kings of Media and Persia.

"Horn" in the East is the symbol of power and royalty.<p>one &#8230; higher than &#8230; other &#8230; the higher came up last&#8212;Persia, which was of little note till Cyrus' time, became then ascendant over Media, the more ancient kingdom. Darius was sixty-two years old (Da 5:31) when he began to reign; during his short reign of two years, being a weak king (Da 6:1-3), the government was almost entirely in Cyrus' hands. Hence Herodotus does not mention Darius; but Xenophon does under the name of Cyaxares II. The "ram" here corresponds to the "bear" (Da 7:5), symbolizing clumsy firmness. The king of Persia wore a jewelled ram's head of gold instead of a diadem, such as are seen on the pillars at Persepolis. Also the Hebrew for "ram" springs from the same root as "Elam," or Persia [Newton]. The "one horn higher than the other" answers to the bear "raising itself on one side" (compare Note, see on [1094]Da 7:5).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/daniel/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Which had two horns; </span> by which is meant the kingdom of the Medes and Persians, as it is in <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-20.htm" title="The ram which you saw having two horns are the kings of Media and Persia.">Daniel 8:20</a></span>, where it is so interpreted.

On the distinction between the two empires, see the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-39.htm" title="And after you shall arise another kingdom inferior to you, and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth.">Daniel 2:39</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/5-31.htm" title="And Darius the Median took the kingdom, being about three score and two years old.">Daniel 5:31</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a ram which had two horns; and the two horns were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last.</span> The rendering of the LXX. does not differ essentially from the Massoretic Version, save in the last clause, which is rendered, "and the higher ascended (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;</span>)." As in the former verse, <span class="accented">oobal</span> is translated "gate." Certainly, as before remarked, "<span class="accented">before</span> a river" is an awkward combination; "<span class="accented">before"</span> or "<span class="accented">over against a</span> gate" is intelligible. "Eastward," which <span class="accented">liphnee</span> also means, will not suit the geographical circumstances, as Shushan itself stood on the east bank of the river Eulaeus, or Shapur. If, further, <span class="accented">oobal</span> means a "marsh," as Jerome renders it, then "eastward" would not suit. for the existing marsh is to the south-west of Shushan. Theodotion is in closer agreement with the Massoretic text, but does not translate (<span class="accented">oobal</span>, he merely transliterates it. The Peshitta is in strict agreement with the text of the Massoretes. Jerome, as we just said. in this verse renders <span class="accented">oobal</span> by <span class="accented">paludem.</span> Daniel in his vision seems looking from the walls of the citadel of Shushan, most likely even now the capital of the triumphant young conqueror. The progress of the arms of Cyrus would no doubt be viewed with apprehension by the court of Babylon. Daniel's thoughts would be naturally filled with the new factor in the polities of the Euphrates valley. Hence it was not unnatural that the thoughts of the (lay should colour the visions of the night. The choice of the animal - the ram - to represent the Medo-Persian monarchy is by some supposed to be illustrated by the figures of goats and rams on Persian cylinders. If it has any special meaning, it probably is that the monarchy had sprung up among a pastoral people. It is maintained by Professor Bevan, that this figure of a ram with two horns proves that there were two successive empires  - a Median and a Persian. If Mr. Bevan would use his ingenuity, and show us any way by which the actual facts of the history and constitution of the Medo-Persian Empire could be represented in a symbol that would not be liable to his misinterpretation, it would be an advantage. The empire, we know, was built up by two races - the race which last came into prominence became the predominant. Here in the symbol before us the unity of the empire is exhibited by the animal being one, and the two races are indicated by the two horns. The duality of the symbol ought to be noted. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/daniel/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Chaldeans immediately denounced Daniel's three friends as transgressors of the king's command. &#1491;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492; &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1511;&#1489;&#1500;, therefore, viz., because the friends of Daniel who were placed over the province of Babylon had not, by falling down before the golden image, done it homage. That they did not do so is not expressly said, but is expressed in what follows. &#1499;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1491;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;&#1503; &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1503; are not Chaldeans as astrologers of magi (&#1499;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;), but members of the Chaldean nation, in contrast to &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497;&#1488;, the Jews. &#1511;&#1512;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;, they came near to the king. &#1491;&#1468;&#1497; &#1511;&#1512;&#1510;&#1497; &#1488;&#1499;&#1500;, literally, to eat the flesh of any one, is in Aramaic the common expression for to calumniate, to denounce. That which was odious in their report was, that they used this instance of disobedience to the king's command on the part of the Jewish officers as an occasion of removing them from their offices, - that their denunciation of them arose from their envying the Jews their position of influence, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/6-5.htm">Daniel 6:5</a> (4)f. Therefore they give prominence to the fact that the king had raised these Jews to places of rule in the province of Babylon.<p>With this form of address in <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/3-9.htm">Daniel 3:9</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-4.htm">Daniel 2:4</a>. &#1496;&#1506;&#1501; &#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1501; signifies in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/3-12.htm">Daniel 3:12</a> rationem reddere, to attend to, to have regard for.

This is placed in the foreground by the accusers, so as to arouse the indignation of the king. "These Chaldeans," Hitz. remarks quite justly, "knew the three Jews, who were so placed as to be well known, and at the same time envied, before this. They had long known that they did not worship idols; but on this occasion, when their religion made it necessary for the Jews to disobey the king's command, they make use of their knowledge."</body></html>
