For all that a man can enjoy himself of the anxious labours wherein he spends his days, amounts to little or nothing; and what comfort hath he in thinking who shall enjoy the fruit of them hereafter?” <span class="ital">For all his days are sorrows, </span>&c. — “And yet, such is our folly, there is no end of our cares; for we see many a man, whose life is nothing but a mere drudgery; who never is at leisure to enjoy any thing that he hath, but still engaged in one troublesome employment or other to get more; which he follows so eagerly, as if it were his business to disquiet and vex himself, and make his life uneasy to him! being not content with his daily toils, unless he rack his mind also with cares in the night! This is so void of all reason that nothing can be imagined more vain and foolish.” — Bishop Patrick.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:18-26 Our hearts are very loth to quit their expectations of great things from the creature; but Solomon came to this at length. The world is a vale of tears, even to those that have much of it. See what fools they are, who make themselves drudges to the world, which affords a man nothing better than subsistence for the body. And the utmost he can attain in this respect is to allow himself a sober, cheerful use thereof, according to his rank and condition. But we must enjoy good in our labour; we must use those things to make us diligent and cheerful in worldly business. And this is the gift of God. Riches are a blessing or a curse to a man, according as he has, or has not, a heart to make a good use of them. To those that are accepted of the Lord, he gives joy and satisfaction in the knowledge and love of him. But to the sinner he allots labour, sorrow, vanity, and vexation, in seeking a worldly portion, which yet afterwards comes into better hands. Let the sinner seriously consider his latter end. To seek a lasting portion in the love of Christ and the blessings it bestows, is the only way to true and satisfying enjoyment even of this present world.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ecclesiastes/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I went about - i. e., I turned from one course of action to another.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ecclesiastes/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22.

And how dieth the wise man: as the fool!" As in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:11</a>, so here &#1494;&#1499;&#1512;&#1493;&#1503; is the principal form, not different from &#1494;&#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1503;. Having no remembrance forever, is equivalent to having no eternal endurance, having simply no onward existence (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/9-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:6</a>). &#1506;&#1501; is both times the comparat. combin., as at <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-26.htm">Job 9:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/37-18.htm">Job 37:18</a>; cf. &#1497;&#1495;&#1491;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/49-11.htm">Psalm 49:11</a>. There are, indeed, individual historically great men, the memory of whom is perpetuated from generation to generation in words and in monuments; but these are exceptions, which do not always show that posterity is able to distinguish between wise men and fools. As a rule, men have a long appreciating recollection of the wise as little as they have of the fools, for long ago (vid., beshekvar, p. 640) in the coming days (&#1499;&#1468;&#1489; &#1488;&#1489;&#1468;, accus. of the time, like the ellipt.&#1492;&#1489;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/27-6.htm">Isaiah 27:6</a>) all are forgotten; &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500; is, as at <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/14-3.htm">Psalm 14:3</a>, meant personally: the one as the other; and &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1495; is rendered by the Masora, like <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/9-6.htm">Psalm 9:6</a>, &#1499;&#1468;&#1489; &#1488;&#1489;, as the pausal form of the finite; but is perhaps thought of as part., denoting that which only in the coming days will become too soon a completed fact, since those who survive go from the burial of the one, as well as from that of the other, to the ordinary duties of the day. Death thus sinks the wise man, as it does the fool, in eternal oblivion; it comes to both, and brings the same to both, which extorted from the author the cry: How dieth the wise man? as the fool! Why is the fate which awaits both thus the same! This is the pointed, sarcastic &#1488;&#1497;&#1498; (how!) of the satirical Mashal, e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-4.htm">Isaiah 14:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/26-17.htm">Ezekiel 26:17</a>; and &#1497;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; is  equals  moriendum est, as at <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-3.htm">2 Samuel 3:3</a>, moriendum erat. Rambach well: &#1488;&#1497;&#1498; est h. l. particula admirationis super rei indignitate.<p>What happened to the author from this sorrowful discovery he now states. </body></html>
