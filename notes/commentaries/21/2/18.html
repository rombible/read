There seems to be no special reference to Rehoboam, but only the assertion of the general principle that the wisest of men must leave all that his labour has gained to be enjoyed by another who may be destitute of wisdom. The thought is not so much that it is a hardship for the wise man to leave what he has gained, as that it is that he should have no advantage over the fool who enjoys the same without any merit.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:18-26 Our hearts are very loth to quit their expectations of great things from the creature; but Solomon came to this at length. The world is a vale of tears, even to those that have much of it. See what fools they are, who make themselves drudges to the world, which affords a man nothing better than subsistence for the body. And the utmost he can attain in this respect is to allow himself a sober, cheerful use thereof, according to his rank and condition. But we must enjoy good in our labour; we must use those things to make us diligent and cheerful in worldly business. And this is the gift of God. Riches are a blessing or a curse to a man, according as he has, or has not, a heart to make a good use of them. To those that are accepted of the Lord, he gives joy and satisfaction in the knowledge and love of him. But to the sinner he allots labour, sorrow, vanity, and vexation, in seeking a worldly portion, which yet afterwards comes into better hands. Let the sinner seriously consider his latter end. To seek a lasting portion in the love of Christ and the blessings it bestows, is the only way to true and satisfying enjoyment even of this present world.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ecclesiastes/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I hated life - Compare this expression, extorted from Solomon by the perception of the vanity of his wisdom and greatness, with <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/8-22.htm">Romans 8:22-23</a>.

One hope alone was left to the disappointed worldling, the perpetuation of his name and riches, laboriously gathered, through his successor. For selfishness is mostly at the root of worldly parents' alleged providence for their children. But now the remembrance of how he himself, the piously reared child of David, had disregarded his father's dying charge (1Ch 28:9), suggested the sad misgivings as to what Rehoboam, his son by an idolatrous Ammonitess, Naamah, should prove to be; a foreboding too fully realized (1Ki 12:1-18; 14:21-31).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ecclesiastes/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">I hated all my labour which I had taken under the sun; </span> all these riches and buildings, and other fruits of my labour, were the matter of my repentance, and aggravations of my misery, because I must, and that everlastingly, part with them, and leave them all behind me. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/ecclesiastes/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Yea, I hated all my labour which I had taken under the sun,....

All which he had no great regard unto, since it was to be left to another; <p>because I should leave it unto the man that shall be after me; because he could not enjoy the fruits of his labour himself, at least but a very short time: but must be obliged to leave all to another, his possessions, estates, riches, and treasure; which a man cannot carry with him when he dies, but must leave all behind him, to his heirs and successors (x).

Mazarin walks through the galleries of his palace and says to himself, “<span class="ital">Il faut quitter tout cela</span>.” Frederick William IV. of Prussia turns to his friend Bunsen as they stand on the terrace at Potsdam, and says, as they look out on the garden, “<span class="ital">Das auch, das soll ich lassen</span>,” (“This too I must leave behind me”.) The thought recurs again and again (chs. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-8.htm" title="There is one alone, and there is not a second; yes, he has neither child nor brother: yet is there no end of all his labor; neither is his eye satisfied with riches; neither said he, For whom do I labor, and bereave my soul of good?

It is impossible that Solomon could thus have spoken of Rehoboam; and to suppose that he wrote thus after Jeroboam's attempt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-26.htm">1 Kings 2:26</a>, etc.), and in contemplation of a possible usurper, is not warranted by any historical statement, the absolute security of the succession being all along expected, and the growing discontent being perfectly unknown to, or contemptuously disregarded by, the king.

Mendelssohn's translation, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:12</a>: "I abandoned my design of seeking to connect wisdom with folly and madness," is impossible, because for such a rendering we should have had at least &#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; instead of &#1500;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514;. Hitzig, otherwise followed by Stuart: "I turned myself to examine me wisdom, and, lo, it was madness as well as folly." This rendering is impossible also, for in such a case &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493; ought to have stood as the result, after &#1495;&#1499;&#1502;&#1492;. The pasage, <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-6.htm">Zechariah 14:6</a>, cited by Hitz., does not prove the possibility of such a brachyology, for there we read not veqaroth veqeppayon, but eqaroth iqeppau&#772;n (the splendid ones, i.e., the stars, will draw themselves together, i.e., will become dark bodies). The two vavs are not correlative, which is without example in the usage of this book, but copulative: he wishes to contemplate (Zckler and others) wisdom on the one side, and madness and folly on the other, in their relation to each other, viz., in their relative worth. Hitzig's ingenuity goes yet further astray in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:12</a>: "For what will the man do who comes after the king? (He shall do) what was long ago his (own) doing, i.e., inheriting from the king the throne, he will not also inherit his wisdom." Instead of a&#772;su&#772;hu&#772;, he reads a&#780;so&#772;hu&#772;, after <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/18-18.htm">Exodus 18:18</a>; but the more modern author, whose work we have here before us, would, instead of this anomalous form, use the regular form &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1514;&#1493;; but, besides, the expression e&#772;th asher-kevar 'asotho, "(he will do) what long ago was his doing," is not Heb.; the words ought to have been keasotho kevar khen i'sah, or at least 'asa&#772;hu&#772;. If we compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:12</a> with 18b, the man who comes after the king appears certainly to be his successor.<p>(Note: The lxx and Symm. by hamme&#780;le&#770;k think of melak, counsel, &#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769;, instead of melek, king; and as Jerome, so also Bardach understands by the king the rex factor, i.e., God the Creator.)<p>But by this supposition it is impossible to give just effect to the relation (assigning a reason or motive) of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:12</a> to 12a expressed by &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;. When I considered, Knobel regards Koheleth as saying, that a fool would be heir to me a wise man, it appeared strange to me, and I was led to compare wisdom and folly to see whether or not the wise man has a superiority to the fool, or whether his labour and his fate are vanity, like those of the fool. This is in point of style absurd, but it is much more absurd logically. And who then gave the interpreter the right to stamp as a fool the man who comes after the king? In the answer: "That which has long ago been done," must lie its justification; for this that was done long ago naturally consists, as Zckler remarks, in foolish and perverse undertakings, certainly in the destruction of that which was done by the wise predecessor, in the lavish squandering of the treasures and goods collected by him. More briefly, but in the same sense, Burger: Nihil quod a solita hominum agendi ratione recedit. But in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-19.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:19</a>, Koheleth places it as a question whether his successor will be a wise man or a fool, while here he would presuppose that "naturally," or as a matter of course, he will be a fool. In the matter of style, we have nothing to object to the translation on which Zckler, with Rabm., Rosenm., Knobel, Hengst., and others, proceeds; the supplying of the verb &#1497;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; to meh ha&#772;a&#772;da&#772;m  equals  what can the man do? is possible (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/2-15.htm">Malachi 2:15</a>), and the neut. interpret. of the suffix of &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; is, after <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-3.htm">Amos 1:3</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/31-11.htm">Job 31:11</a>, admissible; but the reference to a successor is not connected with the course of the thoughts, even although one attaches to the plain words a meaning which is foreign to them. The words &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;...&#1488;&#1514; are accordingly not the answer to the question proposed, but a component part of the question itself. Thus Ewald, and with him Elster, Heiligst., construes: "How will the man be who will follow the king, compared with him whom they made (a king) long ago, i.e., with his predecessor?" But &#1488;&#1514;, in this pregnant sense, "compared with," is without example, at least in the Book of Koheleth, which generally does not use it as a prep.; and, besides, this rendering, by introducing the successor on the throne, offends against the logic of the relation of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:12</a> to <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:12</a>.<p>The motive of Koheleth's purpose, to weigh wisdom and folly against each other as to their worth, consists in this, that a king, especially such an one as Solomon was, has in the means at his disposal and in the extent of his observation so much more than everyother, that no one who comes after him will reach a different experience. This motive would be satisfactorily expressed on the supposition that the answer begins with &#1488;&#1514;, if one should read &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; for &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;: he will be able to do (accomplish) nothing but what he (the king) has long ago done, i.e., he will only repeat, only be able to confirm, the king's report. But if we take the text as it here stands, the meaning is the same; and, besides, we get rid of the harsh ellipsis me&#780;h ha&#772;a&#772;da&#772;m for me&#780;h ya&#780;a&#780;se&#780;h ha&#772;a&#772;da&#772;m. We translate: for what is the man who might come after the king, him whom they have made so long ago! The king whom they made so long ago is Solomon, who has a richer experience, a more comprehensive knowledge, the longer the time (viz., from the present time backwards) since he occupied the throne. Regarding the expression eth asher  equals  quem, instead of the asher simply, vid., Khler under <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-10.htm">Zechariah 12:10</a>. &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;, with the most general subj., is not different from &#1504;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492;, which, particularly in the Book of Daniel (e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-28.htm">Daniel 4:28</a>.), has frequently an active construction, with the subject unnamed, instead of the passive (Gesen. 137, margin). The author of the Book of Koheleth, alienated from the theocratic side of the kingdom of Israel, makes use of it perhaps not unintentionally; besides, Solomon's elevation to the throne was, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1.htm">1 Kings 1</a>, brought about very much by human agency; and one may, if he will, think of the people in the word 'asuhu also, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-39.htm">1 Kings 1:39</a>, who at last decided the matter. Meh before the letters hheth and ayin commonly occurs: according to the Masora, twenty-four times; before other initial letters than these, eight times, and three of these in the Book of Koheleth before the letter he, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:12</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-22.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:10</a>. The words are more an exclamation than a question; the exclamation means: What kind of a man is that who could come after the king! cf. "What wickedness is this!" etc., <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-12.htm">Judges 20:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/22-16.htm">Joshua 22:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/18-14.htm">Exodus 18:14</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-13.htm">1 Kings 9:13</a>, i.e., as standing behind with reference to me-the same figure of extenuatio, as mah adam, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/144-3.htm">Psalm 144:3</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:5</a>.<p>There now follows an account of what, on the one side, happened to him thus placed on a lofty watch-tower, such as no other occupied. </body></html>
