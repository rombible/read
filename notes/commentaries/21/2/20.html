The world is a vale of tears, even to those that have much of it. See what fools they are, who make themselves drudges to the world, which affords a man nothing better than subsistence for the body. And the utmost he can attain in this respect is to allow himself a sober, cheerful use thereof, according to his rank and condition. But we must enjoy good in our labour; we must use those things to make us diligent and cheerful in worldly business. And this is the gift of God. Riches are a blessing or a curse to a man, according as he has, or has not, a heart to make a good use of them. To those that are accepted of the Lord, he gives joy and satisfaction in the knowledge and love of him. But to the sinner he allots labour, sorrow, vanity, and vexation, in seeking a worldly portion, which yet afterwards comes into better hands. Let the sinner seriously consider his latter end. To seek a lasting portion in the love of Christ and the blessings it bestows, is the only way to true and satisfying enjoyment even of this present world.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ecclesiastes/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I went about - i. e., I turned from one course of action to another.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ecclesiastes/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20.

He "turned about" (y), as the word signifies dropped his severe studies of wisdom, and his eager pursuits of pleasure; and desisted from those toilsome works, in which he had employed himself; and went from one thing to another, and settled and stuck at nothing, on purpose to relax his mind, as the Syriac version renders it; to divest it of all anxious thought and care, and call it off from its vain and fruitless undertakings; and be no more concerned about or thoughtful <p>of all the labour which I took under the sun; and what will be the consequence and issue of it; but quietly leave all to an all wise disposing Providence; and not seek for happiness in anything under the sun, but in those things that are above it; not in this world, but in the world to come. <p>(y) "versus sum", Montanus; "et ego verti me", Vatablus, Mercerus, Gejerus. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/ecclesiastes/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Therefore I went about to cause my heart <span class="cverse3">{n}</span> to despair of all the labour which I took under the sun.</span><p>(n) That I might seek the true happiness which is in God.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/ecclesiastes/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">20</span>. <span class="ital">I went about to cause my heart to despair</span>] The verb for despair is not a common one. Another form of it meets us in the emphatic cry, “There is no hope” of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-25.htm" title="Withhold your foot from being unshod, and your throat from thirst: but you said, There is no hope: no; for I have loved strangers, and after them will I go.">Jeremiah 2:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-12.htm" title="And they said, There is no hope: but we will walk after our own devices, and we will every one do the imagination of his evil heart.">Jeremiah 18:12</a>. What he had felt had made the seeker renounce the very impulse that led to labour. In the phrase “I went about,” literally, “<span class="bld">I turned</span>,” we have, as it were, the attitude of one who looks behind him on the road on which so far he has travelled. The retrospect was so dreary that it made the prospect drearier still.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;</span> (Septuagint).

The wise man has eyes in his head; but the fool walketh in darkness." In the sacred Scriptures, "light" is generally the symbol of grace, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/43-3.htm">Psalm 43:3</a>, but also the contrast of an intellectually and morally darkened state, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-4.htm">Isaiah 51:4</a>. To know a thing is equivalent to having light on it, and seeing it in its true light (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/36-10.htm">Psalm 36:10</a>); wisdom is thus compared to light; folly is once, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/38-19.htm">Job 38:19</a>, directly called "darkness." Thus wisdom stands so much higher than folly, as light stands above darkness.&#1497;&#1514;&#1512;&#1493;&#1503;, which hitherto denoted actual result, enduring gain, signifies here preference; along with &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;&#1512;&#1493;&#1503;<p>(Note: Thus written, according to J and other authorities.)<p>there is also found the form &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;&#1512;&#1493;&#1503; <p>(Note: Thus Ven. 1515, 1521; vid., Comm. under <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-28.htm">Genesis 27:28-29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-10.htm">Psalm 45:10</a>.)<p>(vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-17.htm">Proverbs 30:17</a>). The fool walks in darkness: he is blind although he has eyes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-8.htm">Isaiah 43:8</a>), and thus has as good as none, - he wants the spiritual eye of understanding (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-3.htm">Job 10:3</a>); the wise man, on the other hand, his eyes are in his head, or, as we also say: he has eyes in his head, - eyes truly seeing, looking at and examining persons and things. That is the one side of the relation of wisdom to folly as put to the test.<p>The other side of the relation is the sameness of the result in which the elevation of wisdom above folly terminates.<p>"And I myself perceived that one experience happeneth to them all. And I said in my heart, As it will happen to the fool, it will happen also to me; and why have I then been specially wise? Thus I spake then in my heart, that this also is vain." Zckler gives to &#1490;&#1468;&#1501; an adversative sense; but this gam ( equals  &#x3bf;&#788;&#768;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;, similiter) stands always at the beginning of the clause, Ewald, 354a. Gam-ani corresponds to the Lat. ego idem, which gives two predicates to one subject; while et ipse predicates the same of the one of two subjects as it does of the other (Zumpt, 697). The second gam-ani serves for the giving of prominence to the object, and here precedes, after the manner of a substantival clause (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-12.htm">Isaiah 45:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-17.htm">Ezekiel 33:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-10.htm">2 Chronicles 28:10</a>), as at <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-27.htm">Genesis 24:27</a>; cf. Gesen. 121. 3. Miqre&#780;h (from &#1511;&#1512;&#1492;, to happen, to befall) is quiquid alicui accidit (in the later philosoph. terminol. accidens; Venet. &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;); but here, as the connection shows, that which finally puts an end to life, the final event of death. By the word &#1497;&#1491; the author expresses what he had observed on reflection; by &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;...&#1488;&#1501;, what he said inwardly to himself regarding it; and by &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468; &#1491;&#1500;, what sentence he passed thereon with himself. Lammah asks for the design, as maddu'a for the reason. &#1488;&#1494; is either understood temporally: then when it is finally not better with me than with the fool (Hitz. from the standpoint of the dying hour), or logically: if yet one and the same event happeneth to the wise man and to the fool (Eslt.); in the consciousness of the author both are taken together.The &#1494;&#1492; of the conclusion refers, not, as at <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:17</a>, to the endeavouring after and the possession of wisdom, but to this final result making no difference between wise men and fools. This fate, happening to all alike, is &#1492;&#1489;&#1500;, a vanity rendering all vain, a nullity levelling down all to nothing, something full of contradictions, irrational. Paul also (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-20.htm">Romans 8:20</a>) speaks of this destruction, which at last comes upon all, as a &#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;.<p>The author now assigns the reason for this discouraging result. </body></html>
