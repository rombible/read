The most learned of men, who dies a stranger to Christ Jesus, will perish equally with the most ignorant; and what good can commendations on earth do to the body in the grave, or the soul in hell? And the spirits of just men made perfect cannot want them.

The verb from which it is derived seems in this book to refer especially to death. The word does not mean chance (compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/9-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:1-2</a>), independent of the ordering of Divine Providence: the Gentile notion of "mere chance," or "blind fate," is never once contemplated by the writer of this book, and it would be inconsistent with his tenets of the unlimited power and activity of God.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ecclesiastes/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15. why was I&#8212;so anxious to become, &c.

The wisest of kings, and the wisest of men; that is, he looked over things in his mind, and considered what had befallen him, or what were his present circumstances, or what would be his case, especially at death; and said within himself, the same things happen to me, who have attained to the highest pitch of wisdom, as to the most errant fool; and therefore no true happiness can be in this sort of wisdom. The Targum paraphrases it thus, <p>"as it happened to Saul the son of Kish, the king who turned aside perversely, and kept not the commandment he received concerning Amalek, and his kingdom was taken from him; so shall it happen to me;'' <p>and why was I then more wise? the Targum adds, than he, or than any other man, or even than a fool; why have I took so much pains to get wisdom? what am I the better for it? what happiness is there in it, seeing it gives me no advantage, preference, and excellency to a fool; or secures me from the events that befall me? <p>Then I said in my heart, that this also is vanity; this worldly wisdom has nothing solid and substantial in it, as well as pleasure; and it is a vain thing to seek happiness in it, since this is the case, that the events are the same to men that have it, as to one that has it not. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/ecclesiastes/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so it happeneth even to me; and why was I then more wise?

The last word is almost identical with the “profit” which occurs so frequently. He found that he had a surplus of wisdom, and that it was but surplusage. We seem to hear an echo of the <span class="greekheb">Μηδὲ νἀγὰν</span>, the <span class="ital">Ne quid nimis</span> (“Nothing in excess”) of Greek and Roman sages. So, with the same Hebrew word, we have in chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-16.htm" title="Be not righteous over much; neither make yourself over wise: why should you destroy yourself ?">Ecclesiastes 7:16</a>, “Be not righteous over much.” So it was that the sentence of ‘Vanity’ was once more written on wisdom as well as folly. It is not without significance that the man feels the bitterness of the sentence, because, even in his wisdom, he, like the Stoics, had been egoistic. That he and the fool, the man of large discourse, and the man to whom culture was an unknown word, should die the same death, this made him curse his destiny.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then</span> (<span class="accented">and</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>said I in my heart</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-16.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:16</a>), <span class="cmt_word">As it happeneth to the fool, so it happeneth even to me.</span> He applies the general statement of ver. 14 to his own case. The end that overtakes the fool will ere long overtake him; and he proceeds, <span class="cmt_word">Why was I then more wise?</span> "Then" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d6;</span>), may be understood either logically, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. in this case, since such is the fate of wise and foolish; or temporally, at the hour of death regarded as past. He puts the question - To what end, with what design, has he been so excessively wise, or, as it may be, wise overmuch (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-16.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:16</a>)? His wisdom has, as it were, recoiled upon himself - it taught him much, but not content; it made him keen-sighted in seeing the emptiness of human things, but it satisfied not his cravings. <span class="cmt_word">Then I said in my heart, that this also is vanity.</span> This similarity of fate for philosopher and fool makes life vain and worthless; or rather, the meaning may be, if the superiority of wisdom over folly conduces to no other end than this, that superiority is a vanity. The LXX. has glossed the passage, followed herein by the Syriac, "Moreover, I spake in my heart that indeed this is also vanity, because the fool speaks out of his abundance" - ver. 16 giving the substance of the fool's thoughts. Vulgate, <span class="accented">Locutusque cum mente mea</span>, <span class="accented">animadverti quod hoc quoque esset vanitas</span>.

And all that mine eyes desired I kept not from them, I refused not any kind of joy to my heart; for my heart had joy of all my labour: and this was my portion of all my labour. And I turned myself to all the works which my hands had done, and to the labour which I had laboured to accomplish: and, behold, all was vain, and windy effort, and there was no true profit under the sun." In vehosaphti there is here no obj. as at <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-16.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:16</a>; the obj. is the gedullah, the greatness, to be concluded and thought of from vegadalti, "and I became great."

He became great, and always greater, viz., in the possession of all the good things, the possession of which seemed to make a man happy on this earth. And what he resolved upon, in the midst of this dulcis insania, viz., to deport himself as a wise man, he succeeded in doing: his wisdom forsook him not, viz., the means adapted to the end, and ruling over this colossal apparatus of sensual lust; &#1488;&#1507;, as e.g., at <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/16-6.htm">Psalm 16:6</a>, belongs to the whole clause; and &#1506;&#1502;&#1491;, with &#1500;, does not mean here to stand by, sustain (Herzfeld, Ewald, Elster), which it might mean as well as &#1506;&#1500; &#1506;&#1502;&#1491;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/12-1.htm">Daniel 12:1</a>, but to continue, as Jerome, and after him, Luther, translates: sapientia quoquo perseveravit mecum; the Targ. connects the ideas of continuance (lxx, Syr., Venet.) and of help; but the idea intended is that of continuance, for &#1504;&#1492;&#1490;, e.g., does not refer to helping, but self-maintaining.</body></html>
