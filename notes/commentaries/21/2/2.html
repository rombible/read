What does noisy, flashy mirth towards making a man happy? The manifold devices of men's hearts, to get satisfaction from the world, and their changing from one thing to another, are like the restlessness of a man in a fever. Perceiving it was folly to give himself to wine, he next tried the costly amusements of princes. The poor, when they read such a description, are ready to feel discontent. But the remedy against all such feelings is in the estimate of it all by the owner himself. All was vanity and vexation of spirit: and the same things would yield the same result to us, as to Solomon. Having food and raiment, let us therewith be content. His wisdom remained with him; a strong understanding, with great human knowledge. But every earthly pleasure, when unconnected with better blessings, leaves the mind as eager and unsatisfied as before. Happiness arises not from the situation in which we are placed. It is only through Jesus Christ that final blessedness can be attained.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ecclesiastes/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Solomon's trial of God's second gift, namely, riches, and the enjoyment which riches supply; this brought him to the sane result (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:12</a>).<p>Comparing Solomon's action with <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/12-16.htm">Luke 12:16-21</a>, it must be remembered that Solomon's object was the acquisition of wisdom, not self-indulgence, and that he did not fail to look forward to the certainty of death overtaking him. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ecclesiastes/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. laughter&#8212;including prosperity, and joy in general (Job 8:21).<p>mad&#8212;that is, when made the chief good; it is harmless in its proper place.<p>What doeth it?&#8212;Of what avail is it in giving solid good?

The risible faculty in man is given him for some usefulness; and when used in a moderate way, and kept within due bounds, is of service to him, and conduces to the health of his body, and the pleasure of his mind; but when used on every trivial occasion, and at every foolish thing that is said or done, and indulged to excess, it is mere madness, and makes a man look more like a madman and a fool than a wise man; it lasts but for a while, and the end of it is heaviness, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:6</a>. Or, "I said to laughter, thou art mad" (x); and therefore will have nothing to do with thee in the excessive and criminal way, but shun thee, as one would do a mad man: this therefore is not to be reckoned into the pleasure he bid his soul go to and enjoy; <p>and of mirth, what doth it? what good does do? of what profit and advantage is it to man? If the question is concerning innocent mirth, the answer may be given out of <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-13.htm">Proverbs 15:13</a>; but if of carnal sinful mirth, there is no good arises from that to the body or mind; or any kind of happiness to be enjoyed that way, and therefore no trial is to be made of it. What the wise man proposed to make trial of, and did, follows in the next verses. <p>(x)   "risui dixi, insanis", Mercerus, Drusius, Amama; "vel insanus es", Piscator, Schmidt, Rambachius. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/ecclesiastes/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">I said of laughter, It is mad: and of mirth, What doeth it?</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/ecclesiastes/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">2</span>. <span class="ital">I said of laughter, It is mad</span>] The choice of a word cognate with the madness of chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-17.htm" title="And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly: I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit.">Ecclesiastes 1:17</a>, gives a special emphasis to the judgment which the man thus passes on himself.

He uses the term "mad" in reference to the statement in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:17</a>, "I gave my heart to know madness and folly."

Neither of these is as accurate as the Authorized Version. <span class="cmt_word">Of mirth, What doeth it?</span> What does it effect towards real happiness and contentment?

So we have in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-13.htm">Proverbs 14:13</a>, "Even in laughter the heart is sorrowful; and the end of mirth is heaviness;" though the context is different.

The result of his seeing, and that, as he has said <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:13</a>, of a by no means superficial and limited seeing, was a discovery of the fleeting, unsubstantial, fruitless nature of all human actions and endeavours.
