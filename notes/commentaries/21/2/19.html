The world is a vale of tears, even to those that have much of it. See what fools they are, who make themselves drudges to the world, which affords a man nothing better than subsistence for the body. And the utmost he can attain in this respect is to allow himself a sober, cheerful use thereof, according to his rank and condition. But we must enjoy good in our labour; we must use those things to make us diligent and cheerful in worldly business. And this is the gift of God. Riches are a blessing or a curse to a man, according as he has, or has not, a heart to make a good use of them. To those that are accepted of the Lord, he gives joy and satisfaction in the knowledge and love of him. But to the sinner he allots labour, sorrow, vanity, and vexation, in seeking a worldly portion, which yet afterwards comes into better hands. Let the sinner seriously consider his latter end. To seek a lasting portion in the love of Christ and the blessings it bestows, is the only way to true and satisfying enjoyment even of this present world.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ecclesiastes/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Labour - Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:4-8</a>.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ecclesiastes/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18, 19. One hope alone was left to the disappointed worldling, the perpetuation of his name and riches, laboriously gathered, through his successor. For selfishness is mostly at the root of worldly parents' alleged providence for their children. But now the remembrance of how he himself, the piously reared child of David, had disregarded his father's dying charge (1Ch 28:9), suggested the sad misgivings as to what Rehoboam, his son by an idolatrous Ammonitess, Naamah, should prove to be; a foreboding too fully realized (1Ki 12:1-18; 14:21-31).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ecclesiastes/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">A fool; </span> who will undo all that I have done, and turn the effects of my wisdom into instruments of his folly, and occasions of ruin.

The king that should be after him, as the Targum, that should be his successor and heir; and so whether he would make a good or bad use of what was left; whether he would keep and improve it, or squander it away; suggesting, that could he be sure he would be a wise man that should come into his labours, it would be some satisfaction to him that he had laboured, and such a man should have the benefit of it; but as it was a precarious thing what he would be, he could take no pleasure in reviewing his labours he was about to leave. Some think that Solomon here gives a hint of the suspicion he had, that his son Rehoboam, his successor and heir, would turn out a foolish man, as he did; <p>yet shall he have rule over all my labour wherein I have laboured, and wherein I have showed myself wise, under the sun; be he what he will, all will come into his hands; and he will have the power of disposing of all at his pleasure; not only of enjoying it, but of changing and altering things; and perhaps greatly for the worse, if he does not entirely destroy what has been wrought with so much care and industry, toil and labour, wisdom and prudence; the thought of all which was afflicting and distressing: and therefore he adds, <p>This is also vanity; and shows there is no happiness in all that a man does, has, or enjoys; and this circumstance, before related, adds to his vexation and unhappiness. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/ecclesiastes/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And who knoweth whether he shall be a wise man or a fool? yet shall he have rule over all my labour wherein I have laboured, and wherein I have shewed myself wise under the sun.

No man, whatever care he may take to entail his possessions, can secure an entail of character. And there is something irritating at times,—the writer seems to hint, almost maddening,—in the thought that whatever may be the character of the heir, he will have power to scatter in random waste what has been brought together, as with a purpose and a policy. Lands, libraries, galleries are all liable to be scattered and broken up. So in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/39-6.htm" title="Surely every man walks in a vain show: surely they are disquieted in vain: he heaps up riches, and knows not who shall gather them.">Psalm 39:6</a> we have as the doom of the mammon-worshipper, “He heapeth up riches, and cannot tell who shall gather them.” So the sting of the message that comes to the Rich Fool of the parable is “Then whose shall those things be which thou hast provided?” <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-20.htm" title="But God said to him, You fool, this night your soul shall be required of you: then whose shall those things be, which you have provided?">Luke 12:20</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who knoweth whether he shall be a wise man or a fool</span>? The bitter feeling that he has to leave the fruits of his lifelong labor to another is aggravated by the thought that he knows not the character of this successor, whether he will be worthy or not. As the psalmist says, "He heapeth up riches, and knoweth not who shall gather them" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/39-6.htm">Psalm 39:6</a>). Again in the parable, "The things which thou hast prepared, whose shall they be?" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-20.htm">Luke 12:20</a>; comp. Ecclus. 11:18, 19). <span class="cmt_word">Yet shall he have rule,</span> etc. Whatever may be his character, he will have free use and control of all that I have gathered by my labor directed by prudence and wisdom.

The wise man has eyes in his head; but the fool walketh in darkness." In the sacred Scriptures, "light" is generally the symbol of grace, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/43-3.htm">Psalm 43:3</a>, but also the contrast of an intellectually and morally darkened state, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-4.htm">Isaiah 51:4</a>. To know a thing is equivalent to having light on it, and seeing it in its true light (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/36-10.htm">Psalm 36:10</a>); wisdom is thus compared to light; folly is once, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/38-19.htm">Job 38:19</a>, directly called "darkness." Thus wisdom stands so much higher than folly, as light stands above darkness.&#1497;&#1514;&#1512;&#1493;&#1503;, which hitherto denoted actual result, enduring gain, signifies here preference; along with &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;&#1512;&#1493;&#1503;<p>(Note: Thus written, according to J and other authorities.)<p>there is also found the form &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;&#1512;&#1493;&#1503; <p>(Note: Thus Ven. 1515, 1521; vid., Comm. under <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-28.htm">Genesis 27:28-29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-10.htm">Psalm 45:10</a>.)<p>(vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-17.htm">Proverbs 30:17</a>). The fool walks in darkness: he is blind although he has eyes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-8.htm">Isaiah 43:8</a>), and thus has as good as none, - he wants the spiritual eye of understanding (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-3.htm">Job 10:3</a>); the wise man, on the other hand, his eyes are in his head, or, as we also say: he has eyes in his head, - eyes truly seeing, looking at and examining persons and things. That is the one side of the relation of wisdom to folly as put to the test.<p>The other side of the relation is the sameness of the result in which the elevation of wisdom above folly terminates.<p>"And I myself perceived that one experience happeneth to them all. And I said in my heart, As it will happen to the fool, it will happen also to me; and why have I then been specially wise? Thus I spake then in my heart, that this also is vain." Zckler gives to &#1490;&#1468;&#1501; an adversative sense; but this gam ( equals  &#x3bf;&#788;&#768;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;, similiter) stands always at the beginning of the clause, Ewald, 354a. Gam-ani corresponds to the Lat. ego idem, which gives two predicates to one subject; while et ipse predicates the same of the one of two subjects as it does of the other (Zumpt, 697). The second gam-ani serves for the giving of prominence to the object, and here precedes, after the manner of a substantival clause (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-12.htm">Isaiah 45:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-17.htm">Ezekiel 33:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-10.htm">2 Chronicles 28:10</a>), as at <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-27.htm">Genesis 24:27</a>; cf. Gesen. 121. 3. Miqre&#780;h (from &#1511;&#1512;&#1492;, to happen, to befall) is quiquid alicui accidit (in the later philosoph. terminol. accidens; Venet. &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;); but here, as the connection shows, that which finally puts an end to life, the final event of death. By the word &#1497;&#1491; the author expresses what he had observed on reflection; by &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;...&#1488;&#1501;, what he said inwardly to himself regarding it; and by &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468; &#1491;&#1500;, what sentence he passed thereon with himself. Lammah asks for the design, as maddu'a for the reason. &#1488;&#1494; is either understood temporally: then when it is finally not better with me than with the fool (Hitz. from the standpoint of the dying hour), or logically: if yet one and the same event happeneth to the wise man and to the fool (Eslt.); in the consciousness of the author both are taken together.The &#1494;&#1492; of the conclusion refers, not, as at <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:17</a>, to the endeavouring after and the possession of wisdom, but to this final result making no difference between wise men and fools. This fate, happening to all alike, is &#1492;&#1489;&#1500;, a vanity rendering all vain, a nullity levelling down all to nothing, something full of contradictions, irrational. Paul also (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-20.htm">Romans 8:20</a>) speaks of this destruction, which at last comes upon all, as a &#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;.<p>The author now assigns the reason for this discouraging result. </body></html>
