The world is a vale of tears, even to those that have much of it. See what fools they are, who make themselves drudges to the world, which affords a man nothing better than subsistence for the body. And the utmost he can attain in this respect is to allow himself a sober, cheerful use thereof, according to his rank and condition. But we must enjoy good in our labour; we must use those things to make us diligent and cheerful in worldly business. And this is the gift of God. Riches are a blessing or a curse to a man, according as he has, or has not, a heart to make a good use of them. To those that are accepted of the Lord, he gives joy and satisfaction in the knowledge and love of him. But to the sinner he allots labour, sorrow, vanity, and vexation, in seeking a worldly portion, which yet afterwards comes into better hands. Let the sinner seriously consider his latter end. To seek a lasting portion in the love of Christ and the blessings it bestows, is the only way to true and satisfying enjoyment even of this present world.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ecclesiastes/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Nothing better for a man, than that ... - literally, no good in man that etc. The one joy of working or receiving, which, though it be transitory, a man recognizes as a real good, even that is not in the power of man to secure for himself: that good is the gift of God.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ecclesiastes/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>24. English Version gives a seemingly Epicurean sense, contrary to the general scope. The Hebrew, literally is, "It is not good for man that he should eat," &c., "and should make his soul see good" (or "show his soul, that is, himself, happy"), &c. [Weiss]. According to Holden and Weiss, Ec 3:12, 22 differ from this verse in the text and meaning; here he means, "It is not good that a man should feast himself, and falsely make as though his soul were happy"; he thus refers to a false pretending of happiness acquired by and for one's self; in Ec 3:12, 22; 5:18, 19, to real seeing, or finding pleasure when God gives it. There it is said to be good for a man to enjoy with satisfaction and thankfulness the blessings which God gives; here it is said not to be good to take an unreal pleasure to one's self by feasting, &c.<p>This also I saw&#8212;I perceived by experience that good (real pleasure) is not to be taken at will, but comes only from the hand of God [Weiss] (Ps 4:6; Isa 57:19-21). Or as Holden, "It is the appointment from the hand of God, that the sensualist has no solid satisfaction" (good).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ecclesiastes/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">There is nothing better for a man; </span> or, Is there <span class="ital">any thing better for a man</span>? which implies that there is nothing better, to wit, for man’s present comfort and satisfaction; this is the chief, and indeed the only, considerable benefit of his labours. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">That he should make his soul enjoy good; </span> that he should thankfully take, and freely and cheerfully enjoy, the comforts which God gives him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">That it was from the hand of God; </span> that this also is a singular gift of God, and not to be procured by a man’s own wisdom or diligence. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/ecclesiastes/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>There is nothing better for a man than that he should eat and drink,.... Not in an immoderate and voluptuous manner, like the epicure and the atheist, that disbelieve a future state and the resurrection of the dead, and give up themselves to all sinful and sensual gratifications; but in a moderate way, enjoying in a cheerful and comfortable manner the good creatures of God, which he has given; being contented with them, thankful for them, and looking upon them as the blessings of divine goodness, and as flowing from the love of God to him; and thus freely using, and yet not abusing them. Some render it, "it is not good for a man to eat" (a), &amp;c. immoderately and to excess, and to place his happiness in it: or, "there is no good with man" (b); it is not in the power of man to use the creatures aright. Jarchi renders it by way of interrogation, "is it not good?" which comes to the same sense with ours, and so the Vulgate Latin version; <p>and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour; not leave off labouring; nor eat and drink what he has not laboured for, or what is the fruit of other men's labour; but what is the effect of his own, and in which he continues; and this is the way to go on in it with cheerfulness, when he enjoys the good, and reaps the benefit and advantage of it; which is certainly preferable to a laying up his substance, and leaving it to he knows not who. <p>This also I saw, that it was from the hand of God; not only the riches a man possesses, but the enjoyment of them, or a heart to make use of them; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/5-18.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:18</a>. The Midrash interprets this eating and drinking, of the law and good works: and the Targum explains it, causing the soul to enjoy the good of doing the commandments, and walking in right ways; and observes, that a man that prospers in this world, it is from the hand of the Lord, and is what is decreed to be concerning him. <p>(a)  "non est igitur bonum", Vatablus.

Almost all interpreters however are agreed in adopting a conjectural emendation, which again in its turn has given rise to two different renderings: (1) “Is it not better (or “Is it not good”) for a man to eat and drink …?” or (2) “there is nothing good for a man but to eat and drink.…” The two last are of course substantially the same in their teaching, and both express what we may call the higher type of Epicureanism which forms one element of the book. The pursuit of riches, state, luxury, is abandoned for the simple joys that lie within every man’s reach, the “<span class="ital">fallentis semita vitae</span>” of one who has learnt the lesson of regulating his desires. The words “to eat and drink” are closely connected with “enjoying good <span class="ital">in his labour</span>.” What is praised is not the life of slothful self-indulgence or æsthetic refinement, but that of a man who, though with higher culture, is content to live as simply as the ploughman, or the vinedresser, or artificer. <span class="greekheb">Λάθε βιώσας</span>, “live in the shade,” was the Epicurean rule of wisdom. Pleasure was not found in feasts and sensual excess but in sobriety of mind, and the conquest of prejudice and superstition (Diog. Laert. x. 1. 132). The real wants of such a life are few, and there is a joy in working for them. Here again the thought finds multiform echoes in the utterances of men who have found the cares and pleasures and pursuits of a more ambitious life unsatisfying. It is significant that the very words “eat and drink” had been used by Jeremiah in describing the pattern life of a righteous king (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-15.htm" title="Shall you reign, because you close yourself in cedar? did not your father eat and drink, and do judgment and justice, and then it was well with him?">Jeremiah 22:15</a>). The type of life described is altogether different from that of the lower Epicureans who said “Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-32.htm" title="If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what advantages it me, if the dead rise not? let us eat and drink; for to morrow we die.">1 Corinthians 15:32</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>So we have one Epicurean poet singing<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“Si non aurea sunt iuvenum simulacra per aedes<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Lampadas igniferas manibus retinentia dextris,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Lumina nocturnis epulis ut suppeditentur,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Nec domus argento fulget auroque renidet<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Nec citharae reboant laqueata aurataque templa,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Cum tamen inter se prostrati in gramine molli<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Propter aquae rivum sub ramis arboris altae<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Non magnis opibus iucunde corpora curant,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Praesertim cum tempestas adridet et anni<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Tempora conspergunt viridantis floribus herbas.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“What though no golden statues of fair boys<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>With lamp in hand illumine all the house<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And cast their lustre on the nightly feast;<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Nor does their home with silver or with gold<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Dazzle the eye; nor through the ceilèd roof,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Bedecked with gold, the harps re-echo loud.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Yet, while reclining on the soft sweet grass<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>They lie in groups along the river’s bank,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Beneath the branches of some lofty tree,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And at small cost find sweet refreshment there,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>What time the season smiles, and spring-tide weeks<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Re-gem the herbage green with many a flower.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Lucret. <span class="ital">De Rer.

Act ii. 5.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">This also I saw, that it was from the hand of God</span>] In the thought which is thus expressed, we find, however, something more than an echo of Greek Epicureanism. The <span class="bld">Debater</span> recognises a Divine Will in this apportionment of happiness, just as he had before recognised that Will in the toil and travail with which the sons of man were exercised (ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-13.htm" title="And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all things that are done under heaven: this sore travail has God given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith.">Ecclesiastes 1:13</a>). The apparent inequalities are thus, in part at least, redressed, and it is shewn as the teaching of experience no less than of the Divine Master, that “a man’s life consisteth not in the abundance of things which he possesseth” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-15.htm" title="And he said to them, Take heed, and beware of covetousness: for a man's life consists not in the abundance of the things which he possesses.">Luke 12:15</a>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There is nothing better for a man, than that he should eat and drink</span>. The Vulgate makes the sentence interrogative, which the Hebrew does not sanction, <span class="accented">Nonne melius est comedere et bibere</span>? Septuagint <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x1ff3;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "There is naught good to a man to eat or drink;" St. Jerome and others insert <span class="accented">misi</span>, "except for a man to eat," etc. This and the Authorized Version, which are more or less approved by most critics, make the writer enunciate a kind of modified Epicureanism, quotations in confirmation of which will be found set forth by Plumptre. It is not pretended that the present Hebrew text admits this exposition, and critics have agreed to modify the original in order to express the sense which they give to the passage. As it stands, the sentence runs, "It is not good in (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;</span>) man that he should eat," etc. This is supposed to clash with later statements; e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:12, 13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:15</a>; and to condemn all bodily pleasure even in its simplest form. Hence commentators insert <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;</span> ("than") before <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;&#x5ba;&#x5d0;&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span>, supposing that the initial mere has dropped out after the terminal of the preceding word, <span class="accented">adam</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-22.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:22</a>). This solution of a difficulty might be allowed were the Hebrew otherwise incapable of explanation without doing violence to the sentiments elsewhere expressed. But this is not the case. As Metals has seen, the great point lies in the preposition <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;</span>, and what is stated is that it does not depend on man, it is not in his power, he is not at liberty to eat and drink and enjoy himself simply at his own will; his power and ability proceed wholly from God. A higher authority than his decides the matter. The phrase, "to eat and drink," is merely a periphrasis for living in comfort, peace, and affluence. St. Gregory, who holds that here and in other places Koheleth seems to contradict himself, makes a remark which is of general application, "He who looks to the text, and does not acquaint himself with the sense of the Holy Word, is not so much furnishing himself with instruction as bewildering himself in uncertainty, in that the literal words sometimes contradict themselves; but whilst by their oppositeness they stand at variance with themselves, they direct the reader to a truth that is to be understood" ('Moral.,' 4:1). They who read Epicureanism into the text fall into the error here denounced. They take the expression, "eat and drink," in the narrowest sense of bodily pleasure, whereas it was by no means so confined in the mind of a Hebrew. To eat bread in the kingdom of God, to take a place at the heavenly banquet, represents the highest bliss of glorified man (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/14-15.htm">Luke 14:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-9.htm">Revelation 19:9</a>, etc.). In a lower degree it signifies earthly prosperity, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-15.htm">Jeremiah 22:15</a>, "Did not thy father eat and drink, and do judgment and justice? then it was well with him." So in our passage we find only the humiliating truth that man in himself is powerless to make his life happy or his labors successful. There is no Epicurean-ism, even in a modified form, in the Hebrew text as it has come down to us. With other supposed traces of this philosophy we shall have to deal subsequently (see on Ecclesiastes 3:12; 6:2). <span class="cmt_word">And that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labor</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. taste the enjoyment of his labor, get pleasure as the reward of all his exertions, or find it in the actual pursuit. <span class="cmt_word">This also I saw, that it was from the hand of God</span>. This is the point - the power of enjoyment depends on the will of God.
