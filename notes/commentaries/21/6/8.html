The desires of the soul find nothing in the wealth of the world to give satisfaction. The poor man has comfort as well as the richest, and is under no real disadvantage. We cannot say, Better is the sight of the eyes than the resting of the soul in God; for it is better to live by faith in things to come, than to live by sense, which dwells only upon present things. Our lot is appointed. We have what pleases God, and let that please us. The greatest possessions and honours cannot set us above the common events of human life. Seeing that the things men pursue on earth increase vanities, what is man the better for his worldly devices? Our life upon earth is to be reckoned by days. It is fleeting and uncertain, and with little in it to be fond of, or to be depended on. Let us return to God, trust in his mercy through Jesus Christ, and submit to his will. Then soon shall we glide through this vexatious world, and find ourselves in that happy place, where there is fulness of joy and pleasures for evermore.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ecclesiastes/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>What - literally, what profit (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-3.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:3</a>).<p>Knoweth ... living - i. e., "Knows how to conduct himself rightly among his contemporaries." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ecclesiastes/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8.

More delight and pleasure, in gratifying his senses, by eating and drinking: the wise man enjoys no more than the fool; the fool finds as much pleasure in the labour of his hands, which is for his mouth, as the wise man does; and the wise man can get no more satisfaction to his mind, from these outward gratifications, than the fool; <p>what hath the poor, that knoweth to walk before the living? either, what does the poor man want more than the rich man, that knows how to get his bread, and is diligent and industrious among men to live, and does get a livelihood for himself and family; he enjoys all the sweets and comforts of life, as well as the rich man: or what hath the poor knowing man? as Aben Ezra interprets it, according to the accents; what has he more or does he enjoy more, than the poor foolish man, provided he has but sense enough to behave himself among men, so as to have bread to eat, and clothes to wear; which is as much as any man can enjoy, be he ever so rich or so wise? <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/ecclesiastes/6.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For what hath the wise more than the fool? what hath the poor, that knoweth to walk before the living?</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/ecclesiastes/6.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">8</span>. <span class="ital">For what hath wise more than the fool?</span>] The question so far is easy. In this matter, the gifts of intellect make no difference. The wise, no less than the fool, is subject to the pressure of bodily necessities, and has to labour for them. The second clause is somewhat less clear. Of the many interpretations that have been given, two have most to commend them, (1) supplying the subject of comparison from the first clause, <span class="bld">what advantage hath the poor that knows to walk before the living</span> (<span class="ital">i.e. that has learnt the art to live</span>) <span class="bld">over the fool</span> (<span class="ital">who is the mere slave of appetite)? what does wisdom and self-control and freedom from the snares of wealth really profit him?</span> and (2), treating the sentence as elliptical, <span class="bld">What advantage hath the poor over him who knows how to walk before the living</span> (<span class="ital">i.e.</span> the man of high birth or station, <span class="ital">who lives in public, with the eyes of men on him</span>)? The latter explanation has the merit of giving a more balanced symmetry to the two clauses. The question, with its implied answer, seems at first at variance with the praise of the lot of the labouring poor in ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/5-12.htm" title="The sleep of a laboring man is sweet, whether he eat little or much: but the abundance of the rich will not suffer him to sleep.">Ecclesiastes 5:12</a>, “Don’t trust,” the writer seems to say in his half-cynical, half-ironical mood, “even to poverty, as a condition of happiness. The poor man is as open to cares and anxieties as the man of culture and refinement. After all, poor and rich stand on nearly the same level.”<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For what hath the wise more fire than the fool?</span> <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. What advantage hath the wise man over the fool? This verse confirms the previous one by an interrogative argument. The same labor for support, the same unsatisfied desires, belong to all, wise or foolish; in this respect intellectual gifts have no superiority. (For a similar interrogation implying an emphatic denial, see Ecclesiastes 1:30) <span class="cmt_word">What hath the poor, that knoweth to walk before the living?</span> The Septuagint gives the verse thus: <span class="greek">&#x1f4d;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> (A, C, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>) <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>, "For what advantage hath the wise man over the fool? since the poor man knows how to walk before life?" Vulgate, <span class="accented">Quid habet amplius sapiens a stulto? et quid pauper</span>, <span class="accented">nisi ut pergat illuc</span>, <span class="accented">ubi est vita?</span> "And what hath the poor man except that he go thither where is life?" Both these versions regard <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> as used in the sense of "life," and that the life beyond the grave; but this idea is foreign to the context; and the expression must be rendered, as in the Authorized Version, "the living." The interpretation of the clause has much exercised critics. Plumptre adheres to that of Bernstein and others, "What advantage hath the poor over him who knows how to walk before the living?' (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the man of high birth or station, who lives in public, with the eyes of men upon him). The poor has his cares and unsatisfied desires as much as the man of culture and position. Poverty offers no protection against such assaults, But the expression, to <span class="accented">know how to walk before the living</span>, means to understand and to follow the correct path of life; to know how to behave properly and uprightly in the intercourse with one's fellow-men; to have what the French call <span class="accented">savoir vivre</span>. (So Volok.) The question must be completed thus: "What advantage has the discreet and properly conducted poor man over the fool?" None, at least in this respect. The poor man, even though he be well vetoed in the rule of life, has insatiable desires which he has to check or conceal, and so is no better off than the fool, who equally is unable to gratify them. The two 'extremities of the social scale are taken  - the rich wise man, and the prudent poor man - and both are shown to fail in enjoying life; and what is true of these must be also true of all that come between these two limits, "the appetite is not filled" (ver. 7). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ecclesiastes/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>To &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1498;, as at <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-11.htm">2 Chronicles 1:11</a>, &#1493;&#1498; and honour is added as a third thing.
