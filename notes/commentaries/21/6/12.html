The desires of the soul find nothing in the wealth of the world to give satisfaction. The poor man has comfort as well as the richest, and is under no real disadvantage. We cannot say, Better is the sight of the eyes than the resting of the soul in God; for it is better to live by faith in things to come, than to live by sense, which dwells only upon present things. Our lot is appointed. We have what pleases God, and let that please us. The greatest possessions and honours cannot set us above the common events of human life. Seeing that the things men pursue on earth increase vanities, what is man the better for his worldly devices? Our life upon earth is to be reckoned by days. It is fleeting and uncertain, and with little in it to be fond of, or to be depended on. Let us return to God, trust in his mercy through Jesus Christ, and submit to his will. Then soon shall we glide through this vexatious world, and find ourselves in that happy place, where there is fulness of joy and pleasures for evermore.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ecclesiastes/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>After him - i. e., On earth, in his own present sphere of action, after his departure hence (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-19.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-22.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:22</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ecclesiastes/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. For who knoweth, &c.&#8212;The ungodly know not what is really "good" during life, nor "what shall be after them," that is, what will be the event of their undertakings (Ec 3:22; 8:7). The godly might be tempted to "contend with God" (Ec 6:10) as to His dispensations; but they cannot fully know the wise purposes served by them now and hereafter. Their sufferings from the oppressors are more really good for them than cloudless prosperity; sinners are being allowed to fill up their measure of guilt. Retribution in part vindicates God's ways even now. The judgment shall make all clear. In Ec 7:1-29, he states what is good, in answer to this verse.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ecclesiastes/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Who knoweth what is good for man?</span> no man certainly knows what is best for him here, whether to be high or low, rich or poor, because those great things which men generally desire and pursue are very frequently the occasions of men’s utter ruin, as hath been noted again and again in this book. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Vain life; </span> life itself, which is the foundation of all men’s comforts and enjoyments here, is a vain, and uncertain, and transitory thing, and therefore all things which depend. upon it must needs be so too. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">A shadow; </span> which, whilst it abides, hath nothing real, and solid, or substantial in it, and doth speedily pass away, and leaves no sign behind it. And as no man can be happy with these things whilst he liveth and enjoyeth them, so he can have no content in leaving them to others, because he knoweth not either who shall possess them, or how the future owners will use or abuse them, or what mischief they may do by them, either to others, or even to themselves. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/ecclesiastes/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For who knoweth what is good for man in this life?.... To be in a higher or lower station of life, to live in grandeur or meanness, to be rich or poor, learned or unlearned; since that which seems most agreeable to human nature is at, ended with so much vanity, the occasion of so much sin, and often issues in ruin and misery, that no man knows what is best for him; and therefore it is the wisest way to be content with what a man has, and enjoy it in the most comfortable manner, and use it to the best ends and purposes he can. The Targum is, <p>"for who is he that knows what is good for a man in this world, but to study in the law, which is the life of the world?'' <p>so the Midrash, <p>all the days of his vain life, which he spendeth as a shadow? or "the number of the days of vain life, which he makes as a shadow" (d); that is, which God makes as a "shadow", as Cocceius observes; makes to pass away swiftly: this is a description of the vanity, brevity, and uncertainty of human life; it consists of days, rather than of months and years; and those such as are easily numbered, and which pass away suddenly and swiftly, like a shadow that has no substance and reality in it, and leaves nothing behind it; or like a bird that flies away, as Jarchi, and is seen no more; such is the life of man, a most vain life, vanity itself; so it may be rendered, "the number of the days of the life of his vanity" (e); since therefore he has so short a time to enjoy anything in, it is hard to say what is best for him to have, and the rather since he is quite ignorant of what is to come; <p>for who can tell a man what shall be after him under the sun? he does not know himself, nor can any man inform him, what will become of his wealth and riches after his death, which he has got together; who shall enjoy them, and how long and what use will be made of them, either to their own good, or the good of others. <p>(d)  "et facit eos at umbram", Cocceius.

See note on ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-21.htm" title="Who knows the spirit of man that goes upward, and the spirit of the beast that goes downward to the earth?">Ecclesiastes 3:21</a>. After all discussions on the supreme good, some pointing to pleasure, and some to virtue, and some to apathy, who can give a definite and decisive answer? Life remained after all vain, and not worth living. See again the poem of Omar Khayyam in the <span class="ital">Appendix</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">which he spendeth as a shadow</span>] The thought was so natural as to be all but universal. It had been uttered by Job (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-9.htm" title="All this have I seen, and applied my heart to every work that is done under the sun: there is a time wherein one man rules over another to his own hurt.">Ecclesiastes 8:9</a>), and by David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-15.htm" title="For we are strangers before you, and sojourners, as were all our fathers: our days on the earth are as a shadow, and there is none abiding.">1 Chronicles 29:15</a>). It was uttered also by Sophocles:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὁρῶ γὰρ ἡμᾶς οὐδὲν ὄντας ἄλλο</span>, <span class="greekheb">πλὴν</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">εἴδωλ</span>ʼ, <span class="greekheb">ὅσοιπερ ζῶμεν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἢ κούφην σκιάν</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"></span>“In this I see that we, all we that live,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Are but vain shadows, unsubstantial dreams.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Aias</span>, 127.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">for who can tell a man</span>] Man’s ignorance of the future, of what may become of children or estate, is, as before in chs. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ecclesiastes/2-18.htm" title="Yes, I hated all my labor which I had taken under the sun: because I should leave it to the man that shall be after me....">Ecclesiastes 2:18-19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-7.htm" title="Then I returned, and I saw vanity under the sun.">Ecclesiastes 4:7</a>, another element in the “vanity” of human life. Granted that it is long and prosperous to the end, still the man is vexed or harassed with the thought that his work may be all undone, his treasures wasted, his plans frustrated.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - This verse in the Greek and Latin versions, as in some copies of the Hebrew, is divorced from its natural place, as the conclusion of the paragraph, vers. 10, 11, and is arranged as the commencement of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Ecclesiastes 7</a>. Plainly, the Divine prescience of vers. 10, 11 is closely connected with the question of man's ultimate good and his ignorance of the future, enunciated in this verse. <span class="cmt_word">For who knoweth what is good for man in this life?</span> Such discussions are profitless, for man knows not what is his real good - whether pleasure, apathy, or virtue, as philosophers would put it. To decide such questions he must be able to foresee results, which is denied him. The interrogative "Who knows?" is equivalent to an emphatic negative, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-21.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:21</a>, and is a common rhetorical form which surely need not be attributed to Pyrrhonism (Plumptre). <span class="cmt_word">All the days of his vain life which he spendeth as a shadow.</span> These words amplify and explain the term "in life" of the preceding clause. They may be rendered literally, <span class="accented">During the number of the days of the life</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/5-18.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:18</a>) <span class="accented">of his vanity</span>, <span class="accented">and he passeth them as a shadow</span>. A life of vanity is one that yields no good result, full of empty aims, unsatisfied wishes, unfulfilled purposes. It is the man who is here compared to the shadow, not his life. So <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-2.htm">Job 14:2</a>, "He fleeth as a shadow, and continueth not," He soon passes away, and leaves no trace behind him. The thought is common. "Ye [Revised Version] are a vapor," says St. James (James 4:14), "that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away." Plumptre well quotes Soph., 'Ajax,' 125 -  <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greek">&#xa0;&#x1ffe;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span><br /><span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3bb;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x7d;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"In this I see that we, all we that live,<br />Are but vain shadows, unsubstantial dreams."</span> To which we may add Pind., 'Pyth.,' 8:95 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f54;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f0c;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Ye creatures of a day!<br />What is the great man what the poor?<br />Naught but a shadowy dream."</span> The comparison of man's life to a shadow or vapor is equally general (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-15.htm">1 Chronicles 29:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102-11.htm">Psalm 102:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/144-4.htm">Psalm 144:4</a>; Wisd. 2:5; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/4-14.htm">James 4:14</a>). The verb used for "spendeth" is <span class="accented">asah</span>, "to do or make," which recalls the Greek phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-33.htm">Acts 15:33</a>, etc.; Demosth., 'De Fals. Leg.,' p. 392, 17), and the Latin, <span class="accented">dies facere</span> (Cic., 'Ad Attic.,' 5:20. 1); but we need not trace Greek influence in the employment of the expression here. <span class="cmt_word">For who can tell a man what shall be after him under the sun?</span> This does not refer to the life beyond the grave, but to the future in the present world, as the words, "under the sun," imply (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-22.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:14</a>). To know what is best for him, to arrange his present life according to his own wishes and plans, to be able to depend upon his own counsel for all the actions and designs which he undertakes, man should know what is to be after him, what result his labors will have, who and what kind of heir will inherit his property, whether he will leave children to carry on his name, and other facts of the like nature; but as this is all hidden from him, his duty and his happiness is to acquiesce in the Divine government, to enjoy with moderation the goods of life, and to be content with the modified satisfaction which is accorded to him by Divine beneficence. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ecclesiastes/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>A life extending to more than even a thousand years without enjoyment appears to him worthless: "And if he has lived twice a thousand years long, and not seen good - Do not all go hence to one place?" This long period of life, as well as the shortest, sinks into the night of Sheol, and has advantage over the shortest if it wants the &#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; &#1496;, i.e., the enjoyment of that which can make man happy. That would be correct if "good" were understood inwardly, ethically, spiritually; but although, according to Koheleth's view, the fear of God presides over the enjoyment of life, regulating and hallowing it, yet it remains unknown to him that life deepened into fellowship with God is in itself a most real and blessed, and thus the highest good. Regarding &#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; (here, as at <a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/7-4.htm">Esther 7:4</a>, with perf. foll.: etsi vixisset, tamen interrogarem: nonne, etc.); it occurs also in the oldest liturgical Tefilla, as well as in the prayer Nishmath (vid., Baer's Siddur, Abodath Jisrael, p. 207). &#1508;&#1468; ... &#1488;&#1500;&#1507;, a thousand years twice, and thus an Adam's life once and yet again. Otherwise Aben Ezra: 1000 years multiplied by itself, thus a million, like &#1508;&#1468;&#1506;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, 20 x 20  equals  400; cf. Targ. <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-26.htm">Isaiah 30:26</a>, which translates &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1506;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501; by 343  equals  7 x 7 x 7. Perhaps that is right; for why was not the expression &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1492; &#1488;&#1500;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; directly used? The "one place" is, as at <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-20.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:20</a>, the grave and Hades, into which all the living fall. A life extending even to a million of years is worthless, for it terminates at last in nothing. Life has only as much value as it yields of enjoyment. </body></html>
