The desires of the soul find nothing in the wealth of the world to give satisfaction. The poor man has comfort as well as the richest, and is under no real disadvantage. We cannot say, Better is the sight of the eyes than the resting of the soul in God; for it is better to live by faith in things to come, than to live by sense, which dwells only upon present things. Our lot is appointed. We have what pleases God, and let that please us. The greatest possessions and honours cannot set us above the common events of human life. Seeing that the things men pursue on earth increase vanities, what is man the better for his worldly devices? Our life upon earth is to be reckoned by days. It is fleeting and uncertain, and with little in it to be fond of, or to be depended on. Let us return to God, trust in his mercy through Jesus Christ, and submit to his will. Then soon shall we glide through this vexatious world, and find ourselves in that happy place, where there is fulness of joy and pleasures for evermore.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ecclesiastes/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Things - Namely, the various circumstances detailed in the foregoing chapters, from the Preacher's personal experience, and his observation of other people, ending with the comprehensive declaration in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/6-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:10</a> to the effect that vanity is an essential part of the constitution of creation as it now exists, and was foreknown.<p>What is man the better? - Rather, what is profitable to man? <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ecclesiastes/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11.

As appears by all that has been said in this and the preceding chapters; such as wisdom and knowledge, wealth and riches, pleasure, power, and authority. Man is a poor vain creature himself, all he is and has is vanity; and these serve but to increase it, and make him vainer and vainer still; <p>what is man the better? for these things? not at all, rather the worse, being more vain; there is no profit by them, no excellency arises to him from them, no happiness in them, nothing that will be of any service to him, especially with respect to a future state, or when he comes to die. It may be rendered, as it is in the Septuagint and Vulgate Latin versions, "seeing there are many words that multiply vanity"; as all such words do that are used with God by way of murmur and complaint concerning a man's lot and condition in this world, and as expostulating and contending with him about it; these increase sin, and by them men contract more guilt, and therefore are not the better for such litigations, but the worse; and so the words stand in connection with <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/6-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:10</a>, but the former sense seems best, this being the conclusion of the wise man's discourse concerning vanity. So the Targum and Jarchi understand it of things, and not words. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/ecclesiastes/6.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Seeing there be many things that increase vanity, what is man the better?</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/ecclesiastes/6.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">11</span>. <span class="ital">there be many things that increase vanity</span>] The Hebrew noun, as so often throughout the book, may stand either for <span class="ital">things</span> or <span class="ital">words</span>. In the former case, the maxim points to the pressure of affairs, what we call “business,” the cares about many things, which make men feel the hollowness of life. In the latter, it probably refers to the speculative discussions on the chief good, destiny, and the like, which were rife in the schools both of Jews and Greeks, and finds a parallel in ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-12.htm" title="And further, by these, my son, be admonished: of making many books there is no end; and much study is a weariness of the flesh.">Ecclesiastes 12:12</a>, and in Milton’s description of like debates, as to<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“Fixed fate, free will, fore-knowledge absolute;<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Vain wisdom all, and false philosophy.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The latter fits in best with the explanation which refers the previous verse to the Divine decrees, the former with that which has been adopted here.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">what is man the better</span>] Literally, <span class="bld">what profit</span> (the word is another form of that which occurs so frequently), what outcome, is there for man?<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Seeing there be many things that increase vanity</span>. The noun rendered"things" (<span class="accented">dabar</span>) may equally mean "words;" and it is a question which signification is most appropriate here. The Septuagint has <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>, "many words." So the Vulgate, <span class="accented">verba sunt plurima</span>. If we take the rendering of the Authorized Version, we must understand the passage to mean that the distractions of business, the cares of life, the constant disappointments, make men feel the hollowness and unsatisfactory nature of labor and wealth and earthly goods, and their absolute dependence upon Providence. But in view of the previous context, and especially of ver. 10, which speaks of contending (<span class="accented">din</span>) with God, it is most suitable to translate <span class="accented">debarim</span> "words," and to understand them of the expressions of impatience, doubt, and unbelief to which men give utterance when arraigning the acts or endeavoring to explain the decrees of God. Such profitless words only increase the perplexity in which men are involved. It is very possible that reference is here made to the discussions on the chief good, free-will, predestination, and the like subjects, which, as we know from Josephus, had begun to be mooted in Jewish schools, as they had long been rife in those of Greece. In these disputes Pharisees and Sadducees took opposite sides. The former maintained that some things, but not all, were the subject of fate (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f31;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>), and that certain things were in our own power to do or not to do; that is, while they attribute all that happens to fate, or God's decree, they hold that man has the power of assent, supposing that God tempers all in such sort, that by his ordinance and man's will all things are performed, good or evil. The Sadducees eliminated fate altogether from human actions, and asserted that men are in all things governed, not by any external force, but by their own will alone; that their success and happiness depended upon themselves, and that ill fortune was the consequence of their own folly or stupidity. A third school, the Essenes, held that fate was supreme, and that nothing could happen to mankind beyond or in contravention of its decree ('Joseph. Ant.,' 13:5. 9; 18:1:3, 4; 'Bell. Jud.,' 2:08. 14). Such speculative discussions may have been in Koheleth's mind when he wrote this sentence. Whatever may be the difficulties of the position, we Christians know and feel that in matters of religion and morality we are absolutely free, have an unfettered choice, and that from this fact arises our responsibility. <span class="cmt_word">What is man the better?</span> What profit has man from such speculations or words of skepticism? <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ecclesiastes/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The comparison of an untimely birth with such a man is in favour of the former: "For it cometh in nothingness and departeth in darkness; and with darkness its name is covered. Moreover, it hath not seen the sun, and hath not known: it is better with it than with that other." It has entered into existence, &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1489;&#1500;, because it was a lifeless existence into which it entered when its independent life should have begun; and &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498;, it departeth, for it is carried away in all quietness, without noise or ceremony, and "with darkness" its name is covered, for it receives no name and remains a nameless existence, and is forgotten as if it had never been. Not having entered into a living existence, it is also (gam) thus happy to have neither seen the sun nor known and named it, and thus it is spared the sight and the knowledge of all the vanities and evils, the deceptions and sorrows, that are under the sun. When we compare its fate with the long joyless life of that man, the conclusion is apparent: &#1502; ... &#1504;&#1495;&#1514;, plus quietis est huic quam illi, which, with the generalization of the idea of rest (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-13.htm">Job 3:13</a>) in a wider sense, is  equals  melius est huic quam illi (&#1494;&#1492; ... &#1494;&#1492;, as at <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-19.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:19</a>). The generalization of the idea proceeds yet further in the Mishn. &#1504;&#1493;&#1495; &#1500;&#1493;, e.g.: "It is better (&#1504;&#1493;&#1495; &#1500;&#1493; &#1500;&#1488;&#1491;&#1501;) for a man that he throw himself into a lime-kiln than that (&#1493;&#1488;&#1500;), etc." From this usage Symm. renders &#1502; ... &#1504;&#1495;&#1514; as obj. to &#1497;&#1491;&#1506; &#1500;&#1488;, and translates: &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b7; &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#788;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#788;&#768;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; ; and Jerome: neque cognovit distantiam boni et mali, - a rendering which is to be rejected, because thus the point of the comparison in which it terminates is broken, for 5b draws the facit. It is true that this contains a thought to which it is not easy to reconcile oneself. For supposing that life were not in itself, as over against non-existence, a good, there is yet scarcely any life that is absolutely joyless; and a man who has become the father of an hundred children, has, as it appears, sought the enjoyment of life principally in sexual love, and then also has found it richly. But also, if we consider his life less as relating to sense: his children, though not all, yet partly, will have been a joy to him; and has a family life, so lengthened and rich in blessings, only thorns, and no roses at all? And, moreover, how can anything be said of the rest of an untimely birth, which has been without motion and without life, as of a rest excelling the termination of the life of him who has lived long, since rest without a subjective reflection, a rest not felt, certainly does not fall under the point of view of more or less, good or evil? The saying of the author on no side bears the probe of exact thinking. In the main he designs to say: Better, certainly, is no life than a joyless life, and, moreover, one ending dishonourably. And this is only a speciality of the general clause, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:2</a>., that death is better than life, and not being born is better than both. The author misunderstands the fact that the earthly life has its chief end beyond itself; and his false eudaemonism, failing to penetrate to the inward fountain of true happiness, which is independent of the outward lot, makes exaggerated and ungrateful demands on the earthly life. </body></html>
