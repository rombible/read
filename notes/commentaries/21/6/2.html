By one means or other his possessions come to strangers; this is vanity, and an evil disease. A numerous family was a matter of fond desire and of high honour among the Hebrews; and long life is the desire of mankind in general. Even with these additions a man may not be able to enjoy his riches, family, and life. Such a man, in his passage through life, seems to have been born for no end or use. And he who has entered on life only for one moment, to quit it the next, has a preferable lot to him who has lived long, but only to suffer.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ecclesiastes/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Common among - Rather, great (heavy) upon people. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ecclesiastes/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. for his soul&#8212;that is, his enjoyment.<p>God giveth him not power to eat&#8212;This distinguishes him from the "rich" man in Ec 5:19.

By "riches" may be meant gold and silver, things which a covetous man is never satisfied with; and by "wealth", cattle, with which farms and fields are stocked: the wealth of men, especially in former times, and in the eastern countries, lay very much in these, as did the wealth of Abraham and Job, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/13-2.htm">Genesis 13:2</a>; and all these, as they are reckoned glorious and honourable in themselves; so they create honour and glory among men, and raise to high and honourable places; and these, as they go, they are usually put together, and are called by the name of honour and glory itself; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-16.htm">Proverbs 3:16</a>. And they are all the gifts of God, which he either as blessings bestows upon men, or suffers men to attain unto, though a curse may go along with them; which is the case here, for no man whatever is possessed of them but by the will of God or his divine permission; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-12.htm">1 Chronicles 29:12</a>; and which a man may, and sometimes has, such a plentiful portion of; <p>so that he wanteth nothing for his soul of all that he desireth: he has not only for the supply of his wants, what is necessary for his daily use and service, but even what is for delight and pleasure; yea, as much as he could reasonably wish for; nay, more than heart could wish, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-7.htm">Psalm 73:7</a>; <p>yet God giveth him not power to eat thereof; the Targum adds, "because of his sin"; either he takes it away from him, he making no use of it; or his appetite is taken away, that he has no desire to it; or rather he has no heart to enjoy what he has, and scarce any part of it; not to eat and drink, and wear suitably to his circumstances, but grudges whatever he lays out on his back or belly, or in housekeeping in his family; for though God gives him a large substance, yet not a heart to make use of it, without which he cannot enjoy it; and therefore it would have been as good, or better for him, to have been without it; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/5-19.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:19</a>; <p>but a stranger eateth it; the Syriac version adds, "after him"; enjoys it, not only a part of it, but the whole; one that is not akin to him, and perhaps was never known by him; and yet, by one means or another, either in a lawful or unlawful way, comes into the possession of all he has; this has been always reckoned a great unhappiness, <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/5-2.htm">Lamentations 5:2</a>. Hence it follows, <p>this is vanity, and it is an evil disease; it is a vain thing to be possessed of great substance, and not enjoy anything of it in a comfortable way, through the sin of covetousness; which is a spiritual disease, and a very bad one; very prejudicial to the soul, and the state of it, and is rarely cured. Juvenal (w) calls it frenzy and madness for a man to live poor, that be may die rich; he is like the ass that Crassus Agelastus saw, loaded with figs, and eating thorns. <p>(w) "Cum furor dubius", &amp;c.

Two of the words here given, "riches" and "honor," are those used by God in blessing Solomon in the vision at Gibeon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-13.htm">1 Kings 3:13</a>); but all three are employed in the parallel passage (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-11.htm">2 Chronicles 1:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">So that he wanteth nothing for his soul of all that he desireth.</span> "His soul" is the man himself, his personality, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/49-19.htm">Psalm 49:19</a>. So in the parable (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-19.htm">Luke 12:19</a>) the rich fool says to his soul, "Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years." In the supposed case the man is able to procure for himself everything which he wants; has no occasion to deny himself the gratification of any rising desire. All this comes from God's bounty; but something more is wanted to bring happiness. <span class="cmt_word">Yet God giveth him not power to eat thereof.</span> "To eat" is used in a metaphorical sense for "to enjoy," take advantage of, make due use of (see on Ecclesiastes 2:24). The ability to enjoy all these good things is wanting, either from discontent, or moroseness, or sickness, or as a punishment for secret sin. <span class="cmt_word">But a stranger eateth it</span>. The "stranger" is not the legal heir, but an alien to the possessor's blood, neither relation nor even necessarily a friend. For a childless Oriental to adopt an heir is a common custom at the present day. The wish to continue a family, to leave a name and inheritance to children's children, was very strong among the Hebrews - all the stronger as the life beyond the grave was dimly apprehended. Abraham expressed this feeling when he sadly cried, "I go childless, and he that shall be possessor of my house is Dammesek Eliezer" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-2.htm">Genesis 15:2</a>). The evils are two - that this great fortune brings no happiness to its possessor, and that it passes to one who is nothing to him. <span class="cmt_word">An evil disease</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1fe5;&#x1fe4;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;</span>, Septuagint, an evil as bad as the diseases spoken of in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-27.htm">Deuteronomy 28:27, 28</a>. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ecclesiastes/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>A transition is now made to rich men as such, and the registering formula which should go before <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/5-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:14</a> here follows: "And this also is a sore evil: altogether exactly as he came, thus shall he depart: and what gain hath he that laboureth in the wind?" Regarding &#1494;&#1492;; and regarding &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1506; &#1513;&#1473;, <p>(Note: I n H. written as one word: &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1506;&#1502;&#1514;. Parchon (Lex. under &#1506;&#1502;&#1514;) had this form before him. In his Lex. Kimchi bears evidence in favour of the correct writing as two words.)<p>The writing of these first two as one word [vid. note below] accords with Ibn-Giat's view, accidentally quoted by Kimchi, that the word is compounded of &#1499; of comparison, and the frequently occurring &#1500;&#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1514; always retaining its &#1500;, and ought properly to be pointed &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1506; (cf. &#1502;&#1500;&#1468;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-20.htm">1 Kings 7:20</a>). &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; signifies combination, society, one thing along with or parallel to another; and thus &#1500;&#1506;&#1502;&#1514; bears no &#1499;, since it is itself a word of comparison, &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1514; "altogether parallel," "altogether the same." The question: what kind of advantage (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-3.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:3</a>) is to him (has he) of this that ... , carries its answer in itself. Labouring for the wind or in the wind, his labour is &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; (&#1512;&#1506;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503;) &#1512;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;, and thus fruitless. And, moreover, how miserable an existence is this life of labour leading to nothing! </body></html>
