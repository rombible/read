By one means or other his possessions come to strangers; this is vanity, and an evil disease. A numerous family was a matter of fond desire and of high honour among the Hebrews; and long life is the desire of mankind in general. Even with these additions a man may not be able to enjoy his riches, family, and life. Such a man, in his passage through life, seems to have been born for no end or use. And he who has entered on life only for one moment, to quit it the next, has a preferable lot to him who has lived long, but only to suffer.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ecclesiastes/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Common among - Rather, great (heavy) upon people. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ecclesiastes/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 6<p>Ec 6:1-12.<p>1. common&#8212;or else more literally,&#8212;"great upon man," falls heavily upon man.The vanity of riches without use, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/6-1.htm" title="There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it is common among men:">Ecclesiastes 6:1</a>,2</span>.

The Vulgate Latin version reads it, another evil; but wrongly, for the same is considered as before, the evil of covetousness; which is one of the evil things that come out of the heart of man; is abominable to the Lord, contrary to his nature and will, and a breach of his law, which forbids it, and is the root of all evil; this is an evil under the sun, for there is nothing of this kind above it; and it fell under the observation of Solomon in various instances; <p>and it is common among men; or, "great over men" (u); or "over the man", the covetous man: it spreads itself over them; few were free from it, even so long ago, in those early times, and in such times in which silver was made no account of, and was like stones in Jerusalem, as common as they; and yet the sin of covetousness, of hoarding up money and making no use of it, for a man's own good, and the good of others, was very rife among men, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-27.htm">1 Kings 10:27</a>. <p>(u)    "et multum ipsum super hominem", Montanus; "et magaum est illud super hominem istum", Rambachius. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/ecclesiastes/6.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it is common among men:</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/ecclesiastes/6.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">1</span>. <span class="ital">There is an evil which I have seen under the sun</span>] The picture is substantially the same as that of ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ecclesiastes/4-7.htm" title="Then I returned, and I saw vanity under the sun....">Ecclesiastes 4:7-8</a>. The repetition is characteristic, consciously or unconsciously, of the pessimism from which the writer has not yet emancipated himself. He broods over the same thought, chews, as it were, the “cud of bitter fancies” only, “<span class="ital">semper eandem canens cantilenam</span>.” Here the picture is that of a man who has all outward goods in abundance, but he just lacks that capacity for enjoyment which is (as in ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/5-20.htm" title="For he shall not much remember the days of his life; because God answers him in the joy of his heart.">Ecclesiastes 5:20</a>) the “gift of God,” and he dies childless and a stranger becomes the heir. We are reminded of the aged patriarch’s exclamation, “I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-2.htm" title="And Abram said, LORD God, what will you give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?">Genesis 15:2</a>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-6.</span> - Section 9. Koheleth proceeds to illustrate the fact which he stated at the end of the last chapter, viz. that the possession and enjoyment of wealth are alike the free gift of God. We may see men possessed of all the gifts of fortune, yet denied the faculty of enjoying them. Hence we again conclude that <span class="accented">wealth cannot secure happiness</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There is an evil which I have seen under the sun.</span> The writer presents his personal experience, that which has fallen under his own observation (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/5-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And it is common among men.</span> <span class="accented">Rab</span>, Translated "common," like <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> Greek, is used of number and of degree; hence there is some doubt about its meaning here.

In 13a the author has the case of Job in his mind; this verse before us is a reminiscence from <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/1-21.htm">Job 1:21</a>, with the setting aside of the difficult word &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; found there, which Sirach 40:1 exhibits. With "naked" begins emphatically the main subject; &#1499;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1468;&#1488;  equals  &#1489;&#1488; &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; is the intensifying resumption of the comparison; the contrast of &#1500;&#1499;&#1514; f, going away, excedere vit, is &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1488; of the entrance on life, coming into the world. &#1502;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492; (according to the root meaning and use, corresponding to the French point, Olsh. 205a) emphatically precedes the negation, as at <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/14-6.htm">Judges 14:6</a> (cf. the emphasis reached in a different way, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/49-18.htm">Psalm 49:18</a>). &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488; signifies here, as at <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/5-18.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:18</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/24-5.htm">Psalm 24:5</a>, to take hence, to take forth, to carry away. The &#1489; of &#1489;&#1468;&#1506; is not partitive (Aben Ezra compares <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-32.htm">Leviticus 8:32</a>), according to which Jerome and Luther translate de labore suo, but is the Beth pretii, as e.g., at <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-34.htm">1 Kings 16:34</a>, as the Chald. understands it; Nolde cites for this Beth pretii passages such as <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-24.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:24</a>, but incorrectly. Regarding the subjunctive &#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1468;&#1500;&#1498;, quod auferat. We might also with the lxx and Symm. punctuate &#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1468;&#1500;&#1498;: which might accompany him in his hand, but which could by no means denote, as Hitzig thinks: (for his trouble), which goes through his hand. Such an expression is not used; and Hitzig's supposition, that here the rich man who has lost his wealth is the subject, does not approve itself. </body></html>
