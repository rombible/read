The people cannot be happy when their princes are childish, and lovers of pleasure. Slothfulness is of ill consequence both to private and public affairs. Money, of itself, will neither feed nor clothe, though it answers the occasions of this present life, as what is to be had, may generally be had for money. But the soul, as it is not redeemed, so it is not maintained with corruptible things, as silver and gold. God sees what men do, and hears what they say in secret; and, when he pleases, brings it to light by strange and unsuspected ways. If there be hazard in secret thoughts and whispers against earthly rulers, what must be the peril from every deed, word, or thought of rebellion against the King of kings, and Lord of lords! He seeth in secret. His ear is ever open. Sinner! curse not THIS KING in thy inmost thought.

Though he is a child, and unskilful in government, gives himself to his passions and pleasures, and neglects the affairs of the kingdom; yet be so far from rebelling against him, and doing him any injury, or speaking ill of him, as not even to wish him any ill; or, within thine own breast, imprecate any evil upon him, but rather pray for him, wish him well, and do everything to promote the welfare of his person and government, and this both for the Lord's sake, and for conscience's sake; and therefore curse him not "in thy conscience" (m), as some render it. Jarchi interprets this of God the King of the world; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/2-9.htm">Job 2:9</a>; and Jerom of Christ; who should not be blasphemed, lest the angels, that go about the earth, should carry it to heaven; <p>and curse not the rich in thy bedchamber; subordinate rulers and magistrates, the king's ministers and counsellors, who are commonly rich; even those luxurious princes, before described, who give up themselves to eating and drinking, and spend the public money in profuse feasts and entertainments: yet a man should be careful how he speaks against them; and not only be cautious of what he says about them, in a vilifying way, in companies and clubs where disaffected persons speak their minds freely; but even in his own house, where his servants may hear him; nay, even in his bedchamber where only his wife and children are; <p>for a bird of the air shall carry the voice, and that which hath wings shall tell the matter; an hyperbolical expression; showing that, by some strange and unthought of ways and means, treason, though so very secret, should be brought to the knowledge of the king and his ministers; as if a bird, sitting at the window, or flying by at the same time, should hear and carry it to them: sometimes this is by means of spies and informers, that kings have in all places, to bring them news of the behaviour and sentiments of men, of whom such understand the passage; or by means of such, that bear an ill will to them, or are faithful subjects to the king. With the Persians were certain officers, called the king's ears, and the emperor's eyes; by means of whom the king was believed to be a god, since, by the ears and eyes of others, through those spies, he knew all that was done everywhere (n). Some interpret it of angels, good or bad: Jarchi, of the soul of man, which at last flies to heaven, which he thinks is the bird of the air; and of an angel that is associated to him, his guardian angel; meant, as he supposes, by that which hath wings, or "the master of wings" (o). <p>(m)  , Sept.

The wise man must recognise that espionage as a fact and gives his counsel accordingly, but it is not the less clear that the counsel itself conveys, in its grave irony, a condemnation of the practice. It may be noted that the addition of “curse not the rich” makes the irony clearer, and takes the maxim out of the hands of those who would read in it the serious condemnation of all independence of thought and speech in face of the “right divine of kings to govern wrong.” For the purposes of the teacher, in the maxims in which the irony of indignation veils itself in the garb of a servile prudence, the rich man and the king stand on the same level.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in thy bedchamber</span>] This is, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-12.htm" title="And one of his servants said, None, my lord, O king: but Elisha, the prophet that is in Israel, tells the king of Israel the words that you speak in your bedchamber.">2 Kings 6:12</a>, like the “closet” of <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-6.htm" title="But you, when you pray, enter into your closet, and when you have shut your door, pray to your Father which is in secret; and your Father which sees in secret shall reward you openly.">Matthew 6:6</a>, proverbial for the extremest retirement.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">a bird of the air shall carry the voice</span>] The figure is so natural, answering to the “walls have ears” of the Rabbinic, German, English proverbs, that any more special reference scarcely need to be sought for, but it is interesting to note the close parallel presented by the familiar Greek proverb of “the cranes of Ibycos.” For the reader who does not know the story it may be well to tell it. Ibycos was a lyric poet of Rhegium, circ. b.c. 540. He was murdered by robbers near Corinth and, as he died, called on a flock of cranes that chanced to fly over him, to avenge his death. His murderers went with their plunder to Corinth, and mingled with the crowd in the theatre. It chanced that the cranes appeared and hovered over the heads of the spectators, and one of the murderers betrayed himself by the terror-stricken cry “Behold the avengers of Ibycos!” (Suidas <span class="greekheb">Ἴβυκος</span>. Apollon. Sidon in the <span class="ital">Anthol. Graec</span>. B. vii. 745, ed. Tauchnitz). Suggestive parallels are also found in Greek comedy.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">οὐδεὶς οἰδεν τὸν θησαυρὸν τὸν ἐμὸν</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">πλὴν εἴ τις ἄρ</span>ʼ <span class="greekheb">ὄρνις</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"></span>“No one knows of my treasure, save, it may be, a bird.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Aristoph. <span class="ital">Birds</span>, 575.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἡ κορώνη μοὶ πάλαι</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἄνω τι φράζει</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"></span>“Long since the raven tells me from on high.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Aristoph. <span class="ital">Birds</span>, 50.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Possibly, however, the words may refer to the employment of carrier pigeons in the police espionage of despots.

Koheleth warns against this error; it is dangerous to give way to it (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-28.htm">Exodus 22:28</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:2</a> the motive for submission to the king is placed on religious grounds; in the present passage the ground is prudence, regard for personal safety, which might be compromised by plain speaking, especially when one has to do with such depraved and unscrupulous persons. We may compare David's generous conduct to his cruel persecutor Saul, whom he spared because he was the Lord's anointed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-6.htm">1 Samuel 24:6</a>, l0; 26:9, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-14.htm">2 Samuel 1:14</a>). <span class="accented">Madda</span>, "thought," "consciousness," is rare, and is supposed to belong to late Hebrew (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-10.htm">2 Chronicles 1:10, 11, 12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/1-4.htm">Daniel 1:4, 17</a>). The Septuagint translates it <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>: Vulgate, <span class="accented">cogitatio</span>. To encourage such thoughts in the mind is to run the risk of openly expressing them at some unguarded moment; for "out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh." <span class="cmt_word">Curse not the rich in thy bedchamber</span>. In ability to injure, the rich stand in the same category as the king. You are not safe <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "in your very bedchamber," where, if anywhere, you would fancy yourself free from espionage. But "walls have ears," says the proverb (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-11.htm">Habakkuk 2:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-40.htm">Luke 19:40</a>); and the King of Syria is warned, "Elisha, the prophet that is in Israel, telleth the King of Israel the words thou speakest in thy bedchamber" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-12.htm">2 Kings 6:12</a>). "That which ye have spoken in the ear in closets (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) shall be proclaimed upon the housetops" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-3.htm">Luke 12:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For a bird of the air shall carry the voice</span>.

"Ultio malefacti") or to the employment of carrier pigeons. We say of secret information, "a little bird told me."

Erasmus, ' Adag.,' s.v. "Occulta"). In Koheleth's day informers evidently plied their trade industriously, and here meet, not only with notice, but ironically with reprobation. On the general sentiment of the verse, we may quote Juvenal, 'Sat.,' 9:102, "O Corydon, Corydon," thus versified in Ginsburg's commentary - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"And dost thou seriously believe, fond swain,<br />The actions of the great unknown remain?<br />Poor Corydon! even beasts would silence break,<br />And stocks and stones, if servants did not, speak.<br />Bolt every door, stop every cranny tight,<br />Close every window, put out every light;<br />Let not a whisper reach the listening ear,<br />No noise, no motion; let no soul be near;<br />Yet all that passed at the cock's second crow,<br />The neighboring vintner shall, ere day-break, know."</span> <span class="cmt_word">That which hath wings</span> (compare Latin <span class="accented">ales</span>); the possessor (<span class="accented">haul</span>) of a pair of wings, a periphrasis for "a bird," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-17.htm">Proverbs 1:17</a>. We had "master of the tongue," ver. 11; so in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-6.htm">Daniel 8:6, 20</a>, "having horns," is "master (<span class="accented">haul</span>) of horns."  <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ecclesiastes/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"And the fool maketh many words: while a man yet doth not know that which shall be; and what shall be when he is no more, who can show him that?" The vav at the beginning of this verse corresponds to the Lat. accedit quod. That he who in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:12</a> was named kesil is now named hassachal, arises from this, that meanwhile sichluth has been predicated of him. The relation of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:14</a> to <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:14</a>, Geier has rightly defined: Probatur absurditas multiloquii a communi ignorantia ac imbecillitate humana, quae tamen praecipue dominatur apud ignaros stultos. We miss before lo-yeda' an "although" (gam, <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/6-1.htm">Nehemiah 6:1</a>, or ki gam, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:12</a>); the clause is, after the manner of a clause denoting state or condition, subordinated to the principal clause, as at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/5-10.htm">Psalm 5:10</a> : "an open grave is their throat &#1497;&#1495; &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;, although they smooth their tongue, i.e., speak flatteringly." The lxx, Syr., Symm., and Jerome seek to rectify the tautology id quod futurum est et quod futurum est (cf. on the other hand, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:7</a>), for they read &#1497;&#1492; ... &#1502;&#1492; &#1513;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492;. But the second quod futurum certainly preserves by &#1502;&#1488;&#1509; its distinguishing nearer definition. Hitzig explains: "What is done, and what after this (that is done) is done." Scarcely correctly: aharav of the parallel passage, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/6-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:12</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:14</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/9-3.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:3</a>, requires for the suffix a personal reference, so that thus meaharav, as at <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-21.htm">Deuteronomy 29:21</a>, means "from his death and onwards." Thus, first, the knowledge of the future is denied to man; then the knowledge of what will be done after his death; and generally, of what will then be done. The fool, without any consciousness of human ignorance, acts as if he knew all, and utters about all and everything a multitude of words; for he uselessly fatigues himself with his ignorance, which remains far behind the knowledge that is possible for man. </body></html>
