Those who strive to trace a continuity of thought take <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-18.htm" title="By much slothfulness the building decays; and through idleness of the hands the house drops through.">Ecclesiastes 10:18</a> as a figurative description of the ruin of an ill-governed land; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-19.htm" title="A feast is made for laughter, and wine makes merry: but money answers all things.">Ecclesiastes 10:19</a> as describing the riot of those rulers who make feasts for merriment, and have money freely at their disposal; and (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-20.htm" title="Curse not the king, no not in your thought; and curse not the rich in your bedchamber: for a bird of the air shall carry the voice, and that which has wings shall tell the matter.">Ecclesiastes 10:20</a>) as a warning to the subjects to beware how, notwithstanding all this mis-government, they venture to rebel.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/ecclesiastes/10.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-19.htm" title="A feast is made for laughter, and wine makes merry: but money answers all things.">Ecclesiastes 10:19</a></span>. <span class="ital">A feast is made for laughter, </span>&c. — Not merely for caring, but chiefly for pleasant conversation, and the society of friends; not the laughter of fools, which is madness, but that of wise men, namely, that cheerfulness by which they fit themselves for business and severe studies: <span class="ital">and wine maketh merry </span>— Hebrew, <span class="greekheb">ישׂמח חיים</span>, <span class="ital">maketh glad the life, </span>exhilarates the mind; <span class="ital">but money answereth all things — </span>Procures not only meat and drink for feasting, but all other worldly advantages. Therefore be frugal, and spend not all in luxurious eating and drinking, remembering, that money is wanted for a great many other purposes. Some refer this verse to rulers, and consider this last clause as being added to aggravate the sin and folly of luxury, to which, when princes give up themselves, they not only neglect their business, but thereby waste that money and treasure which are so highly necessary for the support and preservation of themselves and their kingdoms: and, in consequence thereof, are obliged to squeeze money out of their people by oppressive taxes, and other dishonourable and dangerous practices.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/10.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>10:16-20 The happiness of a land depends on the character of its rulers. The people cannot be happy when their princes are childish, and lovers of pleasure. Slothfulness is of ill consequence both to private and public affairs. Money, of itself, will neither feed nor clothe, though it answers the occasions of this present life, as what is to be had, may generally be had for money. But the soul, as it is not redeemed, so it is not maintained with corruptible things, as silver and gold. God sees what men do, and hears what they say in secret; and, when he pleases, brings it to light by strange and unsuspected ways. If there be hazard in secret thoughts and whispers against earthly rulers, what must be the peril from every deed, word, or thought of rebellion against the King of kings, and Lord of lords! He seeth in secret. His ear is ever open. Sinner! curse not THIS KING in thy inmost thought. Your curses cannot affect Him; but his curse, coming down upon you, will sink you to the lowest hell.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ecclesiastes/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>literally, For merriment they make a feast (bread), and wine gladdens the living, and money supplies all things.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ecclesiastes/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19. Referring to Ec 10:18. Instead of repairing the breaches in the commonwealth (equivalent to "building"), the princes "make a feast for laughter (Ec 10:16), and wine maketh their life glad (Ps 104:15), and (but) money supplieth (answereth their wishes by supplying) all things," that is, they take bribes to support their extravagance; and hence arise the wrongs that are perpetrated (Ec 10:5, 6; 3:16; Isa 1:23; 5:23). Maurer takes "all things" of the wrongs to which princes are instigated by "money"; for example, the heavy taxes, which were the occasion of Rehoboam losing ten tribes (1Ki 12:4, &c.).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ecclesiastes/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The design and effect of feasting and drinking wine is, that men may exhilarate their minds with the society of their friends, and with the use of the creatures. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Money answereth all things; </span> it procures not only meat and drink for feasting, but for all other things; as the heavens are said to answer the earth, when they give it those showers which it desires and needs to make it fruitful, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-21.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in that day, I will hear, said the LORD, I will hear the heavens, and they shall hear the earth;">Hosea 2:21</a></span>. And this clause seems to be added as an aggravation of the sin and folly of luxury, because princes do thereby waste that money and treasure which is so highly necessary for the support and preservation of themselves, and of their kingdoms, and are forced to squeeze money out of their people by oppressive, and dishonourable, and dangerous practices, that they may have more to spend in riotous courses. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/ecclesiastes/10.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>A feast is made for laughter,.... Or, "who make bread for laughter" (i). Not bakers, who make bread for common use, and for all sorts of persons, sorrowful ones as others; but luxurious men, particularly such princes as are before described; they "make bread", that is, a feast, as the phrase is used, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/5-1.htm">Daniel 5:1</a>; not for mere refreshment, but to promote mirth and gaiety to an excessive degree; being attended with rioting and drunkenness, chambering and wantonness, with revellings and dancing; <p>and wine maketh merry; or, "and they prepare wine" (k); which is provided in plenty at feasts; and which is sometimes put for a feast itself, and called a banquet of wine, <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/7-2.htm">Esther 7:2</a>; which wine makes merry, and men drink of it till they become drunk with it, at such profuse feasts: or, "which maketh life cheerful" (l); as it does, when moderately used: "cheers the living"; so Aben Ezra; <p>but money answereth all things; is in the room of all things, and by it men obtain everything they want and wish for; it answers the requests of all, and supplies them with what they stand in need of, or can desire: particularly such expensive feasts, and sumptuous entertainments, are made by means of money; and, in this luxurious way, the coffers of princes are drained, and they are obliged to raise new levies, and impose new taxes upon their subjects, to the oppression of them. Or else the sense may be, that princes should consider, and not be so profuse in their manner of living, but be more frugal and careful of the public money, and lay it up against a time of need; since it is that that answers all things, is the sinew of war when that arises, and will procure men and arms, to secure and protect them from their enemies, and obtain peace and safety for them and their subjects, which otherwise they cannot expect. <p>(i)   "ad risum facientes panem", Montanus; "faciunt panem", Paganinus, Mercerus, Piscator.

If these are in thy house pray for what thou wilt and it shall be thine,” and Horace:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Scilicet uxorem cum dote, fidemque, et amicos,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Et genus, et formam, regina pecunia donat;<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Ac bene nummatum decorat Suadela Venusque.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“Seek’st thou a dowried wife, or friends, or trust,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Beauty or rank, Queen Money gives thee all;<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Put money in thy purse, and thou shalt lack<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Nor suasive power nor comeliness of form.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Epp.</span> i. 6. 36–38.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The truer rendering of the Hebrew, however, gives not so much a maxim as the statement of a fact and is entirely in harmony with the preceding verses. <span class="bld">For revelry they</span> (<span class="ital">i.e.</span> “man,” indefinitely) <span class="bld">prepare food</span> (literally, <span class="bld">bread</span>) <span class="bld">and wine that rejoices life, and money answereth all things</span>, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> meets all they want. The words obviously point to the conduct of the luxurious and slothful princes condemned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-16.htm" title="Woe to you, O land, when your king is a child, and your princes eat in the morning!">Ecclesiastes 10:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-18.htm" title="By much slothfulness the building decays; and through idleness of the hands the house drops through.">Ecclesiastes 10:18</a>. Regardless of their duty as rulers and of the sufferings of their people, they aim only at self-indulgence and they look to money, however gained, as the means of satisfying their desires. So, in our own times, Armenians or Fellaheen may die by thousands of famine or pestilence, but the palaces of the Sultan and the Khedive are as full of luxury and magnificence as ever. The State may be bankrupt and creditors unpaid, but they manage somehow to get what they want. The money which they squeeze out from a starving province is for them as the God they worship who grants all they wish.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A feast is made for laughter, and wine maketh merry</span>. Here is a cause of the decay spoken of above. The rulers spend in revelry and debauchery the time and energy which they ought to give to affairs of state. More literally, <span class="accented">for merriment they make bread, and wine</span> [<span class="accented">that</span>] <span class="accented">cheereth life</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> they use God's good gifts of bread and wine as means of intemperance and thoughtless pleasure. So a psalmist speaks of wine as making glad the heart of man (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-15.htm">Psalm 104:15</a>); and Ben-Sira says, "Wine is as good as life to a man, if it be drunk moderately: what life is there to a man that is without wine? for it was created to make men glad. Wine measurably drunk and in season bringeth gladness of the heart, and cheer fullness of the mind" (Ecclus. 31. [34.] 27, 28). <span class="cmt_word">But money answereth all things</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> grants all that such persons want. It requires money to provide rich food and costly wines; this they possess, and they are thus able to indulge their appetites to the utmost. It concerns them not how such resources are obtained - won by extortion from a starving people, exacted in exorbitant taxation, pillaged by unscrupulous instruments; they want gold to expend on their lusts, and they get it same-how, and with it all that in their view makes life worth living. Commentators alto Horace, ' Ep.,' 1:6.36, "Scilicet uxorem," etc. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"For why - a portioned wife, fair fame, and friends,<br />Beauty and birth on sovereign Wealth attends.<br />Blest is her votary throned his bags among?<br />Persuasion's self sits perched upon his tongue;<br />Love beams in every feature of his face,<br />And every gesture beams celestial grace."</span><br /><br />(<span class="note_acc">Howes.</span>) Corn. a Lapide appositely quotes - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"...quidquid nummis praesentibus opta,<br />Et veniet; clausum possidet arca Jovem."</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"If thou hast gold, then wish for anything,<br />And it will surely come; the money-box<br />Hath in it a most potent deity."</span> Pineda, followed by Metals, suggests that this verse may be taken in a good sense. He would make ver. 18 correspond to ver. 16, characterizing the government of debauchees, and ver. 19 correspond to ver. 17, representing the rule of temperate princes where all is peace and prosperity. But there is nothing grammatical to indicate this arrangement; and the explanation given above is doubtless correct. The Septuagint Version is not faithful in our present text, though it is followed virtually by the Syriac: <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3ca;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> "For gladness they make bread and wine and oil, that the living may rejoice, and to money all things will humble themselves, will obey" (doubly translating the word). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ecclesiastes/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness; and the end of his mouth is mischievous madness." From folly (absurdity) the words which are heard from a fool's mouth rise to madness, which is compounded of presumption, wantonness, and frenzy, and which, in itself a symptom of mental and moral depravity, brings as its consequence destruction on himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/18-17.htm">Proverbs 18:17</a>). The adjective &#1512;&#1506;&#1492; is as in &#1512;&#1506; &#1495;&#1500;&#1497;, which interchanges with &#1512;&#1506;&#1492; &#1495;&#1493; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/6-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:2</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/5-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:12</a>, etc. The end of his mouth, viz., of his speaking, is  equals  the end of the words of his mouth, viz., the end which they at last reach. Instead of holeloth, there is here, with the adj. following, holeluth, with the usual ending of abstracta. The following proverb says how the words of the fool move between these two poles of folly and wicked madness: he speaks much, and as if he knew all things. </body></html>
