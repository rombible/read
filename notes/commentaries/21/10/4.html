The wrath of the civil magistrate, the chief ruler of the land, the sovereign prince or king, to whom men are and should be subject: if his wrath on any occasion breaks out in a furious manner, and, like a storm and tempest, is very blustering and threatening: <p>leave not thy place; at court; thine office under the prince, do not throw it up in a passion, and quit his service upon it; and much less forget thy duty and allegiance to him, and go into disloyalty and rebellion; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-3.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:3</a>; <p>for yielding pacifieth great offences; bearing his anger patiently, submitting to his displeasure quietly, making no returns, or at least giving soft answers, and behaving in a modest and humble manner; in time his wrath will subside, and he will be pacified, and forgive the offences committed; or be convinced that there were none, or however not so great as to require such resentment; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-1.htm">Proverbs 15:1</a>. The Targum is, <p>"if a spirit of evil concupiscence rules over thee; thy good place, in which thou wert used to stand, leave not:'' <p>some understand this of a man's having a spirit of rule and government coming upon him, or of his being advanced to power and authority, that then he should not forget the low estate in which he had been. Jarchi interprets it of the spirit of the governor of the world, strictly inquiring into the actions of men; and healing their sins by chastisements, which cause them to leave them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/ecclesiastes/10.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">If the <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> spirit of the ruler riseth against thee, leave not thy place; for yielding pacifieth great offences.</span><p>(c) If your superior is angry with you, be discrete and not moved.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/ecclesiastes/10.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">4</span>. <span class="ital">If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee</span>] To the picture of the boastful self-assertion of the fool is appended as a contrast, that of the self-effacement of the wise. The scene brought before us is that of a statesman, or minister, whose advice runs counter to that of the ruler. The “spirit,” what we should call the “temper,” of the latter “rises up” against the former. What shall the adviser do? His natural impulse is to “leave his place,” <span class="ital">i. e.</span> either to cut short his interview, or, resign his office. He won’t be slighted, will not put up with contradiction. That, however, is precisely what the wise of heart will not do. <span class="ital">Yielding, i. e.</span> the temper of conciliation (the Hebrew noun is literally the <span class="ital">healing</span>, or the <span class="ital">healthy, mood of mind</span>) <span class="ital">puts to rest,</span> or <span class="ital">puts a stop to, great offences</span>. The history of all nations, our own included, presents manifold instances of both modes of action, sometimes, as in the case of Chatham’s behaviour to George III., in the same statesman at different times, sometimes in the attitude of rival statesmen towards the same sovereign. Interpreters after their manner, seeing either the golden or the silver side of the shields, have referred the last words either to the angry acts of the ruler, or to the sins of rebellion in the minister. It can scarcely be questioned, however, that the proverb includes both. The maxim has its parallel in our English proverb, “Least said is soonest mended.”<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 4-7.</span> - Section 12. <span class="accented">Illustration of the conduct of wisdom under capricious rulers</span>, or when fools are exalted to high stations. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee</span>. "Spirit" (<span class="accented">ruach</span>) is here equivalent to "anger," as <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-3.htm">Judges 8:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/29-11.htm">Proverbs 29:11</a>. The idea seems to be that a statesman or councilor gives wise advice to a monarch, which the latter takes in bad part, and shows strong resentment against the person who offered it. Now, when a man knows himself to be in the right, and yet finds his counsel rejected, perhaps with scorn and reproach added, he is naturally prone to feel sore, and to show by some overt act his sense of the ill treatment which he has received. But what says wisdom? <span class="cmt_word">Leave not thy place</span> (<span class="accented">makom</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> position, pest, office. Do not hastily resign the situation at court to which you have been appointed. Some, not so suitably, take the expression, "leave thy place," figuratively, as equivalent to "give way to anger, renounce the temper which becomes you, lose your self-possession." But Wright, from the analogous use of <span class="accented">matstsale</span> and <span class="accented">maamad</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-19.htm">Isaiah 22:19</a>, confirms the interpretation which we have adopted. Compare the advice in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-3.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:3</a>, where, however, the idea is rather of open rebellion than of a resentment which shows itself by withdrawal. Origen ('De Princip.,' 3:2) explained "the spirit of the ruler" to be the evil spirit; and Gregory, commenting on this passage, writes ('Moral.,' 3:43), "As though he had said in plain words, 'If thou perceivest the spirit of the tempter to prevail against thee in aught, quit not the lowliness of penitence;' and that it was the abasement of penitence that he called 'our place,' he shows by the words that follow, 'for healing [Vulgate] pacifieth great offences.' For what else is the humility of mourning, save the remedy of sin?" (Oxford transl.). <span class="cmt_word">For yielding pacifieth great offenses</span>. <span class="accented">Marpe</span>, "yielding," is rendered "healing" by the versions. Thus <span class="greek">&#x1f34;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> (Septuagint); <span class="accented">euratio</span> (Vulgate). But this translation is not so suitable as that of Symmachus, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>, "moderation." The word is used in the sense of" gentleness," "meekness," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-30.htm">Proverbs 14:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-4.htm">Proverbs 15:4</a>; and the gnome expresses the truth that a calm, conciliating spirit, not prone to take offence, but patient under trying circumstances, obviates great sins. The sins are those of the subject. This quiet resignation saves him from conspiracy, rebellion, treason, etc., into which his untempered resentment might hurry him. We may compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-1.htm">Proverbs 15:1</a> and Proverbs 25:15; and Horace, 'Cam.,' 3. 3, "Justum et tenacem propositi virum," etc. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"The man whose soul is firm and strong,<br />Bows not to any tyrant's frown,<br />And on the rabble's clamorous throng<br />In proud disdain looks coldly down."</span><br /><br />(<span class="note_acc">Stanley.</span>) They who regard the "offenses" as those of the ruler explain them to mean oppression and injustice; but it seems plain from the run of the sentence that the minister, not the monarch, is primarily in the mind of the writer, though, of course, it is quite true that the submission of the former might save the ruler from the commission of some wrong. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ecclesiastes/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"And I:said: Better is wisdom than strength; but the wisdom of the poor is despised, and his words are not heard." With the words, "I saw," the author introduces his observations, and with "I said" his reflections. Wisdom is better than strength, since it does more for the wise man, and through him for others, than physical force, - more, as expressed in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-19.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:19</a>, than ten mighty men. But the respect which wisdom otherwise secures for a man, if it is the wisdom of a poor man, sinks into despect, to which his poverty exposes him, - if necessity arises, his service, as the above history shows, is valued; but as a rule his words are unheeded, for the crowd estimate the worth of him whom they willingly hear according to the outward respect in which he is held.<p>To the lessons gathered from experience, are now added instructive proverbs of kindred contents. </body></html>
