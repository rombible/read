But the soul, as it is not redeemed, so it is not maintained with corruptible things, as silver and gold. God sees what men do, and hears what they say in secret; and, when he pleases, brings it to light by strange and unsuspected ways. If there be hazard in secret thoughts and whispers against earthly rulers, what must be the peril from every deed, word, or thought of rebellion against the King of kings, and Lord of lords!

Not so much in age; though it is sometimes an unhappiness to a nation to be governed by a minor, especially if the young king has not good tutors, guardians, ministers, and counsellors, about him; but, if otherwise, a nation may be very happy under a minority, or the government of a young prince; such were Solomon, Joash, Uzziah, Josiah, and our Edward VI: but it rather respects one that is a child in understanding and judgment, in manners and conduct; that minds his pleasures, as children their play; is fickle and changeable, passionate and self-willed, unskilful in government, and yet will not be advised. The Targum applies this to the land of Israel, and instances in wicked Jeroboam, who made the morning sacrifice to cease; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-12.htm">Isaiah 3:12</a>. From considering the bad effects of folly in men in general, in private persons and in subjects, the wise man proceeds to observe the ill consequences of it to a nation, in kings and princes, in civil magistrates: Jerom or Bede interprets this allegorically: Woe to the land whose king is the devil, who is always desirous of new things, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-4.htm">2 Corinthians 4:4</a>; <p>and thy princes eat in the morning; as soon as they are up, children like; and not only eat, which may be convenient and lawful to do; but eat to excess, in a riotous and intemperate manner, and so unfit themselves for any service all the day: the "morning" is particularly observed, because the fittest time for consultation about the affairs of government; and was the usual time of sitting in judgment and trying causes, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-12.htm">Jeremiah 21:12</a>; and also for acts of religion and devotion. And so the Targum, <p>"and thy princes eat bread before they offer the daily morning sacrifice.'' <p>Sad is the case of a nation, when not only their king is a minor, or a foolish one; but when his tutors and guardians, or his ministers of state and counsellors, give up themselves to sensual pleasures, and neglect public affairs; and, instead of being in the council chamber, or in a court of judicature, or at their early devotions, are indulging themselves in riotous eating and drinking. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/ecclesiastes/10.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Woe to thee, O land, when thy king <i>is</i> a <span class="cverse3">{h}</span> child, and thy princes <span class="cverse3">{i}</span> eat in the morning!</span><p>(h) That is, without wisdom and counsel.<p>(i) Are given to their lusts and pleasures.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 16-20.</span> - Section 15. Koheleth returns to the theme mentioned in vers. 4-7. and speaks <span class="accented">of folly in one who holds the position of king, and the need of wisdom and prudence in the subjects of an unworthy ruler</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Woe to thee, O land, when thy king is a child</span>! "Child" is <span class="accented">naar</span>, which term included any age up to manhood. Some interpret the word here, as <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> in Greek, in the sense of "slave," contrasting it with "the son of nobles" in the following verse. But it can hardly signify more than servitor, attendant; and in ver. 7 the antithesis to "prince" is <span class="accented">ebed</span>, not <span class="accented">naar</span>. The child in the present case is a youthful, inexperienced ruler, who does not realize his responsibilities, and is the tool of evil advisers. What particular instance, if any, Koheleth had in view it is impossible to say. Of course, many expositors see a reference to Rehoboam. whom, at forty years of age, his own son Abijah calls <span class="accented">naar</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-7.htm">2 Chronicles 13:7</a>), and who was certainly childish in his conduct (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-1.htm">1 Kings 12:1-14</a>). Hitzig connects the passage with the reign of Ptolemy Epiphanes, who was but five years old at the death of his father,  <span class="date">B.C. 205</span>, the reins of government being assumed by Agathocles and his sister Agathoclea, who occasioned serious disasters to the laud. To support this opinion, the date of our book has to be considerably reduced (see Introduction). It is best to take the gnome as a general expression, like that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-12.htm">Isaiah 3:12</a>, "As for my people, children are their oppressors, and women rule over them." <span class="cmt_word">Thy princes eat in the morning.</span> Eating here implies feasting and banqueting, beginning the day with sensual enjoyment instead of such honest work as attending to state matters, administering justice, etc., as becomes good rulers. None but profligates would thus spend the early morning. "These are not drunken, as ye suppose; seeing it is but the third hour of the day," says St. Peter, repudiating the charge of intoxication (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-15.htm">Acts 2:15</a>). "Woe unto them," cries Isaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-11.htm">Isaiah 5:11</a>), "that rise up early in the morning, that they may follow strong drink!" Even the heathen censured such debauchery. Cicero thus abuses Antonius: "At quam multos dies in ea villa turpissime es per-bacchatus. Ab hora tertia bibebatur, ludebatur, vomebatur" ('Philipp.,' 2:41). Curtius (5. 7. 2) reprehends" de die convivia inire." The Greeks had a proverb to denote abnormal sensuality, <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3c6;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ecclesiastes/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"If the iron has become blunt, and he has not whetted the face, then he must give more strength to the effort; but wisdom has the superiority in setting right." This proverb of iron, i.e., iron instruments (&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1494;&#1500;, from &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1494;, to pierce, like the Arab. name for iron, hadi&#770;d, means essentially something pointed), is one of the most difficult in the Book of Koheleth, - linguistically the most difficult, because scarcely anywhere else are so many peculiar and unexampled forms of words to be found. The old translators afford no help for the understanding of it. The advocates of the hypothesis of a Dialogue have here a support in &#1488;&#1501;, which may be rendered interrogatively; but where would we find, syntactically as well as actually, the answer? Also, the explanations which understand &#1495;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; in the sense of war-troops, armies, which is certainly its nearest-lying meaning, bring out no appropriate thought; for the thought that even blunt iron, as far as it is not externally altogether spoiled (lo-phanim qilqal), or: although it has not a sharpened edge (Rashi, Rashbam), might be an equipment for an army, or gain the victory, would, although it were true, not fit the context; Ginsburg explains: If the axe be blunt, and he (who goes out against the tyrant) do not sharpen it beforehand (phanim, after Jerome, for lephanim, which is impossible, and besides leads to nothing, since lephanim means ehedem formerly, but not zuvor [prius], Ewald, 220a), he (the tyrant) only increases his army; on the contrary, wisdom hath the advantage by repairing the mischief (without the war being unequal); - but the "ruler" of the foregoing group has here long ago disappeared, and it is only a bold imagination which discovers in the hu of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:10</a> the person addressed in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:4</a>, and represents him as a rebel, and augments him into a warlike force, but recklessly going forth with unwhetted swords. The correct meaning for the whole, in general at least, is found if, after the example of Abulwald and Kimchi, we interpret &#1495;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; of the increasing of strength, the augmenting of the effort of strength, not, as Aben-Ezra, of conquering, outstripping, surpassing; &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; means to make strong, to strengthen, <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/10-6.htm">Zechariah 10:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/10-12.htm">Zechariah 10:12</a>; and &#1495;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, as plur. of &#1495;&#1497;&#1500;, strength, is supported by &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497; &#1495;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-5.htm">1 Chronicles 7:5</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-7.htm">1 Chronicles 7:7</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-11.htm">1 Chronicles 7:11</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-40.htm">1 Chronicles 7:40</a>, the plur. of &#1495;&#1497;&#1500; &#1490;&#1489;&#1493;&#1512;; the lxx renders by &#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9; and he shall strengthen the forces, and the Peshito has &#1495;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497; for &#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-13.htm">Acts 8:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-11.htm">Acts 19:11</a> (cf. Chald. Syr. &#1488;&#1514;&#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1500;, to strengthen oneself, to become strengthened). Thus understanding the words &#1497;&#1490; &#1497;&#1495; of intentio virium, and that not with reference to sharpening (Luth., Grotius), but to the splitting of wood, etc. (Geier, Desvoeux, Mendelss.), all modern interpreters, with the exception of a few who lose themselves on their own path, gain the thought, that in all undertakings wisdom hath the advantage in the devising of means subservient to an end. The diversities in the interpretation of details leave the essence of this thought untouched. Hitz., Bttch., Zckl., Lange, and others make the wood-splitter, or, in general, the labourer, the subject to &#1511;&#1492;&#1492;, referring &#1493;&#1492;&#1493;&#1488; to the iron, and contrary to the accents, beginning the apodosis with qilqal: "If he (one) has made the iron blunt, and it is without an edge, he swings it, and applies his strength."<p>&#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, "without an edge" (lo for belo), would be linguistically as correct as &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; &#1500;&#1488;, "without children," <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-30.htm">1 Chronicles 2:30</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-32.htm">1 Chronicles 2:32</a>; Ewald, 286b; and qilqal would have a meaning in some measure supported by <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-26.htm">Ezekiel 21:26</a>. But granting that qilqal, which there signifies "to shake," may be used of the swinging of an axe (for which we may refer to the Aethiop. k&#803;ualk&#803;uala, k&#803;alk&#803;ala, of the swinging of a sword), yet &#1511;&#1500;&#1511;&#1500;&#1493; (&#1488;&#1514;&#1493; &#1511;&#1500;&#1511;&#1500;) could have been used, and, besides, &#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; means, not like &#1508;&#1497;, the edge, but, as a somewhat wider idea, the front, face (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-21.htm">Ezekiel 21:21</a>; cf. Assyr. pan ilippi, the forepart of a ship); "it has no edge" would have been expressed by (&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1508;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;) &#1508;&#1468;&#1492; &#1500;&#1488; &#1493;&#1492;&#1493;&#1488;, or by &#1502;&#1500;&#1496;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473; &#1488;&#1497;&#1504;&#1504;&#1493; &#1493;&#1492;&#1493;&#1488; (&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1491;, &#1502;&#1493;&#1512;&#1496;). We therefore translate: if the iron has become blunt, hebes factum sit (for the Pih. of intransitives has frequently the meaning of an inchoative or desiderative stem, like &#1502;&#1506;&#1514;, to become little, decrescere, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-3.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:3</a>; &#1499;&#1468;&#1492;&#1492;, hebescere, caligare, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-12.htm">Ezekiel 21:12</a>; Ewald, 120c), and he (who uses it) has not polished (whetted) the face of it, he will (must) increase the force. &#1493;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; does not refer to the iron, but, since there was no reason to emphasize the sameness of the subject (as e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-30.htm">2 Chronicles 32:30</a>), to the labourer, and thus makes, as with the other explanation, the change of subject noticeable (as e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-1.htm">2 Chronicles 26:1</a>). The order of the words &#1511;&#1500; ... &#1493;&#1492;, et ille non faciem (ferri) exacuit, is as at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-9.htm">Isaiah 53:9</a>; cf. also the position of lo in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-34.htm">2 Samuel 3:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-29.htm">Numbers 16:29</a>.<p>&#1511;&#1500;&#1511;&#1500;, or pointed with Pattach instead of Tsere (cf. qarqar, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-17.htm">Numbers 24:17</a>) in bibl. usage, from the root-meaning levem esse, signifies to move with ease, i.e., quickness (as also in the Arab. and Aethiop.), to shake (according to which the lxx and Syr. render it by &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, &#1491;&#1468;&#1500;&#1495;, to shake, and thereby to trouble, make muddy); in the Mishn. usage, to make light, little, to bring down, to destroy; here it means to make light  equals  even and smooth (the contrast of rugged and notched), a meaning the possibility of which is warranted by &#1504;&#1495; &#1511;&#1500;&#1500;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-7.htm">Ezekiel 1:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-6.htm">Daniel 10:6</a> (which is compared by Jewish lexicographers and interpreters), which is translated by all the old translators "glittering brass," and which, more probably than Ewald's "to steel" (temper), is derived from the root qal, to burn, glow.<p>(Note: Regarding the two roots, vid., Fried.

Hitzig, Elster, and Zckl. incorrectly translate: "and it is a profit wisely to handle wisdom;" for instead of the inf. absol. &#1492;&#1498;, they unnecessarily read the inf. constr. &#1492;&#1499;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1512;, and connect &#1495;&#1499;&#1502;&#1492; &#1492;&#1499;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1512;, which is a phrase altogether unparalleled. Hichsir means to set in the right position (vid., above, kaser), and the sentence will thus mean: the advantage which the placing rightly of the means serviceable to an end affords, is wisdom - i.e., wisdom bears this advantage in itself, brings it with it, concretely: a wise man is he who reflects upon this advantage. It is certainly also possible that &#1492;&#1499;&#1513;&#1473;, after the manner of the Hiph. &#1492;&#1510;&#1500;&#1497;&#1495; and &#1492;&#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1497;&#1500;, directly means "to succeed," or causatively: "to make to succeed." We might explain, as e.g., Knobel: the advantage of success, or of the causing of prosperity, is wisdom, i.e., it is that which secures this gain. But the meaning prevalent in post-bibl. Heb. of making fit, equipping, - a predisposition corresponding to a definite aim or result, - is much more conformable to the example from which the porisma is deduced. Buxtorf translates the Hiph. as a Mishnic word by aptare, rectificare. Tyler suggests along with "right guidance" the meaning "pre-arrangement," which we prefer.<p>(Note: Also the twofold Haggadic explanation, Taanith 8a, gives to hachshir the meaning of "to set,  priori, in the right place." Luther translated qilqal twice correctly, but further follows the impossible rendering of Jerome: multo labore exacuetur, et post industriam sequetur sapientia.) </body></html>
