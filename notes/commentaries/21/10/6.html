Do not, in a passion, quit thy post of duty; wait awhile, and thou wilt find that yielding pacifies great offences. Men are not preferred according to their merit. And those are often most forward to offer help, who are least aware of the difficulties, or the consequences. The same remark is applied to the church, or the body of Christ, that all the members should have the same care one for another.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ecclesiastes/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The "evil" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:5</a> is here specified as that caprice of a king by which an unworthy favorite of low origin is promoted to successive dignities, while a noble person is degraded or neglected. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ecclesiastes/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. rich&#8212;not in mere wealth, but in wisdom, as the antithesis to "folly" (for "foolish men") shows.

Or "in great heights" (q); in high places of honour and truest; even foolish and wicked men; men of poor extraction, of low life, and of mean abilities and capacities; and, which is worse, men vile and vicious, as Doeg the Edomite, Haman the Amalekite, and others; <p>and the rich sit in low places; men not only of fortune and estates, and above doing mean and little actions, and so more fit for such high places; but men rich in wisdom and knowledge, of large capacities and of great endowments of mind, and so abundantly qualified for posts in the administration of government; and, above all, men rich in grace, fearing God, and hating coveteousness, as rulers ought to be, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/18-21.htm">Exodus 18:21</a>; and yet these sometimes are neglected, live in obscurity, who might otherwise be very useful in public life.

Such men, like the <span class="greekheb">ἀρχαιόπλουτοι</span> (the “men of ancestral wealth”) of Greek political writers, (Aristot. <span class="ital">Rhet</span>. ii. 9; Aesch. <span class="ital">Agam</span>. 1043) a wise ruler associates with himself as counsellors. The tyrant, on the other hand, like Louis XI. exalts the baseborn to the place of honour, or like Edward II. or James I. of England, or Henry III. of France, lavishes dignities on his minions. So the writer may have seen Agathoclea and her brother; all-powerful, as mistress and favourite, in the court of Ptolemy Philopator (Justin xxx. 1).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in low place</span>. This is an instance of the error intimated in the preceding verse. A tyrannical ruler exalts incompetent persons, unworthy favorites, to "great heights" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, Septuagint), as it is literally - puts them into eminent positions. "Folly" is abstract for concrete, "fools." <span class="accented">And the rich sit in low place</span>. "The rich" (<span class="accented">ushirim</span>) are not simply those who have wealth, however obtained, but men of noble birth; <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, as Plumptre appositely notes, persons of ancestral wealth, who from natural position might be looked upon as rulers of men. Such men would seek eminent stations, not from base motives of gain, but from an honorable ambition, and yet they are often slighted by unworthy princes and kept in low estate (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-7.htm">1 Samuel 2:7, 8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-10.htm">Proverbs 19:10</a>; Ecclus. 11:5, 6). The experience mentioned in this and the following verses could scarcely have been Solomon's, though it has been always common enough in the East, where the most startling changes have been made, the lowest persons have been suddenly raised to eminence, mistresses and favorites loaded with dignities, and oppression of the rich has been systematically pursued. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ecclesiastes/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The following proverb also leans on the history above narrated: "Better is wisdom than weapons of war; and one sinner destroyeth much good."

This is a synthetic distich whose two parts may be interpreted independently.
