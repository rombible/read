The babbler's tongue is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison; and contradiction only makes it the more violent. We must find the way to keep him gentle. But by rash, unprincipled, or slanderous talk, he brings open or secret vengeance upon himself. Would we duly consider our own ignorance as to future events, it would cut off many idle words which we foolishly multiply. Fools toil a great deal to no purpose. They do not understand the plainest things, such as the entrance into a great city. But it is the excellency of the way to the heavenly city, that it is a high-way, in which the simplest wayfaring men shall not err, Isa 25:8.

Or "grace" (u). He speaks kind and good things in favour of the characters of men, and not as the babbling detractor: he speaks well of civil magistrates and rulers in the state; of the ministers of the word in the church; and of all his fellow creatures, as far as can with truth be said: and a truly good and gracious man, who is Solomon's wise man, in opposition to a fool and wicked man; his discourse will run upon the grace of God, upon the doctrines of grace, and upon the experience of the truth of grace on his heart: upon the grace of God the Father, in loving and choosing men; in contriving their salvation; in making a covenant of grace with them in Christ; in sending him to die for them, and in accepting his satisfaction and righteousness for them: and on the grace of the Son, in becoming their surety; assuming their nature, dying in their room and stead, interceding for them, taking care of them, and supplying them with grace out of his fulness: and on the grace of the Spirit, in regeneration and sanctification; working in them faith, hope, and love; applying precious promises to them, and sealing them up to the day of redemption: of these things they speak often one to another, and cannot but talk of the things they have felt and seen: and such words and discourses are gracious, graceful, and grateful to truly pious souls, and minister grace unto them; and are also well pleasing and acceptable to God and Christ, as well as gain them favour among men; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/22-11.htm">Proverbs 22:11</a>; <p>but the lips of a fool swallow up himself; his words are not only able and displeasing to others, but bring ruin upon himself; by talking too freely of rulers and others, he brings himself into trouble, and plunges himself into difficulties, out of which he cannot easily get; yea, is swallowed up in them, and destroyed. Or, his "lips swallow up him" (w); the wise man, whose words are gracious; and, by his calumny and detraction, his deceit and lies, brings him into disgrace and danger: or, "swallows it up", or "that" (x); the grace of the wise man, or his gracious words; and hinders the edification of others by them, and the good effects of them.

In “are gracious” (literally <span class="bld">are grace itself</span>) we find a parallel to the “gracious words” (literally <span class="bld">words of grace</span>) of <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-22.htm" title="And all bore him witness, and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth.

They describe the quality in speech which wins favour, what the Greeks called the <span class="greekheb">ἠθικὴ πίστις</span> (<span class="ital">moral suasion</span>), which conciliates the good will of the hearers (Aristot. <span class="ital">Rhet</span>. i. 2, § 3).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the lips of a fool will swallow up himself</span>] The English version rightly preserves the vivid force of the original, instead of weakly paraphrasing it by “destroy” or “consume.” Who has not heard orators who, while they thought they were demolishing their opponents, were simply demolishing themselves, swallowing up their own reputation for honesty or consistency, greeted by the ironical cheers of their opponents, while those of their own party listen in speechless dismay? Our own familiar phrase, when we speak of an imprudent orator having “to eat his own words,” expresses another aspect of the same idea.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12-15.</span> - Section 14.

The word &#1492;&#1505;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500; (with double seghol, Aram. &#1505;&#1499;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;) is used here instead of those in whom it is personified. Elsewhere a multiplicity of things great, such as &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, &#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, and the like, is heightened by &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; (cf. e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-17.htm">Psalm 18:17</a>); here "great heights" are such as are of a high, or the highest degree; rabbim, instead of harabbim, is more appos. than adject. (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/43-14.htm">Genesis 43:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-28.htm">Psalm 68:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/143-10.htm">Psalm 143:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-21.htm">Jeremiah 2:21</a>), in the sense of "many" (e.g., Ginsburg: "in many high positions") it mixes with the poetry of the description dull prose.<p>(Note: Luzz. reads &#1504;&#1514;&#1503;: "Folly brings many into high places." The order of the words, however, does not favour this.)<p>Ashirim also is peculiarly used: divites  equals  nobiles (cf. &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1506;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-5.htm">Isaiah 32:5</a>), those to whom their family inheritance gives a claim to a high station, who possess the means of training themselves for high offices, which they regard as places of honour, not as sources of gain. Regibus multis, Grotius here remarks, quoting from Sallust and Tacitus, suspecti qui excellunt sive sapientia sive nobilitate aut opibus. Hence it appears that the relation of slaves and princes to each other is suggested; hoc discrimen, says Justin, 41:3, of the Parthians, inter servos liberosque est quod servi pedibus, liberi nonnisi equis incedunt; this distinction is set aside, princes must walk 'al-haare&#780;ts, i.e., beregel (beragle&#772;he&#780;m), and in their stead (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-25.htm">Jeremiah 17:25</a>) slaves sit high on horseback, and rule over them (the princes), - an offensive spectacle, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-10.htm">Proverbs 19:10</a>. The eunuch Bagoas, long all-powerful at the Persian Court, is an example of the evil consequences of this reversal of the natural relations of men. </body></html>
