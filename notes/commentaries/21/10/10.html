More force has then to be used in both cases; but "force" without judgment "endangers" one's self. Translate, "If one hath blunted his iron" [Maurer]. The preference of rash to judicious counsellors, which entailed the pushing of matters by force, proved to be the "hurt" of Rehoboam (1Ki 12:1-33).<p>wisdom is profitable to direct&#8212;to a prosperous issue.

The axe (literally, <span class="bld">the iron</span>) is used to cut wood. What if it fail to cut (<span class="ital">i. e.</span> if, going below the imagery, the man has not the sharpness or strength to carry his plans promptly into effect), <span class="bld">if he</span> (the cutter down of trees) <span class="bld">has not sharpened its edge</span>, literally <span class="bld">its face</span> as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-21.htm" title="For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination: he made his arrows bright, he consulted with images, he looked in the liver.">Ezekiel 21:21</a>, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> if he has entered on his plans without due preparation. In that case he must “put to more strength,” must increase his force (<span class="ital">i. e.</span> the impact of his stroke). He will have to do by the iteration of main force what might have been effected by sagacity and finesse. So interpreted, the whole imagery is consistent. The man who enters on the perilous enterprise of reform or revolution has to face not only the danger that he may perish in the attempt, but the risk of failure through the disproportion of his resources to his ends. The meaning of the proverb would be clear to any one who united the character of an expert in felling timber with the experience of a political reformer. Briefly paraphrased, the maxim would run thus in colloquial English, “If you must cut down trees, take care that you sharpen your axe.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">but wisdom is profitable to direct</span>] Better, <span class="bld">But it is a gain to use wisdom with success</span>, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> It is better to sharpen the axe than to go on hammering with a blunt one, better to succeed by skill and tact than by mere brute strength.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If the iron be blunt, and he do not whet the edge</span>. The illustration at the end of the last verse is continued. The "iron" is the axe used in cutting wood; if this be blunted by the work to which it is put, and he, the laborer, has not sharpened the edge (Hebrew, <span class="accented">the face</span>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-1.htm">Ezekiel 21:1</a>), what is the consequence? How is he to carry on his work? <span class="cmt_word">Then must he put to more strength</span>. He must put more force in his blows, he must make up for the want of edge by added power and weight. This is the simplest explanation of the passage, which contains many linguistic difficulties. These may be seen discussed at length in the commentaries of Delitzsch, Wright, Nowack, etc. The translation of Ginsburg is not commendable, "If the axe be blunt, and he (the tyrant's opponent)do not sharpen it beforehand (<span class="accented">phanim</span>, taken as an adverb of time), he (the tyrant) shall only increase the army."

Wisdom teaches how to conduct matters to a successful termination; for instance, it prompts the worker to sharpen his tool instead of trying to accomplish his task by an exertion of mere brute strength. The gnome applies to all the instances which have been mentioned above. Wisdom alone enables a man to meet and overcome the dangers and difficulties which beset his social, common, and political life. If we apply the whole sentence to the case of disaffection with the government or open rebellion, the caution given would signify  - See that your means are adequate to the end, that your resources are sufficient to conduct your enterprise to success.

Luther connects <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:4</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-3.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:3</a> by "therefore;" for by the potentate he understands such an one as, himself a fool, holds all who contradict him to be fools: then it is best to let his folly rage on. But the &#1502;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500; is a different person from the &#1505;&#1499;&#1500;; and &#1502;&#1511; &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1495; does not mean, "let not yourself get into a passion," or, as he more accurately explains in the Annotationes: "remain self-possessed" (similarly Hitzig: lose not thy mental state of composure), but, in conformity with &#1514;&#1500;&#1498; ... &#1488;&#1500;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-3.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:3</a>, "forsake not the post (synon. &#1502;&#1510;&#1468;&#1489; and &#1502;&#1506;&#1502;&#1491;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-19.htm">Isaiah 22:19</a>, cf. 23) which thou hast received." The person addressed is thus represented not merely as a subject, but officially as a subordinate officer: if the ruler's displeasure (&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;, as at <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-3.htm">Judges 8:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/29-11.htm">Proverbs 29:11</a>) rises up against him (&#1506;&#1500;&#1492;, as elsewhere; cf. &#1488;&#1507;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-21.htm">Psalm 73:21</a>; or &#1495;&#1502;&#1492;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-20.htm">2 Samuel 11:20</a>), he ought not, in the consciousness that he does not merit his displeasure, hastily give up his situation which has been entrusted to him and renounce submission; for patience, gentleness (regarding &#1502;&#1512;&#1508;&#1468;&#1488;, vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-18.htm">Proverbs 12:18</a>) '&#1490;&#1468;&#1491; ... '&#1497;&#1503;.<p>This concluding clause of the verse is usually translated: "It appeaseth (pacifieth) great sins" (lxx &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;, Symm. &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;). The phrase (&#1495;&#1502;&#1492;) &#1488;&#1507; &#1492;&#1504;&#1497;&#1495; is not to be compared, for it signifies quieting by an exhausting outbreak; on the contrary, &#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1495; in the passage before us must signify quieting, as the preventing of an outbreak (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-1.htm">Proverbs 15:1</a>). It appears more correct to render &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;&#1495; in both cases in the sense of &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3bd;, missum facere: to leave great sins is  equals  not to commit them, to give up the lust thereto; for hinniahh signifies to let go, to leave off, e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-9.htm">Jeremiah 14:9</a>; and to indulge, <a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/3-8.htm">Esther 3:8</a>, here as at <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-18.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:18</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/11-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 11:6</a>, "to keep the hands from something." The great sins cannot certainly be thought of as those of the ruler; for on his part only one comes into view, if indeed, according to the old legal conception, it could be called such, viz., cruel proceeding with reference to him who wilfully withdraws from him, and thus proves his opposition; much rather we are to think of the great sins into which he who is the object of the ruler's displeasure might fall, viz., treason (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:2</a>), insubordination, self-destruction, and at the same time, since he does not stand alone, or make common cause with others who are discontented, the drawing of others into inevitable ruin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-3.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:3</a>). All these sins, into which he falls who answers wrath with wrath, patience avoids, and puts a check to them. The king's anger is perhaps justified; the admonition, however, would be otherwise expressed than by 'l-tnch mq', if it were not presupposed that it was not justified; and thus without meta'basis eis a'llo ge'nos an I-section follows the reflection regarding wise deportment as over against the king's displeasure, a section which describes from experience and from personal observation the world turned upside down in the state. </body></html>
