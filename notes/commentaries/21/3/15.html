We have the world so much in our hearts, are so taken up with thoughts and cares of worldly things, that we have neither time nor spirit to see God's hand in them. The world has not only gained possession of the heart, but has formed thoughts against the beauty of God's works. We mistake if we think we were born for ourselves; no, it is our business to do good in this life, which is short and uncertain; we have but little time to be doing good, therefore we should redeem time. Satisfaction with Divine Providence, is having faith that all things work together for good to them that love him. God doeth all, that men should fear before him. The world, as it has been, is, and will be. There has no change befallen us, nor has any temptation by it taken us, but such as is common to men.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Rather, What has been - what was before, and what shall be has been before.

That which has been from the beginning now is; that which cometh, and what shall be in the end of days, has been already, as the Targum. Jarchi interprets this of God and his attributes, which are always the same; he is the "I am that I am", <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-14.htm">Exodus 3:14</a>; the immutable and eternal Jehovah, which is, and was, and is to come, invariably the same. Or rather it designs his decrees and purposes; what has been decreed in his eternal mind is now accomplished; and what is future has been already in his decrees; nor does anything come to pass but what he has appointed. So it is interpreted, in an ancient tract (p) of the Jews, of <p>"what was before it came into the world, so that there is nothing new under the sun; now it is obliged to come into this world, as it is said, "before I formed thee in the belly, I knew thee", <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-5.htm">Jeremiah 1:5</a>.'' <p>This will also hold true of natural things, and of the identity of them; of some individuals, as the sun, moon, and stars, which are as they always were, and will be; the sun rises and sets as it used to do; and the moon increases and decreases, as it always has done; and the stars keep the same station or course, and so they ever will, as they have: the same seasons are now in their turn as heretofore, and such as will be have been already; as summer, winter, spring, autumn, seedtime, harvest, cold, heat, night, and day: the same kinds and species of creatures, that have been, are; and what will be have been already; so that there is no new thing under the sun; the same thing is here expressed as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-9.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:9</a>; <p>and God requireth that which is past; his decrees and purposes to be fulfilled, which are past in his mind; the same seasons to return which have been; and the same kinds and species of creatures to exist which have already. The words may be rendered, "and God seeketh that which is pursued", or "persecuted" (q): and accordingly the whole will bear a different sense; and the preacher may be thought to have entered upon a new subject, which he continues in some following verses, the abuse of power and authority: and the meaning then is, the same acts of injustice, violence, and persecution, have been done formerly as now, and now as formerly; and what hereafter of this kind may be, will be no other than what has been; from the beginning persecution was; Cain hated and slew his brother, because of his superior goodness; and so it always has been, is, and will be, that such who are after the flesh persecute those who are after the spirit; but God will make inquisition for blood, and require it at the hands of those that shed it; he will seek out the persecuted, and vindicate him, and, avenge his persecutor. This way the Midrash, Jarchi, and Alshech, and the Septuagint version, render the words; and so the Syriac version, "God seeketh him that is afflicted, who is driven away"; and to this agrees the Targum, <p>"and in the great day which shall be, the Lord will require the mean and poor man of the hands of the wicked that persecute him.'' <p>And what follows seems to confirm this sense. <p>(p) Tikkune Zohar Correct. 69. fol. 104. 2.((q)    "Deus quaerit propulsum, seu quod persecutionem veluti passum est", Gejerus, Schmidt. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">That which hath been is now; and that which is to be hath already been; and God <span class="cverse3">{f}</span> requireth that which is past.</span><p>(f) God only causes what which is past, to return.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">15</span>. <span class="ital">God requireth that which is past</span>] Better, <span class="bld">seeks after that which is put to flight.</span> The old thought of the uniformity of sequence in nature and in history which had before seemed oppressive in its monotony, has been balanced by the thought of God’s perfection and the beauty of His order, and by the “fear” which grows out of it. It is followed up by a new aspect of the same truth. The past is thought of as vanishing, “put to flight,” receding into the dim distance. It might seem to be passing into the abyss of oblivion, but God <span class="bld">recalls</span> it (this is obviously the meaning of “require” as used by the translators of the A. V. in its strict etymological sense), brings back the same order, or an analogous order of events, and so history repeats itself. The strange rendering adopted by the Targum and some modern interpreters, “<span class="ital">God seeks the persecuted</span>,” <span class="ital">i.e.</span> visits and protects them, though tenable as a translation, introduces an idea quite foreign to the train of thought.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That which hath been is now</span>; so Septuagint; "That which hath been made, the same remaineth" (Vulgate); better, <span class="accented">that which hath been</span>, <span class="accented">long ago it is</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. was in existence long before. The thought is much the same as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-9.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:9</a>, only here it is adduced not to prove the vanity and endless sameness of circumstances, but the orderly and appointed succession of events under the controlling providence of God. <span class="cmt_word">That which is to be hath already been</span>. The future will be a reproduction of the past. The laws which regulate things change not; the moral government is exercised by him who "is, and was, and is to come" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-8.htm">Revelation 1:8</a>), and therefore in effect history repeats itself; the same causes produce the same phenomena. <span class="cmt_word">God requireth that which is past</span>; literally, <span class="accented">God seeketh after that which hath been chased away</span>; Septuagint, "God will seek him who is pursued (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>);" Vulgate, "God reneweth that which is passed (<span class="accented">instaurat quod abiit</span>)." The meaning is - God brings back to view, recalls again into being, that which was past and had vanished out of sight and mind. The sentence is an explanation of the preceding clauses, and has nothing to do with the inquisition at the day of judgment. Hengstenberg has followed the Septuagint, Syriac, and Targum, in translating, "God seeks the persecuted," and seeing herein an allusion to the punishment of the Egyptians for pursuing the Israelites to the Red Sea, or a general statement that God succors the oppressed. But this idea is quite alien to the intention of the passage, and injures the coherence. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Since, then, everything has its time depending not on human influence, but on the determination and providence of God, the question arises: "What gain hath he that worketh in that wherewith he wearieth himself?" It is the complaint of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-3.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:3</a> which is here repeated. From all the labour there comes forth nothing which carries in it the security of its continuance; but in all he does man is conditioned by the change of times and circumstances and relations over which he has no control. And the converse of this his weakness is short-sightedness. </body></html>
