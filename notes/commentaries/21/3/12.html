We have the world so much in our hearts, are so taken up with thoughts and cares of worldly things, that we have neither time nor spirit to see God's hand in them. The world has not only gained possession of the heart, but has formed thoughts against the beauty of God's works. We mistake if we think we were born for ourselves; no, it is our business to do good in this life, which is short and uncertain; we have but little time to be doing good, therefore we should redeem time. Satisfaction with Divine Providence, is having faith that all things work together for good to them that love him. God doeth all, that men should fear before him. The world, as it has been, is, and will be. There has no change befallen us, nor has any temptation by it taken us, but such as is common to men.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In them - i. e., in the sons of men.<p>To do good - In a moral sense.

In these things; as the Arabic version; in the creatures, as Jarchi; in all sublunary enjoyments; in everything the wise man had made a trial of before, as natural Wisdom and knowledge, worldly pleasure, riches, and wealth; the "summun bonum", or happiness of men, did not lie in these things; this he knew by experience, and had the strongest assurance of it: or in them, that is, the children of men, as the Targum: there is no real good thing in them, nor comes out of them, nor is done by them; they cannot think a good thought, nor do a good action, of themselves. Or rather the sense is, I know there is nothing better for them than what follows: <p>but for a man to rejoice; not in sin and sinful pleasures, in a riotous, voluptuous, and epicurean manner; but to be cheerful, and enjoy the blessings of life in a comfortable way, and with a thankful heart; and especially to rejoice in spiritual things, and above all in Christ; and not in any self-boastings or carnal confidences, all such rejoicing is evil; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/9-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:7</a>. The Targum is, <p>"but that they rejoice in the joy of the law;'' <p>but it is much better to rejoice in the things of the Gospel, which is indeed a joyful sound; <p>and to do good in his life: to himself and family, by making use of the good things of life, and not withholding and hoarding them up; and to others, to all men, as opportunity offers, and especially to the household of faith; and not only by liberality and alms deeds, but by doing all good works, from right principles and to right ends, and that always, as long as he lives, <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-9.htm">Galatians 6:9</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">I know that there is no good in them, but for a man to rejoice, and to do good in his life.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">12</span>. <span class="ital">for a man to rejoice, and to do good</span>] There is no instance in O. T. language of the phrase “do good” being used, like the Greek <span class="greekheb">εὖ πράττειν</span>, in the sense of “prospering,” or “enjoying one’s self,” and in ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-20.htm" title="For there is not a just man on earth, that does good, and sins not.">Ecclesiastes 7:20</a> it can only have its full ethical meaning, such as it has in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-14.htm" title="Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it.">Psalm 34:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-3.htm" title="Trust in the LORD, and do good; so shall you dwell in the land, and truly you shall be fed.">Psalm 37:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-3.htm" title="And said, Remember now, O LORD, I beseech you, how I have walked before you in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in your sight. And Hezekiah wept sore.">Isaiah 38:3</a>. On the whole, therefore, we are led to assign that meaning to it here. Over and above the life of honest labour and simple joys which had been recognised as good before, the seeker has learnt that “honesty is the best policy,” that “doing good” (the term is more comprehensive in its range than our “beneficence”) is in some sense the best way of getting good. It is not the highest ethical view of the end of life, but it was an advance on his previous conclusion.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I know that there is no good in them, but for a man to rejoice;</span> rather, <span class="accented">I knew</span>, <span class="accented">perceived</span>, <span class="accented">that there was no good for them</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. for men. From the facts adduced, Koheleth learned this practical result - that man had nothing in his own power (see on Ecclesiastes 2:24) which would conduce to his happiness, but to make the best of life such as he finds it. Vulgate, <span class="accented">Cognovi quod non esset melius nisi laetari</span>. <span class="cmt_word">To do good in his life</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>; (Septuagint); <span class="accented">Facere bene</span> (Vulgate). This has been taken by many in the sense of "doing one's self good, prospering, enjoying one's self." like the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3cb;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, and therefore nearly equivalent to "rejoice" in the former part of the verse. But the expression is best taken here, as when it occurs elsewhere (e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-20.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:20</a>), in a moral sense, and it thus teaches the great truth that virtue is essential to happiness, that to "trust in the Lord... to depart from evil, and to do good" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/36-3.htm">Psalm 36:3</a>, 27), will bring peace and content (see in the epilogue, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:13, 14</a>). There is no Epicureanism in this verse; the enjoyment spoken of is not licentiousness, but a happy appreciation of the innocent pleasures which the love of God offers to those who live in accordance with the laws of their higher nature. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"To seek has its time, and to lose has its time; to lay up has its time, and to throw away has its time." Vaihinger and others translate &#1500;&#1488;&#1489;&#1468;&#1491;, to give up as lost, which the Pih. signifies first as the expression of a conscious act. The older language knows it only in the stronger sense of bringing to ruin, making to perish, wasting (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/29-3.htm">Proverbs 29:3</a>). But in the more modern language, &#1488;&#1489;&#1491;, like the Lat. perdere, in the sense of "to lose," is the trans. to the intrans. &#1488;&#1489;&#1491;, e.g., Tahoroth; viii. 3, "if one loses (&#1492;&#1502;&#1488;&#1489;&#1468;&#1491;) anything," etc.; Sifri, at <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-19.htm">Deuteronomy 24:19</a>, "he who has lost (&#1502;&#1488;&#1489;&#1468;&#1491;) a shekel," etc. In this sense the Palest.-Aram. uses the Aphel &#1488;&#1493;&#1489;&#1491;, e.g., Jer. Meza ii. 5, "the queen had lost (&#1488;&#1493;&#1489;&#1491;&#1514;) her ornament." The intentional giving up, throwing away from oneself, finds its expression in &#1500;&#1492;&#1513;&#1473;.<p>The following pair of contrasts refers the abandoning and preserving to articles of clothing: -  </body></html>
