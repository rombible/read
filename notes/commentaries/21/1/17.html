He found his searches after knowledge weariness, not only to the flesh, but to the mind. The more he saw of the works done under the sun, the more he saw their vanity; and the sight often vexed his spirit. He could neither gain that satisfaction to himself, nor do that good to others, which he expected. Even the pursuit of knowledge and wisdom discovered man's wickedness and misery; so that the more he knew, the more he saw cause to lament and mourn. Let us learn to hate and fear sin, the cause of all this vanity and misery; to value Christ; to seek rest in the knowledge, love, and service of the Saviour.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ecclesiastes/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>To know madness and folly - A knowledge of folly would help him to discern wisdom, and to exercise that chief function of practical wisdom - to avoid folly. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ecclesiastes/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17. wisdom &#8230; madness&#8212;that is, their effects, the works of human wisdom and folly respectively. "Madness," literally, "vaunting extravagance"; Ec 2:12; 7:25, &c., support English Version rather than Dathe, "splendid matters." "Folly" is read by English Version with some manuscripts, instead of the present Hebrew text, "prudence."

The Targum, Septuagint, and all the Oriental versions, interpret the last word, translated "folly", by understanding, knowledge, and prudence; which seems to be right, since Solomon speaks of nothing afterwards, as vexation and grief to him, but wisdom and knowledge: and I would therefore read the clause in connection with the preceding, thus, "and the knowledge of things boasted of", vain glorious knowledge; "and prudence", or what may be called craftiness and cunning; or what the apostle calls "science falsely so called", <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-20.htm">1 Timothy 6:20</a>; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-8.htm">Proverbs 12:8</a>; <p>I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit; See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:14</a>; the reason follows. <p>(s) In Timaeo, p. 1084. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/ecclesiastes/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know <span class="cverse3">{l}</span> madness and folly: I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit.</span><p>(l) That is, vain things, which served to pleasure, in which was no convenience, but grief and trouble of conscience.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/ecclesiastes/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">17</span>. <span class="ital">And I gave my heart</span>] The apparent iteration of the phrase of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-13.htm" title="And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all things that are done under heaven: this sore travail has God given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith.">Ecclesiastes 1:13</a> expresses the concentration of purpose. The writer adds that his search took a yet wider range. He sought to know wisdom through its opposite, to enlarge his experience of the diseases of human thought. He had fathomed the depths of the “madness and folly;” the former word expressing in Hebrew as in English the wilder forms of unwisdom. There is, perhaps, a touch of self-mockery in the fact that the latter word in the Hebrew is all but identical in sound with a word which means “prudence.” One, the writer seems to say, has the same issue as the other. Some critics, indeed (<span class="ital">e.g.</span> Ginsburg), think that the present text originated in an error of transcription and that we ought to read “to know wisdom and knowledge.” It has been thought and, as stated in the <span class="ital">Introduction</span> (chap. ii.), with some reason, that in the use of the stronger word we have an echo of the current language of the Stoics who looked on all the weaknesses of mankind as so many forms of insanity. So Horace (<span class="ital">Sat.</span> ii. 3. 43),<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“Quem mala stultitia et quemcunque inscitia veri<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Cæcum agit, insanum Chrysippi porticus et grex<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Autumat.

Laert. vii. 124,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">λέγουσι πάντας τοὺς ἄφρονας μαίνεσθαι</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"></span>“All that are foolish they pronounce insane.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">vexation of spirit</span>] Better, <span class="bld">feeding on wind</span>, as before. See note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-14.htm" title="I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all is vanity and vexation of spirit.">Ecclesiastes 1:14</a>. The word is, however, not identical in form, but expresses a more concrete idea. By some it is rendered “meditation.” The fact that the writer uses a word not found elsewhere in the Old Testament, suggests the thought that he wanted a new word for the expression of a new thought.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I gave my heart</span>. He reiterates the expression in order to emphasize his earnestness and energy in the pursuit of wisdom. And knowing, as St. Jerome says, that "contrariis contraria inteiliguntur," he studies the opposite of wisdom, and learns the truth by contrasting it with error. <span class="cmt_word">And</span> <span class="cmt_word">to know madness and folly</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:12</a>). The former word, <span class="accented">holeloth</span> (intensive plural), by its etymology points to a confusion of thought, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. an unwisdom which deranges all ideas of order and propriety; and folly (hero <span class="accented">sikluth</span>), throughout the sapiential books, is identified with vice and wickedness, the contradictory of practical godliness. The LXX. has <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>, "parables and knowledge," and some editors have altered the Hebrew text in accordance with this version, which they consider more suitable to the context. But Koheleth's standpoint is quite consistent. To use the words of St. Jerome in his 'Commentary,' "AEqualis studii fuit Salomoni, scire sapientiam et scientiam, et e regione errores et stultitiam, ut in aliis appetendis et aliis declinandis vera ejus sapientia probaretur." On the other hand, Den-Sirs gives a much-needed warning against touching pitch (Ecclus. 13:1), and argues expressly that "the knowledge of wickedness is not wisdom" (Ecclus. 19:22). Plumptre unnecessarily sees in the use of the term" madness 'an echo of the teaching of the Stoics, who regarded men's weaknesses as forms of insanity. The moralist had no need to travel beyond his own experience in order to learn that sin was the acme of unwisdom, a declension from reason which might well be called madness. The subject is handled by Cicero, 'Tusc. Disput.,' 3:4, 5. We are reminded of Horace's expression ('Carm.,' 2:7. 27) - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Recepto Dulce mihi furere est amico."</span> And Anacreon's (31.), <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. Thus far we have had Koheleth's secret thoughts - what he communed with his own heart (ver. 16). The result of his studies was most unsatisfying <span class="cmt_word">I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit</span>; or, <span class="accented">a striving after wind</span>, as ver. 14 Though the word is somewhat different. As such labor is wasted, for man cannot control issues. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ecclesiastes/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"There is no remembrance of ancestors; and also of the later ones who shall come into existence, there will be no remembrance for them with those who shall come into existence after them." With &#1494;&#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1503; (with Kametz) there is also &#1494;&#1499;&#1512;&#1493;&#1503;, the more common form by our author, in accordance with the usage of his age; Gesen., Elst., and others regard it here and at <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-16.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:16</a> as constr., and thus &#1500;&#1512;&#1488; as virtually object-gen. (Jerome, non est priorum memoria); but such refinements of the old syntaxis ornata are not to be expected in our author: he changes (according to the traditional punctuation) here the initial sound, as at <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:17</a> the final sound, to oth and uth. &#1488;&#1497;&#1503; &#1500; is the contrast of &#1492;&#1497;&#1492; &#1500;: to attribute to one, to become partaker of. The use of the expression, "for them," gives emphasis to the statement. "With those who shall come after," points from the generation that is future to a remoter future, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/33-2.htm">Genesis 33:2</a>. The Kametz of the prep. is that of the recompens. art.; cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/2-31.htm">Numbers 2:31</a>, where it denotes "the last" among the four hosts; for there &#1492;&#1488; is meant of the last in order, as here it is meant of the remotely future time. </body></html>
