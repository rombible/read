In using this expression we mean to indicate the opinion that the unity of the book is rather that of a musical composition than of a philosophical treatise. A leading theme is given out and followed for a time. Episodes are introduced, not perhaps logically connected with the original subject, but treated in harmony with it, and leading back to the original theme which is never lost sight of, and with which the composition comes to a close (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-8.htm" title="Vanity of vanities, said the preacher; all is vanity.">Ecclesiastes 12:8</a>).<p>The word translated “vanity” (which occurs thirty-seven times in this book, and only thirty-three times in all the rest of the Old Testament) in its primary meaning denotes breath or vapour, and is so translated here in some of the Greek versions (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/4-4.htm" title="You adulterers and adulteresses, know you not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.">James 4:4</a>); so in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-13.htm" title="When you cry, let your companies deliver you; but the wind shall carry them all away; vanity shall take them: but he that puts his trust in me shall possess the land, and shall inherit my holy mountain;">Isaiah 57:13</a>. It is the same word as the proper name Abel, on which see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-2.htm" title="And she again bore his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.">Genesis 4:2</a>. It is frequently applied in Scripture to the follies of heathenism (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-22.htm" title="Are there any among the vanities of the Gentiles that can cause rain? or can the heavens give showers? are not you he, O LORD our God? therefore we will wait on you: for you have made all these things.">Jeremiah 14:22</a>, &c), and also to the whole estate of men (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/39-5.htm" title="Behold, you have made my days as an handbreadth; and my age is as nothing before you: truly every man at his best state is altogether vanity. Selah.">Psalm 39:5-6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/62-9.htm" title="Surely men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a lie: to be laid in the balance, they are altogether lighter than vanity.">Psalm 62:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/144-4.htm" title="Man is like to vanity: his days are as a shadow that passes away.">Psalm 144:4</a>). The translation “vanity<span class= "ital">” </span>is that of the LXX. We may reasonably believe that St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-20.htm" title="For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who has subjected the same in hope,">Romans 8:20</a>) had this key-note of Ecclesiastes in his mind.<p>“Vanity of vanities” is a common Hebrew superlative, as in the phrases “Heaven of heavens,” “Song of songs,” “Holy of holies,” “Lamentation of lamentations” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/2-4.htm" title="In that day shall one take up a parable against you, and lament with a doleful lamentation, and say, We be utterly spoiled: he has changed the portion of my people: how has he removed it from me! turning away he has divided our fields.">Micah 2:4</a>, margin).<p><span class= "bld">Saith the Preacher.—</span>Heb., <span class= "ital">said. </span>The Hebrew constantly employs the preterite when English usage requires the present or perfect. In the case of a message the point of time contemplated in Hebrew is that of the giving, not the delivery, of the message. So “Thus said Benhadad,” “Thus said the Lord” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-2.htm" title="And he sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel into the city, and said to him, Thus said Benhadad,">1Kings 20:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-5.htm" title="And the messengers came again, and said, Thus speaks Benhadad, saying, Although I have sent to you, saying, You shall deliver me your silver, and your gold, and your wives, and your children;">1Kings 20:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-13.htm" title="And, behold, there came a prophet to Ahab king of Israel, saying, Thus said the LORD, Have you seen all this great multitude? behold, I will deliver it into your hand this day; and you shall know that I am the LORD.">1Kings 20:13</a> and <span class= "ital">passim</span>) are rightly translated by the present in our version. In the present case this formula is one which might conceivably be employed if the words of Kohéleth were written down by himself; yet it certainly rather suggests that we have here these words as written down by another.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/ecclesiastes/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-2.htm" title="Vanity of vanities, said the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all is vanity.">Ecclesiastes 1:2</a></span>. <span class="ital">Vanity, </span>&c. — Not only <span class="ital">vain, </span>but <span class="ital">vanity </span>in the abstract, which denotes extreme vanity. <span class="ital">Saith the Preacher </span>— Upon deep consideration and long experience, and by divine inspiration.

We here behold Solomon returning from the broken and empty cisterns of the world, to the Fountain of living water; recording his own folly and shame, the bitterness of his disappointment, and the lessons he had learned. Those that have taken warning to turn and live, should warn others not to go on and die. He does not merely say all things are vain, but that they are vanity. VANITY OF VANITIES, ALL IS VANITY. This is the text of the preacher's sermon, of which in this book he never loses sight. If this world, in its present state, were all, it would not be worth living for; and the wealth and pleasure of this world, if we had ever so much, are not enough to make us happy. What profit has a man of all his labour? All he gets by it will not supply the wants of the soul, nor satisfy its desires; will not atone for the sins of the soul, nor hinder the loss of it: what profit will the wealth of the world be to the soul in death, in judgment, or in the everlasting state?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ecclesiastes/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Vanity - This word &#1492;&#1489;&#1500;  hebel, or, when used as a proper name, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/4-2.htm">Genesis 4:2</a>, "Abel", occurs no less than 37 times in Ecclesiastes, and has been called the key of the book. Primarily it means "breath," "light wind;" and denotes what:<p>(1) passes away more or less quickly and completely;<p>(2) leaves either no result or no adequate result behind, and therefore<p>(3) fails to satisfy the mind of man, which naturally craves for something permanent and progressive: it is also applied to:<p>(4) idols, as contrasted with the Living, Eternal, and Almighty God, and, thus, in the Hebrew mind, it is connected with sin.<p>In this book it is applied to all works on earth, to pleasure, grandeur, wisdom, the life of man, childhood, youth, and length of days, the oblivion of the grave, wandering and unsatisfied desires, unenjoyed possessions, and anomalies in the moral government of the world.<p>Solomon speaks of the world-wide existence of "vanity," not with bitterness or scorn, but as a fact, which forced itself on him as he advanced in knowledge of men and things, and which he regards with sorrow and perplexity. From such feelings he finds refuge by contrasting this with another fact, which he holds with equal firmness, namely, that the whole universe is made and is governed by a God of justice, goodness, and power. The place of vanity in the order of Divine Providence - unknown to Solomon, unless the answer be indicated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-29.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:29</a> - is explained to us by Paul, <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/8.htm">Romans 8</a>, where its origin is traced to the subjugation and corruption of creation by sin as a consequence of the fall of man; and its extinction is declared to be reserved until after the Resurrection in the glory and liberty of the children of God.<p>Vanity of vanities - A well-known Hebrew idiom signifying vanity in the highest degree.

So they are unquestionably <span class="ital">vain</span>, because they are not what they seem to be, and perform not what they promise, content and satisfaction, but instead of that are commonly the causes or occasions of innumerable cares, and fears, and sorrows, and mischiefs; and because they are altogether unsuitable to the noble mind or soul of man, both in nature or quality, and in duration, as being unstable and perishing things. And this vanity of them is here repeated again and again; partly, because it was most deeply fixed and perpetually present in Solomon’s thoughts; partly, to show the unquestionable certainty and vast importance of this truth; and partly, that he might more thoroughly awaken the dull and stupid minds of men to the consideration of it, and might wean men’s hearts from those things upon which he knew they excessively doted. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/ecclesiastes/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Vanity of vanities, saith the preacher,.... This is the preacher's text; the theme and subject he after enlarges upon, and proves by an induction of particulars; it is the sum of the whole book; <p>vanity of vanities, all is vanity; most extremely vain, exceedingly so, the height of vanity: this is repeated, both for the confirmation of it, men being hard of belief of it; and to show how much the preacher was affected with it himself, and to affect others with the same. The Targum reads, "vanity of vanities in this world"; which is right as to the sense of the passage; for though the world, and all things in it, were made by God, and are very good; yet, in comparison of him, are less than nothing, and vanity; and especially as become subject to it through sin, a curse being brought upon the earth by it; and all the creatures made for the use of men liable to be abused, and are abused, through luxury, intemperance, and cruelty; and the whole world usurped by Satan, as the god of it. Nor is there anything in it, and put it all together, that can give satisfaction and contentment; and all is fickle, fluid, transitory, and vanishing, and in a short time will come to an end: the riches of the world afford no real happiness, having no substance in them, and being of no long continuance; nor can a man procure happiness for himself or others, or avert wrath to come, and secure from it; and especially these are vanity, when compared with the true riches, the riches of grace and glory, which are solid, substantial, satisfying, and are for ever: the honours of this world are empty things, last a very short time; and are nothing in comparison of the honour that comes from God, and all the saints have, in the enjoyment of grace here, and glory hereafter: the sinful pleasures of life are imaginary things, short lived ones; and not to be mentioned with spiritual pleasures, enjoyed in the house of God, under the word and ordinances; and especially with those pleasures, for evermore, at the right hand of God. Natural wisdom and knowledge, the best thing in the world; yet much of it is only in opinion; a great deal of it false; and none saving, and of any worth, in comparison of the knowledge of Christ, and of God in Christ; all the forms of religion and external righteousness, where there is not the true fear and grace of God, are all vain and empty things. Man, the principal creature in the world, is "vain man"; that is his proper character in nature and religion, destitute of grace: every than is vain, nay, vanity itself; high and low, rich and poor, learned or unlearned; nay, man at his best estate, as worldly and natural, is so; as even Adam was in his state of innocence, being fickle and mutable, and hence he fell, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/39-5.htm">Psalm 39:5</a>; and especially his fallen posterity, whose bodies are tenements of clay; their beauty vain and deceitful; their circumstances changeable; their minds empty of all that is good; their thoughts and imaginations vain; their words, and works, and actions, and their whole life and conversation; they are not at all to be trusted in for help, by themselves or others. The Targum is, <p>"when Solomon, king of Israel, saw, by the spirit of prophecy, that the kingdom of Rehoboam his son would be divided with Jeroboam, the son of Nebat; and that Jerusalem, and the house of the sanctuary, would be destroyed, and the people of the children of Israel would be carried captive; he said, by his word, Vanity of vanities in this world, vanity of vanities; all that I and my father David have laboured for, all is vanity!'' <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/ecclesiastes/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{b}</span> Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all <i>is</i> vanity.</span><p>(b) He condemns the opinions of all men who set happiness in anything but in God alone, seeing that in this world all things are as vanity and nothing.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/ecclesiastes/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">2</span>. <span class="ital">Vanity of vanities</span>] The form is the highest type (as in the “servant of servants” of <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-25.htm" title="And he said, Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be to his brothers.">Genesis 9:25</a>, the “chief over the chief” of <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/3-32.htm" title="And Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest shall be chief over the chief of the Levites, and have the oversight of them that keep the charge of the sanctuary.">Numbers 3:32</a>) of the Hebrew superlative. The word translated “vanity,” identical with the name Abel or <span class="ital">Hebel</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-2.htm" title="And she again bore his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.">Genesis 4:2</a>) means primarily a “breath,” or “vapour,” and as such becomes the type of all that is fleeting and perishable (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/62-9.htm" title="Surely men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a lie: to be laid in the balance, they are altogether lighter than vanity.">Psalm 62:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/144-4.htm" title="Man is like to vanity: his days are as a shadow that passes away.">Psalm 144:4</a>). It is uniformily translated by “vanity” in the English Version of this book, which is moulded on the Vulgate as that was upon the LXX. The other Greek versions gave “vapour of vapours” (Hieron. <span class="ital">in loc.</span>) and this may perhaps be regarded as, in some respects, a preferable rendering. The watchword of the book, the key-note of its melancholy music, meeting us not less than thirty-nine times, is therefore, whether we take it as a proposition or an exclamation, like that of the Epicurean poet “<span class="ital">Pulvis et umbra sumus</span>” (Hor. <span class="ital">Od.</span> iv. 7. 9), like that also, we may add, of St James (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/3-14.htm" title="But if you have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth.">James 3:14</a>) and the Psalmist (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/90-3.htm" title="You turn man to destruction; and say, Return, you children of men....">Psalm 90:3-10</a>). In the <span class="ital">Wisdom of Solomon</span> apparently written (see <span class="ital">Introduction</span>, chap. v.) as a corrective complement to Ecclesiastes we have a like series of comparisons, the “dust,” the “thin froth,” the “smoke,” but there the idea of ‘vanity’ is limited to the “hope of the ungodly” and the writer, as if of set purpose, avoids the sweeping generalizations of the <span class="bld">Debater</span>, who extends the assertion to the “all” of human life, and human aims. It is not without significance that St Paul, in what is, perhaps, the solitary reference in his writings to this book, uses the word which the LXX. employs here, when he affirms that “the creature was made subject to <span class="ital">vanity</span>” and seeks to place that fact in its right relation to the future restitution of the Universe (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-20.htm" title="For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who has subjected the same in hope,">Romans 8:20</a>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 2-11.</span> - PROLOGUE.

"Vanity" is <span class="accented">hebel</span>, which means "breath," and is used metaphorically of anything transitory, frail, unsatisfying. We have it in the proper name Abel, an appropriate designation of the youth whose life was cut short by a brother's murderous hand. "Vanity of vanities," like "heaven of heavens" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-27.htm">1 Kings 8:27</a>), "song of songs" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/1-1.htm">Song of Solomon 1:1</a>), etc., is equivalent to a superlative, "most utterly vain." It is here an exclamation, and is to be regarded as the key-note of the whole subsequent treatise, which is merely the development of this text. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>; other Greek translators, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c4;&#x3bc;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c4;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, "vapor of vapors." For "saith" the Vulgate gives <span class="accented">dixit</span>; the Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>; but as there is no reference to any previous utterance of the Preacher, the present is more suitable here. In affirming that "all is vanity," the writer is referring to human and mundane things, and directs not his view beyond such phenomena. Such reflection is common in sacred and profane writings alike; such experience is universal (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/47-9.htm">Genesis 47:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/39-5.htm">Psalm 39:5-7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-3.htm">Psalm 90:3-10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/3-14.htm">James 3:14</a>). "Pulvis et umbra sumus," says Horace ('Carm.,' 4:7. 16. "O curas hominum! O quantum est in rebus inane!" (Persius, 'Sat.,' 1:1). If Dean Plumptre is correct in contending that the Book of Wisdom was written to rectify the deductions which might be drawn from Koheleth, we may contrast the caution of the apocryphal writer, who predicates vanity, not of all things, but only of the hope of the ungodly, which he likens to dust, froth, and smoke (see Wisd. 2:1, etc.; 5:14). St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-20.htm">Romans 8:20</a>) seems to have had Ecclesiastes in mind when he spoke of the creation being subjected to vanity (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>), as a consequence of the fall of man, not to be remedied till the final restitution of all things. "But a man will say, If all things are vain and vanity, wherefore were they made? If they are God's works, how are they vain? But it is not the works of God which he calls vain. God forbid! The heaven is not vain; the earth is not vain: God forbid! Nor the sun, nor the moon, nor the stars, nor our own body. No; all these are very good. But what is vain? Man's works, pomp, and vain-glory. These came not from the hand of God, but are of our own creating. And they are vain because they have no useful end That is called vain which is expected indeed to possess value, yet possesses it not; that which men call empty, as when they speak of 'empty hopes,' and that which is fruitless. And generally that is called vain which is of no use. Let us see, then, whether all human things are not of this sort" (St. Chrysostom, 'Hem. 12. in Ephes.'). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/31.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>27 &#1510; She looketh well to the ways of her house,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And eateth not the bread of idleness.<p>Although there exists an inner relation between 27a and <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-26.htm">Proverbs 31:26</a>, yet 27a is scarcely to be thought of (Hitzig) as appos. to the suffix in &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1504;&#1492;&#1468;.
