The verse gains in liveliness if more literally rendered, “going towards the south and circling towards the north, circling, circling goes the wind, and to its circles the wind returns.”<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:4-8 All things change, and never rest.

The north and south winds are the two prevailing winds in Palestine and Egypt.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ecclesiastes/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the north; </span> the wind also sometimes blows from one quarter of the world, and sometimes from another; all of them being synecdochically comprehended under these two eminent quarters. But because this word, the <span class="ital">wind</span>, is not expressed in the Hebrew, but is only borrowed or understood from the latter clause of the verse, this first clause is by other judicious interpreters understood of the sun, of whom he last spake; the words being thus rendered according to the Hebrew, <span class="ital">He</span> (the sun) <span class="ital">goeth towards the south</span>, (which he doth one half of the year,) and turneth about unto the north, which he doth the other half. And so here is the whole motion of the sun towards the four quarters of the world particularly described; his daily motion from east to, vest, and back again, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-5.htm" title="The sun also rises, and the sun goes down, and hastens to his place where he arose.">Ecclesiastes 1:5</a></span>; and his yearly motion from north to south, between the signs of Cancer and Capricorn. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The wind returneth again according to his circuits:</span> this clause is by all understood of the wind, which is fitly mentioned immediately after the sun, because it hath its rise from the sun, who is therefore called <span class="ital">the father of winds</span>, and the winds do usually rise with the sun, and are laid when he sets. But then it is rendered thus, and that very agreeably to the Hebrew, <span class="ital">the wind goeth continually whirling or compassing about, and he returneth again to his circuits</span>, being sometimes in one, and sometimes in another quarter, and successively returning to the same quarters in which he had formerly been. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/ecclesiastes/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the north,.... The word "wind" is not in this clause in the original text, but is taken from the next, and so may be rendered, "it goeth towards the south", &amp;c. that is, the sun (x) before mentioned, which as to its diurnal and nocturnal course in the daytime goes towards the south, and in the night towards the north; and as to its annual course before the winter solstice it goes to the south, and before the summer solstice to the north, as interpreters observe. And the Targum not only interprets this clause, but even the whole verse, of the sun, paraphrasing the whole thus, <p>"it goes all the side of the south in the daytime, and goes round to the side of the north in the night, by the way of the abyss; it goes its circuit, and comes to the wind of the south corner in the revolution of Nisan and Tammuz; and by its circuit it returns to the wind of the north corner in the revolution of Tisri and Tebet; it goes out of the confines of the east in the morning, and goes into the confines of the west in the evening.'' <p>But Aben Ezra understands the whole of the wind, as our version and others do, which is sometimes in the south point of the heavens, and is presently in the north; <p>it whirleth about continually; and the wind returneth again according to his circuits; which may be meant of the circuits of the sun, which has a great influence on the wind, often raising it in a morning and laying it at night; but it is the wind itself which whirls and shifts about all the points of the compass, and returns from whence it came, where the treasures of it are. Agreeably to Solomon's account of the wind is Plato's definition of it, <p>"the wind is the motion of the air round about the earth (y).'' <p>This also exemplifies the rotation of men and things, the instability, inconstancy, and restless state of all sublunary enjoyments; the unprofitableness of men's labours, who, while they labour for riches and honour, and natural knowledge, labour for the wind, and fill their belly with east wind, which cannot satisfy, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/5-16.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:16</a>; as well as the frailty of human life, which is like the wind that passes away and comes not again; and in this respect, like the rest of the instances, exceed man, which returns to its place, but man does not, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-7.htm">Job 7:7</a>. <p>(x) Jarchi, Alshech, and Titatzak, interpret it of the sun; so Mercerus, Varenius, Gejerus; accordingly Mr. Broughton renders it "he walketh to the south."

These words, as we have seen above, are referred to the sun by the Septuagint, Vulgate, and Syriac; but it is best to make this verse refer only to the wind - a fresh example of motion continually repeated with no real progress to an end. Thus each verse comprises one subject and idea, ver. 4 being concerned with the earth, ver. 5 with the sun, ver. 6 with the wind, and ver. 7 with the waters. There seems to be no particular force in the naming of north and south, unless it be in contrast to the sun's motion from east to west, mentioned in the preceding verse. The words following show that these two directions are not alone intended. Thus the four quarters are virtually included. <span class="cmt_word">It whirleth about continually.</span> The original is more forcible, giving by its very form the idea of weary monotony. The subject is delayed till the last, thus: <span class="accented">Going towards the south</span>... <span class="accented">circling</span>, <span class="accented">circling</span>, <span class="accented">goeth the wind</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. it blows from all quarters at its own caprice. <span class="cmt_word">And the wind returneth again according to his circuits</span>. <span class="accented">And on its circlings returneth the wind</span>; it comes back to the point whence it started. The wind, seemingly the freest of all created things, is bound by the same law of immutable changeableness, insensate repetition. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/31.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>31 &#1514; Give to her of the fruit of her hands;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And let her works praise her in the gates!<p>The fruit of her hands is the good which, by her conduct, she has brought to maturity - the blessing which she has secured for others, but, according to the promise (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-10.htm">Isaiah 3:10</a>), has also secured for her own enjoyment.

Her best praise is her works themselves. In the gates, i.e., in the place where the representatives of the people come together, and where the people are assembled, her works praise her; and the poet desires that this may be right worthily done, full of certainty that she merits it, and that they honour themselves who seek to praise the works of such a woman, which carry in themselves their own commendation. </body></html>
