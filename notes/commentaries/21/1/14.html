This also is vanity and vexation of spirit.">Ecclesiastes 2:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-4.htm" title="Again, I considered all travail, and every right work, that for this a man is envied of his neighbor. This is also vanity and vexation of spirit.">Ecclesiastes 4:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-6.htm" title="Better is an handful with quietness, than both the hands full with travail and vexation of spirit.">Ecclesiastes 4:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/6-9.htm" title="Better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the desire: this is also vanity and vexation of spirit.">Ecclesiastes 6:9</a>). The A. V. translation, “vexation of spirit,” is difficult to justify. Very nearly the same phrase occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/12-1.htm" title="Ephraim feeds on wind, and follows after the east wind: he daily increases lies and desolation; and they do make a covenant with the Assyrians, and oil is carried into Egypt.">Hosea 12:1</a>, and is there translated “feeding on wind,” for in Hebrew, as in some other languages, the name for “spirit” primarily denotes breath or wind. Accordingly many interpreters understand the phrase of the text “feeding on wind” (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-20.htm" title="He feeds on ashes: a deceived heart has turned him aside, that he cannot deliver his soul, nor say, Is there not a lie in my right hand?">Isaiah 44:20</a>). The same root, however, which means to “feast on a thing,” has the secondary meaning to “delight in a thing,” and so the corresponding noun in Chaldee comes to mean “pleasure” or “will.” (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/5-17.htm" title="Now therefore, if it seem good to the king, let there be search made in the king's treasure house, which is there at Babylon, whether it be so, that a decree was made of Cyrus the king to build this house of God at Jerusalem, and let the king send his pleasure to us concerning this matter.">Ezra 5:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/7-18.htm" title="And whatever shall seem good to you, and to your brothers, to do with the rest of the silver and the gold, that do after the will of your God.">Ezra 7:18</a>.) Accordingly the LXX. and many modern interpreters understand the phrase of the text “effort after wind.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/ecclesiastes/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ecclesiastes/1-14.htm" title="I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all is vanity and vexation of spirit....">Ecclesiastes 1:14-15</a></span>. <span class="ital">I have seen all the works, </span>&c. — Diligently observed, and, in a great measure, understood them; <span class="ital">and behold, all is vanity and vexation of spirit </span>— Not only unsatisfying, but also an affliction or breaking to a man’s spirit. <span class="ital">That which is crooked, </span>&c. — All our knowledge serves only to discover our miseries, but is utterly insufficient to remove them; it cannot rectify those disorders which are either in our own hearts and lives, or in the men and things of the world. <span class="ital">That which is wanting </span>— In our knowledge, and in order to man’s complete satisfaction and happiness; <span class="ital">cannot be numbered </span>— Or, <span class="ital">counted out </span>to us from the treasures of human learning, but what is wanting will be so still; all our enjoyments here, when we have done our utmost to bring them to perfection, are still defective: and that which is wanting in our own knowledge is so much, that it <span class="ital">cannot be numbered. </span>The more we know, the more we see of our own ignorance.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:12-18 Solomon tried all things, and found them vanity.

The more he saw of the works done under the sun, the more he saw their vanity; and the sight often vexed his spirit. He could neither gain that satisfaction to himself, nor do that good to others, which he expected. Even the pursuit of knowledge and wisdom discovered man's wickedness and misery; so that the more he knew, the more he saw cause to lament and mourn.

Modern Hebrew grammarians assert that the word rendered "vexation" must be derived from a root signifying "to feed," "follow," "strive after." This being admitted, it remains to choose between two translations:<p>(1) "striving after wind," or "windy effort;" adopted by the Septuagint and the majority of modern interpreters; or<p>(2) feeding on wind. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/12-1.htm">Hosea 12:1</a> : and similar phrases in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-14.htm">Proverbs 15:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-20.htm">Isaiah 44:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-3.htm">Psalm 37:3</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ecclesiastes/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14. The reason is here given why investigation into man's "works" is only "sore travail" (Ec 1:13); namely, because all man's ways are vain (Ec 1:18) and cannot be mended (Ec 1:15).<p>vexation of&#8212;"a preying upon"<p>the Spirit&#8212;Maurer translates; "the pursuit of wind," as in Ec 5:16; Ho 12:1, "Ephraim feedeth on wind."

Most commentators, however, prefer the rendering “striving after the wind” or “windy effort,” but “feeding” expresses, it is believed, the meaning of the Hebrew more closely. The LXX. gives <span class="greekheb">προαίρεσις πνεύματος</span> (= resolve of wind, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> fleeting and unsubstantial). Symmachus gives <span class="greekheb">βόσκησις</span> and Aquila <span class="greekheb">νομή</span> (= feeding). The word in question occurs seven times in Ecclesiastes but is not found elsewhere. The rendering “vexation” rests apparently on a false etymology.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - Here is the result of this examination of human actions. <span class="cmt_word">I have seen all the works that are done under the sun.</span> In his varied experience nothing had escaped his notice. <span class="cmt_word">And behold, all is vanity and vexation of spirit</span>; <span class="accented">reuth ruach</span>; <span class="accented">afflictio spiritus</span> (Vulgate); <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "choice of spirit," or, "wind" (Septuagint); <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> (Aquila and Theodotion); <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "feeding on wind" (Symmachus). This last translation, or "striving after wind," seems to be most agreeable to the etymology of the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5ea;</span>, which, except in this book (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:11, 17, 26</a>, etc.), occurs elsewhere only in the Chaldee portion of Ezra (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/5-17.htm">Ezra 5:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/7-18.htm">Ezra 7:18</a>). Whichever sense is taken, the import is much the same. What is implied is the unsubstantial and unsatisfying nature of human labors and endeavors. Many compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/12-2.htm">Hosea 12:2</a>, "Ephraim feedeth on wind," and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-20.htm">Isaiah 44:20</a>, "He feedeth on ashes." In contrast, perhaps, to this constantly recurring complaint, the author of the Book of Wisdom teaches that murmuring is unprofitable and blasphemous (Wisd. 1:11). Bailey, in 'Festus,' sings - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Of all life's aims, what's worth the thought we waste on't?<br />How mean, how miserable, seems every care!<br />How doubtful, too, the system of the mind!<br />And then the ceaseless, changeless, hopeless round<br />Of weariness, and heartlessness, and woe,<br />And vice, and vanity! Yet these make life -<br />The life, at least, I witness, if not feel<br />No matter, we are immortal."</span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ecclesiastes/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"All things are in activity; no man can utter it; the eye is not satisfied with seeing, and the ear is not full with hearing." All translators and interpreters who understand devarim here of words (lxx, Syr., and Targ.) go astray; for if the author meant to say that no words can describe this everlasting sameness with perpetual change, then he would have expressed himself otherwise than by "all words weary" (Ew., Elst., Hengst., and others); he ought at least to have said &#1500;&#1512;&#1497;&#1511; &#1497;&#1490;. But also "all things are wearisome" (Knob., Hitz.), or "full of labour" (Zck.), i.e., it is wearisome to relate them all, cannot be the meaning of the sentence; for &#1497;&#1490;&#1506; does not denote that which causes weariness, but that which suffers weariness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/25-18.htm">Deuteronomy 25:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-2.htm">2 Samuel 7:2</a>); and to refer the affection, instead of to the narrator, to that which is to be narrated, would be even for a poet too affected a quid pro quo. Rosenmller essentially correctly: omnes res fatigantur h. e. in perpetua versantur vicissitudine, qua fatigantur quasi. But &#1497;&#1490;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; is not appropriately rendered by fatigantur; the word means, becoming wearied, or perfectly feeble, or also: wearying oneself (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:12</a>), working with a strain on one's strength, fatiguing oneself (cf.&#1497;&#1490;&#1497;&#1506;, that which is gained by labour, work). This is just what these four examples are meant to show, viz., that a restless activity reaching no visible conclusion and end, always beginning again anew, pervades the whole world-all things, he says, summarizing, are in labour, i.e., are restless, hastening on, giving the impression of fatigue.<p>Thus also in strict sequence of thought that which follows: this unrest in the outer world reflects itself in man, when he contemplates that which is done around him; human language cannot exhaust this coming and going, this growth and decay in constant circle, and the quodlibet is so great, that the eye cannot be satisfied with seeing, nor the ear with hearing; to the unrest of things without corresponds the unrest of the mind, which through this course, in these ever repeated variations, always bringing back the old again to view, is kept in ceaseless activity. The object to da&#780;bbe&#772;r is the totality of things. No words can comprehend this, no sensible perception exhaust it. That which is properly aimed at here is not the unsatisfiedness of the eyes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/27-20.htm">Proverbs 27:20</a>), and generally of the mind, thus not the ever-new attractive power which appertains to the eye and the ear of him who observes, but the force with which the restless activity which surrounds us lays hold of and communicates itself to us, so that we also find no rest and contentment. With &#1513;&#1474;&#1489;&#1506;, to be satisfied, of the eye, there is appropriately interchanged &#1504;&#1502;&#1500;&#1488;, used of the funnel-shaped ear, to be filled, i.e., to be satisfied (as at <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/6-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:7</a>). The min connected with this latter word is explained by Zck. after Hitz., "away from hearing," i.e., so that it may hear no more. This is not necessary. As saava' with its min may signify to be satisfied with anything, e.g., <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/6-3.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-22.htm">Job 19:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-13.htm">Psalm 104:13</a>; cf. Kal, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-6.htm">Isaiah 2:6</a>, Pih. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-34.htm">Jeremiah 51:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/127-5.htm">Psalm 127:5</a>. Thus mishshemoa' is understood by all the old translators (e.g., Targ. &#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;), and thus also, perhaps, the author meant it: the eye is not satisfied with seeing, and the ear is not filled (satisfied) with hearing; or yet more in accordance with the Heb. expression: there is not an eye, i.e., no eye is satisfied, etc., restlessly hastening, giving him who looks no rest, the world goes on in its circling course without revealing anything that is in reality new. </body></html>
