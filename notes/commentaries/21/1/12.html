Solomon, in this book called Kohéleth, pre-eminent among Jewish sovereigns as well for wisdom as for temporal prosperity, speaking in the first person, tells how, with all his advantages, he could secure in this life no lasting or satisfying happiness. He relates first how he found no satisfaction from an enlightened survey of human life. He found (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-14.htm" title="I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all is vanity and vexation of spirit.">Ecclesiastes 1:14</a>) that it presented a scene of laborious exertion empty of profitable results. His researches (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-15.htm" title="That which is crooked cannot be made straight: and that which is wanting cannot be numbered.">Ecclesiastes 1:15</a>) only brought to light errors and defects which it was impossible to remedy; so that (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-18.htm" title="For in much wisdom is much grief: and he that increases knowledge increases sorrow.">Ecclesiastes 1:18</a>) the more thought a man bestowed on the subject, the greater his grief.

He found his searches after knowledge weariness, not only to the flesh, but to the mind. The more he saw of the works done under the sun, the more he saw their vanity; and the sight often vexed his spirit. He could neither gain that satisfaction to himself, nor do that good to others, which he expected. Even the pursuit of knowledge and wisdom discovered man's wickedness and misery; so that the more he knew, the more he saw cause to lament and mourn.

Solomon having given a general proof of the vanity of all things here below, and of the insufficiency of them to make men happy, proceeds to particular instances, and begins with human wisdom and knowledge, which of all things might be thought to be most conducive to true happiness; and yet it falls short of it: he instances in himself for proof of it; and he could not have pitched on anyone more proper and pertinent to the purpose, who had all the advantages of obtaining wisdom, was assiduous in his pursuit of it, and made a proficiency in it above all mankind; wherefore he must be owned to be a proper judge, and whatever is concluded by him may be taken for granted as certain; and this is the sum of the following verses to the end of the chapter. Now let it be observed, that he was a "preacher", not a private person, and must have a good share of knowledge to qualify him for teaching and instructing others; and, more than this, he was a king, and did not want money to purchase books, and procure masters to instruct him in all the branches of literature; and when he entered upon the more profound study of wisdom, and especially when he said this, it was not in his infancy or childhood, or before he came to the throne, but after; even after he had asked, wisdom of God to govern, and it had been given him; yea, after he had been a long time king, as he now was; though the Jewish writers, as the Targum, Jarchi, and others, conclude from hence that he was not now a king, but become a private person, deposed or driven from his throne, which does not appear: moreover, he was king of Israel, not over a barbarous people, where darkness and ignorance reigned, but over a "wise and understanding people", as they are called <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-6.htm">Deuteronomy 4:6</a>; and he was king over them in Jerusalem too, the metropolis of the nation; there he had his royal palace, where were not only the temple, the place of divine worship, but a college of prophets, and a multitude of priests, and an abundance of wise and knowing men, whom he had opportunity of conversing with frequently; to which may be added, his large correspondence abroad; persons from all kings and kingdoms came to hear his wisdom, as the queen of Sheba; and by putting questions to him, and so exercising his talents, not a little contributed to the improvement of them. Now a person so qualified must be a judge of wisdom, and what he says deserves attention; and it may be observed, that what he says, as follows, is "in verbo regis et sacerdotis", on the word of a king and preacher, who would never risk his honour, or forfeit his character, by saying an untruth. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/ecclesiastes/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{h}</span> I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem.</span><p>(h) He proves that if any could have attained happiness in this world by labour and study, he should have obtained it, because he had gifts and aids from God to it above all others.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/ecclesiastes/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">12</span>. <span class="ital">I the Preacher was king over Israel</span>] Better, “<span class="bld">I … have been</span> king.” It would, perhaps, be too much to say that this mode of introducing himself, is so artificial as to exclude, as some have thought, the authorship of the historical Solomon. Louis XIV.’s way of speaking of himself “<span class="ital">Quand ĵ etois roi</span>” may well have had its parallel, as Mr Bullock suggests in the <span class="ital">Speaker’s Commentary</span>, in the old age of another king weary of the trappings and the garb of Majesty. As little, however, can they be held to prove that authorship. A writer aiming at a dramatic impersonation of his idea of Solomon would naturally adopt some such form as this and might, perhaps, adopt it in order to indicate that it was an impersonation.

Koheleth relates his own experience as king, in accordance with his assumption of the person of Solomon. The use of the past tense in this verse is regarded by many as strong evidence against the Solomonic authorship of the book. "I have been king" (not "I have become king," as Gratz would translate) is a statement introducing the supposed speaker, not as a reigning monarch, but as one who, in time past, exercised sovereignty. Solomon is represented as speaking from the grave, and recalling the past for the instruction of his auditors. In a similar manner, the author of the Book of Wisdom (8:1-13) speaks in his impersonation of Solomon. That king himself, who reigned without interruption to his death, could not have spoken of himself in the terms used here. He lost neither his throne nor his power; and, therefore, the expression cannot be paralleled (as Mr. Bullock suggests) by the complaint of Louis XIV., unsuccessful in war and weary of rule, "When I was king." Solomon <span class="accented">redivivus</span> is introduced to give weight to the succeeding experiences. Here is one who had every and the most favorable opportunity of seeing the best side of things; and yet his testimony is that all is vanity. In the acquisition of wisdom, the contrast between the advantage of learned leisure and the interruptions of a laborious life is set forth in Ecclus. 38:24, etc. <span class="accented">King over Israel</span>. The expression indicates a time before the division of the kingdom. We have it in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-26.htm">1 Samuel 15:26</a>, and occasionally elsewhere. The usual phrase is "King of Israel." (For <span class="accented">in Jerusalem</span>, see on ver. 1.) <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ecclesiastes/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"It goeth to the south, and turneth to the north; the wind goeth ever circling, and the wind returneth again on its circuits." Thus designedly the verse is long-drawn and monotonous. It gives the impression of weariness. &#1513;&#1473;&#1489; may be 3rd pret. with the force of an abstract present, but the relation is here different from that in 5a, where the rising, setting, and returning stand together, and the two former lie backwards indeed against the latter; here, on the contrary, the circling motion and the return to a new beginning stand together on the same line; &#1513;&#1473;&#1489; is thus a part., as the Syr. translates it. The participles represent continuance in motion. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:4</a> the subjects stand foremost, because the ever anew beginning motion belongs to the subject; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:5</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:6</a>, on the contrary, the pred. stands foremost, and the subject in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:6</a> is therefore placed thus far back, because the first two pred. were not sufficient, but required a third for their completion. That the wind goes from the south (&#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1501;, R. &#1491;&#1512;, the region of the most intense light) to the north (&#1510;&#1508;&#1493;&#1503;, R. &#1510;&#1508;&#1503;, the region of darkness), is not so exclusively true of it as it is of the sun that it goes from the east to the west; this expression requires the generalization "circling, circling goes the wind," i.e., turning in all directions here and there; for the repetition denotes that the circling movement exhausts all possibilities. The near defining part. which is subordinated to "goeth," elsewhere is annexed by "and," e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/1-11.htm">Jonah 1:11</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-30.htm">2 Samuel 15:30</a>; here &#1505;&#1489;&#1489; &#1505;&#1493;&#1489;&#1489; , in the sense of &#1505;&#1489;&#1497;&#1489;  &#1505;&#1489;&#1497;&#1489;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-2.htm">Ezekiel 37:2</a> (both times with Pasek between the words), precedes. &#1505;&#1489;&#1497;&#1489;&#1492; is here the n. actionis of &#1505;&#1489;&#1489;. And "on its circuits" is not to be taken adverbially: it turns back on its circuits, i.e., it turns back on the same paths (Knobel and others), but &#1506;&#1500; and &#1513;&#1473;&#1489; are connected, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/26-11.htm">Proverbs 26:11</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-7.htm">Psalm 19:7</a> : the wind returns back to its circling movements to begin them anew (Hitzig). "The wind" is repeated (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:1</a>) according to the figure Epanaphora or Palindrome (vid., the Introd. to Isaiah, c. 40-66). To all regions of the heavens, to all directions of the compass, its movement is ceaseless, ever repeating itself anew; there is nothing permanent but the fluctuation, and nothing new but that the old always repeats itself. The examples are thoughtfully chosen and arranged. From the currents of air, the author now passes to streams of water. </body></html>
