If a more minute explanation of the double doors is to be given, we may understand the verse as speaking of the closing of the lips on the falling away of the teeth. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/41-14.htm" title="Who can open the doors of his face? his teeth are terrible round about.">Job 41:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/141-3.htm" title="Set a watch, O LORD, before my mouth; keep the door of my lips.">Psalm 141:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/5-7.htm" title="And the remnant of Jacob shall be in the middle of many people as a dew from the LORD, as the showers on the grass, that tarries not for man, nor waits for the sons of men.">Micah 5:7</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">He shall rise up.</span>—No satisfactory explanation of this clause has been given. The following are three of the best interpretations that have been proposed: (1) The old man, whose state has been figuratively described before, is said to sleep so badly that the chirping of a bird will awake him. (2) His voice becomes feeble like the chirping of a bird (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-4.htm" title="And you shall be brought down, and shall speak out of the ground, and your speech shall be low out of the dust, and your voice shall be, as of one that has a familiar spirit, out of the ground, and your speech shall whisper out of the dust.">Isaiah 29:4</a>). (3) The bird of ill omen raises its voice (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/102-6.htm" title="I am like a pelican of the wilderness: I am like an owl of the desert.">Psalm 102:6-7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-14.htm" title="And flocks shall lie down in the middle of her, all the beasts of the nations: both the cormorant and the bittern shall lodge in the upper lintels of it; their voice shall sing in the windows; desolation shall be in the thresholds; for he shall uncover the cedar work.">Zephaniah 2:14</a>).

When a man has the pain of reviewing a misspent life, his not having given up sin and worldly vanities till he is forced to say, I have no pleasure in them, renders his sincerity very questionable. Then follows a figurative description of old age and its infirmities, which has some difficulties; but the meaning is plain, to show how uncomfortable, generally, the days of old age are. As the four verses, 2-5, are a figurative description of the infirmities that usually accompany old age, ver. 6 notices the circumstances which take place in the hour of death. If sin had not entered into the world, these infirmities would not have been known. Surely then the aged should reflect on the evil of sin.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ecclesiastes/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And the doors ... is low - The house is viewed from without.

The Midrash and Jarchi interpret these of the holes of the body; in which they are followed by our learned and ingenuous countryman, Dr. Smith; who, by them, understands the inlets and outlets of the body; and, by the "streets", the ways and passages through which the food goes, and nourishment is conveyed; and which may be said to be shut, when they cease from their use: but it seems much better, with Aben Ezra and others, to interpret them of the lips; which are sometimes called the doors of the mouth, or lips, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/141-3.htm">Psalm 141:3</a>; which are opened both for speaking and eating; but, in aged persons, are much shut as to either; they do not choose to speak much, because of the disagreeableness of their voice, and difficulty of speech, through the shortness of breath, and the loss of teeth; nor do they open them much to eat, through want of appetite; and while eating, are obliged, for want of teeth, to keep their lips close, to retain their food from falling out; they mumble with their lips both in speaking and eating; and, particularly in public, aged persons care not to speak nor eat, for the reason following: though some understand it, more literally, of their having the doors of their houses shut, and keeping within, and not caring to go abroad in the streets, because of their infirmities so the Targum, <p>"thy feet shall be bound from going in the streets;'' <p>when the sound of the grinding is low; which the above Jewish writers, and, after them, Dr. Smith, understand of the stomach, grinding, digesting, and concocting food, and of other parts through which it is conveyed, and the offices they perform; but sound or voice does not seem so well to agree with that; rather therefore this is to be understood, as before, of the grinding of the teeth, through the loss of which so much noise is not heard in eating as in young men, and the voice in speaking is lower; the Targum is, <p>"appetite of food shall depart from thee;'' <p>and he shall rise up at the voice of the bird; that is, the aged person, the least noise awakes him out of sleep; and as he generally goes to bed soon, he rises early at cock crowing, or with the lark, as soon as the voice of that bird or any other, is heard; particularly the cock, which crows very early, and whose voice is heard the most early, and is by some writers (f) emphatically called the bird that calls men to their work; <p>and all the daughters of music shall be brought low; either those that make music, and are the instruments of it, as the lungs, the throat, the teeth, mouth, and lips, so the Targum and Midrash; or those that receive music, as the ears, and the several parts of them, the cavities of them, particularly the tympanum and auditory nerve; all which, through old age, are impaired, and become very unfit to be employed in making music, or in attending to it: the voice of singing men and singing women could not be heard with pleasure by old Barzillai, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-36.htm">2 Samuel 19:36</a>. These clauses are expressive of the weakness which generally old age brings on men; very few instances are there to the contrary; such as of Caleb, who, at eighty five years of age, was as strong as at forty; and of Moses, whose natural force abated not at an hundred and twenty; nor indeed as of Cyrus, who, when seventy years of age, and near his death, could not perceive that he was weaker then than in his youth (g). <p>(f) "Inque suum miseros excitat ales opus", Ovid.

The gates of all houses are closed. None leave their houses; the <span class="bld">noise of the mill ceases. The bird</span> (probably the crane or the swallow) <span class="bld">rises</span> in the air with sharp cries (literally, <span class="bld">for a cry</span>). Even the “daughters of song” (the birds that sing most sweetly, the nightingale or thrush, or possibly the “singing women” of ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-8.htm" title="I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces: I got me men singers and women singers, and the delights of the sons of men, as musical instruments, and that of all sorts.">Ecclesiastes 2:8</a>, whose occupation is gone in a time of terror and dismay) <span class="bld">crouch silently</span>, or perhaps, <span class="bld">chirp in a low tone.</span> Few will dispute the vividness of the picture. The interpretation of the symbols becomes, however, more difficult than ever. The key is probably to be found in the thought that as we had the decay of bodily <span class="ital">organs</span> in the previous verse, so here we have that of bodily <span class="ital">functions</span>. The “doors” (the Hebrew is dual as representing what we call “folding doors”) are the apertures by which the life of processes of sensation and nutrition from its beginning to its end is carried on, and the failure of those processes in extreme age, or in the prostration of paralysis, is indicated by the “shutting” of the doors. What we may call the dual organs of the body, lips, eyes, ears, alike lose their old energies. The <span class="bld">mill</span> (a better rendering than “grinding”) is that which contains the “grinders” of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-3.htm" title="In the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble, and the strong men shall bow themselves, and the grinders cease because they are few, and those that look out of the windows be darkened,">Ecclesiastes 12:3</a>, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> the mouth, by which that process begins, can no longer do its work of vocal utterance rightly. The words “he shall rise up at the voice of the bird” have for the most part been taken as describing the sleeplessness of age, the old man waking at a sparrow’s chirp, but this interpretation is open to the objections (1) that it abruptly introduces the old man as a personal subject in the sentence, while up to this point all has been figurative; and (2) that it makes the clause unmeaning in its relation to the picture of the terror-stricken city, below which we see that of the decay of man’s physical framework. Adopting the construction given above, we get that which answers to the “childish treble” of the old man’s voice, and find a distinct parallel to it in the elegy of Hezekiah “Like a crane or a swallow, so did I chatter” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-14.htm" title="Like a crane or a swallow, so did I chatter: I did mourn as a dove: my eyes fail with looking upward: O LORD, I am oppressed; undertake for me.">Isaiah 38:14</a>); the querulous moaning which in his case was the accompaniment of disease becoming, with the old or the paralysed, normal and continuous. The “daughters of song” are, according to the common Hebrew idiom, those that sing, birds or women, as the case may be. Here, their being “brought low,” <span class="ital">i.e.</span> their withdrawal from the stage of life, may symbolise the failure either of the power to sing, or of the power to enjoy the song of others. The words of Barzillai in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-35.htm" title="I am this day fourscore years old: and can I discern between good and evil? can your servant taste what I eat or what I drink? can I hear any more the voice of singing men and singing women? why then should your servant be yet a burden to my lord the king?">2 Samuel 19:35</a> paint the infirmities of age in nearly the same form, though in less figurative language. “Can thy servant taste what I eat or drink? Can I hear any more the voice of singing men or singing women?” The interpretations which find in the “daughters of song” either (1) the lips as employed in singing, or (2) the ears as drinking in the sounds of song, though each has found favour with many commentators, have less to commend them, and are open to the charge of introducing a needless and tame repetition of phenomena already described.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>With the picture of old age thus far we may compare that, almost cynical in its unsparing minuteness, of Juvenal <span class="ital">Sat.</span> x. 200–239. A few of the more striking parallels may be selected as examples:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“Frangendus misero gingiva panis inermi.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“Bread must be broken for the toothless gums.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“Non eadem vini, atque cibi, torpente palato, Gaudia.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“For the dulled palate wine and food have lost Their former savours.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“Adspice partis<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Nunc damnum alterius; nam quæ cantante voluptas,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Sit licet eximius citharœdus, sitve Seleucus,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Et quibus auratâ mos est fulgere lacernâ?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Quid refert, magni sedeat quâ parte theatri,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Qui vix cornicines exaudiet, atque tubarum<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Concentus.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“Now mark the loss of yet another sense:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>What pleasure now is his at voice of song.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>How choice soe’er the minstrel, artist famed,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Or those who love to walk in golden robes?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>What matters where he sits in all the space<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Of the wide theatre, who scarce can hear<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The crash of horns and trumpets?”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Or again<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“Ille humero, hic lumbis, hic coxâ debilis; ambos<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Perdidit ille oculos, et luscis invidet; hujus<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Pallida labra cibum accipiunt digitis alienis.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Ipse ad conspectum cœnæ diducere rictum<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Suetus, hiat tantùm, ceu pullus hirundinis, ad quem<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Ore volat pleno mater jejuna.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“Shoulders, loins, hip, each failing in its strength<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Now this man finds, now that, and one shall lose<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Both eyes, and envy those that boast but one.…<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And he who used, at sight of supper spread,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>To grin with wide-oped jaw, now feebly gapes,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Like a young swallow, whom its mother bird<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Feeds from her mouth filled, though she fast herself.”<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The doors shall be shut in the streets</span>. Hitherto the symbolism has been comparatively easy to interpret. With this verse inextricable difficulties seem to arise. Of course, in one view it is natural that in the bitter weather, or on the appearance of a tempest, the doors towards the street should be closed, and none should leave the house. But what are meant by the doors in the metaphorical house, the body of the aged man? Jewish expositors understood them to be the pores, or excretive apertures of the body, which lose their activity in old age - which seems an unseemly allusion. Plumptre will have them to be the organs which carry on the processes of sensation and nutrition from the beginning to the end; but it seems a forced metaphor to call these "double-doors." More natural is it to see in the word, with its dual form, the mouth closed by the two lips. So a psalmist speaks of the mouth, the door of the lips (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/141-3.htm">Psalm 141:3</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/7-5.htm">Micah 7:5</a>). As it is only the external door of a house that could be employed in this metaphor, the addition, "in [or, 'towards'] the streets," is accounted for. <span class="cmt_word">When the sound of the grinding is low</span>. The sound of the grinding or the mill is weak and low when the teeth have ceased to masticate, and, instead of the crunching and grinding of food, nothing is heard but a munching and sucking. The falling in of the mouth over the toothless gums is represented as the closing of doors. To take the words in their literal sense is to make the author repeat himself, reiterating what he is supposed to have said before in speaking of the grinding-women - all labor is lessened or stopped. The sound of grinding betokened cheerfulness and prosperity; its cessation would be an ominous sign (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-10.htm">Jeremiah 25:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/18-22.htm">Revelation 18:22</a>). Another interpretation considers this clause to express the imperfect vocal utterance of the old man; but it is hardly likely that the author would call speech "the voice of the grinding," or of the mill, as a metaphor for "mouth." <span class="cmt_word">And he shall rise up at the voice of the bird</span>. This is a very difficult sentence, and has been very variously explained. It is usually taken to mean that the old man sleeps lightly and awakes (for "rises up" may mean no more than that) at the chirrup of a bird. The objection to this interpretation is that it destroys the figurative character of the description, introducing suddenly the personal subject. Of course, it has another signification in the picture of the terror-stricken household; and many interpreters who thus explain the allegory translate the clause differently. Thus Ginsburg renders, "The swallow rises to shriek," referring to the habits of that bird in stormy weather. But there are grammatical objections to this translation, as there are against another suggestion, "The bird (of ill omen) raises its voice." We need not do more than refer to the mystical elucidation which detects here a reference to the resurrection, the voice of the bird being the archangel's trumpet which calls the dead from their graves. Retaining the allegory, we must translate the clause, "He [or, 'it,' <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the voice] rises to the bird's voice;" the old man's voice becomes a "childish treble," like the piping of a little bird. The relaxation of the muscles of the larynx and other vocal organs occasions a great difference in the pitch or power of tone (compare what Hezekiah says, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-14.htm">Isaiah 38:14</a>, "Like a crane or a swallow so did I chatter," though there it is the low murmur of sorrow and complaint that is meant). <span class="cmt_word">And all the daughters of music shall be brought low.</span> "The daughters of song" are the organs of speech, which ere now humbled and fail, so that the man cannot sing a note. Some think that the ears are meant, as St. Jerome writes, Et <span class="accented">obsurdescent omnes filiae carminis</span>, which may have some such notion. Others arrive at a similar signification from manipulation of the verb, thus eliciting the sense - The sounds of singing-women or song-birds are dulled and lowered, are only heard as a faint, unmeaning murmur. This exposition rather contradicts what had preceded, viz. that the old man is awoke by the chirrup of a sparrow; for his ears must be very sensitive to be thus easily affected; unless, indeed, the "voice of the bird" is merely a note of time, equivalent to early cock-crowing. We must not omit Wright's explanation, though it does not commend itself to our mind. He makes a new stanza begin here: "When one rises at the voice of the bird," and sees here a description of the approach of spring, as if the poet said, "When the young and lusty are enjoying the return of genial weather, and the concert of birds with which no musician can compete, the aged, sick in their chambers, are beset with fears and are sinking fast." We fail altogether to read this meaning in our text, wherein we recognize only a symbolical representation of the old man's vocal powers. It is obvious to cite Juvenal's minute and painful description of old age in 'Sat.,' 10:200, etc., and Shakespeare's lines in 'As You Like It' (act 2. sc. 7), where the reference to the voice is very striking- <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"His big, manly voice,<br />Turning again toward childish treble, pipes<br />And whistles in his sound."</span> Cox paraphrases, "The song-birds drop silently into their nests," alarmed at the tempest. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ecclesiastes/11.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"And sweet is the light, and pleasant it is for the eyes to see the sun; for if a man live through many years, he ought to rejoice in them all, and remember the days of darkness; that there will be many of them. All that cometh is vain." Dale translates the copula vav introducing <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/11-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 11:7</a> by "yes," and Bullock by "truly," both thus giving to it a false colouring. "Light," Zckler remarks, stands here for "life." But it means only what the word denotes, viz., the light of life in this world (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/56-14.htm">Psalm 56:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-30.htm">Job 33:30</a>), to which the sun, as the source of it, is related, as &#1502;&#1488;&#1493;&#1512; is to &#1488;&#1493;&#1512;. Cf. Eurip. Hippol., &#x3c9;&#788;&#834; &#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3c1; &#x3ba;.&#x3c4;.&#x3bb;, and Iphigen. in Aulis, 1218-19, &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3bc; &#787; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;.&#x3c4;.&#x3bb;: "Destroy not my youth; to see the light is sweet," etc. The &#1500; in &#1500;&#1506; has the short vowel Pattach, here and at <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>, after the Masora.<p>(Note: Cf. on the contrary, at <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-6.htm">Genesis 3:6</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-26.htm">Proverbs 10:26</a>, where it has the Kametz; cf. also Michlol 53b.)<p>The ki beginning <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/11-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 11:8</a> is translated by Knobel, Hitz., Ewald, and others by "ja" (yes); by Heiligstedt, as if a negative preceded by immo; but as the vav of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/11-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 11:7</a> is copulative "and," so here the ki is causal "for." If it had been said: man must enjoy himself as long as he lives, for the light is sweet, etc., then the joy would have its reason in the opportunity given for it. Instead of this, the occasion given for joy has its reason in this, that a man ought to rejoice, viz., according to God's arrangement and ordinance: the light is sweet, and it is pleasant for the eyes to see the sun; for it ought thus to be, that a man, however long he may live, should continue to enjoy his fair life, especially in view of the night which awaits him. Ki im are not here, as at <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:12</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:15</a>, where a negative precedes, to be taken together; but ki assigns the reason, and im begins a hypothetical protasis, as at <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/8-17.htm">Exodus 8:17</a>, and frequently. Im, with the conclusion following, presents something impossible, as e.g., <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/50-12.htm">Psalm 50:12</a>, si esurirem, or also the extreme of that which is possible as actual, e.g., <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-18.htm">Isaiah 7:18</a>, si peccata vestra sint instar coccini. In the latter case, the clause with the concessive particle may be changed into a sentence with a concessive conjunctive, as at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-22.htm">Isaiah 10:22</a> : "for though thy people, O Israel, be as numerous as the sand of the sea;" and here: "though a man may live ever so many years." The second ki after &#1493;&#1497;&#1494; is the explicat. quod, as at <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-24.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:4</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:17</a>, etc.: he must remember the days of darkness, that there shall be many of them, and, at all events, not fewer than the many years available for the happy enjoyment of life. In this connection kol-shebba' denotes all that will come after this life. If Hitz. remarks that the sentence: "All that is future is vanity," is a false thought, this may now also be said of his own sentence extracted from the words: "All that is, is transitory." For all that is done, in time may pass away; but it is not actually transitory (&#1492;&#1489;&#1500;). But the sentence also respects not all that is future, but all that comes after this life, which must appear as vain (he&#780;vel) to him for whom, as for Koheleth, the future is not less veiled in the dark night of Hades, as it was for Horace, i. 4. 16 s.:<p>"Jam te premet nox fabulaeque<p>Manes Et domus exilis Plutonia."<p>Also, for Koheleth as for Horace, iv. 7. 16, man at last becomes pulvis et umbra, and that which thus awaits him is hevel. Tyler is right, that "the shadowy and unsubstantial condition of the dead and the darkness of Sheol" is thus referred to. &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1488; signifies not that which is nascens, but futurum, e.g., Sanhedrin 27a, "from the present &#1493;&#1500;&#1492;&#1489;&#1488; and for the future" (for which, elsewhere, the expression &#1500;&#1506;&#1514;&#1497;&#1491; &#1500;&#1489;&#1488; is used). The Venet. construes falsely: All (the days) in which vanity will overtake (him); and Luther, referring &#1489;&#1488; as the 3rd pers. to the past, follows the misleading of Jerome. Rightly the lxx and Theod.: &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3be;&#x3b7;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;. </body></html>
