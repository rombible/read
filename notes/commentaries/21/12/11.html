Though the general purpose of the verses is plain, the words used are enigmatical, and one cannot feel great confidence in assigning their precise meaning. The translation of our version fairly represents the original, if it is observed that the words “by” and “which,” which determine the meaning, are in italics. With regard to the “nail,” compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/9-8.htm" title="And now for a little space grace has been showed from the LORD our God, to leave us a remnant to escape, and to give us a nail in his holy place, that our God may lighten our eyes, and give us a little reviving in our bondage.">Ezra 9:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-23.htm" title="And I will fasten him as a nail in a sure place; and he shall be for a glorious throne to his father's house.">Isaiah 22:23</a>. The word “masters” we have had twice in this book already in the sense of possessor, “master of the tongue” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-11.htm" title="Surely the serpent will bite without enchantment; and a babbler is no better.">Ecclesiastes 10:11</a>), “master of wings” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-20.htm" title="Curse not the king, no not in your thought; and curse not the rich in your bedchamber: for a bird of the air shall carry the voice, and that which has wings shall tell the matter.">Ecclesiastes 10:20</a>). “Assemblies” is a word not coming from the same root as that from which Kohéleth is derived. It might mean collections of sayings as well as of people. It is difficult to affix any meaning to the last clause, except that the sages, of whom the verse speaks, have been given for the instruction of the people by Israel’s great Shepherd (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80-1.htm" title="Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, you that lead Joseph like a flock; you that dwell between the cherubim, shine forth.">Psalm 80:1</a>).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/12.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>12:8-14 Solomon repeats his text, VANITY OF VANITIES, ALL IS VANITY. These are the words of one that could speak by dear-bought experience of the vanity of the world, which can do nothing to ease men of the burden of sin. As he considered the worth of souls, he gave good heed to what he spake and wrote; words of truth will always be acceptable words. The truths of God are as goads to such as are dull and draw back, and nails to such as are wandering and draw aside; means to establish the heart, that we may never sit loose to our duty, nor be taken from it. The Shepherd of Israel is the Giver of inspired wisdom. Teachers and guides all receive their communications from him. The title is applied in Scripture to the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God. The prophets sought diligently, what, or what manner of time, the Spirit of Christ in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow. To write many books was not suited to the shortness of human life, and would be weariness to the writer, and to the reader; and then was much more so to both than it is now. All things would be vanity and vexation, except they led to this conclusion, That to fear God, and keep his commandments, is the whole of man. The fear of God includes in it all the affections of the soul towards him, which are produced by the Holy Spirit. There may be terror where there is no love, nay, where there is hatred. But this is different from the gracious fear of God, as the feelings of an affectionate child. The fear of God, is often put for the whole of true religion in the heart, and includes its practical results in the life. Let us attend to the one thing needful, and now come to him as a merciful Saviour, who will soon come as an almighty Judge, when he will bring to light the things of darkness, and manifest the counsels of all hearts. Why does God record in his word, that ALL IS VANITY, but to keep us from deceiving ourselves to our ruin? He makes our duty to be our interest. May it be graven in all our hearts. Fear God, and keep his commandments, for this is all that concerns man.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ecclesiastes/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>literally, Words of wise men are as goads, and as nails driven in (by) masters of assemblies; they are given from one shepherd: "goads," because they rouse the hearer and impel him to right actions; "nails" (perhaps tent-spikes), because they remain fixed in the memory: "masters of assemblies" are simply "teachers" or "preachers" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:1</a> note), instructors of such assemblies as Wisdom addresses <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-20.htm">Proverbs 1:20</a>.<p>One shepherd - i. e., God, who is the supreme Giver of wisdom <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-6.htm">Proverbs 2:6</a>, and the chief Shepherd <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-1.htm">Jeremiah 23:1-4</a>.

However, the mention of "goads" favors the English Version, "masters of assemblies," namely, under-shepherds, inspired by the Chief Shepherd (1Pe 5:2-4). Schmidt translates, "The masters of assemblies are fastened (made sure) as nails," so Isa 22:23.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ecclesiastes/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The words of the wise; </span> not of secularly or politicly wise men, but of the spiritually wise and holy men of God; of which, and not of the former, this whole context treats. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">As goads, and as nails, </span> piercing into men’s dull minds and hard hearts, and quickening and provoking them to the practice of all their duties. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Fastened; </span> which do not only amuse and startle men for the present, as the wise and grave counsels of moral philosophers frequently do, but make powerful and abiding impressions in them; which is the peculiar effect of God’s word. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">By the masters of assemblies; </span> by the teachers of God’s church and people, whether prophets or others, appointed by God for that work. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Which are given from one shepherd; </span> from God, or from Jesus Christ, the great Shepherd and Teacher of the church in all ages, by whose Spirit the ancient prophets, as well as other succeeding teachers, were inspired and taught, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-15.htm" title="And I will give you pastors according to my heart, which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding.">Jeremiah 3:15</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-11.htm" title="Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow.">1 Peter 1:11</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-21.htm" title="For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spoke as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.">2 Peter 1:21</a></span>. And this clause seems to be added partly as the reason of that admirable harmony and agreement which is amongst all the men of God in all ages and places, because they are all taught by one Master, and guided by the same hand; and partly to oblige us to the greater attention and reverence to all their doctrines and counsels, which we are to receive as the word of God, and not of men only, as it is said, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-13.htm" title="For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when you received the word of God which you heard of us, you received it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectually works also in you that believe.">1 Thessalonians 2:13</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/ecclesiastes/12.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>The words of the wise are as goads,.... As the goad teacheth the ox; so the Targum. Not the words of the wise philosophers of that age, or of ages before, or since; but of the inspired penmen of the Scriptures, as Moses, David, Solomon, and of others since; and of all good men, whose doctrines are agreeably to them; these are like "goads" or "pricks", sharp pointed sticks or staves, with which men push and prick their cattle, when driving them from place to place, or ploughing with them: and of a similar use are the doctrines of the word, when attended with a divine efficacy; these are a means of pricking sinners to the heart; and of laying open their vileness and sinfulness to them; and of repentance and contrition; and of awakening them from a sleep in sin to a sense of their danger; and even of killing them, as to their own sense and apprehension of things, and, with respect to their hopes of life, by their own works; as the Philistines were slain by Shamgar with an ox goad, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-31.htm">Judges 3:31</a>; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-37.htm">Acts 2:37</a>; and these are also of use to the saints, as goads, to stir them up, when slothful, to the discharge of duty; and to awaken them, when drowsy, out of their carnal security; and to correct them for their faults, by sharp reproofs and rebukes; as well as to excite them to go on to perfection, who are apt to sit still and lie down; and to direct them to walk straight on, without turning to the right hand or left; <p>and as nails fastened by the masters of assemblies; like these are the truths and doctrines of the word, when they have a place in the heart, and become the "ingrafted word" there; when they are "planted" (e) in the soul, as the word signifies; when they are fixed in the mind and memory, and dwell and abide there: and when as nails, driven into anything, fasten what they are drove into; so these are the means of fastening souls; of causing them to cleave to God and Christ; to the church, and his people, and to one another; and to the Gospel, and their profession of it; hence they are not like children, tossed to and fro, wavering and unstable: of all which "the masters of the assemblies" are the instruments; that is, ministers and pastors of churches. As there were assemblies for religious worship under the law, in which the prophets, priests, and Levites, assisted; so there are assemblies or churches under the Gospel dispensation, which are gathered and meet together for the service of God, and over these the ministers of the word preside; these are set over the churches in the Lord, and have the rule of them; though they are not to lord it over God's heritage, or have the dominion over their faith; but are helpers of their joy, and useful in the above things, through their ministry. Some choose to render "masters of collections", or "gatherings" (f); and think it may respect their gathering truths out of the sacred writings, as the bee gathers honey out of the flowers; in allusion to those that gathered together the choice and pithy sentences and sayings of others, like the men of Hezekiah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/25-1.htm">Proverbs 25:1</a>; or to undershepherds, gathering the sheep into the fold (g), by the order of the principal one; who made use of goads, to drive away thieves or wild beasts; and nails, to preserve the sheepfold whole. And others think that not the words, but the of the assemblies themselves, are compared to "nails", and read them, "and the masters of the assemblies are as nails fastened" (h); are well established, firm and sure; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-23.htm">Isaiah 22:23</a>; and others take it to be no other than an epithet of the nails themselves, and render it, "as nails fixed, which are binders"; that is, great binding nails, which, being fixed in boards, bind, compact, and hold them together; to which the words of the wise may be compared, being the means of compacting and holding together the church of God, comparable to a sheepfold; hence mention is made of the shepherd in the next clause: or of fixing the attention of the minds of men unto them, and of retaining them in memory, and to which they speak of as first principles, and never swerve from them (i); but, that not ministers, the instruments, but the principal and efficient cause, may have the glory, is added, <p>which are given from one Shepherd; not Zerubbabel, as Grotius; nor Moses, as the Targum, Jarchi, and Alshech; but Christ, the one Shepherd, set over the flock; and under whom the masters of assemblies, or pastors of churches, are, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-23.htm">Ezekiel 37:23</a>; from whom they have their gifts and qualifications, their mission and commissions; and are given to the churches, as pastors and teachers, to feed them, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-10.htm">Ephesians 4:10</a>; and from whom they have their food, the Gospel and the doctrines of it, to feed the flocks with, assigned to their care, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-8.htm">John 17:8</a>; though this is to be understood not to the exclusion of God, the Father of Christ, by whom all Scripture is inspired; nor of the Spirit, by whom holy men of God spake as they were moved, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16</a>. <p>(e) "plantati", Pagninus, Montanus, Tigurine version, Rambachius.

They assert that its words also, sweet as they seem, are not without their sting, though, like the prick of the goad, it is for good and not for evil, urging men on to strong and vigorous labour in the fields of thought and action. The comparison was a natural one in any country, but we are reminded of what was said of the words of Pericles that his eloquence “left a sting (<span class="greekheb">κέντρον</span>) in the minds of his hearers (Eupolis, quoted by Liddell and Scott, <span class="ital">s. v.</span> <span class="greekheb">κέντρον</span>), and in part also of the Greek proverb, consecrated for us by a yet higher application (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-5.htm" title="And he said, Who are you, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom you persecute: it is hard for you to kick against the pricks.">Acts 9:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-14.htm" title="And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking to me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why persecute you me? it is hard for you to kick against the pricks.">Acts 26:14</a>) that “it is hard to kick against the pricks,” as applicable to resisting wisdom as well as to defying power (Æsch. <span class="ital">Agam</span>. 1633, Pindar, <span class="ital">Pyth</span>, ii. 173).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">as nails fastened by the masters of assemblies</span>] The word for “nails” is found in this, or a cognate form, with that meaning in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-7.htm" title="So the carpenter encouraged the goldsmith, and he that smoothes with the hammer him that smote the anvil, saying, It is ready for the soldering: and he fastened it with nails, that it should not be moved.">Isaiah 41:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-4.htm" title="They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails and with hammers, that it move not.">Jeremiah 10:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-3.htm" title="And David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates, and for the joinings; and brass in abundance without weight;">1 Chronicles 22:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/3-9.htm" title="And the weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold. And he overlaid the upper chambers with gold.">2 Chronicles 3:9</a>; and there is no adequate reason for taking it here, as some have done (Ginsburg), in the sense of the “stakes” of a tent. The word “by” however is an interpolation, and the words taken as they stand would run <span class="bld">as nails fastened are the masters of assemblies.</span> The whole analogy of the Hebrew is against our referring the last words to any but persons, and we must therefore reject the interpretation that the “words of the wise are as goads, as fastened nails which are put together in collections” (Delitzsch). The “masters of assemblies” (not, as it has been rendered (Tyler) “editors of collections”,) can be none else than the heads or leaders of a body of learned men, like the Great Synagogue of the traditions of the time of Ezra and Nehemiah, or the Sanhedrin of a later date. In “the fastened nail” we have a symbolism like that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-23.htm" title="And I will fasten him as a nail in a sure place; and he shall be for a glorious throne to his father's house.">Isaiah 22:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/9-8.htm" title="And now for a little space grace has been showed from the LORD our God, to leave us a remnant to escape, and to give us a nail in his holy place, that our God may lighten our eyes, and give us a little reviving in our bondage.">Ezra 9:8</a>, and seen also in the Rabbinic proverb, “Well for the man who has a nail to hang things on” (Dukes, <span class="ital">Rabbin. Blumenlese</span>, p. 121). In both these cases, it will be noted, the word refers to persons. It is the fitting emblem of fixity and permanence, and forms the natural complement to that of the goads. As it has been well put (Ginsburg), the two words express the several aspects of Truth as progressive and conservative.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">which are given from one shepherd</span>] The noun is used often in the O. T. both in its literal sense, and of kings and rulers as the shepherds of their people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-8.htm" title="The priests said not, Where is the LORD? and they that handle the law knew me not: the pastors also transgressed against me, and the prophets prophesied by Baal, and walked after things that do not profit.">Jeremiah 2:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-15.htm" title="And I will give you pastors according to my heart, which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding.">Jeremiah 3:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-19.htm" title="Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan against the habitation of the strong: but I will suddenly make him run away from her: and who is a chosen man, that I may appoint over her? for who is like me? and who will appoint me the time? and who is that shepherd that will stand before me?">Jeremiah 49:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-44.htm" title="Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan to the habitation of the strong: but I will make them suddenly run away from her: and who is a chosen man, that I may appoint over her? for who is like me? and who will appoint me the time? and who is that shepherd that will stand before me?">Jeremiah 50:44</a>; Ezekiel 34 <span class="ital">passim</span>), and of God as the great Shepherd of Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/23-1.htm" title="The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want.">Psalm 23:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80-1.htm" title="Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, you that lead Joseph like a flock; you that dwell between the cherubim, shine forth.">Psalm 80:1</a>, and by implication, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-23.htm" title="And I will set up one shepherd over them, and he shall feed them, even my servant David; he shall feed them, and he shall be their shepherd.">Ezekiel 34:23</a>). We have to choose accordingly between the two latter meanings. The words either assert that all the varied forms of the wisdom of the wise come from God, or that all the opinions, however diversified, which are uttered by “the masters of assemblies,” are subject to the authority of the President of the assembly. The first gives, it is believed, the most satisfactory meaning, and so taken, the words express the truth declared, without symbolism, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/12-1.htm" title="Now concerning spiritual gifts, brothers, I would not have you ignorant....">1 Corinthians 12:1-11</a>. It was not, perhaps, without some reference to this thought, though scarcely to this passage, that our Lord claimed for Himself as the one true Guide and Teacher of mankind the title of the “Good Shepherd,” and condemned all that had come before Him, assuming that character, as thieves and robbers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-8.htm" title="All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them.">John 10:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-11.htm" title="I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd gives his life for the sheep.">John 10:11</a>), and that St Peter speaks of Him as the “chief Shepherd” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-4.htm" title="And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, you shall receive a crown of glory that fades not away.">1 Peter 5:4</a>) over all who exercise a pastoral office in the Church of Christ.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The words of the wise are as goads</span>. The connection of this verse with the preceding is maintained by the fact that the "acceptable words," etc., are words of the wise, emanate from the same persons. Herewith he proceeds to characterize them, with especial reference to his own work. The goad was a rod with an iron spike, or sharpened at the end, used in driving oxen (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-31.htm">Judges 3:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-21.htm">1 Samuel 13:21</a>; Ecclus. 38:25; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-5.htm">Acts 9:5</a>). Words of wisdom are called goads because they rouse to exertion, promote reflection and action, restrain from error, impel to right; if they hurt and sting, the pain which they inflict is healthful, for good and not for evil. <span class="cmt_word">And as nails fastened by the masters of assemblies</span>. The proposition "by" is an interpolation, and the sentence should run: Ant/ <span class="accented">like nails fastened</span> [<span class="accented">are</span>] <span class="accented">the, etc</span>. <span class="accented">- masmeroth</span>, "nails," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-7.htm">Isaiah 41:7</a>. There is much difficulty in explaining the next words, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5e1;&#x5bb;&#x5e4;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> (<span class="accented">baale asuppoth</span>). We have had similar expressions applied to possessors in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:11</a>, "lord of the tongue," and "lord of wings" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-20.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:20</a>); and analogy might lead us to apply the phrase here to-persons, and not things; but in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-15.htm">Isaiah 41:15</a> we find a threshing-instrument termed "lord of teeth;" and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-20.htm">2 Samuel 5:20</a> a town is called Baal-Perazim, "Lord of breaches;" so we must be guided by other considerations in our exposition. The Septuagint, taking the whole sentence together, and regarding <span class="accented">baals</span> as a preposition, renders, "As nails firmly planted, (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x7b;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1fb6;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>) which from the collections were given from one shepherd." Schleus-her takes <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x7b;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> to mean, "<span class="accented">Ii</span> quibus munus datum erat collectionem faciendi," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the author, of collections. The Vulgate has, <span class="accented">Verba</span>...  <span class="accented">quae per magistrorum consilium data sunt a pastore uno</span>. The "masters of assemblies" can only be the chiefs of some learned conclaves, like the great synagogue supposed to exist in the time of Ezra and later. The clause would then assert that these pundits are like fastened nails, which seems rather unmeaning. One might say that their uttered sentiments became fixed in the mind as nails firmly driven in, but one could not properly say this of the men themselves. A late editor, Gietmann, suggests that "lords of collection" may mean "brave men, heroes, gathered in line of battle," serried ranks, just as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/22-20.htm">Proverbs 22:20</a> the <span class="accented">term shalishim</span>, chariot-fighters, chieftains, is applied to choice proverbs. Thus he would say that the words of the wise are as goads because they stimulate the intellect, as nails because they readily find entrance, and like men in battle array when they are reduced to writing and marshaled in a book. This is certainly ingenious, but somewhat too artificial to be regarded as the genuine intention of the writer. It seems best to take the word translated "assemblies" as denoting collections, not of people, but of proverbs; and the compound phrase would thus mean proverbs of an excellent character, the best of their sort gathered together in writing. Such words are well compared to nails; they are no longer floating loosely about, they are fixed in the memory, they secure other knowledge, and, though they are separate utterances, they have a certain unity and purpose. Nails are often used proverbially as emblems of what is fixed and unalterable. Thus AEschyl., 'Suppl.,' 944 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;&#x1fef;&#x39d;&#x39b;&#x1ffd;&#x393;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x1f70;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x1f61;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Through them a nail is firmly fixed, that they<br />May rest immovable."</span> Cicero, 'Verr.,' 2:5.21, "Ut hoc beneficium, quemadmodum dicitur, trabali clave figeret;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to make it sure and steadfast (comp.

But we do not <span class="accented">know</span> that such supervision existed or was exercised at the time when Koheleth wrote; and, as we saw above, there is probably no reference to any such assemblies in the passage. The "one shepherd" is doubtless Jehovah, who is called the Shepherd of Israel, who feeds his people like a flock, etc. (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/48-15.htm">Genesis 48:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-24.htm">Genesis 49:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/23-1.htm">Psalm 23:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80-1.htm">Psalm 80:1</a>, etc.). The appellation is here used as concinnous with the thought of the ox-goad, intimating that God watches and leads his people like a tender shepherd and a skilful farmer. This is an important claim to inspiration. All these varied utterances, whatever form they take, whether his own or his predecessor's, are outcomes of wisdom, and proceed from him who is only wise, Almighty God. It is no disparagement of this work to imply that it is not the production of the true Solomon; Koheleth is ready to avow himself the writer, and yet claims a hearing as being equally moved by heavenly influence. It is like St. Paul's assertion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-40.htm">1 Corinthians 7:40</a>), "I think that I also have the Spirit of God." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ecclesiastes/12.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:5</a><p>From this his repugnance to singing, and music, and all loud noises, progress in the description is made to the difficulty such aged men have in motion: "Also they are afraid of that which is high; and there are all kinds of fearful things in the way ... ." The description moves forward in a series of independent sentences; that &#1513;&#1473; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1501; to which it was subordinate in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-3.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:3</a>, and still also in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:4</a>, is now lost sight of. In the main it is rightly explained by the Talm., and with it the Midrash: "Even a little hillock appears to him like a high mountain; and if he has to go on a journey, he meets something that terrifies him;" the Targ. has adopted the second part of this explanation. &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1492;&#1468; (falsely referred by the Targ. to the time lying far back in the past) is understood neut.; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>. Such decrepid old men are afraid of (&#1497;&#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;, not videbunt, as the lxx, Symm., Ar., and the Venet. translate, who seem to have had before them the defective &#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;) a height, - it alarms them as something unsurmountable, because their breath and their limbs fail them when they attempt it; and hathhhattim (plur. of the intensifying form of hat, consternatio, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/41-25.htm">Job 41:25</a>), i.e., all kinds of formidines (not formido, Ewald, 179a, Bttch. 762, for the plur. is as in salsilloth, 'aph'appim, etc., thought of as such), meet them in the way. As the sluggard says: there is a lion in the way, and under this pretence remains slothfully at home, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-13.htm">Proverbs 24:13</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/22-13.htm">Proverbs 22:13</a>, so old men do not venture out; for to them a damp road appears like a very morass; a gravelly path, as full of neck-breaking hillocks; an undulating path, as fearfully steep and precipitous; that which is not shaded, as oppressively hot and exhausting-they want strength and courage to overcome difficulties, and their anxiety pictures out dangers before them where there are none.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:5</a><p>The allegory is now continued in individual independent figures: "And the almond tree is in blossom." The Talm. explains &#1493;&#1497;&#1503; &#1492;&#1513; of the haunch-bone projecting (from leanness); the Midrash, of the bones of the vertebral column, conceived of as incorruptible and as that round which will take place the future restoration of the human body, - probably the cross bone, os sacrum, <p>(Note: The Jewish opinion of the incorruptible continuance of this bone may be connected with the designation os sacrum; the meaning of this is controverted, vid., Hyrtl's Anatomie, 124.)<p>inserted between the two thigh bones of the pelvis as a pointed wedge; cf. Jerome in his Comm.: quidam sacram spinam interpretantur quod decrescentibus natium cornibus spina accrescat et floreat; &#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1494; is an Old Heb., Aram., and Arab. name of the almond tree and the almond nut (vid., under <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/30-37.htm">Genesis 30:37</a>), and this, perhaps, is the reason of this identification of the emblematic &#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1491; with &#1500;&#1493;&#1494; (the os sacrum, or vertebra magna) of the spine. The Targ. follows the Midrash in translating: the &#1512;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1513;&#1473;&#1494; (the top of the spine) will protrude from leanness like an almond tree (viz., from which the leaves have been stripped). In these purely arbitrary interpretations nothing is correct but (1) that &#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1491; is understood not of the almond fruit, but of the almond tree, as also at <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-11.htm">Jeremiah 1:11</a> (the rod of an almond tree); (2) that &#1497;&#1504;&#1488;&#1509; (notwithstanding that these interpreters had it before them unpointed) is interpreted, as also by the lxx, Syr., Jerome, and the Venet., in the sense of blossoming, or the bursting out of blossoms by means of the opening up of the buds. Many interpreters understand &#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1512; of almond fruit (Winzer, Ewald, Ginsb., Rdiger, etc.), for they derive &#1497;&#1504;&#1488;&#1509; from &#1504;&#1488;&#1509;, as Aben Ezra had already done, and explain by: fastidit amygdalam (nucem), or fastidium creat amygdala. But (1) &#1497;&#1504;&#1488;&#1509; for &#1497;&#1504;&#1488;&#1509; (Hiph. of &#1504;&#1488;&#1509;, to disdain, to treat scornfully) is a change of vowels unexampled; we must, with such an explanation, read either &#1497;&#1504;&#1468;&#1488;&#1509;, fastiditur (Gaab), or &#1497;&#1504;&#1488;&#1509;; (2) almond nuts, indeed, belong to the more noble productions of the land and the delicacies, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/43-11.htm">Genesis 43:11</a>, but dainties, &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4; &#787; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;, at the same time they are not, so that it would be appropriate to exemplify the blunted sensation of taste in the old man, by saying that he no more cracks and eats almonds. The explanation of Hitzig, who reads &#1497;&#1504;&#1488;&#1509;, and interprets the almond tree as at Sol 7:9 the palm, to denote a woman, for he translates: the almond tree refuses (viz., the old man), we set aside as too ingenious; and we leave to those interpreters who derive &#1497;&#1504;&#1488;&#1509; from &#1504;&#1488;&#1509;, and understand &#1492;&#1513;&#1511;&#1491; <p>(Note: Abulwald understands &#1513;&#1511;&#1512; and &#1495;&#1490;&#1489; sexually, and glosses the latter by jundub (the locust), which in Arab. is a figure of suffering and patience.)<p>of the glans penis (Bttch., Frst, and several older interpreters), to follow their own foul and repulsive criticism. &#1497;&#1504;&#1488;&#1509; is an incorrect reading for &#1497;&#1504;&#1509;, as at <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/10-14.htm">Hosea 10:14</a>, &#1511;&#1488;&#1501; for &#1511;&#1501;, and, in Prov., &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; for &#1512;&#1513;&#1473; (Gesen. 73. 4); and besides, as at Sol 6:11, &#1492;&#1504;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;, regular Hiph. of &#1504;&#1510;&#1509; (&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-15.htm">Lamentations 4:15</a>), to move tremblingly (vibrate), to glisten, blossom (cf. &#1504;&#1493;&#1505;, to flee, and &#1504;&#1497;&#1505;&#1503;, Assyr. nisannu, the flower-month). Thus deriving this verbal form, Ewald, and with him Heiligst., interprets the blossoming almond tree as a figure of the winter of life: "it is as if the almond tree blossomed, which in the midst of winter has already blossoms on its dry, leafless stem." But the blossoms of the almond tree are rather, after <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/17-2.htm">Numbers 17:2-8</a>, a figure of special life-strength, and we must thus, thrown back to &#1497;&#1504;&#1488;&#1509; from &#1504;&#1488;&#1509; (to flourish), rather explain, with Furrer (in Schenkel's B. L.), as similarly Herzf.: the almond tree refuses, i.e., ceases, to blossom; the winter of old age is followed by no spring; or also, as Dale and Taylor: the almond tree repels, i.e., the old man has no longer a joyful welcome for this messenger of spring. But his general thought has already found expression in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:2</a>; the blossoming almond tree must be here an emblem of a more special relation. Hengst. supposes that "the juniper tree (for this is the proper meaning of &#1513;&#1511;&#1491;) is in bloom" is  equals  sleeplessness in full blossom stands by the old man; but that would be a meaningless expression. Nothing is more natural than that the blossoming almond tree is intended to denote the same as is indicated by the phrase of the Latin poet: Intempestivi funduntur vertice cani (Luther, Geiger, Grot., Vaih., Luzz., Gurlitt, Tyler, Bullock, etc.).<p>It has been objected that the almond blossoms are not pure white, but according to the variety, they are pale-red, or also white; so that Thomson, in his beautiful Land and the Book, can with right say: "The almond tree is the type of old age whose hair is white;" and why? "The white blossoms completely cover the whole tree." Besides, Bauer (1732) has already remarked that the almond blossoms, at first tinged with red, when they are ready to fall off become white as snow; with which may be compared a clause cited by Ewald from Bodenstedt's A Thousand and One Days in the Orient: "The white blossoms fall from the almond trees like snow-flakes." Accordingly, Dchsel is right when he explains, after the example of Zckler: "the almond tree with its reddish flower in late winter, which strews the ground with its blossoms, which have gradually become white like snow-flakes, is an emblem of the winter of old age with its falling silvery hair."<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:5</a><p>From the change in the colour of the hair, the allegory now proceeds to the impairing of the elasticity of the highs and of their power of bearing a load, the malum coxae senile (in a wider than the usual pathological sense): "And the grasshopper (i.e., locust, &#1495;&#1490;&#1489;, Samar. &#1495;&#1512;&#1490;&#1489;&#1492;  equals  &#1495;&#1512;&#1490;&#1468;&#1500;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-22.htm">Leviticus 11:22</a>) becomes a burden." Many interpreters (Merc., Dderl., Gaab, Winz., Gesen., Winer, Dale) find in these words &#1492;&#1495; &#1493;&#1497;&#1505; the meaning that locust-food, or that the chirping of grasshoppers, is burdensome to him (the old man); but even supposing that it may at once be assumed that he was a keen aeridophagus (locusts, steeped in butter, are like crabs (shrimps) spread on slices of butter and bread), or that he had formerly a particular delight in the chirping of the &#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3be;, which the ancients number among singing birds (cf. Taylor, l.c.), and that he has now no longer any joy in the song of the &#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3be;, although it is regarded as soothing and tending to lull to rest, and an Anacreon could in his old days even sing his &#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd; &#x3c3;&#x3b5; &#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3be;, - yet these two interpretations are impossible, because &#1492;&#1505; may mean to burden and to move with difficulty, but not "to become burdensome." For the same reason, nothing is more absurd than the explanation of Kimchi and Gurlitt: Even a grasshopper, this small insect, burdens him; for which Zckl., more naturally: the hopping and chirping of the grasshopper is burdensome to him; as we say, The fly on the wall annoys him. Also Ewald and Heiligstedt's interpretation: "it is as if the locust raised itself to fly, breaking and stripping off its old husk," as inadmissible; for &#1492;&#1505;&#1514;&#1489;&#1500; can mean se portare laboriose, but not ad evolandum eniti; the comparison (Arab.) tahmmal gains the meaning of hurry onwards, to proceed on an even way, like the Hebr. &#1492;&#1513;&#1499;&#1497;&#1501;, to take upon the shoulder; it properly means, to burden oneself, i.e., to take on one's back in order to get away; but the grasshopper coming out of its case carries away with it nothing but itself. For us, such interpretations - to which particularly, the advocates of the several hypotheses of a storm, night, and mourning, are constrained - are already set aside by this, that according to the allegory &#1493;&#1497;&#1503; &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;, &#1492;&#1495; &#1493;&#1497;&#1505; must also signify something characteristic of the body of an old man. The lxx, Jerome, and Ar. translate: the locust becomes fat; the Syr.: it grows. It is true, indeed, that great corpulence, or also a morbid dropsical swelling of the belly (ascites), is one of the symptoms of advanced old age; but supposing that the (voracious) locust might be en emblem of a corpulent man, yet &#1492;&#1505;&#1514;&#1489;&#1500; means neither to become fat nor to grow. But because the locust in reality suggests the idea of a corpulent man, the figure cannot at the same time be intended to mean that the old man is like a skeleton, consisting as it were of nothing but skin and bone (Lyra, Luther, Bauer, Dathe); the resemblance of a locust to the back-bone and its joints (Glassius, Khler, Vaih.) is not in view; only the position of the locusts's feet for leaping admits the comparison of the prominent scapulae (shoulder-blades); but shoulder-blades (scapulae alatae), angular and standing out from the chest, are characteristics of a consumptive, not of a senile habit. Also we must cease, with Hitz., Bttch., Luzz., and Gratz, to understand the figure as denoting the &#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; to be now impotent; for relaxation and shrinking do not agree with hctbl, which suggests something burdensome by being weighty.<p>The Midrash interprets &#1492;&#1495;&#1490;&#1489; by "ankles," and the Targ. translates accordingly: the ankles (&#1488;&#1505;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;, from the Pers. ustuwa&#770;r, firm) of thy feet will swell-unsuitably, for "ankles" affords no point of comparison with locusts, and they have no resemblance to their springing feet. The Talm., glossing &#1492;&#1495;&#1490;&#1489; by "these are the buttocks" (nates) (cf. Arab. 'ajab, the os coccygis, Syn. 'ajuz, as the Talm. &#1506;&#1490;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514; interchanges with &#1506;&#1489;&#1493;&#1494;), is on the right track. There is nothing, indeed, more probably than that &#1492;&#1490;&#1489; is a figure of the coxa, the hinder region of the pelvis, where the lower part of the body balances itself in the hip-joint, and the motion of standing up and going receives its impulse and direction by the muscular strength there concentrated. This part of the body may be called the locust, because it includes in itself the mechanism which the two-membered foot for springing, placed at an acute angle, presents in the locust. Referred to this coxa, the loins, &#1497;&#1505;&#1514;&#1489;&#1500; has its most appropriate meaning: the marrow disappears from the bones, elasticity from the muscles, the cartilage and oily substance from the joints, and, as a consequence, the middle of the body drags itself along with difficulty; or: it is with difficulty moved along (Hithpa. as pass., like <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:10</a>); it is stiff, particularly in the morning, and the old man is accustomed to swing his arms backwards, and to push himself on as it were from behind. In favour of this interpretation (but not deciding it) is the accord of &#1495;&#1490;&#1489; with &#1506;&#1490;&#1489;  equals  &#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3be; (by which the os coccygis is designated as the cuckoo's bone). Also the verbal stem (Arab.) jah&#803;ab supplies an analogous name: not jah&#803;ab, which denotes the air passage (but not, as Knobel supposes, the breath itself; for the verb signifies to separate, to form a partition, Mish. &#1502;&#1495;&#1497;&#1510;&#1495;), but (Arab.) jah&#803;abat, already compared by Bochart, which denotes the point (dual), the two points or projections of the two hip-bones (vid., Lane's Lex.), which, together with the os sacrum lying between, form the ring of the pelvis.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:5</a><p>From the weakening of the power of motion, the allegory passes on to the decay of sensual desires, and of the organs appertaining thereto: "And the caper-berry fails ... ." The meaning "caper" for &#1492;&#1488;&#1489; is evidence by the lxx (&#x3b7;&#788; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, Arab. alkabar), the Syr., and Jerome (capparis), and this rendering is confirmed by the Mishnic &#1488;&#1489;&#1497;&#1493;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514;, which in contradistinction to &#1514;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;, i.e., the tender branches, and &#1511;&#1508;&#1512;&#1497;&#1505;&#1497;&#1503;, i.e., the rind of fruit, signifies the berry-like flower-buds of the caper bush, <p>continued...</body></html>
