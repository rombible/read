These are the words of one that could speak by dear-bought experience of the vanity of the world, which can do nothing to ease men of the burden of sin. As he considered the worth of souls, he gave good heed to what he spake and wrote; words of truth will always be acceptable words. The truths of God are as goads to such as are dull and draw back, and nails to such as are wandering and draw aside; means to establish the heart, that we may never sit loose to our duty, nor be taken from it. The Shepherd of Israel is the Giver of inspired wisdom. Teachers and guides all receive their communications from him. The title is applied in Scripture to the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God. The prophets sought diligently, what, or what manner of time, the Spirit of Christ in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow. To write many books was not suited to the shortness of human life, and would be weariness to the writer, and to the reader; and then was much more so to both than it is now. All things would be vanity and vexation, except they led to this conclusion, That to fear God, and keep his commandments, is the whole of man. The fear of God includes in it all the affections of the soul towards him, which are produced by the Holy Spirit. There may be terror where there is no love, nay, where there is hatred. But this is different from the gracious fear of God, as the feelings of an affectionate child. The fear of God, is often put for the whole of true religion in the heart, and includes its practical results in the life. Let us attend to the one thing needful, and now come to him as a merciful Saviour, who will soon come as an almighty Judge, when he will bring to light the things of darkness, and manifest the counsels of all hearts. Why does God record in his word, that ALL IS VANITY, but to keep us from deceiving ourselves to our ruin? He makes our duty to be our interest. May it be graven in all our hearts. Fear God, and keep his commandments, for this is all that concerns man.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ecclesiastes/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>By these - i. e., "By the words of wise men."<p>Books - Rather, "Writings."

Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, may be intended, for whose sake, more especially, this book might be written; though it may take in every hearer of this divine preacher, every disciple of this teacher, every subject of his kingdom, as well as every reader of this book, whom he thus addresses, and for whom he was affectionately concerned as a father for a son; that they might be enlightened with divine knowledge, warned of that which is evil, and admonished and advised to that which is good; "by these" words and writings of his own, and other wise men; and by these masters of assemblies, who, and their words, are from the one and chief Shepherd; to these they would do well to take heed, and to these only or chiefly. It may be rendered, "and what is the more excellent of these, he admonished" (k); to observe what is mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:13</a>, and lies in a few words, "Fear God", &amp;c. and especially Jesus Christ, the "Alpha" and "Omega", the sum and substance of the whole Bible; of what had been written in Solomon's time, and has been since: he is the most excellent part of it; or that which concerns him, in his person, offices, and grace: or thus; "and what is above", or "more than these, beware of" (l); do not trouble thyself with any other writings; these are sufficient, all that is useful and valuable is to be found in them; and as for others, if read, read them with care and caution, and only as serving to explain these, and to promote the same ends and designs, or otherwise to be rejected; <p>of making many books there is no end; many books, it seems, were written in Solomon's time; there was the same itch of writing as now, it may be; but what was written was not to be mentioned with the sacred writings, were comparatively useless and worthless. Or the sense is, should Solomon, or any other, write ever so many volumes, it would be quite needless; and there would be no end of writing, for these would not give satisfaction and contentment; and which yet was to be had in the word of God; and therefore that should be closely attended to: though this may be understood, not only of making or composing books, but of getting them, as Aben Ezra; of purchasing them, and so making them a man's own. A man may lay out his money, and fill his library with books, and be very little the better for them; what one writer affirms, another denies; what one seems to have proved clearly, another rises up and points out his errors and mistakes; and this occasions replies and rejoinders, so that there is no end of these things, and scarce any profit by them; which, without so much trouble, may be found in the writings of wise men, inspired by God, and in which we should rest contented; <p>and much study is a weariness of the flesh; the study of languages, and of each of the arts and sciences, and of various subjects in philosophy and divinity, particularly in writing books on any of these subjects; which study is as fatiguing to the body, and brings as much weariness on it, as any manual and mechanic operation; it dries up the moisture of the body, consumes the spirits, and gradually and insensibly impairs health, and brings on weakness, as well as weariness. Some render it, "much reading", as Jarchi, and so Mr. Broughton; and Aben Ezra observes, that the word in the Arabic language so signifies: the Arabic word "lahag" signifies to desire anything greedily, or to be greedily given and addicted to anything (m); and so may denote such kind of reading here, or such a person who is "helluo", a glutton at books, as Cato is said to be. And now reading books with such eagerness, and with constancy, is very wearisome, and is to little advantage; whereas reading the Scripture cheers and refreshes the mind, and is profitable and edifying. Gussetius (n) interprets it of much speaking, long orations, which make weary. <p>(k)  "potius inquam ex istis", Junius &amp; Tremellius; "quod potissimum ex istis", Gejerus.

It is significant, as noted above, that this appears here for the first time in this book.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">of making many books there is no end</span>] The words, which would have been singularly inappropriate as applied to the scanty literature of the reign of the historical Solomon, manifestly point to a time when the teachers of Israel had come in contact with the literature of other countries, which overwhelmed them with its variety and copiousness, and the scholar is warned against trusting to that literature as a guide to wisdom. Of that copiousness, the Library at Alexandria with its countless volumes would be the great example, and the inscription over the portals of that at Thebes that it was the Hospital of the Soul (<span class="greekheb">ἰατρεῖον ψυχῆς</span>, Diodor. Sic. i. 49) invited men to study them as the remedy for their spiritual diseases. Conspicuous among these, as the most voluminous of all, were the writings of Demetrius Phalereus (Diog. Laert. v. 5. 9), and those of Epicurus, numbering three hundred volumes (Diog. Laert. x. 1. 17), and of his disciple Apollodorus, numbering four hundred (Diog. Laert. x. 1. 15), and these and other like writings, likely to unsettle the faith of a young Israelite, were probably in the Teacher’s thought. The teaching of the Jewish Rabbis at the time when Koheleth was written was chiefly oral, embodying itself in maxims and traditions, and the scantiness of its records must have presented a striking contrast to the abounding fulness of that of the philosophy of Greece. It was not till a much later period that these traditions of the elders were collected into the Mishna and the Gemara that make up the Talmud. Scholars sat at the feet of their teacher, and drank in his words, and handed them on to their successors. The words of the wise thus orally handed down are contrasted with the “many books.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">much study is a weariness of the flesh</span>] The noun for “study” is not found elsewhere in the O. T., but there is no doubt as to its meaning. What men gain by the study of many books is, the writer seems to say, nothing but a headache, no guidance for conduct, no solution of the problems of the universe. They get, to use the phrase which Pliny (<span class="ital">Epp.</span> vii. 9) has made proverbial, “<span class="ital">multa, non multum</span>.” We are reminded of the saying of a higher Teacher that “one thing is needful” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-42.htm" title="But one thing is needful: and Mary has chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her.">Luke 10:42</a>). The words of Marcus Aurelius, the representative of Stoicism, when he bids men to “free themselves from the thirst for books” (<span class="ital">Medit</span>. ii. 3), present a striking parallel. So again, “Art thou so unlettered that thou canst not read, yet canst thou abstain from wantonness, and be master of pain and pleasure (<span class="ital">Meditt</span>. vii. 8).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12-14.</span> - The author warns against profitless study, and gives the final conclusion to which the whole discussion leads. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And further, by these, my son, be admonished</span>; rather, <span class="accented">and what is more than these, be warned</span>. Besides all that has been said, take this additional and important caution, viz. what follows. The clause, however, has been differently interpreted, as if it said, "Do not attempt to go beyond the words of the sages mentioned above; or, "Be content with my counsels; they will suffice for your instruction." This seems to be the meaning of the Authorized Version. The personal address, "my son," so usual in the Book of Proverbs, is used by Koheleth in this place alone. It does not necessarily imply relationship (as if the pseudo-Solomon was appealing to Rehoboam), but rather the condition of pupil and learner, sitting at the feet of his teacher and friend. <span class="cmt_word">Of malting many books there is no end.</span> This could not be said in the time of the historical Solomon, even if we reckon his own voluminous works (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-32.htm">1 Kings 4:32, 33</a>); for we know of no other writers of that date, and it is tolerably certain that none existed in Palestine. But we need not suppose that Koheleth is referring to extraneous heathen productions, of which, in our view, there is no evidence that he possessed any special knowledge. Doubtless many thinkers in his time had treated of the problems discussed in his volume in a far different manner from that herein employed, and it seemed good to utter a warning against the unprofitable reading of such productions. Juvenal speaks of the insatiable passion for writing in his day ('Sat.,' 7:51) - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Tenet insanabile multos<br />Scribendi cacoethes et aegro in corde senestit;"</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>which Dryden renders - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"The charms of poetry our souls bewitch;<br />The curse of writing is an endless itch."</span> As in taking food it is not the quantity which a man eats, but what he digests and assimilates, that nourishes him, so in reading, the rule, <span class="accented">Non multa, sed multum</span>, must be observed; the gorging the literary appetite on food wholesome or not impedes the healthy mental process, and produces no intellectual growth or strength. The obvious lesson drawn by spiritual writers is that Christians should make God's Word their chief study, "turning away from the profane babblings and oppositions of the knowledge which is falsely so called" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-20.htm">1 Timothy 6:20</a>). For as St. Augustine says ('De Doctr. Christ.'), "Whereas in Holy Scripture you will find everything which has been profitably said elsewhere, to a far greater extent you will therein find what has been nowhere else enunciated, but which has been taught solely by the marvelous sublimity and the equally marvelous humility of the Word of God." <span class="cmt_word">Much study is a weariness of the flesh.</span> The two clauses in the latter part of the verse are co-ordinate. Thus the Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f74;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> ("weariness") <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>. The word for "study" (<span class="accented">lahag</span>) is not found elsewhere in the Old Testament, nor in the Talmud, but the above meaning is sustained by its connection with an Arabic word signifying "to be eager for." The Vulgate (like the Septuagint) renders it <span class="accented">meditatio</span>. You may weary your brain, exhaust your strength, by protracted study or meditation on many books, but you will not necessarily thereby gain any insight into the problems of the universe or guidance for daily life. Marcus Aurelius dissuades from much reading: "Would you examine your whole composition?" he says; "pray, then let your library alone; what need you puzzle your thoughts and over-grasp yourself?" Again, "As for books, never be over-eager about them; such a fondness for reading will be apt to perplex your mind, and make you die unpleased" ('Medit.,' 2:2, 3, Collier). So Ben-Sira affirms, "The finding out of parables is a wearisome Labor of the mind" (Ecclus. 13:26). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ecclesiastes/12.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>A third 'ad asher lo now follows (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/5-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:1-2</a>); the first placed the old man in view, with his dsagrment in general; the second described in detail his bodily weaknesses, presenting themselves as forerunners of death; the third brings to view the dissolution of the life of the body, by which the separation of the soul and the body, and the return of both to their original condition is completed. "Ere the silver cord is loosed, and the golden bowl is shattered, and the pitcher is broken at the fountain, and the wheel is shattered in the well, and the dust returns to the earth as that which it was, and the spirit returns to God who gave it." Before entering into the contents of these verses, we shall consider the form in which some of the words are presented. The Cheth&#305;&#770;b &#1497;&#1512;&#1495;&#1511; we readily let drop, for in any case it must be said that the silver cord is put out of action; and this word, whether we read it &#1497;&#1512;&#1495;&#1511; or &#1497;&#1512;&#1495;&#1511; (Venet. &#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#837;&#834;), is too indefinite, and, supposing that by the silver cord a component part of the body is meant, even inappropriate, since the organs which cease to perform their functions are not removed away from the dead body, but remain in it when dead. But the Keri &#1497;&#1512;&#1514;&#1511; ("is unbound") has also its difficulty. The verb &#1512;&#1514;&#1511; signifies to bind together, to chain; the bibl. Heb. uses it of the binding of prisoners, <a href="http://biblehub.com/nahum/3-18.htm">Nahum 3:18</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-19.htm">Isaiah 40:19</a>; the post-bibl. Heb. of binding  equals  shutting up (contrast of &#1508;&#1514;&#1495;, Pesikta, ed. Buber, 176a, whence Mezia 107b, &#1513;&#1493;&#1512;&#1488; &#1493;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514;&#1511;&#1488;, a wall and enclosure); the Arab. of shutting up and closing a hole, rent, split (e.g., murtatik&#803;, a plant with its flower-buds as yet shut up; rutu&#770;k&#803;, inaccessibleness).

Since, however, we still need here the idea of setting loose or tearing asunder (lxx &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#837;&#834;; Symm. &#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;; Syr. &#1504;&#1514;&#1508;&#1505;&#1511;, from &#1508;&#1468;&#1505;&#1511;, abscindere; Jerome, rumpatur), we have only the choice of interpreting ye&#772;rathe&#772;q either, in spite of the appearance to the contrary, in the meaning of constingitur, of a violent drawing together of the cord stretched out lengthwise; or, with Pfannkuche, Gesen., Ewald, to read &#1497;&#1504;&#1468;&#1514;&#1511; ("is torn asunder"), which one expects, after <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-20.htm">Isaiah 33:20</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/16-9.htm">Judges 16:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-20.htm">Jeremiah 10:20</a>.

But perhaps it is meant by &#1492;&#1494;&#1468;&#1492;&#1489;. The gullah above the candlestick which Zechariah saw was, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/4-12.htm">Zechariah 4:12</a>, provided with two golden pipes, in which were two olive trees standing on either side, which sunk therein the tuft-like end of their branches, of which it is said that they emptied out of themselves hazzahav into the oil vessels. Here it is manifest that hazzahav means, in the one instance, the precious metal of which the pipes are formed; and in the other, the fluid gold of the oil contained in the olive branches. Accordingly, Hitzig understands gullath hazzahav here also; for he takes gullah as a figure of the body, the golden oil as a figure of the soul, and the silver cord as a figure of vital energy.<p>Thus, with Hitz., understanding gullath hazzahav after the passage in Zechariah, I have correctly represented the meaning of the figures in my Psychol. p. 228, as follows: - "The silver cord  equals  the soul directing and bearing the body as living; the lamp hanging by this silver cord  equals  the body animated by the soul, and dependent on it; the golden oil  equals  the spirit, of which it is said, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-27.htm">Proverbs 20:27</a>, that it is a lamp of God." I think that this interpretation of the golden oil commends itself in preference to Zckler's interpretation, which is adopted by Dchsel, of the precious fluidum of the blood; for if hazzahav is a metaphorical designation of oil, we have to think of it as the material for burning and light; but the principle of bright life in man is the spirit (ruahh hhayim or nishmath hhayim); and in the passage in Zechariah also, oil, which makes the candlestick give light, is a figure of the spirit (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:6</a>, ki im-beruhhi). But, as one may also suppose, it is not probable that here, with the same genit. connection, &#1492;&#1499;&#1505;&#1507; is to be understood of the material and the quality; and hazzqahav, on the contrary, of the contents. A golden vessel is, according to its most natural meaning, a vessel which is made of gold, thus a vessel of a precious kind. A golden vessel cannot certainly be broken in pieces, but we need not therefore understand an earthenware vessel only gilded, as by a silver cord is to be understood only that which has a silver line running through it (Gesen. in the Thes.); &#1512;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509; may also denote that which is violently crushed or broken, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-3.htm">Isaiah 42:3</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-53.htm">Judges 9:53</a>. If gullath hazzahav, however, designates a golden vessel, the reference of the figure to the body, and at the same time of the silver cord to the vital energy or the soul, is then excluded, - for that which animates stands yet above that which is animated, - the two metallic figures in this their distribution cannot be comprehended in this reference. We have thus to ask, since gullath hazzahav is not the body itself: What in the human body is compared to a silver cord and to a golden vessel? What, moreover, to a pitcher at the fountain, and to a wheel or a windlass? Winzer settles this question by finding in the two double figures only in general the thoughts represented: antequam vita ex tenui quasi filo suspensa pereat, and (which is essentially the same) antequam machina corporis destruatur.<p>Gurlitt also protests against the allegorical explanation of the details, but he cannot refrain from interpreting more specially than Winzer. Two momenta, he says, there are which, when a man dies, in the most impressive way present themselves to view: the extinction of consciousness, and the perfect cessation, complete ruin, of the bodily organism. The extinction of consciousness is figuratively represented by the golden lamp, which is hung up by a silver cord in the midst of a house or tent, and now, since the cord which holds it is broken, it falls down and is shattered to pieces, so that there is at once deep darkness; the destruction of the bodily organism, by a fountain, at which the essential parts of its machinery, the pitcher and windlass, are broken and rendered for ever useless. This interpretation of Gurlitt's affords sufficient support to the expectation of the allegorical meaning with which we approached <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:6</a>; and we would be satisfied therewith, if one of the figures did not oppose us, without seeking long for a more special allegorical meaning: the pitcher at the fountain or well (&#1499;&#1468;&#1491;, not &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1491;, because determined by 'al-hammabu'a) is without doubt the heart which beats to the last breath of the dying man, which is likened to a pitcher which, without intermission, receives and again sends forth the blood. That the blood flows through the body like living water is a fact cognizable and perceptible without the knowledge of its course; fountain (&#1502;&#1511;&#1493;&#1512;) and blood appear also elsewhere as associated ideas, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/12-7.htm">Leviticus 12:7</a>; and nishbar, as here vetishshabe&#780;r, into a state of death, or near to death, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-9.htm">Jeremiah 23:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-21.htm">Psalm 69:21</a>. From this gullath hazzahav must also have a special allegorical sense; and if, as Gurlitt supposes, the golden vessel that is about to be destroyed is a figure of the perishing self-consciousness (whereby it is always doubtful that, with this interpretation, the characteristic feature of light in the figure is wanting), then it is natural to go further, and to understand the golden vessel directly of the head of a man, and to compare the breaking of the skull, <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/9-53.htm">Judges 9:53</a>, expressed by vataritz eth-gulgolto, with the words here before us, vatharutz gullath hazzahav; perhaps by gullath the author thought of the cogn. - both as to root and meaning - &#1490;&#1500;&#1490;&#1500;&#1514;; but, besides, the comparison of the head, the bones of which form an oval bowl, with gullath is of itself also natural. It is true that, according to the ancient view, not the head, but the heart, is the seat of the life of the spirit; "in the heart, Ephrem said (Opp. Syr. ii. 316), the thinking spirit (shuschobo) acts as in its palace;" and the understanding, the Arabians <p>(Note: Vid., Noldeke's Poesien d. alten Araber, p. 190.)<p>also say, sits in the heart, and thus between the ribs. Everything by which &#1489;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512; and &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; is affected - thus, briefly formulated, the older bibl. idea - comes in the &#1500;&#1489; into the light of consciousness. But the Book of Koheleth belongs to a time in which spiritual-psychical actions began to be placed in mediate causal relation with the head; the Book of Daniel represents this newer mode of conception, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-28.htm">Daniel 2:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-2.htm">Daniel 4:2</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/7-10.htm">Daniel 7:10</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-15.htm">Daniel 7:15</a>. The image of the monarchies seen in Nebuchadnezzar's dream, <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/2-32.htm">Daniel 2:32</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/2-28.htm">Daniel 2:28</a>, had a golden head; the head is described as golden, as it is the membrum praecipuum of the human body; it is compared to gold as to that which is most precious, as, on the other hand, &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; is used as a metaphorical designation of that which is most precious. The breaking to pieces of the head, the death-blow which it receives, shows itself in this, that he who is sick unto death is unable to hold his head erect, that it sinks down against his will according to the law of gravity; as also in this, that the countenance assumes the aspect which we designate the facies hippocratica, and that feeling is gradually destroyed; but, above all, that is thought of which Ovid says of one who was dying: et resupinus humum moribundo vertice pulsat.<p>If we now further inquire regarding the meaning of the silver cord, nothing can obviously be meant by it which is locally above the golden bowl which would be hanging under it; also &#1492;&#1499;&#1505;&#1507; &#1490;&#1500;&#1514; itself certainly admits no such literal antitype, - the concavity of the &#1490;&#1500;&#1490;&#1500;&#1514; is below, and that of a &#1490;&#1500;&#1492;, on the other hand, is above. The silver cord will be found if a component part of the structure of the body is pointed to, which stands in a mutually related connection with the head and the brain, the rending asunder of which brings death with it. Now, as is well known, dying finally always depends on the brain and the upper spinal marrow; and the ancients already interpreted the silver cord of the spinal marrow, which is called by a figure terminologically related to the silver cord, &#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1496; &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1491;&#1512;&#1492; (the spinal cord), and as a cord-like lengthening of the brain into the spinal channel could not be more appropriately named; the centre is grey, but the external coating is white. We do not, however, maintain that hakke&#780;se&#780;ph points to the white colour; but the spinal marrow is related, in the matter of its value for the life of man, to the brain as silver is to gold. Since not a violent but a natural death is the subject, the fatal stroke that falls on the spinal marrow is not some kind of mechanical injury, but, according as &#1497;&#1512;&#1514;&#1511; is unbound is explained or is changed into &#1497;&#1504;&#1468;&#1514;&#1511; is torn asunder, is to be thought of either as constriction  equals  shrinking together, consuming away, exhaustion; or as unchanging  equals  paralysis or disabling; or as tearing asunder  equals  destruction of the connection of the individual parts. The emendation &#1497;&#1504;&#1514;&#1511; most commends itself; it remains, however, possible that &#1497;&#1504;&#1514;&#1511; is meant in the sense of morbid contraction (vid., Rashi); at any rate, the fate of the &#1490;&#1500;&#1492; is the consequence of the fate of the &#1495;&#1489;&#1500;, which carries and holds the gullah, and does not break without at the same time bringing destruction on it; as also the brain and the spinal marrow stand in a relation of solidarity to each other, and the head receives <p>(Note: Many interpreters (lately Ewald, Hengst., Zckl., Taylor, and others) understand the silver cord of the thread of life; the spinal marrow is, without any figure, this thread of life itself.)<p>continued...</body></html>
