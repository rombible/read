We should remember our duties, and set about them, looking to him for grace and strength. This should be done early, while the body is strong, and the spirits active. When a man has the pain of reviewing a misspent life, his not having given up sin and worldly vanities till he is forced to say, I have no pleasure in them, renders his sincerity very questionable. Then follows a figurative description of old age and its infirmities, which has some difficulties; but the meaning is plain, to show how uncomfortable, generally, the days of old age are. As the four verses, 2-5, are a figurative description of the infirmities that usually accompany old age, ver. 6 notices the circumstances which take place in the hour of death. If sin had not entered into the world, these infirmities would not have been known. Surely then the aged should reflect on the evil of sin.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ecclesiastes/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>High - The powerful and the proud, such persons as an old man in his timidity might shrink from opposing or meeting: or, high ground which old men would avoid ascending.<p>Fears ... in the way - Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/26-13.htm">Proverbs 26:13</a>.<p>The almond tree - The type of old age.

Or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. The back, which fitly follows after the head, upon which the almond tree flourished, in which the strength of the body lay, and which formerly was able to bear great burdens, but now, through its weakness and crookedness, is a burden too heavy for itself. And some of the Jewish and other interpreters understand this word, which others render <span class="ital">locust</span> or <span class="ital">grasshopper</span>, to be some part of the body, either the <span class="ital">back-bone</span>, or <span class="ital">the head of the thigh bone</span>, or <span class="ital">the ankle-bone</span>, any of which may well be said to be heavy or burdensome to itself, when it moves slowly and listlessly, and not without difficulty and trouble. <span class="ital">Desire</span>, to wit, of meats, and drinks, and music, and other carnal delights, which are vehemently desired by men in the heat of their youth, but are unsavoury to old men; of which see an instance <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-35.htm" title="I am this day fourscore years old: and can I discern between good and evil? can your servant taste what I eat or what I drink? can I hear any more the voice of singing men and singing women? why then should your servant be yet a burden to my lord the king?">2 Samuel 19:35</a></span>.

The first clause, however, is fairly clear if we omit the interpolated “<span class="ital">when</span>.” <span class="bld">They</span> (the indefinite plural, with the force of the French <span class="ital">on</span>) <span class="bld">shall be afraid of a height,</span> or <span class="bld">hill.</span> The new form of the sentence, the opening words also, indicate that the picture of the storm has been completed, and that symbolism of another kind comes in. We see, as it were, another slide in the magic lantern of the exhibiter. To be “afraid of a hill” expresses not merely or chiefly the failure of strength of limbs to climb mountains, but the temper that, as we say, makes “mountains out of molehills,” which, like the slothful man of <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/22-13.htm" title="The slothful man said, There is a lion without, I shall be slain in the streets.">Proverbs 22:13</a>, sees “a lion in the path.” There are “fears in the way.” Imaginary terrors haunt the aged. Here again we have a parallel in Latin poetry:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“Multa senem circumveniunt incommoda; vel quòd<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Quærit et inventis miser abstinet, ac timet uti,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Vel quòd res omnes timidè gelidèque ministrat.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“Many the troubles that attend the old;<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>For either still he sets his mind on gains<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And dares not touch, and fears to use his gains,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Or deals with all things as with chill of fear.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Horace, <span class="ital">Ep. ad Pis.</span> 169–71.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>So Aristotle among the characteristics of age notes that the old are <span class="greekheb">δειλοὶ καὶ πάντα προφοβητικοὶ</span> (timid and in all things forecasting fears) (<span class="ital">Rhet</span>. ii. 23). The interpreters who carry the idea of a storm through the whole passage explain the passage: “They (the people of the city) shall be afraid of that which is coming from on high,” <span class="ital">i.e.</span> of the gathering storm-clouds, but for the reasons above given, that interpretation seems untenable.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and the almond tree shall flourish</span>] The true meaning is to be found, it is believed, in the significance of the Hebrew name for almond tree (<span class="ital">Sheked</span> = the early waking tree, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-11.htm" title="Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying, Jeremiah, what see you? And I said, I see a rod of an almond tree.">Jeremiah 1:11</a>), and the enigmatic phrase describes the <span class="ital">insomnia</span> which often attends old age. The tree that flourishes there is the tree of <span class="ital">Vigilantia</span> or Wakefulness. As might be expected, the discordant interpretations of commentators multiply, and we may record, but only in order to reject them, the more notable of these. (1) The almond blossoms represent the white hairs of age. Those blossoms are, however, pink and not white, and few persons would find a likeness in the two objects thus compared. (2) The verb rendered “shall flourish” has been derived from a root with the meaning “to loathe—scorn—reject,” and the sentence has been explained either (2) he (the old man) loathes the almond, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> has no taste for dainties, or (3) turns away from the almond tree, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> has no welcome for the messenger of spring, or (4), with the same sense as (2), “the almond causes loathing.” Anatomical expositors strain their fancies to find in the almond that which answers to (5) the thigh bone, or (6) the vertebral column, or some other part of the body which age affects with weakness. Into the discussion what part best answers to the almond we need not follow them.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and the grasshopper shall be a burden</span>] The word translated “grasshopper” is one of the many terms used, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-13.htm" title="If I shut up heaven that there be no rain, or if I command the locusts to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among my people;">2 Chronicles 7:13</a>, for insects of the locust class, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-22.htm" title="Even these of them you may eat; the locust after his kind, and the bald locust after his kind, and the beetle after his kind, and the grasshopper after his kind.">Leviticus 11:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-33.htm" title="And there we saw the giants, the sons of Anak, which come of the giants: and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight.">Numbers 13:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-22.htm" title="It is he that sits on the circle of the earth, and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers; that stretches out the heavens as a curtain, and spreads them out as a tent to dwell in:">Isaiah 40:22</a>, where the A. V. has “grasshopper.” It will be noted that in some of these passages (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-33.htm" title="And there we saw the giants, the sons of Anak, which come of the giants: and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight.">Numbers 13:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-22.htm" title="It is he that sits on the circle of the earth, and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers; that stretches out the heavens as a curtain, and spreads them out as a tent to dwell in:">Isaiah 40:22</a>) it plays the part of the “mustard seed” of the Gospel parable (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-31.htm" title="Another parable put he forth to them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field:">Matthew 13:31</a>) as the type of that which is the extreme of diminutiveness. And this we can scarcely doubt is its meaning here. “That which is least weighty is a burden to the timidity of age.” Assuming the writer to have come in contact with the forms of Greek life, the words may receive an illustration from its being the common practice of the Athenians to wear a golden grasshopper in their heads as the symbol of their being <span class="ital">autochthones</span>, “sprung from the soil.” Such an ornament is to the old man more than he cares to carry, and becomes another symbol of his incapacity to support the least physical or mental burden. As before we note a wide variety of other, but, it is believed, less tenable, explanations. (1) The locust has been looked on as, like the almond, another dainty article of food, which the terror of the storm, or the loss of appetite in age, renders unattractive. Commonly indeed they are said to have been eaten only by the poor, but Aristotle (<span class="ital">Hist. Anim</span>. v. 30) names them as a delicacy, and the Arabs are said to consider them as such now (Ginsburg). Entering once more on the region of anatomical exposition we have the grasshopper taken (2) for the bone of the <span class="ital">pelvis</span> which becomes sharp and prominent in age, (3) for the stomach which swells with dropsy, (4) for the ankles swelling from the same cause, and so on through various other members.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and desire shall fail</span>] The word translated “desire” is not found elsewhere in the Old Testament, and this rendering rests on a somewhat doubtful etymology. The LXX. version, which may be admitted as shewing in what sense the word was taken at a very early date, and with which the Rabbinic use of the word agrees, gives <span class="greekheb">κάππαρις</span>, which the Vulgate reproduces in <span class="ital">capparis</span>, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> the caper or <span class="ital">Capparis spinosa</span> of botanists. It is in favour of this rendering that it preserves the enigmatic symbolism of the two previous clauses, while “desire” simply gives an abstract unfigurative term, out of harmony with the context. Possibly indeed the name was given to the plant as indicating its qualities as a restorative and stimulant (Plutarch, <span class="ital">Sympos</span>.; Athenæus, <span class="ital">Deipnos</span>, ix. p. 405). The pickled capers of modern cookery are the buds of the shrub, but the berries and leaves are reputed to possess the same virtues. Hence one of the Epicures in Athenæus (<span class="ital">Deipnos</span>. ix. p. 370) takes <span class="greekheb">Νὴ τὸν κάππαριν</span> (By the caper!) as a favourite oath, just as a modern <span class="ital">gourmet</span> might swear by some favourite sauce. So understood the meaning of the passage seems fairly clear. <span class="bld">The caper-berry shall fall</span>, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> shall no longer rouse the flagging appetite of age. There shall be a <span class="ital">longa oblivio</span> of what the man had most delighted in. It would seem indeed from the account of the <span class="ital">capparis</span> given by Pliny (<span class="ital">Hist. Nat.</span> xx. 59) that its medicinal virtues were of a very varied character. It was a remedy for paralysis and diseases of the kidneys and the liver, for tooth-ache and ear-ache, for scrofula and phagedænic ulcers. The words describe accordingly the infirmity which no drugs, however potent, can cure. It is as when Shakespeare says that “poppy and mandragora” shall fail to minister the “sweet sleep” of yesterday, as when we say of a man in the last stage of decrepitude that “no quinine or phosphorus will help him now.” See the <span class="ital">Ideal Biography</span> in the <span class="ital">Introduction</span>, ch. iii. So understood the <span class="bld">Debater</span> speaks with a scorn like that of Euripides (<span class="ital">Suppl</span>. 1060) of the attempts of the old to revive their flagging desires and avert the approach of death.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">μισῶ δ</span>ʼ <span class="greekheb">ὅσοι χρῄζουσιν ἐκτείνειν βίον</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">λουτροῖσι</span>, <span class="greekheb">καὶ στρωμναῖσι καὶ μαγέυμασιν</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"></span>“I hate them, those who seek to lengthen life<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>With baths, and pillows, and quack-doctor’s drugs.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Substantially most commentators agree in this meaning. The anatomical school, however, identify it, as before, with this or that bodily organ affected by old age, and one writer (Rosenmüller) thinks that the point of comparison is found in the fact that the caper-berry as it ripens, bends the stalk with its weight, and then splits open and lets the seeds fall out.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">because man goeth to his long home</span>] Literally, <span class="bld">to the house of his eternity, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> to his eternal home.</span> The description of the decay of age is followed by that of death as the close of all, and for a time, perhaps to link together the two symbolical descriptions, the language of figurative imagery is dropped. The “eternal home” is, of course, the grave (the phrase is stated by Ginsburg to be in common use among modern Jews), or more probably, <span class="ital">Sheol</span>, or Hades, the dwelling-place of the dead. In <a href="http://apocrypha.org/tobit/3-6.htm" title="Now therefore deal with me as seemeth best unto thee, and command my spirit to be taken from me, that I may be dissolved, and become earth: for it is profitable for me to die rather than to live, because I have heard false reproaches, and have much sorrow: command therefore that I may now be delivered out of this distress, and go into the everlasting place: turn not thy face away from me.">Tob 3:6</a>, “the everlasting place” seems used of the felicity of Paradise, and it is, at least, obvious that the thought of immortality, though not prominent, is not excluded here. The term <span class="ital">Domus æterna</span> appears often on the tombs of Rome in Christian as well as non-Christian inscriptions, probably as equivalent to the “everlasting habitations” of <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-9.htm" title="And I say to you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when you fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations.">Luke 16:9</a>, and in these cases it clearly connotes more than an “eternal sleep.” An interesting parallel is found in the Assyrian legend of Ishtar, in which Hades is described as the “House of Eternity,” the “House men enter, but cannot depart from; the Road men go to, but cannot return” (<span class="ital">Records of the Past</span>, i. 143).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the mourners go about the streets</span>] Literally, in the singular, the <span class="bld">street</span> or <span class="bld">market-place.</span> The words bring before us the most prominent feature of Eastern funerals. The burial-place was always outside the city, and the body was borne on an open bier through the streets and open places of the city, and the hired mourners, men and women, followed with their wailing cries, praising the virtues, or lamenting the death, of the deceased (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-31.htm" title="And David said to Joab, and to all the people that were with him, Rend your clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and mourn before Abner. And king David himself followed the bier.">2 Samuel 3:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-10.htm" title="Weep you not for the dead, neither bemoan him: but weep sore for him that goes away: for he shall return no more, nor see his native country.">Jeremiah 22:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-18.htm" title="Therefore thus said the LORD concerning Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah; They shall not lament for him, saying, Ah my brother! or, Ah sister! they shall not lament for him, saying, Ah lord! or, Ah his glory!">Jeremiah 22:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/5-38.htm" title="And he comes to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and sees the tumult, and them that wept and wailed greatly.">Mark 5:38</a>). Sometimes these were short and simple, like the “Ah brother! Ah, sister! Ah, his glory!” of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-18.htm" title="Therefore thus said the LORD concerning Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah; They shall not lament for him, saying, Ah my brother! or, Ah sister! they shall not lament for him, saying, Ah lord! or, Ah his glory!">Jeremiah 22:18</a>. Sometimes they developed into elegiac poems like the lamentations of David over Saul and Jonathan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_samuel/1-17.htm" title="And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son:...">2 Samuel 1:17-27</a>), and Abner (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_samuel/3-32.htm" title="And they buried Abner in Hebron: and the king lifted up his voice, and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people wept....">2 Samuel 3:32-34</a>). So we have in the Talmud (quoted by Dukes, <span class="ital">Rabbin. Blumenlese</span>, pp. 256, 257) examples such as the following, “The palms wave their heads for the just man who was like a palm”—“If the fire falls upon the cedar what shall the hyssop on the wall do?” It is obvious that such elegies would often take the form of a figurative description of death, and that which follows in the next verse may well have been an echo from some such elegy.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Also when they shall be afraid of that which is high</span>. There is no "when" in the original, which runs, "Also, or yea, they fear on high." "They" are old men, or, like the French <span class="accented">on</span>, "people" indefinitely; and the clause says that they find difficulty in mounting an ascent, as the Vulgate renders, <span class="accented">Excelsa</span> <span class="accented">quoque timebant</span>. Shortness of breath, asthmatic tendencies, failure of muscular power, make such an exertion arduous and burdensome, just as in the previous verse a similar cause rendered singing impossible. The description is now arriving at the last stage, and allegorizing the closing scene. The steep ascent is the <span class="accented">via dolorosa</span>, the painful process of dying, from which the natural man shrinks; for as the gnome says - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x1fc7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f61;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x1fb7;</span><br /><span class="accented">"None dotes on life more than the aged man."</span> The old man is going on the appointed road, <span class="cmt_word">and fears shall be in the way</span>; or, <span class="accented">all sorts of fears</span> (plural of intensity) <span class="accented">are in the path</span>; as in his infirm condition he can walk nowhere without danger of meeting with some accident, so analogously, as he contemplates his end and the road he has to travel, "fearfulness and trembling come upon him, and horror overwhelms him" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55-5.htm">Psalm 55:5</a>). Plumptre sees in these clauses a further adumbration of the inconveniences of old age, how that the decrepit man makes mountains of mole-hills, is full of imaginary terrors, always forecasting sad events, and so on; but this does not carry on the picture to the end which the poet has now in view, and seems tame and commonplace. The supporters of the storm-theory explain the passage as denoting the fears of the people at what is coming from on high - the gathering tempest, these fears extending to those on the highway, - which is feeble. <span class="cmt_word">And the almond tree shall flourish</span>; or, <span class="accented">is in blossom</span>. The old man is thus figured from the observed aspect of this tree. It blossoms in winter upon a leafless stem, and its flowers, at first of a pale pink color, turn to a snowy whiteness as they fall from the branches. The tree thus becomes a fit type of the arid, torpid-looking old man with his white hair. So Wright quotes Virgil, 'AEneid,' 5:416 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Temporibus geminis canebat sparsa senectus;ETT*> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>though there the idea is rather of mingled black and grey hair than of ahead of snowy whiteness. Canon Tristram ('Nat. Hist. of the Bible,' p. 332), referring to the usual version of this clause, adds, "But the better interpretation seems to be, that as the almond blossom ushers in the spring, so do the signs referred to in the context indicate the <span class="accented">hastening</span> (<span class="accented">shaked</span>, 'almond,' meaning also 'hasten') of old age and death." Plumptre adopts the notion that the name of the tree is derived from a stem meaning <span class="accented">"to watch,"</span> and that thus it may be called <span class="accented">the early-waking tree</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-11.htm">Jeremiah 1:11</a>), the enigmatic phrase describing the wakefulness that often attends old age. But this seems a refinement by no means justified by the use of the word. Others find in the verb the signification <span class="accented">"to</span> disdain, loathe," and explain that the old man has lost his taste for almond nuts, which <span class="accented">seems to be</span> an unnecessary observation after the previous allusions to his toothless condition, the cracking and eating of such things requiring the grinders to be in perfect order. The versions are unanimous in translating the clause as the Authorized Version. Thus the Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x1f7b;&#x3b3;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>: <span class="accented">Vulgate, fiorebit amygdalus</span>. (So Verier. and the Syriac.) Wright takes this clause and the next to indicate the opening of spring, when nature reawakens from its winter sleep, and the dying man can no longer respond to the call or enjoy the happy season. The expositors who adhere to the notion of the storm would translate, "the almond shall be rejected," alluding to fear taking away appetite; but the rendering is faulty. <span class="cmt_word">And the grasshopper shall he a burden.</span> <span class="accented">Chagab</span>, rendered "grasshopper" here and <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-22.htm">Leviticus 11:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-33.htm">Numbers 13:33</a>, etc., is rightly translated "locust" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-15.htm">2 Chronicles 7:15</a>. It is one of the smaller species of the insect, as is implied by its use in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-22.htm">Isaiah 40:22</a>, where from the height of heaven the inhabitants of earth are regarded as <span class="accented">chagabim</span>. The clause is usually explained to mean that the very lightest burden is troublesome to old age, or that the hopping and chirping of these insects annoy the querulous senior. But who does not see the incongruity of expressing the disinclination for labor and exertion by the figure of finding a grasshopper too heavy to carry? Who would think of carrying a grasshopper? Plumptre, who discovers Greek allusions in the most unlikely places, sees here an intimation of the writer's acquaintance with the Athenians' custom of wearing a golden grasshopper on their heads as a token that they were <span class="accented">autochthones</span>, "sprung from the soil." Few will be disposed to concur with this opinion. Ginsburg and others consider that Koheleth is regarding the locust as an article of food, which it was and still is in the East (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-21.htm">Leviticus 11:21, 22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-4.htm">Matthew 3:4</a>). In some places it is esteemed a great delicacy, and is cooked and prepared in a variety of ways. So here the writer is supposed to mean that dainties shall tempt in vain; even the much-esteemed locust shall be loathed. But we cannot imagine this article of food, which indeed was neither general nor at all seasons procurable, being singled out as an appetizing esculent. The solution of the enigma must be sought elsewhere. The Septuagint gives, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span>: the Vulgate, <span class="accented">imping</span>, <span class="accented">uabitur locusts</span>, "the locust grows fat. Founded on this rendering is the opinion which considers that under this figure is depicted the corpulence or dropsical swelling that sometimes accompanies advanced life. But this morbid and abnormal condition could not be introduced into a typical description of the usual accompaniments of age, even if the verb could be rightly translated as the Greek and Latin versions give it, which is more than doubtful. Delitzsch, after some Jewish interpreters, considers that under the term "locust" is meant the loins or hips, or <span class="accented">caput femoris</span>, which is thus named" because it includes in itself the mechanism which the two-membered foot for springing, placed at an acute angle, presents in the locust." The poet is thought to allude to the loss of elasticity in the hips and the inability to bear any weight. We cannot agree to the propriety of this artificial explanation, which seems to have been invented to account for the expressions in the text, rather than to be founded on fact. But though we reject this elucidation of the figure, we think Delitzsch and some others are right in taking the verb in the sense of "to move heavily, to crawl along." "The locust crawls," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the old man drags his limbs heavily and painfully along, like the locust just hatched in early spring, and as yet not furnished with wings, which makes it8 way clumsily and slowly. The analogy derives another feature from the fact, well attested, that the appearance of the locust was synchronous with the days considered most fatal to old people, namely, the seven at the end of January and the beginning of February. So we now have the figure of the old man with his snow-white hair, panting and gasping, creeping painfully to his grave. One more <span class="accented">trait is</span> added. <span class="cmt_word">And desire shall fail.</span> The word rendered "desire" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>) is found nowhere else in the Old Testament, and its meaning is disputed. The Authorized Version has adopted the rendering of some of the Jewish commentators (and that of Venet., <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x1f54;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>), but, according to Delitzsch, the feminine form of the noun precludes the notion of an abstract quality, and the etymology on which it rests is doubtful. Nor would it be likely that, having employed symbolism hitherto throughout his description, the writer would suddenly drop metaphor and speak in unfigurative language. We are, therefore, driven to rely for its meaning on the old versions, which would convey the traditionary idea. The Septuagint gives, <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, and so the Vulgate, <span class="accented">capparis</span>, by which is designated the caper tree or berry, probably the same as the hyssop, which is found throughout the East, and was extensively used as a provocative of appetite, a stimulant and restorative. Accordingly, the writer is thought here to be intimating that even stimulants, such as the caper, affect the old man no longer, cannot give zest to or make him enjoy his food. Here, again, the figurative is dropped, and a literal, unvarnished fact is stated, which mars the perfection of the picture. But the verb here used (<span class="accented">parar</span>) is capable of another signification, and is often found in the unmetaphorical sense of "breaking" or "bursting;" so the clause will run, "and the caper berry bursts." Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>: Vulgate, <span class="accented">dissipabitur capparis</span>. The fruit of this plant, when overripe, bursts open and falls off - a fit image of the dissolution of the aged frame, now ripe for the tomb, and showing evident tokens of decay. By this interpretation the symbolism is maintained, which perhaps is further illustrated by the fact that the fruit hangs down and droops from the end of long stalks, as the man bows his head and stoops his back to meet the coming death. <span class="cmt_word">Because</span> (<span class="accented">ki</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>man goeth to his long home</span>. This and the following clause are parenthetical, ver. 6 resuming the allegory. It is as though Koheleth said - Such is the way, such are the symptoms, when decay and death are approaching; all these things happen, all these signs meet the eye, at such & period. "His long home;" <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3ca;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> (Septuagint), "to the house of his eternity," "his everlasting habitation," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the grave, or Hades. There is a similar expression in Tobit 3:6, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, which in the Hebrew editions of that book is given as, "Gather me to my father, to the house appointed for all living," with which Canon Churton (<span class="accented">in lot</span>.) compares <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-21.htm">Job 10:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-23.htm">Job 30:23</a>. So <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/49-11.htm">Psalm 49:11</a> (according to many versions), "Their graves are their houses for ever." The <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> of <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-9.htm">Luke 16:9</a> are a periphrasis for life in heaven. Diodorus Siculus notes that the Egyptians used the terms <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3ca;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f34;&#x3ba;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> of Hades (2. 51; 1. 93). The expression, "domus eterna," appears at Rome on tombs, as Plumptre observes, both in Christian and non-Christian inscriptions; and the Assyrians name the world or state beyond the grave "the house of eternity" ('Records of the Past,' 1:143). From the expression in the text nothing can be deduced concerning Koheleth's eschatological views. He is speaking here merely phenomenally. Men live their little span upon the earth, and then go to what in comparison of this is an eternity. Much of the difficulty about <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, etc., would be obviated if critics would remember that the meaning of such words is conditioned by the context, that e.g. "everlasting" applied to a mountain and to God cannot be understood in the same, sense. <span class="cmt_word">And the mourners go about the streets</span>. This can hardly mean that the usual funeral rites have begun; for the death is not conceived as having already taken place; this is reserved for ver. 7. Nor can it, therefore, refer to the relations and friends who are sorrowing for the departed. The persons spoken of must be the mourners who are hired to play and sing at funerals (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-31.htm">2 Samuel 3:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-17.htm">Jeremiah 9:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-5.htm">Jeremiah 34:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-23.htm">Matthew 9:23</a>). These were getting ready to ply their trade, expecting hourly the old man's death. So the Romans had their <span class="accented">praeficae</span>, and persons "qui conducti plorant in funere" (Horace, 'Ars Poet.,' 431). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ecclesiastes/11.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"Rejoice, young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thine heart, and in the sight of thine eyes: but know, that for all this God will bring thee to judgment." The parallel &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497; shows that the beth in &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;&#1491; (with &#1491; aspirated) does not introduce the reason of the joy, but the time suitable for it. Instead of veyithav libbecha, "let thy heart be of good cheer," as the expression might also be, the words are vithivecha libbecha, "make thy heart of good cheer to thee," - so, viz., that from this centre brightness may irradiate thy countenance (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-13.htm">Proverbs 15:13</a>) and thy whole personality, vid., Psychologie, p. 249. Vehhuroth, the period of youth, is here and at <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:1</a>  equals  <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/11-28.htm">Numbers 11:28</a>, vehhurim, as the only once occurring ne'uroth, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-30.htm">Jeremiah 32:30</a>, is  equals  the elsewhere generally used ne'urim; the form in o&#770;th is the more modern (cf. keluloth, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-2.htm">Jeremiah 2:2</a>). "Ways of the heart" are thus ways into which the impulse of the heart leads, and which satisfy the heart. &#1502;&#1512; &#1506;&#1497;&#1503;, at <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/6-9.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:9</a>, designates the pleasure felt in the presence of the object before one; here, a sight which draws and fastens the eyes upon it. The Cheth&#305;&#770;b has the plur. &#1502;&#1512;&#1488;&#1497;, which is known to the language (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/1-15.htm">Daniel 1:15</a>; Sol 2:14), and which would here designate the multitude of the objects which delight the eyes, which is not unsuitable; the Pih. &#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1498; denotes also elsewhere, frequently, e.g., <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/131-1.htm">Psalm 131:1</a>, walking, in an ethical sense; Hitz., Zckl., and others interpret the first &#1489; as specifying the sphere, and the second as specifying the norm ("according to the sight of thine eyes"); but they both introduce that wherein he ought to act freely and joyfully: in the ways of thy heart, into which it draws thee; and in the sight of thine eyes, towards which they direct themselves with interest. The lxx B. renders, "and not after the sight of thine eyes." This "not" (&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#769;), which is wanting in A.C., is an interpolation, in view of the warning, <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/15-39.htm">Numbers 15:39</a>, against following the impulse of the heart and of the eyes; the Targ. also therefore has: "be prudent with reference to the sight of thine eyes." But this moralizing of the text is superfluous, since the call to the youthful enjoyment of life is accompanied with the nota bene: but know that God will bring thee to an account for all this; and thus it excludes sinful sensual desire. In the midst of an address, where a yet closer definition follows, &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1513; is thus punctuated, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-3.htm">Job 14:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/143-3.htm">Psalm 143:3</a>; here, in the conclusion of the sentence, it is &#1489;&#1502;&#1513;. Hitzig supposes that there is denoted by it, that the sins of youth are punished by chronic disease and abandonment in old age; Knobel and others understand by the judgment, the self-punishment of sins by all manner of evil consequences, which the O.T. looks upon as divinely inflicted penalties. But in view of the facts of experience, that God's righteous requital is in this life too frequently escaped, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:14</a>, the author, here and at <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:17</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:14</a>, postulates a final judgment, which removes the contradiction of this present time, and which must thus be in the future; he has no clear idea of the time and manner of this final judgment, but his faith in God places the certainty of it beyond all doubt. The call to rejoice is now completed by the call to avoid all that occasions inward and outward sorrow. </body></html>
