This interpretation agrees both with the foregoing verse, in which he describes the miseries of old age, and with the following clause, which is added to explain those otherwise ambiguous expressions; and with the Scripture use of this phrase; for a state of comfort and happiness is often described by the light of the sun, and a state of trouble is set forth, by the darkening of the light of the sun. <span class="ital">Nor the clouds return after the rain — </span>This phrase denotes a perpetual succession of rain, and clouds bringing rain, and then rain and clouds again.

We should remember our duties, and set about them, looking to him for grace and strength. This should be done early, while the body is strong, and the spirits active. When a man has the pain of reviewing a misspent life, his not having given up sin and worldly vanities till he is forced to say, I have no pleasure in them, renders his sincerity very questionable. Then follows a figurative description of old age and its infirmities, which has some difficulties; but the meaning is plain, to show how uncomfortable, generally, the days of old age are. As the four verses, 2-5, are a figurative description of the infirmities that usually accompany old age, ver. 6 notices the circumstances which take place in the hour of death. If sin had not entered into the world, these infirmities would not have been known. Surely then the aged should reflect on the evil of sin.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ecclesiastes/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>While ... not - Or, Before.

That clause, <span class="ital">and the light</span>, seems to be added to signify that he speaks of the darkening of the sun, and moon, and stars, not in themselves, or in their own bodies, but only in respect of that light which they afford to men. And therefore the same clause which is expressed after the sun, is to be understood after the moon and stars, as is very usual in Scripture in like cases. And those expressions are to be understood either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. Literally, of the dim-sightedness of old men, by reason whereof the light of the sun, &c. seems dark to them; which seems not to agree with the context, partly because the dimness of their sight is expressed in the next verse, and partly because both his and the following verses are wholly allegorical. Or rather, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. Figuratively, and that either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. Of the outward parts of the body, and especially of the face, the beauty of the countenance, the lightsome and pleasant complexion of the cheeks, the liveliness of the eyes, which are compared to the sun, and moon, and stars, and which are obscured in old age, as the Chaldee paraphrast understands it. Or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. Of the inward parts of the mind, the understanding, fancy, memory, which may not unfitly be resembled to the sun, and moon, end stars, and all which are sensibly decayed in most old men. For it may seem improbable that Solomon in his description of the infirmities of old age should omit the decays of the most noble part of man, which are commonly incident to old age. And yet, with submission to those worthy persons who think otherwise, it seems not necessary that he should here speak of those inward decays, partly, because they are not so general in old men as the decays of the body are; partly, because he here directeth his speech to sensual men, who are more affected with corporal than with intellectual maladies; and partly, because both the foregoing and following passages concern the state of men’s bodies, and their outward condition. Or rather, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. Of external things, and of the great change of their joy and prosperity, which they had in their youthful time, into sorrow and manifold calamities, which are usually the companions of old age; for this interpretation seems best to agree both with the foregoing verse, in which he describes the miseries of old age, and with the following clause, which is added to explain and determine those otherwise ambiguous expressions; and with the Scripture use of this phrase, which is the best key for the understanding of Scripture; for a state of comfort and happiness is oft described by the light of the sun, &c., as <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-31.htm" title="So let all your enemies perish, O LORD: but let them that love him be as the sun when he goes forth in his might.

The wise man proceeds to describe the infirmities of old age, and the troubles that attend it; in order to engage young men to regard God and religion, before these come upon them, which greatly unfit for his service. This the Targum and Midrash, and, after them, Jarchi, interpret of the splendour of the countenance of man, of the light of his eyes, and the beauty of his cheeks, and other parts of his face; which decrease and go off at old age, and paleness and wrinkles succeed: and others of the adversities and calamities which attend persons at such years; which are sometimes in Scripture signified by the darkening of the sun, moon, and stars, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-10.htm">Isaiah 13:10</a>; but some choose to understand this, more literally, of the dimness of sight in old men; by whom the light of the sun, moon, and stars, is scarcely discerned: but as this infirmity is afterwards described, I rather think with others, that by the "sun", "light", and "moon", are meant the superior and inferior faculties of the soul, the understanding, mind, judgment, will, and affections; and, by the "stars", those bright notions and ideas raised in the fancy and imagination, and fixed in the memory; all which are greatly impaired or lost in old age: so Alshech interprets the sun and moon of the soul and spirit, and the stars of the senses; "light" is not in the Syriac version; <p>nor the clouds return after the rain; which some understand of catarrhs, defluxions, and rheums, flowing at the eyes, nose, and mouth, one after another, which frequently attend, and are very troublesome to persons in years; but may be more generally applied to the perpetual succession of evils, afflictions, and disorders, in old age; as soon as one is got over, another follows, billow after billow; or, like showers in April, as soon as one is gone, another comes. The Targum paraphrases it of the eyebrows distilling tears, like clouds after rain. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/ecclesiastes/12.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">While the sun, or the light, or the moon, or the stars, are not darkened, nor the <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> clouds return after the rain:</span><p>(a) Before you come to a continual misery: for when the clouds remain after the rain, man's grief is increased.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/ecclesiastes/12.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">2</span>. <span class="ital">while the sun, or the light</span>] The imagery falls in naturally with the thought that the approach of death is represented by the gathering of a tempest. It does not follow, however, that this excludes the thought of a latent symbolism in detail as well as in the general idea. The thought that man was as a microcosm, and that each element in the universe had its analogue in his nature, was a familiar one to the Greek and Oriental mind, and was susceptible of many applications. So, to take an instance belonging to a different age or country, we find an Eastern poet thus writing, <span class="ital">circ</span>. a. d. 1339,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“Of all that finds its being in the world<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Man in himself the symbol true may find.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>His body is as earth, and as the Heaven<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>His head, with signs and wonders manifold,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And the five senses shine therein as stars.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Spirit, like the sun, pours light on all.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The limbs, that bear the body’s burden up,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Are as the hills that raise their height to heaven.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Hair covers all his limbs, as grass the earth,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And moisture flows, as flow the streams and brooks.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>So on the day when soul and body part,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And from the body’s load the soul is freed,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Then canst thou see the body all a-tremble,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>As earth shall tremble at the last great day;<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Spirit with its senses fall away,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>As stars extinguished fall on earth below;<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The last death-sigh with which the body dies<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Thrill through the bones, like tempest-blast and storm.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>As on that day the hills shall pass away,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>So does death’s storm break up our mortal frame.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>A sea of death-damps flows from every pore:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Thou plungest in, and art as drowned therein:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>So is thy dying like the great world’s death;<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In life and death it is thy parallel.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>From the <span class="ital">Gulschen Ras</span> of Mahmud, quoted in Tholuck’s <span class="ital">Blüthen-Sammlung aus der morgenländischen Mystik</span>, p. 213.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It will be admitted that the parallelism is singularly striking and suggestive. With this clue to guide us we may admit all that has been urged by Umbreit, Ginsburg and others in favour of the “storm” interpretation and yet not reject the more detailed symbolic meaning of Jewish and other commentators. We may have the broad outline of the phenomena that precede a tempest, sun, moon and stars, hidden by the gathering blackness. A like imagery meets us as representing both personal and national calamity in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-10.htm" title="For the stars of heaven and the constellations thereof shall not give their light: the sun shall be darkened in his going forth, and the moon shall not cause her light to shine.">Isaiah 13:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-9.htm" title="She that has borne seven languishes: she has given up the ghost; her sun is gone down while it was yet day: she has been ashamed and confounded: and the residue of them will I deliver to the sword before their enemies, said the LORD.">Jeremiah 15:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-9.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in that day, said the Lord GOD, that I will cause the sun to go down at noon, and I will darken the earth in the clear day:">Amos 8:9</a>. The sun may be the Spirit, the Divine light of the body, the moon as the Reason that reflects that light, the stars as the senses that give but a dim light in the absence of sun and moon. The clouds that return after rain are the natural symbol of sorrows, cares, misfortunes, that obscure the shining of the inward light, perhaps of the showers of tears which they cause, but after which in the melancholy and gloom of age and weakness they too commonly “return.” The mere anatomical interpretation which interprets the first four symbols as referring to the eyes, the brow, the nose, the cheeks, and finds in the “clouds after rain” the symptoms of the catarrh of old age, may be looked upon as a morbid outgrowth of prosaic fancy in men in whom the sense of true poetic imagination was extinct.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - From this verse onwards there is great diversity of interpretation. While some think that the approach of death is represented under the image of a storm, others deem that what is here intended is first the debility of old age, and then, at ver. 6, death itself, which two stages are described under various metaphors and figures. <span class="cmt_word">While the sun, or the light, or the moon, or the stars, be not darkened.</span> Under these figures the evil days spoken of above, the advent and infirmities of old age, are represented. It would be endless and unprofitable to recount the explanations of 'the terms used in the following verses. Every commentator, ancient and modern, has exerted his ingenuity to force the poet's language into the shape which he has imagined for it. But, as we said above, there are at least two distinct lines of interpretation which have found favor with the great majority of expositors. One of these regards the imagery as applicable to the effects of a heavy storm upon a house and its inmates, explaining every detail under this notion; the other regards the terms used as referring to the man himself, adumbrating the gradual decay of old age, the various members and powers that are affected being represented under tropes and images, Both interpretations are beset with difficulties, and are only with some straining and accommodation forced into a consistent harmony. But the latter seems to us to present fewer perplexities than the other, and we have adopted it here. At the same time, we think it expedient to give the other view, together with our own, as there is much to be said in its favor, and many great writers have declared themselves on its side. Wright supposes (and makes a good case for his theory) that Koheleth is referring especially to the closing days of winter, which in Palestine are very fatal to old people. The seven last days, indeed, are noted even now as the most sickly and dangerous of all the year. The approach of this period casts a dark shadow upon all the inhabitants of the house. The theory is partly borne out by the text, but, like the other solutions, does not wholly correspond to the wording. In the present verse the approach of old age, the winter of life, is likened to the rainy season in Palestine, when the sun is obscured by clouds, and the light of heaven darkened by the withdrawal of that luminary, and neither moon nor stars appear. <span class="cmt_word">And the clouds return after the rain</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> one storm succeeds another (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/37-6.htm">Job 37:6</a>). The imagery is intended to represent the abiding and increasing inconveniences of old age. Not like the spring-time of life and season, when sunshine and storm are interchanged, winter and old age have no vicissitudes, one dreary character invests them both. The darkening of the light is a common metaphor for sorrow and sadness (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-26.htm">Job 30:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-28.htm">Job 33:28, 30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-7.htm">Ezekiel 32:7, 8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-9.htm">Amos 8:9</a>). The symbolism of the details in this verse has been thus elucidated: The diurnal lights appertain to the soul, the nocturnal to the body; the sun is the Divine light which illumines the soul, the moon and the stars are the body and the senses which receive their radiance from the soul's effulgence. These are all affected by the invasion of old age. Some consider that this verse depicts the changes which pass over the higher and more spiritual part of man's nature, while the succeeding imagery refers to the breaking up of the corporeal frame. We should say rather that ver. 2 conveys a general impression, and that this is then elaborated into particulars. According to the interpretation mentioned above, a gathering tempest is here depicted, the details of which are worked out in the following verses. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ecclesiastes/11.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"In the morning sow thy seed, and towards evening withdraw not thine hand; for thou knowest not which shall prosper, whether this or that, or whether both together shall well succeed." The cultivation of the land is the prototype of all labour (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-15.htm">Genesis 2:15</a>), and sowing is therefore an emblem of all activity in one's pursuit; this general meaning for &#1497;&#1491;&#1498; ... &#1488;&#1500;&#1470; (like <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-18.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:18</a>; synon. with &#1497;&#1491;&#1498; ... &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/10-6.htm">Joshua 10:6</a>, of the older language) is to be accepted.

And as <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/11-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 11:2</a> counsels that one should not make his success depend exclusively on one enterprise, but should divide that which he has to dispose of, and at the same time make manifold trials; so here also we have the reason for restless activity of manifold labour from morning till evening: success or failure (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/5-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:5</a>) is in the hand of God, - man knows not which (quid, here, according to the sense, utrum) will prosper, whether (&#1492;) this or (&#1488;&#1493;) that, and whether (&#1488;&#1502;&#1493;), etc.; vid., regarding the three-membered disjunctive question, Ewald, 361; and regarding kee&#780;hhad, it is in common use in the more modern language, as e.g., also in the last benediction of the Shemone-Esra: &#1499;&#1488;&#1495;&#1491; ... &#1489;&#1512;&#1499;&#1504;&#1493;, "bless us, our Father, us all together." &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; goes back to the two &#1494;&#1492;, understood neut.

Thus Hitzig; but the connection is simpler. It is in the spirit of the whole book that, along with the call to earnest activity, there should be the call to the pleasant enjoyment of life: he who faithfully labours has a right to enjoy his life; and this joy of life, based on fidelity to one's calling, and consecrated by the fear of God, is the most real and the highest enjoyment here below.
