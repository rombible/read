Solomon exhorts the wise and pious to cheerful confidence in God, whatever their condition in life. The meanest morsel, coming from their Father's love, in answer to prayer, will have a peculiar relish. Not that we may set our hearts upon the delights of sense, but what God has given us we may use with wisdom. The joy here described, is the gladness of heart that springs from a sense of the Divine favour. This is the world of service, that to come is the world of recompence. All in their stations, may find some work to do. And above all, sinners have the salvation of their souls to seek after, believers have to prove their faith, adorn the gospel, glorify God, and serve their generation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ecclesiastes/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>White garments and perfume are simply an expressive sign of joy.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ecclesiastes/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. wife &#8230; lovest&#8212;godly and true love, opposed to the "snares" of the "thousand" concubines (Ec 7:26, 28), "among" whom Solomon could not find the true love which joins one man to one woman (Pr 5:15, 18, 19; 18:22; 19:14).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ecclesiastes/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest; </span> so he limits him to lawful delights; whereby it is evident that Solomon doth not speak this in the person of an epicure, as some understand it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Of the life of thy vanity; </span> of this vain and frail life; which expression he industriously useth to moderate men’s affections even towards lawful pleasures, and to mind them of their duty and interest in making sure of a better life, and more solid comforts. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Thy portion, </span> allowed to thee by God, and the best part of worldly enjoyments, in this life; by which addition he is again admonishing him of seeking another portion in the future life. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/ecclesiastes/9.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest,.... Or "see", or "enjoy life" (d): this is one of the ways of enjoying life comfortably, and one of the principal ones; that if a man has a wife whom he ought to love as himself as his own flesh, to take delight in her company, be pleasant with her, and rejoice in her, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-18.htm">Proverbs 5:18</a>; and this here may be put for all that pleasure and satisfaction which may be lawfully had in the enjoyment of all other relations and friends; which adds no small part to the comfort of a man's life; <p>all the days of the life of thy vanity; a wife is for life, and not after a while to be divorced; and to be lived joyfully with, not for a short time only, but all the days of life; <p>which he hath given thee under the sun; that is, either which wife God has given thee; for a wife is the gift of God, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-12.htm">Genesis 3:12</a>; and which is a gift under the sun; for above it, or in heaven, and in a future state, there is no marrying nor giving in marriage, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/20-35.htm">Luke 20:35</a>; or which days he hath given thee, so the Septuagint, Vulgate Latin, and Arabic versions. It is added, <p>all the days of thy vanity; which is repeated, that it might be observed that the life of man is but a vain life, a vapour that soon vanishes away, and man in it, at his best estate, is vanity; and that notwithstanding all the enjoyments of life in the most comfortable manner here directed to, yet still the doctrine he set out with must be remembered, that all is vanity, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:2</a>; <p>for that is thy portion in this life, and in thy labour which thou takest under the sun; this is all the outward happiness of a man in this life, and all the use, profit, and advantage of his labours, to eat and drink cheerfully, to clothe decently, to debar himself of nothing of lawful pleasure, particularly to live joyfully with his wife, and enjoy his friends; this is the utmost of outward felicity he can partake of, and this he should not deny himself. Ben Melech restrains this portion to a wife, and joyful living with her; but it is best to include all that goes before. <p>(d)  "vide vitam", Pagninus, Vatablus, Drusius, Mercerus, Cocceius; "vel vitas", Montanus; "perfruere vita", V.

So we should say naturally “live with <span class="ital">a</span> wife whom you love.” The conclusion in which the writer for the present rests is that while sensual indulgence in excess leads to misery and shame, and brings men into contact with the most hateful form of womanhood (chs. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-11.htm" title="Then I looked on all the works that my hands had worked, and on the labor that I had labored to do: and, behold, all was vanity and vexation of spirit, and there was no profit under the sun.">Ecclesiastes 2:11</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-26.htm" title="And I find more bitter than death the woman, whose heart is snares and nets, and her hands as bands: whoever pleases God shall escape from her; but the sinner shall be taken by her.">Ecclesiastes 7:26</a>), there is a calm peacefulness in the life of a happy home, which, though it cannot remove the sense of the “vanity” and transitoriness of life, at least makes it endurable. If there is, as some have thought, an undertone of irony, it is one which springs from a sympathy with the joy as well as the sorrow of life, and not that of a morose cynicism, saying, “enjoy … if you can.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">all the days of thy vanity</span>] The iteration emphasizes the wisdom of making the most of the few days of life. The thought is essentially the same as that expressed in the <span class="ital">Carpe diem</span> of Hor. <span class="ital">Od.</span> i. 11.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">that is thy portion in this life</span>] This, the calm regulated enjoyment of the wiser Epicureans.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest</span>; literally, see <span class="accented">life with a wife whom thou lovest</span>. The article is omitted, as the maxim is to be taken generally. In correction of the outspoken condemnation of women in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-26.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:26</a>, Koheleth here recognizes the happiness of a home where is found a helpmate beloved and worthy of love (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-18.htm">Proverbs 5:18, 19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-22.htm">Proverbs 17:22</a>, on which our passage seems to be founded; and Ecclus. 26:13-18). (For the expression, " see life," <span class="accented">vide</span> note on Ecclesiastes 2:1.) St. Jerome's comment is misleading, "Quacumque tibi placuerit feminarum ejus gaude complexu." Some critics translate <span class="accented">ishshah</span> here "woman." Thus Cox: "Enjoy thyself with any woman whom thou lovest;" but the best commentators agree that the married state is meant in the text, not mere sensual enjoyment. <span class="cmt_word">All the days of the life of thy vanity</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> throughout the time of thy quickly passing life. This is repeated after the next clause (though there omitted by the Septuagint and Syriac), in order to emphasize the transitoriness of the present and the consequent wisdom of enjoying it while it lasts. So Horace bids man "carpe diem" ('Carm.,' 1:11.8), "enjoy each atom of the day;'" and Martial sings ('Epigr,' 7:47. 11) - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Vive velut rapto fugitivaque gaudia carpe."</span><br /><span class="accented">"Live thou thy life as stolen, and enjoy<br />Thy quickly fading pleasures."</span> <span class="cmt_word">Which he</span> (<span class="accented">God</span>) <span class="cmt_word">hath given thee under the sun</span>. The relative may refer to either the "wife" or" the days of life." The Septuagint and Vulgate take it as belonging to the latter, and this seems most suitable (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/5-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That is thy portion in this life, and in thy labor</span>, etc. Such moderate enjoyment is the recompense allowed by God for the toil which accompanies a properly spent life. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ecclesiastes/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"This is an evil in all that is done under the sun, that one event happeneth to all: and also the heart of the children of men is full of evil; and madness possesseth their heart during their life, and after it they go to the dead." As &#1494;&#1492;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/9-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:1</a>, points to the asher following, in which it unfolds itself, so here to the ki following. We do not translate: This is the worst thing (Jerome: hoc est pessimum), which, after <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/14-15.htm">Joshua 14:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-15.htm">Judges 6:15</a>; Sol 1:8, would have required the words &#1489;&#1499;&#1500; &#1492;&#1512;&#1506; - the author does not designate the equality of fate as the greatest evil, but as an evil mixed with all earthly events. It is an evil in itself, as being a contradiction to the moral order of the world; and it is such also on account of its demoralizing influences. The author here repeats what he had already, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:11</a>, said in a more special reference, that because evil is not in this world visibly punished, men become confident and bold in sinning. Vegam (referable to the whole clause, at the beginning of which it is placed) stands beside zeh ra', connecting with that which is evil in itself its evil influences. &#1502;&#1500;&#1488; might be an adj., for this (only once, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-11.htm">Jeremiah 6:11</a>), like the verb, is connected with the accus., e.. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-23.htm">Deuteronomy 33:23</a>. But, since not a statement but a factum had to be uttered, it is finite, as at <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:11</a>. Thus Jerome, after Symm.: sed et cor filiorum hominum repletur malitia et procacitate juxta cor eorum in vita sua. Keeping out of view the false sed, this translation corresponds to the accenting which gives the conjunctive Kadma to &#1512;&#1506;. But without doubt an independent substantival clause begins with &#1493;&#1492;&#1493;: and madness is in their heart (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:17</a>) their life long; for, without taking heed to God's will and to what is pleasing to God, or seeking after instruction, they think only of the satisfaction of their inclinations and lusts.<p>"And after that they go to the dead" - they who had so given themselves up to evil, and revelled in fleshly lusts with security, go the way of all flesh, as do the righteous, and the wise, and just, because they know that they go beyond all restraining bounds. Most modern interpreters (Hitz., Ew., etc.) render aharav, after <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-46.htm">Jeremiah 51:46</a>, adverbially, with the suffix understood neut.: afterwards (Jerome, post haec). but at <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-22.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/6-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:12</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:14</a>, the suffix refers to man: after him, him who liveth here  equals  after he has laid down his life. Why should it not be thus understood also here? It is true &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1497;&#1468; precedes it; but in the reverse say, sing. and plur. also interchange in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/9-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:1</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:12</a>. Rightly the Targ., as with Kleinert and others, we also explain: after their (his) lifetime. A man's life finally falls into the past, it lies behind him, and he goes forth to the dead; and along with self-consciousness, all the pleasures and joy of life at the same time come to an end. </body></html>
