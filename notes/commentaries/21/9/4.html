Our translators, following the older translators, adopt the reading of the margin. That of the text gives, instead of “joined,” a word signifying “chosen;” the best sense that can be given to which is to translate, “For who is excepted,” joining it with the previous verse, beginning this one, “To all the living,” &c. With regard to the statement of the following verses, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/6-3.htm" title="My soul is also sore vexed: but you, O LORD, how long?">Psalm 6:3</a> and the marginal references there given.

Solomon exhorts the wise and pious to cheerful confidence in God, whatever their condition in life. The meanest morsel, coming from their Father's love, in answer to prayer, will have a peculiar relish. Not that we may set our hearts upon the delights of sense, but what God has given us we may use with wisdom. The joy here described, is the gladness of heart that springs from a sense of the Divine favour. This is the world of service, that to come is the world of recompence. All in their stations, may find some work to do. And above all, sinners have the salvation of their souls to seek after, believers have to prove their faith, adorn the gospel, glorify God, and serve their generation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ecclesiastes/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For to him - Rather: "Yet to him."

That is, who is among the living, is one of them, and, as long as he is, there is hope, if his circumstances are mean, and he is poor and afflicted, that it may be better with him in time; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-7.htm">Job 14:7</a>; or of his being a good man, though now wicked; of his being called and converted, as some are at the eleventh hour, even on a death bed; and especially there is a hope of men, if they are under the means of grace, seeing persons have been made partakers of the grace of God after long waiting. There is here a "Keri" and a "Cetib", a marginal reading and a textual writing; the former reads, "that is joined", the latter, "that is chosen"; our version follows the marginal reading, as do the Targum, Jarchi, Aben Ezra, the Septuagint, Syriac, and Arabic versions: some, following the latter, render the words, "who is to be chosen" (y), or preferred, a living, or a dead man? not a dead but a living man: "to all the living there is hope"; of their being better; and, as Jarchi observes, there is hope, while alive, even though he is a wicked man joined to the wicked; yea, there is hope of the wicked, that he may be good before he dies; <p>for a living dog is better than a dead lion; a proverbial speech, showing that life is to be preferred to death; and that a mean, abject, and contemptible person, living, who for his despicable condition may be compared to a dog, is to be preferred to the most generous man, or to the greatest potentate, dead; since the one may possibly be useful in some respects or another, the other cannot: though a living sinner, who is like to a dog for his uncleanness and vileness, is not better than a dead saint or righteous man, comparable to a lion, who has hope in his death, and dies in the Lord. <p>(y)   "quisquis eligatur", Montanus, so Gejerus. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/ecclesiastes/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For to him that is joined to all the living there is hope: for a <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> living dog is better than a dead lion.</span><p>(c) He notes the Epicurean and carnal men, who made their body their god, and had no pleasure in this life, wishing rather to be an abased and vile person in this life, then a man of authority and so to die, which is meant by the dog and lion.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/ecclesiastes/9.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">4</span>. <span class="ital">For to him that is joined to all the living there is hope</span>] A different and preferable punctuation gives the rendering: <span class="bld">For who is specially chosen</span>, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> <span class="bld">who is excepted</span> from the common lot of death. <span class="bld">To all the living there is hope.</span> The passage has, however, received many conflicting interpretations, of which this seems, on the whole, the best. It was quite after the tone of Greek thought to find in the inextinguishable hope which survives in most men even to the end, even though the hope does not stretch beyond the horizon of the grave, their one consolation, that which made life at least liveable, even if not worth living. So Hope was found at the bottom of Pandora’s treasure-chest of evils.

No being exists, of hope,<br />Of love, void."</span> This clause gives a reason for the folly of men, mentioned in ver. 3. Whatever be their lot, or their way of life, they see no reason to make any change by reformation or active exertion. They go on hoping, and do nothing. Something may turn up; amid the inexplicable confusion of the ordering of events some happy contingency may arrive. The above is the reading according to the Keri. Thus the Septuagint:  <span class="greek">&#x1f4d;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>; "For who is he that has fellowship with all the living?" Symmachus has, "For who is he that will always continue to live?" while the Vulgate gives, <span class="accented">Nemo</span> <span class="accented">est qui semper vivat</span>. The Khetib points differently, offering the reading, "For who is excepted?" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> from the common lot, the interrogation being closely connected with the preceding verse, or "Who can choose?" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> whether he will die or not. The sentence then proceeds, "To all the living there is hope." But the rendering of the Authorized Version has good authority, and affords the better sense. <span class="cmt_word">For a living dog is better than a dead lion</span>. The dog in Palestine was not made a pet and companion, as it is among us, but was regarded as a loathsome and despicable object comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-43.htm">1 Samuel 17:43</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-8.htm">2 Samuel 3:8</a>); while the lion was considered as the noblest of beasts, the type of power and greatness (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-30.htm">Proverbs 30:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/31-4.htm">Isaiah 31:4</a>). So the proverbial saying in the text means that the vilest and meanest creature possessed of life is better than the highest and mightiest which has succumbed to death. There is an apparent contradiction between this sentence and such passages as claim a preference for death over life, e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:1</a>; but in the latter the writer is viewing life with all its sorrows and bitter experiences, here he regards it as affording the possibility of enjoyment. In the one case he holds death as desirable, because it delivers from further sorrow and puts an end to misery; in the other, he deprecates death as cutting off from pleasure and hope. He may also have in mind that now is the time to do the work which we have to perform: "The night cometh when no man can work;" Ecclus. 17:28, "Thanksgiving perisheth from the dead, as from one that is not; the living and sound shall praise the Lord" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-18.htm">Isaiah 38:18, 19</a>.) <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ecclesiastes/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"And I commended joy, that there is nothing better for a man under the sun than to eat and drink and enjoy himself; and that this accompanies him in his labour throughout all the days of his life, which God hath given him under the sun." We already read the ultimatum, 15a, in a similar form at <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-24.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:24</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:12</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-22.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:22</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/5-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:17</a>. With &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; &#1497;&#1500; either begins a new clause, and the fut. is then jussive: "let this accompany him," or it is subordinate to the foregoing infinitives, and the fut. is then subjunctive: et ut id eum comitetur. The lxx and other Greeks translate less appropriately indicat.: &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#837;&#834;. Thus also Ewald, Hengst., Zckl., and others: and this clings to him, which, however, would rather be expressed by &#1500;&#1493; &#1497;&#1514;&#1512;&#1493;&#1503; &#1493;&#1492;&#1493;&#1488; or &#1493;&#1492; &#1495;&#1500;&#1511;&#1493;. The verb &#1500;&#1493;&#1492; (R. &#1500;&#1493;, to twist, to bend) does not mean to cling to  equals  to remain, but to adhere to, to follow, to accompany; cf. under <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-16.htm">Genesis 18:16</a>. The possibility of the meaning, "to accompany," for the Kal, is supported by the derivatives &#1500;&#1493;&#1497;&#1492; and &#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1497; (particularly &#1500;&#1493;&#1497;&#1514; &#1492;&#1502;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501;, convoy of the dead); the verb, however, in this signification extra-bibl. is found only in Pih. and Hiph.<p>(Note: Vid., Baer in Abodath Jisrael, p. 39.) </body></html>
