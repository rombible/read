If God be for us, who can be against us, or stand before us? Solomon observes the power of wisdom, though it may labour under outward disadvantages. How forcible are right words! But wise and good men must often content themselves with the satisfaction of having done good, or, at least, endeavoured to do it, when they cannot do the good they would, nor have the praise they should. How many of the good gifts, both of nature and Providence, does one sinner destroy and make waste! He who destroys his own soul destroys much good. One sinner may draw many into his destroying ways. See who are the friends and enemies of a kingdom or a family, if one saint does much good, and one sinner destroys much good.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ecclesiastes/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A parable probably without foundation in fact.

That is, by some persons and at some times, though not by all persons and always; or they are to be heard, or should be heard, though they seldom be, even the words of wise men that are poor: these are to be heard quietly and patiently, without any tumult and contradiction; or should be heard, being delivered with a low and submissive voice, without any noise, or blustering pride, or passion, sedately and with great humility, submitting them to the judgment of others; which sense the comparison seems to require; <p>more than the cry of him that ruleth among fools; more than the noisy words of a foolish governor; or than the dictates of an imperious man, delivered in a clamorous and blustering way; by which he obtains authority among such fools as himself, who are influenced more by the pomp and noise of words than by the force of true wisdom and reason; but all right judges will give the preference to the former. The Targum interprets it of the silent prayer of the wise being received by the Lord, more than the clamour of the wicked. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/ecclesiastes/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The words of wise men are heard in quiet more than the cry of him that ruleth among fools.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/ecclesiastes/9.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">17</span>. <span class="ital">The words of wise men are heard in quiet</span>] The thought is like that of the “great cry and little wool” of the English proverb. That which tells on men, in the long run, is the wisdom whose words are wary, and calm, and few, not the declamation of the wind-bags of popular oratory. Comp. the description of the highest type of wisdom in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-2.htm" title="He shall not cry, nor lift up, nor cause his voice to be heard in the street.">Isaiah 42:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-19.htm" title="He shall not strive, nor cry; neither shall any man hear his voice in the streets.">Matthew 12:19</a>. He that “ruleth among fools” is not the foolish ruler, but the man who takes the highest place in the company of fools, and graduates, as it were, as the Senior Wrangler in that class-list. Such an one is as the “prating fool” of <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-10.htm" title="He that winks with the eye causes sorrow: but a prating fool shall fall.">Proverbs 10:10</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 17, 18.</span> - Section 10. Here follow <span class="accented">some proverbial sayings concerning wisdom and its opposite</span>, which draw the moral from the story in the text. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The words of wise men are heard in quiet more than the cry of him that ruleth among fools</span>. This verse would be better translated, Wo<span class="accented">rds of the wise in quiet are heard better than the shout of a chief among fools</span>. The Vulgate takes the tranquility to appertain to the hearers, thus: <span class="accented">Verbs sapientium audiuntur in silentio</span>; but, as Delitzsch points out, the contrast between "quiet" and "cry" shows that it is the man, and not his auditors, who is quiet. The sentence says that a wise man's words, uttered calmly, deliberately, without pompous declamation or adventitious aids, are of more value than the blustering vociferation of an arch-fool, who seeks to force acceptance for his folly by loudness and swagger (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-15.htm">Isaiah 30:15</a>; and see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-2.htm">Isaiah 42:2</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-19.htm">Matthew 12:19</a>, passages which speak of the peacefulness, reticence, and unobtrusiveness of true wisdom, as seen in the Son of God). The verse introduces a kind of exception to the general rejection of wisdom mentioned above. Though the multitude turn a deaf ear to a wise man's counsel, yet this tells in the long run, and there are always some teachable persons-who sit at his feet and learn from him. "He that ruleth among fools" is not one that governs a silly people, but one who is a prince of fools, who takes the highest place among such. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ecclesiastes/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"Further, I came to see under the sun, that the race belongs not to the swift, and the war not to the heroes, and also not bread to the wise man, and not riches to the prudent, and not favour to men of knowledge; for time and chance happeneth to them all." The nearest preceding &#1512;&#1488;, to which this &#1493;&#1512;&#1489; &#1493;&#1512;&#1488; suitably connects itself, is at <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:17</a>. Instead of redii et videndo quidem  equals  rursus vidi (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-9.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:9</a> and under <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/9-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:1</a>), we had at <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:1</a> the simpler expression, redii et vidi. The five times repeated &#1500; is that of property, of that, viz., by virtue of which one is master of that which is named, has power over it, disposes of it freely. The race belongs not to the swift (&#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1509;, masc. to &#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1510;&#1492;, only here), i.e., their fleetness is yet no guarantee that on account of it they will reach the goal. Luther freely: "To be fleet does not help in running," i.e., running to an object or goal. "The war belongs not to the heroes," means that much rather it belongs to the Lord, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-47.htm">1 Samuel 17:47</a>. - God alone gives the victory (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-16.htm">Psalm 33:16</a>). Even so the gaining of bread, riches, favour (i.e., influence, reputation), does not lie in wisdom, prudence, knowledge of themselves, as an indispensable means thereto; but the obtaining of them, or the not obtaining of them, depends on times and circumstances which lie beyond the control of man, and is thus, in the final result, conditioned by God (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-16.htm">Romans 9:16</a>); <p>(Note: But not <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-22.htm">Jeremiah 9:22</a>; this passage, referred to by Bernstein, is of a different nature.)<p>time and fate happen to all whose ability appears to warrant the issue, they both time and fate encounter them and bar to them the way; they are in an inexplicable manner dependent on both, and helplessly subject to them. As the idea of spiritual superiority is here expressed in a threefold manner by &#1492;&#1495; (whence &#1500;&#1492; of the plur., also with the art. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/9-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/36-4.htm">Exodus 36:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/1-13.htm">Esther 1:13</a>), '&#1492;&#1503;, and &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;, so at <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-2.htm">Isaiah 11:2</a>, the gifts of "wisdom," "counsel," and "knowledge" follow each other. 'Eth is here "time" with its special circumstances (conjunctures), and pega', "accident," particularly as an adversity, disappointment of the word is used also without any addition (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-18.htm">1 Kings 5:18</a>) of misfortune (cf. &#1513;&#1497;&#1512; &#1508;&#1490;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/3-1.htm">Psalm 3:1-8</a>; 91).
