We may learn many things good for ourselves and useful to others. But man cannot always decide who are objects of God's special love, or under his wrath; and God will certainly put a difference between the precious and the vile, in the other world. The difference as to present happiness, arises from the inward supports and consolations the righteous enjoy, and the benefit they derive from varied trials and mercies. As far as the sons of men are left to themselves, their hearts are full of evil; and prosperity in sin, causes them even to set God at defiance by daring wickedness. Though, on this side death, the righteous and the wicked may often seem to fare alike, on the other side there will be a vast difference between them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ecclesiastes/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Event - See <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:14</a> note.<p>Sweareth - i. e., Swears lightly or profanely. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ecclesiastes/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2.

That is, all outward things in this life, good and bad men share in alike; which proves that neither love nor hatred can be known by them: so the emperor Mark Antonine, in speaking of life and death, of honour and dishonour, of pain and pleasure, riches and poverty, says (s), all these things happen alike to good men and bad men; <p>there is one event to the righteous and to the wicked; the same prosperous ones happen to one as to another, as riches, honour, health, wisdom and learning, fame and reputation: if Abraham was rich in cattle, gold, and silver, so was Nabal, and the rich fool in the Gospel; if Joseph was advanced to great dignity in Pharaoh's court, so was Haman in the court of Ahasuerus; if Caleb was as hearty and strong at fourscore and five as ever, it is true of many wicked men, that there are no bands in their death, and their strength is firm to the last; if Moses, Solomon, and Daniel, were wise men, and of great learning, so were the idolatrous Egyptians, and so are many God is not pleased to call by his grace; if Demetrius had a good report of all men, so had the false prophets of old: and the same adverse things happen to one as to another as the instances of Job, Lazarus, and the good figs, the Jews carried into captivity, show; of whom the Midrash, and Jarchi from that, interpret this and the following clauses: "to the righteous and to the wicked": to Noah the righteous, and to Pharaoh, not Necho, as Jarchi, but he whose daughter Solomon married, who, the Jews say, were both lame; <p>to the good, and to the clean, and to the unclean; who are "good", not naturally, and in and of themselves, but by the grace of God; and who are "clean", not by nature, nor by their own power, but through the clean water of divine grace being sprinkled on them, and through the blood and righteousness of Christ applied to them; and who are "unclean", through the corruption of nature, and the pollution of actual sins, they live in. Some understand this of a ceremonial cleanness and uncleanness. The above Jews apply these characters to Moses, who was good; to Aaron, who was clean; and to the spies, who were unclean; and the same thing happened to them all, exclusion from the land of Canaan; <p>to him that sacrificeth, and to him that sacrificeth not: that serves and worships the Lord, and who does not, one branch of service and worship being put for all; and whether they offer themselves, their contrite hearts and spiritual sacrifices, or not. The Jews exemplify this Josiah, who sacrificed to the Lord; and in Ahab, who made sacrifice to cease; and both were slain with arrows; <p>as is the good, so is the sinner; alike in their outward condition and circumstances, whether as to prosperity or adversity; <p>and he that sweareth, as he that feareth an oath; the common swearer, or he that is perjured, and has no reverence of God, nor regard to truth, nor any concern to make good his oath; and he that is cautious about taking one does it with awe and reverence of the divine Being, and is careful of keeping, it, even to his own hurt. The Jews stance in Zedekiah and Samson; the former broke his oath with the king of Babylon, and the latter was a religious observer of an oath; and yet both had their eyes put out; but it does not appear that Samson ever took an oath: the opposition in the text seems to be between one that is ready to take an oath on every occasion, without considering the solemnity of one, and without due care of what he swore to; and one that is cautious about taking an oath, and chooses to be excused from taking one, on any account, could he be excused; preferring such advice as is given, <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/5-34.htm">Matthew 5:34</a>, "swear not at all"; the counsel about swearing, which Isocrates (t) gives, seems worthy of notice; <p>"take an oath required on two accounts; either to purge thyself from a foul crime charged with, or to save friends in danger, and deliver them out of it; but on account of money (or goods) swear not by any deity, no, not even if thou canst take an oath safely; for by some thou wilt be thought to be perjured, and by others to be covetous.'' <p>The word in Hebrew for swearing is always passive, because a man should not swear, unless obliged; and the same form of language is used by Latin writers (u); and the Hebrew word for it comes from a root which signifies "seven", in allusion, as some think, to seven witnesses required to an oath; the Arabians, when they swore, anointed "seven" stones with blood; and, while anointing them, called on their deities (w); see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/21-30.htm">Genesis 21:30</a>. It may be observed, that all men are here divided into good and bad; this has been the distinction from the beginning, and continues, and ever will. <p>(s) De scipso, l. 2. c. 11.

Earthquakes, pestilences, tempests make no discrimination between good and evil. As with the melancholy emphasis of iteration, the various forms of contrasted characters are grouped together. “The righteous and the wicked” point to men’s conduct relative to their neighbours, the “good and pure” (the first word is probably added to shew that a moral and not merely a ceremonial purity is meant) to what we call “self-regarding” actions, the self-reverence of purity in act and thought. “Sacrifice” is the outward expression of man’s relation to God. “The good” and “the sinner” are wider in their range and express the totality of character. The last group is not without difficulty. As commonly interpreted, “he that sweareth” is the man who swears falsely or rashly, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/5-3.htm" title="Then said he to me, This is the curse that goes forth over the face of the whole earth: for every one that steals shall be cut off as on this side according to it; and every one that swears shall be cut off as on that side according to it.">Zechariah 5:3</a>, he “that feareth an oath” is either the man who looks on its obligation with a solemn awe, or one whose communication is Yea, yea, Nay, nay, and who shrinks in reverential awe from any formal use of the Divine Name. On this view, the words probably point to the tendency of thought which was developed in the teaching of the Essenes, who placed every oath on the same level as perjury (Jos. <span class="ital">Wars</span>, ii. 8, § 6), and was in part sanctioned in the Sermon on the Mount (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/5-33.htm" title="Again, you have heard that it has been said by them of old time, You shall not forswear yourself, but shall perform to the Lord your oaths:...">Matthew 5:33-37</a>). It may be noted, however, that in all the other groups, the good side is placed first, and I do not feel quite sure that it is not so in this case also. The man “that sweareth” may be he who does what most religious Jews held to be their duty, truthfully and well (comp <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-13.htm" title="You shall fear the LORD your God, and serve him, and shall swear by his name.">Deuteronomy 6:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-16.htm" title="That he who blesses himself in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth; and he that swears in the earth shall swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hid from my eyes.">Isaiah 65:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/63-11.htm" title="But the king shall rejoice in God; every one that swears by him shall glory: but the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped.">Psalm 63:11</a>), he who “fears the oath,” may be the man whose “coward conscience” makes him shrink from the oath either of compurgation on the part of an accused person (comp. Aristot. <span class="ital">Rhet</span>. i. 27), or of testimony. The former was in frequent use in Jewish as in Greek trials. Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/22-10.htm" title="If a man deliver to his neighbor an ass, or an ox, or a sheep, or any beast, to keep; and it die, or be hurt, or driven away, no man seeing it:...">Exodus 22:10-11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-31.htm" title="If any man trespass against his neighbor, and an oath be laid on him to cause him to swear, and the oath come before your altar in this house:">1 Kings 8:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/6-22.htm" title="If a man sin against his neighbor, and an oath be laid on him to make him swear, and the oath come before your altar in this house;">2 Chronicles 6:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/5-19.htm" title="And the priest shall charge her by an oath, and say to the woman, If no man have lain with you, and if you have not gone aside to uncleanness with another instead of your husband, be you free from this bitter water that causes the curse:...">Numbers 5:19-22</a>. It may be added that this view agrees better with the language about “the oath of God” in ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/5-2.htm" title="Be not rash with your mouth, and let not your heart be hasty to utter any thing before God: for God is in heaven, and you on earth: therefore let your words be few.">Ecclesiastes 5:2</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All things come alike to all</span>; literally, <span class="accented">all things</span> [<span class="accented">are</span>] <span class="accented">like that which</span> [<span class="accented">happens</span>] <span class="accented">to all persons</span>. There is no difference in the treatment of persons; all people of every kind meet with circumstances of every kind. Speaking generally, there is no discrimination, apparently, in the distribution of good and evil. Sun and shade, calm and storm. fruitful and unfruitful seasons, joy and sorrow, are dispensed by inscrutable laws. The Septuagint, reading differently, has, "Vanity is in all;" the Syriac unites two readings, "All before him is vanity, all as to all" (Ginsburg). <span class="cmt_word">There is one event to the righteous, and to the wicked.</span> All men have the same lot, whether it be death or any other contingency, without regard to their naomi condition.

He who takes an oath lightly, carelessly, or falsely (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/5-3.htm">Zechariah 5:3</a>), is contrasted with him who regards it as a holy thing, or shrinks in awe from invoking God's Name in such a case This last idea is regarded as a late Essenic development (see Josephus, 'Bell. Jud.,' 2:08. 6); though something like it is found in the sermon on the mount, "I say unto you, Swear not at all," etc. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-34.htm">Matthew 5:34-37</a>). Dean Plumptre, however, throws doubt on the above interpretation, owing to the fact that in all the other groups the good side is placed first; and he suggests that "he who sweareth" may be one who does his duty in this particular religiously and well (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-13.htm">Deuteronomy 6:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-16.htm">Isaiah 65:16</a>), and "he who fears the oath" is a man whose conscience makes him shrink from the oath of compurgation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-10.htm">Exodus 22:10, 11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/5-19.htm">Numbers 5:19-22</a>), or who is too cowardly to give his testimony in due form. The Vulgate has, <span class="accented">Ut perjurus, its et ille qui verum dejerat</span>; and it seems unnecessary to present an entirely new view of the passage in slavish expectation of a concinnity which the author cannot be proved to have ever aimed at. The five contrasted pairs are the righteous and the wicked, the clean and the unclean, the sacrificer and the non-sacrificer, the good and the sinner, the profane swearer and the man who reverences an oath. The last clause is rendered by the Septuagint, "So is he who sweareth (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>) even as he who fears the oath," which is as ambiguous as the original.

Ewald (whom Heiligst., Elst., and Zckl. follow), as among the ancients, e.g., Mendelssohn, translates <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:12</a> : "Though a sinner do evil an hundred times, and live long, yet I know," etc. That an antecedent may begin with asher is admissible, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-22.htm">Leviticus 4:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-22.htm">Deuteronomy 18:22</a>; but in the case lying before us, still less acceptable than at <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:11</a>.

The sinner is thereby encouraged in sinning, because he does evil, and always again evil, and yet enjoys himself in all the pleasures of long life.

Jerome, improbable: et per patientiam sustentatur, as Mendelssohn: he experiences forbearance, for they supply 'pow (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-9.htm">Isaiah 48:9</a>), and make God the subject. &#1500;&#1468;&#1493; is in any case the so-called dat. ethic.; and the only question is, whether the doing of evil has to be taken from &#1512;&#1506; &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492;, <p>(Note: We expect these two words (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-12.htm">Genesis 31:12</a>) with the retrogression of the tone; but as this ceases, as a rule, with Mercha before Tifcha and Pashta, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/47-3.htm">Genesis 47:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/18-5.htm">Exodus 18:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-42.htm">Deuteronomy 4:42</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-4.htm">Deuteronomy 19:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-14.htm">Isaiah 10:14</a> (cf. the penult. accent of &#1497;&#1488;&#1499;&#1500;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/22-10.htm">Leviticus 22:10</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/22-10.htm">Leviticus 22:10</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/22-19.htm">Leviticus 22:19</a>, and &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/4-17.htm">Genesis 4:17</a>, with the ult. accent <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/22-14.htm">Leviticus 22:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-12.htm">Habakkuk 2:12</a>), so with Mercha sometimes also before other disjunctives, as here before Tebr.)<p>as obj. to &#1493;&#1502;&#1488;: he practises it to him long, or whether, which is more probable, &#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; is to be supplied after <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:13</a>, so that &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497;&#1498; signifies to live long, as at <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-2.htm">Proverbs 28:2</a>, to last long; the dat. ethic. gives the idea of the feeling of contentment connected with long life: he thereupon sins wantonly, and becomes old in it in good health.<p>That is the actual state of the case, which the author cannot conceal from himself; although, on the other hand, as by way of limitation he adds ki ... ani, he well knows that there is a moral government of the world, and that this must finally prevail. We may not translate: that it should go well, but rather: that it must go well; but there is no reason not to interpret the fut. as a pure indic.: that it shall go well, viz., finally, - it is a postulate of his consciousness which the author here expresses; that which exists in appearance contradicts this consciousness, which, however, in spite of this, asserts itself. That to &#1500;&#1497;&#1512; &#1492;&#1488;&#1500; the clause &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1502;&#1500;&#1468;, explaining idem per idem, is added, has certainly its reason in this, that at the time of the author the name "fearers of God" [Gottesfrchitige] had come into use. "The fearers of God, who fear before (&#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;, as at <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:14</a>) Him," are such as are in reality what they are called.<p>In <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:13</a>, Hitzig, followed by Elster, Burg., and Zckl., places the division at &#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;: like the shadow is he who fears not before God. Nothing can in point of syntax be said against this (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-15.htm">1 Chronicles 29:15</a>), although &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1499;&#1468;&#1510;&#1468;&#1500;, "like the shadow is he who," is in point of style awkward. But that the author did not use so rude a style is manifest from <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/6-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:12</a>, according to which &#1499;&#1510;&#1500; is rightly referred to &#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; ... &#1493;&#1500;&#1488;&#1470;. Is then the shadow, asks Hitzig, because it does not "prolong its days," therefore &#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; &#1511;&#1510;&#1512;? How subtle and literal is this use of &#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;! Certainly the shadow survives not a day; but for that very reason it is short-lived, it may even indeed be called &#1511;&#1510;&#1512; &#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, because it has not existence for a single day. In general, qetsel, &#x3c9;&#788;&#x3c2; &#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#769;, is applicable to the life of all men, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/144-4.htm">Psalm 144:4</a>, Wisd. 2:5, etc. It is true of the wicked, if we keep in view the righteous divine requital, especially that he is short-lived like the shadow, "because he has no fear before God," and that in consequence of this want of fear his life is shortened by his sin inflicting its own punishment, and by the act of God. Asher, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:13</a>, as at <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:11</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:12</a>, is the relative conj. Also in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:14</a>, &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; (&#1513;&#1473;) as a pronoun, and &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; (&#1513;&#1473;) as a conj., are mixed together. After the author has declared the reality of a moral government of the world as an inalienable fact of human consciousness, and particularly of his own consciousness, he places over against this fact of consciousness the actual state of things partly at least contradicting it. </body></html>
