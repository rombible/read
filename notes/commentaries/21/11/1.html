From the uncertainty of the results of human effort, he infers that we ought the more diligently to make trial of varied forms of exertion, in order that this or that may succeed. From the instability of human happiness, he draws the lesson that we ought to enjoy freely such happiness as life affords, yet with a temperate and chastened joy, and mindful of the account we shall have to render. The most popular explanation of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/11-1.htm" title="Cast your bread on the waters: for you shall find it after many days.">Ecclesiastes 11:1</a> is, that the figure is taken from the casting of seed on irrigated lands, as, for instance, in Egypt before the waters of the Nile have subsided; and that the duty of beneficence is here inculcated. We are to sow our benefits broadcast, and be assured we shall have a harvest of reward. It is easier to raise objections to this interpretation than to improve on it. That the word translated “bread” is sometimes used in the sense of seed corn, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-28.htm" title="Bread corn is bruised; because he will not ever be threshing it, nor break it with the wheel of his cart, nor bruise it with his horsemen.">Isaiah 28:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-23.htm" title="Then shall he give the rain of your seed, that you shall sow the ground with; and bread of the increase of the earth, and it shall be fat and plenteous: in that day shall your cattle feed in large pastures.">Isaiah 30:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-14.htm" title="He causes the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the service of man: that he may bring forth food out of the earth;">Psalm 104:14</a>. It is objected that the words “cast on the waters” are, literally, “send over the face of the waters,” the word “send” being nowhere else used in the sense of sowing. It has been remarked that in the East bread is used in the shape of light cakes, which would float on water; and the text has been understood as directing the casting of such cakes into a running stream—an irrational proceeding, not likely to occur to any but one to whom this text might have suggested it, and not offering ground for expectation that he who so cast his bread would find it again. It has been less absurdly proposed to understand the text as advising maritime enterprise; but the word “bread” does not harmonise with this explanation. There is nothing else in the book according with such advice; and the next verse, about “the evil that shall be <span class= "ital">upon the earth,” </span>shows that the writer was not thinking of the dangers of the sea. I believe, therefore, that <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/11-6.htm" title="In the morning sow your seed, and in the evening withhold not your hand: for you know not whether shall prosper, either this or that, or whether they both shall be alike good.">Ecclesiastes 11:6</a>, which speaks distinctly of the sowing of seed, is the best commentary on the present verse, which means, cast thy seed, even though thou canst not see where it will fall. Possibly the application of the figure is not to be restricted to acts of beneficence; but the next verse may lead us to think that these are primarily intended, and to these especially the encouragement at the end of the verse applies; for in other cases this book gives a less cheerful view of the possible success of human plans.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/ecclesiastes/11.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/11-1.htm" title="Cast your bread on the waters: for you shall find it after many days.">Ecclesiastes 11:1</a></span>. <span class="ital">Cast thy bread </span>— That is, thy seed, which is here called bread, as it is also <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-5.htm" title="As for the earth, out of it comes bread: and under it is turned up as it were fire.">Job 28:5</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-28.htm" title="Bread corn is bruised; because he will not ever be threshing it, nor break it with the wheel of his cart, nor bruise it with his horsemen.">Isaiah 28:28</a>, because the produce of it makes bread, and the husbandman could ill spare it, wanting it, perhaps, for bread for himself and family; <span class="ital">upon the waters </span>— That is, either by the rivers’ sides, or in moist and marshy ground, or even on the waters that cover it, where there might be little prospect of a crop. Solomon here probably alludes to the manner of planting rice in the eastern countries; for, as Sir John Chardin observes in his note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-20.htm" title="Blessed are you that sow beside all waters, that send forth thither the feet of the ox and the ass.">Isaiah 32:20</a>, “They sow it upon the water; and, before sowing, while the earth is covered with water, they cause the ground to be trodden by oxen, horses, and asses, which go mid-leg deep; and this is the way of preparing the ground for sowing. And, as they sow the rice in the water, they transplant it in the water.” But, though Solomon alludes to this, it is evident he means in these words to inculcate liberality to the poor. As if he had said, <span class="ital">Cast </span>— That is, freely and liberally bestow; <span class="ital">thy bread </span>— That is, thy money, or provisions, or the necessaries of life, of whatever kind; <span class="ital">upon the waters </span>— Upon the poor, on whom thy bounty may at first, and for a time, appear to be lost. (as the seed does, which a man casts upon the waters,) through their unthankfulness or inability to make thee any returns: yet, <span class="ital">thou shalt find it</span> — It shall be restored to thee, either by God or men, more certainly than the rice or other seed corn, cast upon the marshy or watery ground, produces fruit in due season: <span class="ital">after many days </span>— The return may be slow, but it is sure, and will be so much the more plentiful the longer it is delayed.

Give freely, though it may seem thrown away and lost. Give to many. Excuse not thyself with the good thou hast done, from the good thou hast further to do. It is not lost, but well laid out. We have reason to expect evil, for we are born to trouble; it is wisdom to do good in the day of prosperity. Riches cannot profit us, if we do not benefit others. Every man must labour to be a blessing to that place where the providence of God casts him. Wherever we are, we may find good work to do, if we have but hearts to do it. If we magnify every little difficulty, start objections, and fancy hardships, we shall never go on, much less go through with our work. Winds and clouds of tribulation are, in God's hands, designed to try us. God's work shall agree with his word, whether we see it or not. And we may well trust God to provide for us, without our anxious, disquieting cares.

As the wise man had often suggested that nothing was better for a man than to enjoy the good of his labour himself, he here advises to let others, the poor, have a share with him; and as he had directed in the preceding chapter how men should behave towards their superiors, he here instructs them what notice they should take of their inferiors; and as he had cautioned against luxury and intemperance, he here guards against tenacity and covetousness, and exhorts to beneficence and liberality: that which is to be given is "bread", which is put for all the necessaries of life, food and raiment; or money that answers all things, what may be a supply of wants, a support of persons in distress; what is useful, profitable, and beneficial; not stones or scorpions, or what will be useless or harmful: and it must be "thy" bread, a man's own; not independent of God who gives it him; but not another's, what he owes another, or has fraudulently obtained; but what he has got by his own labour, or he is through divine Providence in lawful possession of; hence alms in the Hebrew language is called "righteousness": and it must be such bread as is convenient and fit for a man himself, such as he himself and his family eat of, and this he must cast, it must be a man's own act, and a voluntary one; his bread must not be taken and forced from him; it must be given freely, and in such a manner as not to be expected again; and bountifully and plentifully, as a man casts seed into the earth; but here it is said to be "upon the waters"; bread is to be given to such as are in distress and affliction, that have waters of a full cup wrung out unto them, whose faces are watered with tears, and foul with weeping, from whom nothing is to be expected again, who can make no returns; so that what is given thorn seems to be cast away and lost, like what is thrown into a river, or into the midst of the sea; and even it is to be given to such who prove ungrateful and unthankful, and on whom no mark or impression of the kindness is made and left, no more than upon water; yea, it is to be given to strangers never seen before nor after, like gliding water; so the Vulgate Latin version renders it, "passing waters": or else to such who may be compared to well watered ground, or "moist ground", as Mr. Broughton renders it; where the seed cast will grow up again, and bring forth fruit, and redound to the advantage of the sower, as what is given to the poor does; they are a good soil to sow upon, especially Christ's poor, who are partakers of his living water, grace; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-20.htm">Isaiah 32:20</a>; though it may be the multitude of persons to whom alms is to be given are here intended, which are sometimes signified by waters, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-15.htm">Revelation 17:15</a>; as <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/11-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 11:2</a> seems to explain it. The Targum is, <p>"reach out the bread of thy sustenance to the poor that go in ships upon the thee of the water;'' <p>and some think the speech is borrowed from navigation, and is an allusion to merchants who send their goods beyond sea, and have a large return for them; <p>for thou shalt find it after many days; not the identical bread itself, but the fruit and reward of such beneficence; which they shall have unexpectedly, or after long waiting, as the husbandman for his seed; it suggests that such persons should live long, as liberal persons oftentimes do, and increase in their worldly substance; and if they should not live to reap the advantage of their liberality, yet their posterity will, as the seed of Jonathan did for the kindness he showed to David: or, however, if they find it not again in temporal things, yet in spirituals; and shall be recompensed in the resurrection of the just, and to all eternity. So the Targum, <p>"for after the time of many days, then thou shall find the reward of it in this world (so it is in the king's Bible), and in the world to come;'' <p>see <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-12.htm">Luke 12:12</a>. Jarchi instances in Jethro. Noldius (p) renders it "within many days", even before many days are at an end; for seed sown by waters in hot climates soon sprung up, and produced fruit; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/11-20.htm">Daniel 11:20</a>. <p>(p) Ebr.

It is not to be wondered at, in such a case, that interpreters should, after their nature, read their own thoughts between the lines and so “find what they have sought.” This precept accordingly has been taken by some commentators (<span class="ital">e.g.</span> Grätz) as recommending an unrestrained licentiousness. By others it has been raised almost to the level of the counsel which bids us “do good, hoping for nothing again, even to the unthankful and the evil” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/5-44.htm" title="But I say to you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which spitefully use you, and persecute you;...">Matthew 5:44-46</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/6-32.htm" title="For if you love them which love you, what thank have you? for sinners also love those that love them....">Luke 6:32-35</a>). The latter is, it need hardly be said, infinitely more in accordance with the context and with the conclusion to which the writer is drawing near. Here again we find guidance in the parallelism of Greek thought. As Lowth pointed out (<span class="ital">De Sac. Poes. Heb.</span> x.) the words refer to the Greek proverbial phrase <span class="greekheb">σπείρειν ἐπὶ πόντῳ</span> (“to sow in the ocean”) as indicating a thankless labour. So Theognis, v. 105,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">Δειλοὺς δ</span>ʼ <span class="greekheb">εὖ ἔρδοντι ματαιοτάτη χάρις ἔστιν</span>,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">Ἴσον γὰρ σπείρειν πόντον ἀλὸς πολιῆς</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">Οὔτε γὰρ ἄν πόντον σπείοων βαθὺ λήϊον ἀμῶς</span>,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">Οὔτε κακοὺς εὖ δρῶν εὖ πάλιν ἀντιλάβοις</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"></span>“Vain is thy bounty, giving to the base,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Like scattering seed upon the salt sea’s plain;<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Sowing the sea, thou shalt no harvest reap,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Nor, giving to the vile, reward shalt gain.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Other parallels are found (1) in the Aramaic version of the proverbs of Sirach “Cast thy bread upon the water and the land, and at last thou shalt find it again” (Dukes, <span class="ital">Rabbin. Blumenl</span>. p. 73). (2) In an Arabic proverb, the moral of a long legend narrating how Mohammed the son of Hassan had been in the daily habit of throwing loaves into a river, how the life of an adopted son of the Caliph Mutewekjil, who had narrowly escaped drowning by clambering to a rock, was thus preserved, and how Mohammed saw in this a proof of the proverb he had learnt in his youth “Do good; cast thy bread upon the waters, and one day thou shall be rewarded” (Diez, <span class="ital">Denkwürdigkeiten von Asien</span>, i. p. 106, quoted by Dukes, <span class="ital">ut supra</span>). (3) In a Turkish proverb, also quoted by Dukes from Diez, “Do good, cast thy bread upon the water. If the fish know it not, yet the Creator knows.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The writer holds himself aloof from the selfish prudence of the maxim of Theognis, and bids men not to be afraid “to cast their bread (the generic term stands for “corn,” as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-54.htm" title="And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as Joseph had said: and the dearth was in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.">Genesis 41:54</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-28.htm" title="Bread corn is bruised; because he will not ever be threshing it, nor break it with the wheel of his cart, nor bruise it with his horsemen.">Isaiah 28:28</a>) even upon the face of the thankless waters.” Sooner or later they shall reap as they have sown. Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/9-6.htm" title="But this I say, He which sows sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he which sows bountifully shall reap also bountifully....">2 Corinthians 9:6-10</a>. It is not without interest to note that this interpretation is adopted by Voltaire in his <span class="ital">Précis de l’Ecclesiaste</span>,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“Répandez vos bienfaits avec magnificence,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Même aux moins vertueux ne les refusez pas.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Other interpretations may be briefly noted, but have not much to commend them: (1) that the figure is drawn from agriculture, and that the corn is to be sown in a well irrigated field, but this gives a meaning precisely the opposite of the true one; (2) that it is drawn from commerce and commends a venturous spirit of enterprise like that of exporting corn, which is certain to bring profit in the long run; but this again, unless we make the venture one of benevolence, is foreign to the spirit of the context; (3) that it speaks of throwing cakes of bread upon the water, that float away and seem to be wasted; but this, though leading to the same result as the interpretation here adopted, and having the support of the Arab legend quoted above, lacks the point of the reference to the Greek proverb; (4) last and basest, the imagination of one interpreter mentioned above that the precept sanctions a boundless sensual indulgence.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-6.</span> - Section 16. Leaving alone unanswerable questions, man's duty and happiness are found in activity, especially in doing all the good in his power, for he knows not how soon he himself may stand in need of help. This is <span class="accented">the first remedy for the perplexities of life</span>. The wise man will not charge himself with results. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Cast thy bread upon the waters.</span> The old interpretation of this passage, which found in it a reference to the practice in Egypt of sowing seed during the inundation of the Nile, is not admissible. The verb <span class="accented">shalaeh</span> is not used in the sense of sowing or scattering seed; it means "to cast or send forth." Two chief explanations have been given. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> As to sow on the water is equivalent to taking thankless toil (compare the Greek proverb, <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1ff3;</span>), the gnome may be an injunction to do good without hope of return, like the evangelical precept (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-44.htm">Matthew 5:44-46</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-32.htm">Luke 6:32-35</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> It is a commercial maxim, urging men to make ventures in trade, that they may receive a good return for their expenditure. In this case the casting seed upon the waters is a metaphorical expression for sending merchandise across the sea to distant lands. This view is supposed to be confirmed by the statement concerning the good woman in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-14.htm">Proverbs 31:14</a>, "She is like the merchants' ships; she bringeth her bread from far;" and the words of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-23.htm">Psalm 107:23</a>, "They that go down to the sea in ships, that do Business in great waters." But one sees no reason why Koheleth should suddenly turn to commerce and the trade of a maritime city. Such considerations have no reference to the context, nor to the general design of the book. Nothing leads to them, nothing comes of them. On the other hand, if we take the verse as urging active beneficence as the safest and best proceeding under men's present circumstances, We have a maxim in due accordance with the spirit of the rest of the work, and one which conduces to the conclusion reached at the end. So we adopt the first of the two explanations mentioned above. The bread in the East is made in the form of thin cakes, which would float for a time if thrown into a stream; and if it be objected that no one would be guilty of such an irrational action as flinging bread into the water, it may be answered that this is just the point aimed at. Do your kindnesses, exert yourself, in the most unlikely quarters, not thinking of gratitude or return, but only of duty. And yet surely a recompense will be made in some form or other. Thou shalt find it after many days. This is not to be the motive of our acts, but it will in the course of time be the result; and this thought may be an encouragement. In the Chaldee Version of parts of Ecclesiasticus there is extant a maxim identical with our verse, "Strew thy bread on the water and on the land, and thou shalt find it at the end of days" (Dukes, 'Rabb. Btumenl.,' p. 73). Parallels have been found in many quarters. Thus the Turk says, "Do good, throw it into the water; if the fish does not know it, God does." Herzfeld quotes Goethe - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Was willst du untersuchen,<br />Wohin die Milde fliesst!<br />Ins Wasser wirf deine Kuchen;<br />Wer weiss wet sie geniesst?"</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Wouldst thou too narrowly inquire<br />Whither thy kindness goes!<br />Thy cake upon the water cast;<br />Whom it may feed who knows?"</span> Voltaire paraphrases the passage in his 'Precis de l'Ecclesiaste' - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Repandez vos bienfaits avec magnificence,<br />Meme aux moins vertueux ne les refusez pas.<br />Ne vous informez pas de leur reconnoissance;<br />Il est grand, il est beau de faire des ingrats."</span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ecclesiastes/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"The labour of the foolish wearieth him who knoweth not how to go to the city." If we do not seek to explain: labour such as fools have wearies him (the fool), then we have here such a synallage numeri as at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-8.htm">Isaiah 2:8</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/4-8.htm">Hosea 4:8</a>, for from the plur. a transition is made to the distributive or individualizing sing. A greater anomaly is the treatment of the noun &#1506;&#1502;&#1500; as fem. (greater even than the same of the noun pithgam, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:11</a>, which admitted of attractional explanation, and, besides, in a foreign word was not strange). Kimchi, Michlol 10a, supposes that &#1506;&#1502;&#1500; is thought of in the sense of &#1506;&#1502;&#1500; &#1497;&#1490;&#1497;&#1506;&#1514;; impossible, for one does not use such an expression. Hitzig, and with him Hengst., sees the occasion for the synallage in the discordance of the masc. &#1497;&#1497;&#1490;&#1468;&#1506;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;; but without hesitation we use the expressions &#1497;&#1497;&#1495;&#1500;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/5-6.htm">Micah 5:6</a>, &#1497;&#1497;&#1505;&#1468;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/6-26.htm">Joshua 6:26</a>, and the like. 'Amal also cannot be here fem. unitatis (Bttch. 657. 4), for it denotes the wearisome striving of fools as a whole and individually. We have thus to suppose that the author has taken the liberty of using 'amal once as fem. (vid., on the contrary, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-18.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:18</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-20.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:20</a>), as the poet, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-13.htm">Proverbs 4:13</a>, in the introduction of the Book of Proverbs uses musar once as fem., and as the similarly formed &#1510;&#1489;&#1488; is used in two genders. The fool kindles himself up and perplexes himself, as if he could enlighten the world and make it happy, - he who does not even know how to go to the city. Ewald remarks: "Apparently proverbial, viz., to bribe the great lords in the city." For us who, notwithstanding <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-16.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:16</a>, do not trouble ourselves any more with the tyrants of <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:4</a>, such thoughts, which do violence to the connection, are unnecessary. Hitzig also, and with him Elst. and Zckl., thinks of the city as the residence of the rulers from whom oppression proceeds, but from whom also help against oppression is to be sought. All this is to be rejected. Not to know how to go to the city, is  equals  not to be able to find the open public street, and, like the Syrians, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-18.htm">2 Kings 6:18</a>., to be smitten with blindness. The way to the city is via notissima et tritissima. Rightly Grotius, like Aben Ezra: Multi quaestionibus arduis se faitgant, cum ne obvia quidem norint, quale est iter ad urbem. &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512; is vulgar for &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512;. In the Greek language also the word &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; has a definite signification, and Athens is called &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;, mostly without the art. But Stamboul, the name of which may seem as an illustration of the proverbial phrase, "not to know how to go to the city," is  equals  &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;. Grtz finds here an allusion to the Essenes, who avoided the city - habeat sibi! </body></html>
