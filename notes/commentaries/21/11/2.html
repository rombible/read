We have reason to expect evil, for we are born to trouble; it is wisdom to do good in the day of prosperity. Riches cannot profit us, if we do not benefit others. Every man must labour to be a blessing to that place where the providence of God casts him. Wherever we are, we may find good work to do, if we have but hearts to do it. If we magnify every little difficulty, start objections, and fancy hardships, we shall never go on, much less go through with our work. Winds and clouds of tribulation are, in God's hands, designed to try us. God's work shall agree with his word, whether we see it or not.

Or, a "part" (q); not the whole of a man's substance, for he must have to support himself and his family; he that does not take care of that is worse than an infidel; a man may bestow all his goods on the poor, and not have charity; though no doubt there was true charity, or love, in the poor widow that threw in all her substance into the treasury, which was an extraordinary case, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-8.htm">1 Timothy 5:8</a>; but a man is to give of such things that he has, ordinarily, and not all that he has, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-41.htm">Luke 11:41</a>; he is to give according to his ability, and what he can spare from the service of himself and family; and this is to be distributed, and given in parts to the poor, according to their necessities; not all to one, but something to everyone, "to seven, and also to eight": if seven persons apply, give them everyone a part; and, if an eighth person comes, send him not away empty; give to every one that asketh, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-30.htm">Luke 6:30</a>; compare with this phrase <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/5-5.htm">Micah 5:5</a>; Some think this respects time, so Aben Ezra; that a man should give constantly and continually, should be daily giving, all the seven days of the week, and when the eighth day comes, or the week begins again, go on in the same course. The Targum is, <p>"put a good part of seed in thy field in Tisri (the seventh month), and do not cease from sowing even in Casleu,'' <p>the eighth month; <p>for thou knowest not what evil shall be upon the earth; what calamities shall come upon it, which may sweep away all a man's substance; it may be destroyed by fire, or washed away by a deluge of water, or plundered by an enemy; or, however, the day of death may quickly come, as it certainly shall, and then it will be no longer in a man's power to do good with what he has. Moreover, the arguments which covetous men use against liberality, the wise man uses for it; they argue that bad times may come, and they may sustain great losses; or have a greater charge upon them, a growing family; or they may live to old age, and want it themselves: be it no, these are reasons why they should give liberally while they can; that when these things they fear shall come upon them, they may be relieved and supplied by others; for those that show mercy shall find mercy; and this is the way to make themselves friends in a time of need, and against it; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-9.htm">Luke 16:9</a>. <p>(q) "partem", Pagninus, Montanus, Munster, Vatablus, Drusius, Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator, &amp;c. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/ecclesiastes/11.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Give a portion to seven, and also to eight; for thou knowest not what evil shall be upon the earth.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/ecclesiastes/11.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">2</span>. <span class="ital">Give a portion to seven, and also to eight</span>] The precept is clearly a pendant to <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/11-1.htm" title="Cast your bread on the waters: for you shall find it after many days.">Ecclesiastes 11:1</a> and has received the same variety of interpretations. Following the same line of thought as before, we find in it the counsel to give freely as opportunities present themselves. The combination of “to seven and also to eight,” is, like that of “six and seven” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-19.htm" title="He shall deliver you in six troubles: yes, in seven there shall no evil touch you.">Job 5:19</a>, of “three and four” in Amos 1, 2, like the “seventy times seven” of <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-22.htm" title="Jesus said to him, I say not to you, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven.">Matthew 18:22</a>, a Hebrew form of the definite for the indefinite. There is, in our acts of kindness, to be no grudging narrowness. In such things<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“Kind heaven disdains the lore<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Of nicely calculated less or more.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And the reason given fits in with the counsel, “Thou knowest not what evil shall be on earth.” “Hard times may come, when thou shalt have no means for giving; therefore waste not the present opportunity. Help those to whom thou givest to meet the hazards of the uncertain future.” Here again men interpret according to their character, and so, we have, as before, the licentious moralist finding a plea for unlimited voluptuousness, while the prudential adviser sees in the precept, which he renders “Divide the portion into seven, yea eight parts,” a caution like that which led Jacob to divide his caravan into two portions for the sake of safety (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/32-7.htm" title="Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided the people that was with him, and the flocks, and herds, and the camels, into two bands;...">Genesis 32:7-8</a>). Taken in this last sense the precept stands on a level with the current saying of the Stock Exchange that it isn’t wise to “put all your eggs into one basket,” with the “hedging” of those who bet on more than one horse at the Derby and other races. It may well be left to the student to decide which of these interpretations has most to commend it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It may be admitted, however, as it is the enigmatic form of the precept which has given rise to these discordant views as to its meaning, that the grave irony of the writer, which we have already traced in ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-4.htm" title="If the spirit of the ruler rise up against you, leave not your place; for yielding pacifies great offenses.">Ecclesiastes 10:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-20.htm" title="Curse not the king, no not in your thought; and curse not the rich in your bedchamber: for a bird of the air shall carry the voice, and that which has wings shall tell the matter.">Ecclesiastes 10:20</a> may have led him to adopt that form because it served as a test of character, each scholar finding what he sought. Here also it might be added “Who hath ears to hear, let him hear” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-9.htm" title="Who has ears to hear, let him hear.">Matthew 13:9</a>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Give a portion to seven, and also to eight</span>. This further explains, without any metaphor, the injunction of beneficence in ver. 1. Give portions of thy "bread" to any number of those who need. Delitzsch and others who interpret the passage of maritime enterprise would see in it a recommendation (like the proceeding of Jacob, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-16.htm">Genesis 32:16</a>, etc.) not to risk all at once, to divide one's ventures into various ships. But the expression in the text is merely a mode of enjoining unlimited benevolence. The numbers are purposely indefinite. Instances of this form of speech are common enough (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-16.htm">Proverbs 6:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-7.htm">Proverbs 30:7-9</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-3.htm">Amos 1:3</a>. etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/5-5.htm">Micah 5:5</a>; Ecclus. 23:16 Ecclus. 26:5, 28). Wordsworth notes that the word for "<span class="accented">portion"</span> (<span class="accented">chelek</span>) is that used specially for the portion of the Levites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-20.htm">Numbers 18:20</a>); and in accordance with his view of the date of the book, finds here an injunction not to confine one's offerings to the Levites of Judah, but to extend them to the refugees who come from Israel. <span class="cmt_word">For thou knowest not what evil shall be upon the earth.</span> A time may come when you yourself may need help; the power of giving may no longer be yours; therefore make friends now who may be your comfort in distress. So the Lord urges, "Make to yourselves friends by means of the mammon of unrighteousness" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-9.htm">Luke 16:9</a>). It seems a low motive on which to base charitable actions; but men act on such secondary motives every day, and the moralist cannot ignore them. In the Book of Proverbs secondary and worldly motives are largely urged as useful in the conduct of life (see the Introduction to Proverbs, pp. 8, 9.). St. Paul reminds us that we some day may need a brother's help (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-1.htm">Galatians 6:1</a>). The Fathers have spiritualized the passage, so as to make it of Christian application, far away indeed from Koheleth's thought. Thus St. Gregory: "By the number <span class="accented">seven</span> is understood the whole of this temporal condition...  this is shown more plainly when the number <span class="accented">eight</span> is mentioned after it. For when another number besides follows after seven, it is set forth by this very addition, that this temporal state is brought to an end and closed by eternity. For by the number <span class="accented">seven</span> Solomon expressed the present time, which is passed by periods of seven days. But by the number <span class="accented">eight</span> he designated eternal life, which the Lord made known to us by his resurrection. For he rose in truth on the Lord's day, which, as following the seventh day, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the sabbath, is found to be the eighth from the creation. But it is well said, 'Give portions,' etc. As if it were plainly said, 'So dispense temporal goods, as not to forget to desire those that are eternal. For thou oughtest to provide for the future by well-doing, who knowest not what tribulation succeeds from the future judgment'" ('Moral,' 35:17, Oxford transl.). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ecclesiastes/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"Woe to thee, O land, whose king is a child, and whose princes sit at table in the early morning!

Instead of &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; &#1503;, the older language would rather use the phrase &#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1468;&#1493; &#1504;&#1506;&#1512; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;; and instead of na'ar, we might correctly use, after <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-22.htm">Proverbs 30:22</a>, 'e&#780;ve&#780;d; but not as Grtz thinks, who from this verse deduces the reference of the book of Herod (the "slave of the Hasmonean house," as the Talm. names him), in the same meaning. For na'ar, it is true, sometimes means - e.g., as Ziba's by-name (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-18.htm">2 Samuel 19:18</a> [17]) - a servant, but never a slave as such, so that here, in the latter sense, it might be the contrast of &#1489;&#1468;&#1503;&#1470;&#1495;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;; it is to be understood after <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-12.htm">Isaiah 3:12</a>; and Solomon, Bishop of Constance, understood this woe rightly, for he found it fulfilled at the time of the last German Karolingian Ludwig III.<p>(Note: Cf. Bchmann's Feglgelte Worte, p. 178, 5th ed. (1868).)<p>Na'ar is a very extensively applicable word in regard to the age of a person. King Solomon and the prophets Jeremiah and Zechariah show that na'ar may be used with reference to one in a high office; but here it is one of few years of age who is meant, who is incapable of ruling, and shows himself as childish in this, that he lets himself be led by bad guides in accordance with their pleasure. In 16b, the author perhaps thinks of the heads of the aristocracy who have the phantom-king in their power: intending to fatten themselves, they begin their feasting with the break of day. If we translate yoche&#772;e&#772;lu by "they eat," 16b sounds as if to breakfast were a sin, - with us such an abbreviation of the thought so open to misconception would be a fault in style, but not so with a Hebrew.<p>(Note: Vid., Gesch. d. jd. Poesie, p. 188.f.)<p>&#1488;&#1499;&#1500; (for &#1500;&#1495;&#1501; &#1488;&#1499;&#1500;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/14-4.htm">Psalm 14:4</a>) is here eating for eating's sake, eating as its own object, eating which, in the morning, comes in the place of fresh activity in one's calling, consecrated by prayer. Instead of &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:17</a>, there ought properly to have been &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1498;; but (1) &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497; has this peculiarity, to be explained from its interjectional usage, that with the suff. added it remains in the form of the st. constr., for we say e.g., &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1498; for &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1498;; (2) the sing. form &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, inflected &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;, so substitutes itself that &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1498;, or, more correctly, &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1498;, and &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/29-19.htm">Proverbs 29:19</a>, the latter for &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493;, are used (vid., under Sol 2:14).<p>Regarding be&#780;n-hhorim, the root-word signifies to be white (vid., under <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/40-16.htm">Genesis 40:16</a>). A noble is called hhor, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-12.htm">Isaiah 34:12</a>; and one noble by birth, more closely, or also merely descriptively (Gesen. Lehrgeb. p. 649), be&#780;n-hhorim, from his purer complexion, by which persons of rank were distinguished from the common people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-7.htm">Lamentations 4:7</a>). In the passage before us, be&#780;n-hhorim is an ethical conception, as e.g., also generosus becomes such, for it connects with the idea of noble by birth that of noble in disposition, and the latter predominates (cf. Sol 7:2, nadiv): it is well with a land whose king is of noble mind, is a man of noble character, or, if we give to be&#780;n-hhorim the Mishnic meaning, is truly a free man (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-36.htm">John 8:36</a>). Of princes after the pattern of such a king, the contrary of what is said 16b is true: they do not eat early in the morning, but ba'et, "at the right time;" everywhere else this is expressed by be'itto (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:11</a>); here the expression - corresponding to the Greek &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#837;&#834;, the Lat. in tempore - is perhaps occasioned by the contrast baboqe&#780;r, "in the morning." Eating at the right time is more closely characterized by bighvurah velo vashshethi. Jerome, whom Luther follows, translates: ad reficiendum et non ad luxuriam. Hitz., Ginsb., and Zckl., "for strengthening" (obtaining strength), not: "for feasting;" but that beth might introduce the object aimed at (after Hitz., proceeding from the beth of exchange), we have already considered under <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:4</a>. The author, wishing to say this, ought to have written lshty wl' lgbwrh. Better, Hahn: "in strength, but not in drunkenness," - as heroes, but not as drunkards (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-22.htm">Isaiah 5:22</a>). Ewald's "in virtue, and not in debauchery," is also thus meant. But what is that: to eat in virtue, i.e., the dignity of a man? The author much rather represents them as eating in manly strength, i.e., as this requires it (cf. the plur. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/71-16.htm">Psalm 71:16</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-10.htm">Psalm 90:10</a>), only not bashti ("in drunkenness - excess"), so that eating and drinking become objects in themselves. Kleinert, well: as men, and not as gluttons. The Masora makes, under bashti,' the note &#1500;&#1497;&#1514;, i.e., &#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1497; has here a meaning which it has not elsewhere, it signifies drunkenness; elsewhere it means the weft of a web. The Targ. gives the word the meaning of weakness (&#1495;&#1500;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;), after the Midrash, which explains it by &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468; (in weakness); Menahem b. Saruk takes along with it in this sense &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1492;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-30.htm">Jeremiah 51:30</a>. The Talm. Shabbath 10a, however, explains it rightly by &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1470;&#1497;&#1497;&#1503;. </body></html>
