V. is not that of the Hebrew, which gives <span class="ital">For in the multitude of dreams and vanities and many words</span>, but is adopted by many commentators as representing a more correct text. The introduction of the word “vanities” (the “divers” of the A. V. has, as the italics shew, nothing answering to it in the Hebrew,) indicates the purpose of the writer in thus noting the weak points of popular religionism. They also, the dreams which seemed to them as messages from heaven, the “many words” of long and resounding prayers, took their place in the induction which was to prove that “all is vanity.” So Theophrastus (<span class="ital">Charact</span>. xvi.) describes the superstitious man (<span class="greekheb">δεισιδαίμων</span>) as agitated when he sees a vision and straightway going off to consult a soothsayer. In contrast with the garrulous rashness and the inconsiderate vows and the unwise reliance on dreams which Judaism was learning from heathenism (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-7.htm" title="But when you pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.">Matthew 6:7</a>) Koheleth falls back on the “fear of God,” the temper of reverential and silent awe, which was “the beginning of wisdom” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-7.htm" title="The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge: but fools despise wisdom and instruction.">Proverbs 1:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-28.htm" title="And to man he said, Behold, the fear of the LORD, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding.">Job 28:28</a>). It is significant that here again the teaching of Koheleth has a parallel in that of the Epicurean poet who traces the “religions” of mankind (in his sense of the word) in no small measure to the influence of dreams.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“Quippe etenim jam tum divum mortalia sæcla<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Egregias animo facies vigilante videbant,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Et magis in somnis mirando corporis auctu.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“Even then the race of mortal men would see<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>With waking soul the mighty forms of Gods,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And in their dreams with shapes of wondrous size.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Lucret. <span class="ital">De Rer.

Koheleth sums up the sense of the preceding paragraph, vers. 1-6. The popular religion, which made much of dreams and verbosity and vows, is vanity, and has in it nothing substantial or comforting. The superstitious man who puts his faith in dreams is unpractical and unreal; the garrulous man who is rash in his vows, and in prayer thinks to be heard for his much speaking, displeases God and never secures his object. Ginsburg and Bullock render, "For it is (it happens) through the multitude of idle thoughts and vanities and much talking," the reference being either to the foolish speaking of ver. 2 or to the wrath of God in ver. 6. The Septuagint rendering is elliptical, <span class="greek">&#x1f4d;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f7a;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>. To complete this, some supply, "Many vows are made or excused;" others, "There is evil." Vulgate, <span class="accented">Ubi multa aunt somnia</span>, <span class="accented">plurimae aunt vanitates</span>, <span class="accented">et sermones innumeri</span>.' The Authorized Version gives the sense of the passage. <span class="cmt_word">But fear thou God.</span> In contrast with these spurious forms of religion, which the Jews were inclined to adopt, the writer recalls men to the fear of the one true God, to whom all vows should be performed, and who should be worshipped from the heart. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ecclesiastes/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God, and to go to hear is better than that fools give a sacrifice; for the want of knowledge leads them to do evil." The "house of God" is like the "house of Jahve," <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-20.htm">2 Samuel 12:20</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-1.htm">Isaiah 37:1</a>, the temple; &#1488;&#1500;, altogether like &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1502;&#1470;&#1488;&#1500;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-17.htm">Psalm 73:17</a>. The Cheth&#305;&#770;b &#1512;&#1490;&#1500;&#1497;&#1498; is admissible, for elsewhere also this plur. ("thy feet") occurs in a moral connection and with a spiritual reference, e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-59.htm">Psalm 119:59</a>; but more frequently, however, the comprehensive sing. occurs. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-105.htm">Psalm 119:105</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-15.htm">Proverbs 1:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-26.htm">Proverbs 4:26</a>., and the Ker&#305;&#770; thus follows the right note. The correct understanding of what follows depends on &#1512;&#1506; ... &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1470;. Interpreters have here adopted all manner of impossible views. Hitzig's translation: "for they know not how to be sorrowful," has even found in Stuart at least one imitator; but &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1514; &#1512;&#1506; would, as the contrast of 'asoth tov, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:12</a>, mean nothing else than, "to do that which is unpleasant, disagreeable, bad," like 'asah ra'ah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-18.htm">2 Samuel 12:18</a>. Gesen., Ewald (336b), Elster, Heiligst., Burger, Zckl., Dale, and Bullock translate: "they know not that they do evil;" but for such a rendering the words ought to have been &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1514;&#1501; &#1512;&#1506; (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-15.htm">Jeremiah 15:15</a>); the only example for the translation of &#1500;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1514; after the manner of the acc. c. inf.  equals  se facere malum - viz. at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-4.htm">1 Kings 19:4</a> - is incongruous, for &#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; does not here mean se mori, but ut moreretur. Yet more incorrect is the translation of Jerome, which is followed by Luther: nesciunt quid faciant mali. It lies near, as at <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-24.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:24</a> so also here, to suppose an injury done to the text. Aben Ezra introduced &#1512;&#1511; before &#1500;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;, but Koheleth never uses this limiting particle; we would have to write &#1499;&#1497; &#1488;&#1501;&#1470;&#1500;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1514;, after <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/3-12.htm">Ezra 3:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/8-15.htm">Ezra 8:15</a>. Anything thus attained, however, is not worth the violent means thus used; for the ratifying clause is not ratifying, and also in itself, affirmed of the &#1499;&#1505;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, who, however, are not the same as the resha'im and the hattaim, is inappropriate. Rather it might be said: they know not to do good (thus the Syr.); or: they know not whether it be good or bad to do, i.e., they have no moral feeling, and act not from moral motives (so the Targ.). Not less violent than this remodelling of the text is the expedient of Herzberg, Philippson, and Ginsburg, who from &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506; derive the subject-conception of the obedient (&#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1502;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501;): "For those understand not at all to do evil;" the subj. ought to have been expressed if it must be something different from the immediately preceding &#1499;&#1505;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;. We may thus render enam yod'im, after <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/82-5.htm">Psalm 82:5</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/56-10.htm">Isaiah 56:10</a>, as complete in itself: they (the fools) are devoid of knowledge to do evil  equals  so that they do evil; i.e., want of knowledge brings them to this, that they do evil. Similarly also Knobel: they concern themselves not, - are unconcerned (viz., about the right mode of worshipping God), - so that they do evil, with the correct remark that the consequence of their perverse conduct is here represented as their intention. But &#1497;&#1491;&#1506; &#1500;&#1488;, absol., does not mean to be unconcerned (wanton), but to be without knowledge. Rashbam, in substance correctly: they are predisposed by their ignorance to do evil; and thus also Hahn; Mendelssohn translates directly: "they sin because they are ignorant." If this interpretation is correct, then for &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506; it follows that it does not mean "to obey" (thus e.g., Zckler), which in general it never means without some words being added to it (cf. on the contrary, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>), but "to hear," - viz. the word of God, which is to be heard in the house of God, - whereby, it is true, a hearing is meant which leads to obedience.<p>In the word &#1492;&#1493;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;, priests are not perhaps thought of, although the comparison of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/5-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:5</a> (&#1492;&#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1498;) with <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/2-7.htm">Malachi 2:7</a> makes it certainly natural; priestly instruction limited itself to information regarding the performance of the law already given in Scripture, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-11.htm">Leviticus 10:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-9.htm">Deuteronomy 33:9</a>., and to deciding on questions arising in the region of legal praxis, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-8.htm">Deuteronomy 24:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/2-11.htm">Haggai 2:11</a>. The priesthood did not belong to the teaching class in the sense of preaching. Preaching was never a part of the temple cultus, but, for the first time, after the exile became a part of the synagogue worship. The preachers under the O.T. were the prophets, - preachers by a supernatural divine call, and by the immediate impulse of the Spirit; we know from the Book of Jeremiah that they sometimes went into the temple, or there caused their books of prophecy to be read; yet the author, by the word &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506; of the foregoing proverb, scarcely thinks of them. But apart from the teaching of the priests, which referred to the realization of the letter of the law, and the teaching of the prophets to the realization of the spirit of the law, the word formed an essential part of the sacred worship of the temple: the Tefilla, the Beracha, the singing of psalms, and certainly, at the time of Koheleth, the reading of certain sections of the Bible. When thou goest to the house of God, says Koheleth, take heed to thy step, well reflecting whither thou goest and how thou hast there to appear; and (with this &#1493; he connects with this first nota bene a second) drawing near to hear exceeds the sacrifice-offering of fools, for they are ignorant (just because they hear not), which leads to this result, that they do evil. &#1502;&#1503;, prae, expresses also, without an adj., precedence in number, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-10.htm">Isaiah 10:10</a>, or activity, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-17.htm">Isaiah 9:17</a>, or worth, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/15-2.htm">Ezekiel 15:2</a>. &#1511;&#1512;&#1493;&#1489; is inf. absol. Bttcher seeks to subordinate it as such to &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;: take heed to thy foot ... and to the coming near to hear more than to ... . But these obj. to &#1513;&#1502;&#1512; would be incongruous, and &#1502;&#1514;&#1514; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; clumsy and even distorted in expression; it ought rather to be &#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1498; &#1499;&#1468;&#1499;&#1505;&#1497;&#1470;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; &#1494;&#1489;&#1495;. As the inf. absol. can take the place of the obj., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-15.htm">Isaiah 7:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-24.htm">Isaiah 42:24</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-45.htm">Lamentations 3:45</a>, so also the place of the subj. (Ewald, 240a), although <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/25-27.htm">Proverbs 25:27</a> is a doubtful example of this. That the use of the inf. absol. has a wide application with the author of this book, we have already seen under <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:2</a>. Regarding the sequence of ideas in &#1494;&#1489;&#1495; ... &#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1514; (first the subj., then the obj.), vid., Gesen. 133. 3, and cf. above at <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-18.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:18</a>. &#1494;&#1489;&#1495; (&#1494;&#1489;&#1495;&#1497;&#1501;), along with its general signification comprehending all animal sacrifices, according to which the altar bears the name &#1502;&#1494;&#1489;&#1468;&#1495;, early acquired also a more special signification: it denotes, in contradistinction to &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492;, such sacrifices as are only partly laid on the altar, and for the most part are devoted to a sacrificial festival, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/18-12.htm">Exodus 18:12</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-27.htm">Exodus 12:27</a>), the so-called shelamim, or also zivhhe shelamim, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-14.htm">Proverbs 7:14</a>. The expression &#1494;&#1489;&#1495; &#1504;&#1514;&#1503; makes it probable that here, particularly, is intended the festival (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-41.htm">1 Kings 1:41</a>) connected with this kind of sacrifice, and easily degenerating to worldly merriment (vid., under <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-14.htm">Proverbs 7:14</a>); for the more common word for &#1514;&#1468;&#1514; would have been &#1492;&#1511;&#1512;&#1497;&#1489; or &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1493;&#1496;; in &#1514;&#1468;&#1514; it seems to be indicated that it means not only to present something to God, but also to give at the same time something to man. The most recent canonical Chokma-book agrees with <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-3.htm">Proverbs 21:3</a> in this depreciation of sacrifice. But the Chokma does not in this stand alone. The great word of Samuel, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>., that self-denying obedience to God is better than all sacrifices, echoes through the whole of the Psalms. And the prophets go to the utmost in depreciating the sacrificial cultus.<p>The second rule relates to prayer. </body></html>
