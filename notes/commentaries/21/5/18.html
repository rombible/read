We must not view our calling as a drudgery, but take pleasure in the calling where God puts us. A cheerful spirit is a great blessing; it makes employments easy, and afflictions light. Having made a proper use of riches, a man will remember the days of his past life with pleasure. The manner in which Solomon refers to God as the Giver, both of life and its enjoyments, shows they ought to be received and to be used, consistently with his will, and to his glory. Let this passage recommend to all the kind words of the merciful Redeemer, Labour not for the meat that perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life. Christ is the Bread of life, the only food of the soul.

Observed, considered and approved of, and which he recommended and excited attention to, and is as follows; <p>it is good and comely for one to eat and to drink; to make use of the creatures God has given for service in a free and liberal manner, without excess, and with moderation; and not deprive a man's self of those things he may lawfully partake of, and are necessary for him: to do this is good for himself, and for the health of his body; and is right in the sight of God, and is comely before men; it is not only lawful, but laudable. There is another version and sense of the words, "it is good to eat and drink him that is fair" (q), or comely; Christ, who is fairer than the children of men; to live by faith on him, to eat his flesh, and drink his blood; but this, however true, spiritual, and evangelical, it seems foreign to the text. It follows, <p>and to enjoy the good of all his labour that he taketh under the sun all the days of his life, which God giveth him; this last clause, "which God giveth him", is not to be connected with "the good of all his labour"; though it is true, that whatever good is got by labour is the gift of God; but with "all the days of his life"; for the life of man, and all the days of it, be they more or fewer, are the gift of God, and according to his determinate will and pleasure; and throughout this time a man should enjoy, in a comfortable way, with thankfulness to God, the good things he has gotten by his labour and industry, through the blessing of God along with them. This Solomon frequently inculcates; Aben Ezra says, this is the third time, but it seems to be the fourth; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-24.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:24</a>; <p>for it is his portion; that is, in this life; for otherwise, if a good man, he has a better portion in another: this is the part which God has allotted to him here; and it is his duty, and for his good and comfort, to make use of it. <p>(q) "Bonum est, cum qui pulcher est, edere et bibere, h. e.

If a man has little, let him be content with that little. If he has much, let him enjoy it without excess, and without seeking more. In the combination of “good” and “comely” we have perhaps an endeavour to reproduce the familiar Greek combination of the <span class="greekheb">ἀγαθὸν</span> and the <span class="greekheb">καλόν</span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 18-20.</span> - Section 8.

The Septuagint gives, <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, "<span class="accented">Behold</span>, I have seen a good which is comely;" and it is best to translate, with Delitzsch and others, "Behold, what I have seen as good, what as beautiful, is this." My conclusion holds good. They who seek for traces of Greek influence in Koheleth find Epicureanism in the sentiment, and the familiar combination, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>, in the language. Both ideas are baseless. (For supposed Epicureanism, see on Ecclesiastes 2:24 and Ecclesiastes 3:12.) And the juxtaposition of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> is only a fortuitous rendering of the Hebrew, upon which no argument for Grecism can be founded. <span class="cmt_word">To eat and to drink</span>, etc.; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. to use the common blessings which God bestows with thankfulness and contentment.

This is the point so often insisted upon. These temporal blessings are God's gifts, and are not to be considered as the natural and assured result of man's own exertions. Man, indeed, must labor, but God giveth the increase. <span class="cmt_word">For it is his portion</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-22.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:22</a>). This calm enjoyment is allotted to man by God, and nothing more must be expected. Ben-Sira gives similar advice, "Defraud not thyself of a good day, and let not the share in a right pleasure pass by thee Give, and take, and beguile thy soul; for there is no seeking of dainties in Hades" (Ecclus. 14:14. etc.). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ecclesiastes/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>He can also eat that which is good, and can eat much; but he does not on that account sleep more quietly than the labourer who lives from hand to mouth: "Sweet is the sleep of the labourer, whether he eats little or much; but, on the contrary, the abundance of the rich does not permit him to sleep." The lxx, instead of "labourer," uses the word "slave" (&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;), as if the original were &#1492;&#1506;&#1489;&#1491;. But, as a rule, sound sleep is the reward of earnest labour; and since there are idle servants as well as active masters, there is no privilege to servants. The Venet. renders rightly by "of the husbandman" (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;), the &#1492;&#1488;&#1491;&#1502;&#1492; &#1506;&#1489;&#1491;; the "labourer" in general is called &#1506;&#1502;&#1500;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:8</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/5-26.htm">Judges 5:26</a>, post-bibl. &#1508;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;. The labourer enjoys sweet, i.e., refreshing, sound sleep, whether his fare be abundant of scanty - the labour rewards him by sweet sleep, notwithstanding his poverty; while, on the contrary, the sleep of the rich is hindered and disturbed by his abundance, not: by his satiety, viz., repletion, as Jerome remarks: incocto cibo in stomachi angustiis aestuante; for the labourer also, if he eats much, eats his fill; and why should sufficiency have a different result in the one from what is has in the other? As &#1513;&#1474;&#1489;&#1506; means satiety, not over-satiety; so, on the other hand, it means, objectively, sufficient and plentifully existing fulness to meet the wants of man, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-10.htm">Proverbs 3:10</a>, and the word is meant thus objectively here: the fulness of possession which the rich has at his disposal does not permit him to sleep, for all kinds of projects, cares, anxieties regarding it rise within him, which follow him into the night, and do not suffer his mind to be at rest, which is a condition of sleep. The expression &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474; &#1500;&#1506; is the circumlocutio of the genit. relation, like &#1500;&#1489; ... &#1495;&#1500;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/2-3.htm">Ruth 2:3</a>; &#1504;&#1506; ... &#1488;&#1501; (lxx &#x391;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c3; &#787;&#x391;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;), <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-2.htm">2 Samuel 3:2</a>. Heiligstedt remarks that it stands for &#1513;&#1474;&#1489;&#1506; &#1492;&#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1512;; but the nouns &#1510;&#1502;&#1488;, &#1512;&#1506;&#1489; ,&#1510;&#1502;&#1488; snuon, &#1513;&#1474;&#1489;&#1506; form no const., for which reason the circumloc. was necessary; &#1513;&#1474;&#1489;&#1506; is the constr. of &#1513;&#1474;&#1489;&#1506;. Falsely, Ginsburg: "aber der Ueberfluss den Reichen - er lsst ihn nicht schlafen" but superabundance the rich - it doth not suffer him to sleep; but this construction is neither in accordance with the genius of the German nor of the Heb. language. Only the subject is resumed in &#1488;&#1497;&#1504;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:7</a>); the construction of &#1492;&#1504;&#1497;&#1495; is as at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-21.htm">1 Chronicles 16:21</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-14.htm">Psalm 105:14</a>.
