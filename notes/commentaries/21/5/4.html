Such mockery of God would bring the Divine displeasure, which might blast what was thus unduly kept. We are to keep down the fear of man. Set God before thee; then, if thou seest the oppression of the poor, thou wilt not find fault with Divine Providence; nor think the worse of the institution of magistracy, when thou seest the ends of it thus perverted; nor of religion, when thou seest it will not secure men from suffering wrong.

Or "if thou vowest" (r), as the Vulgate Latin version; for vows are free and indifferent things, which persons may make or not; there is no precept for them in the word of God; instances and examples there are, and they may be lawfully made, when they are in the power of man to perform, and are not inconsistent with the will and word of God; they have been made by good men, and were frequent in former times; but they seem not so agreeable to the Gospel dispensation, having a tendency to ensnare the mind, to entangle men, and bring on them a spirit of bondage, contrary to that liberty wherewith Christ has made them free; and therefore it is better to abstain from them: holy resolutions to do the will and work of God should be taken up in the strength of divine grace; but to vow this, or that, or the other thing, which a man previous to his vow is not obliged unto, had better be let alone: but however, when a vow is made that is lawful to be done, <p>defer not to pay it; that is, to God, to whom it is made, who expects it, and that speedily, as Hannah paid hers; no excuses nor delays should be made; <p>for he hath no pleasure in fools; that is, the Lord hath no pleasure in them, he will not be mocked by them; he will resent such treatment of him, as to vow and not pay, or defer payment and daily, with him. So the Targum, <p>"for the Lord hath no pleasure in fools, because, they defer their vows, and do not pay;'' <p>pay that which thou hast vowed; precisely and punctually; both as to the matter, manner, and time of it. <p>(r)  "si quid vovisti", V.

They point to a time when vows, such as are here referred to, entered largely into men’s personal religion. Memorable instances of such vows are found in the lives of Jacob (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-20.htm" title="And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on,">Genesis 28:20</a>), Jephthah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-30.htm" title="And Jephthah vowed a vow to the LORD, and said, If you shall without fail deliver the children of Ammon into my hands,">Jdg 11:30</a>), Saul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-24.htm" title="And the men of Israel were distressed that day: for Saul had adjured the people, saying, Cursed be the man that eats any food until evening, that I may be avenged on my enemies. So none of the people tasted any food.">1 Samuel 14:24</a>). In later Judaism they came into a fresh prominence, as seen especially in the Corban of <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/7-11.htm" title="But you say, If a man shall say to his father or mother, It is Corban, that is to say, a gift, by whatever you might be profited by me; he shall be free.">Mark 7:11</a>, the revival of the Nazarite vow (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-18.htm" title="And Paul after this tarried there yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brothers, and sailed there into Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn his head in Cenchrea: for he had a vow.">Acts 18:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-23.htm" title="Save that the Holy Ghost witnesses in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions abide me.">Acts 20:23</a>; Joseph. <span class="ital">Wars</span> ii. 15, p. 1), and the oath or anathema of <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-21.htm" title="But do not you yield to them: for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men, which have bound themselves with an oath, that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him: and now are they ready, looking for a promise from you.">Acts 23:21</a>; and one of the treatises of the Mishna (<span class="ital">Nedarim</span>) was devoted to an exhaustive casuistic treatment of the whole subject. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-23.htm" title="Therefore if you bring your gift to the altar, and there remember that your brother has ought against you;">Matthew 5:23</a> we find the recognised rule of the Pharisees, “Thou shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths,” as the conclusion of the whole matter. This the <span class="bld">Debater</span> also affirmed, but he, in his deeper wisdom, went further, and bade men to consider well what kind of vows they made.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">for he hath no pleasure in fools</span>] The construction of the sentence in the Hebrew is ambiguous, and may give either (1) that suggested by the interpolated words in the A. V., or (2) “<span class="bld">there is no pleasure in fools</span>,” <span class="ital">i.e.</span> <span class="bld">they please neither God nor man</span>, or (3) “<span class="bld">there is no fixed purpose in fools</span>,” <span class="ital">i.e.</span> they are unstable in their vows as in everything else. Of these interpretations (2) has most to commend it. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-25.htm" title="It is a snare to the man who devours that which is holy, and after vows to make enquiry.">Proverbs 20:25</a>, “It is a snare … after vows to make inquiry,” we have a striking parallel.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - Koheleth passes on to give a warning concerning the making of vows, which formed a great feature in Hebrew religion, and was the occasion of much irreverence and profanity. <span class="cmt_word">When thou vowest a vow unto God, defer not to pay it</span>. There is here plainly a reminiscence of <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-21.htm">Deuteronomy 23:21-23</a>. Vows are not regarded as absolute duties which every one was obliged to undertake. They are of a voluntary nature, but when made are to be strictly performed. They might consist of a promise to dedicate certain things or persons to God (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/38-20.htm">Genesis 38:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-30.htm">Judges 11:30</a>), or to abstain from doing certain things, as in the case of the Nazarites. The rabbinical injunction quoted by our Lord in the sermon on the mount (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-33.htm">Matthew 5:33</a>), "Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths," was probably levelled against profane swearing, or invoking God's Name lightly, but it may include the duty of performing vows made to or in the Name of God. Our Lord does not condemn the practice of <span class="accented">corban</span>, while noticing with rebuke a perversion of the custom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/7-11.htm">Mark 7:11</a>). For he hath no pleasure in fools. The non-fulfillment of a vow would prove a man to be impious, in proverbial language "a fool," and as such God must regard him with displeasure. The clause in the Hebrew is somewhat ambiguous, being literally, <span class="accented">There is no pleasure</span> (<span class="accented">chephets</span>) <span class="accented">in fools</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. no one, neither God nor man, would take pleasure in fools who make promises and never perform them. Or it may be, There <span class="accented">is no fixed will in fools</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. they waver and are undecided in purpose. But this rendering of <span class="accented">chephets</span> appears to be very doubtful. Septuagint <span class="greek">&#x1f4d;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span> which reproduces the vagueness of the Hebrew; Vulgate, <span class="accented">Displicet enim ei</span> (<span class="accented">Deo</span>) <span class="accented">infidelis et stulta promissio</span>. The meaning is well represented in the Authorized Version, and we must complete the sense by supplying in thought "on the part of God." <span class="cmt_word">Pay that which thou but vowed</span>. Ben-Sirs re-echoes the injunction (Ecclus. 18:22, 23), "Let nothing hinder thee to pay thy vow (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span>) in due time, and defer not until death to be justified [i.e. to fulfill the vow]. Before making a vow (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f54;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) prepare thyself; and be not as one that tempteth the Lord." The verse is cited in the Talmud; and Dukes gives a parallel, "Before thou vowest anything, consider the object of thy vow" ('Rabb. Blumenl.,' p. 70). So in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-25.htm">Proverbs 20:25</a> we have, according to some translations, "It is a snare to a man rashly to say, It is holy, and after vows to make inquiry." Septuagint," Pay thou therefore whatsoever thou shalt have vowed (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f54;&#x3be;&#x3b7;</span>), <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ecclesiastes/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"For out of the prison-house he goeth forth to reign as king, although he was born as a poor man in his kingdom." With &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; the properties of poverty and wisdom attributed to the young man are verified, - wisdom in this, that he knew how to find the way from a prison to a throne. As harammim, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/22-5.htm">2 Chronicles 22:5</a>  equals  haarammim, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-28.htm">2 Kings 8:28</a>, so hasurim  equals  haasurim (cf. masoreth  equals  maasoreth, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-37.htm">Ezekiel 20:37</a>); beth haasirim (Ker&#305;&#770;; haasurim), <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/16-21.htm">Judges 16:21</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/16-25.htm">Judges 16:25</a>, and beth haesur, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-15.htm">Jeremiah 38:15</a>, designate the prison; cf. Mod katan, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:1</a>. The modern form of the language prefers this elision of the &#1488;, e.g., &#1488;&#1508;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;  equals  &#1488;&#1507; &#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;, &#1488;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1512;  equals  &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1488;&#1514;&#1512;, &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1512; post  equals  &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1514;&#1512; contra, etc. The perf. &#1497;&#1495;&#1488; is also thought of as having reached the throne, and having pre-eminence assigned to him as such. He has come forth from the prison to become king, &#1512;&#1513;&#1473; ... &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;. Zckler translates: "Whereas also he that was born in his kingdom was poor," and adds the remark: "&#1490;&#1501; &#1499;&#1497;, after the &#1499;&#1497; of the preceding clause, does not so much introduce a verification of it, as much rather an intensification; by which is expressed, that the prisoner has not merely transitorily fallen into such misery, but that he was born in poor and lowly circumstances, and that in his own kingdom &#1489;&#1468;&#1501;, i.e., in the same land which he should afterwards rule as king." But &#1490;&#1501; &#1499;&#1497; is nowhere used by Koheleth in the sense of "ja auch" ( equals  whereas also); and also where it is thus to be translated, as at <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-18.htm">Jeremiah 14:18</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-11.htm">Jeremiah 23:11</a>, it is used in the sense of "denn auch" ( equals  for also), assigning proof. The fact is, that this group of particles, according as &#1499;&#1497; is thought of as demonst. or relat., means either "denn auch," <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-16.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-22.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:22</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-16.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:16</a>, or "wenn auch"  equals  &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;, as here and at <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:12</a>. In the latter case, it is related to &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1490;&#1468;&#1501; (sometimes also merely &#1490;&#1468;&#1501;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/95-9.htm">Psalm 95:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-15.htm">Malachi 3:15</a>), as &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3bd; (&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;) &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;, although, notwithstanding, is to &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd; (&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;), even although.<p>(Note: That the accentuation separates the two words &#1490;&#1501;&#1470; &#1499;&#1497; is to be judged from this, that it almost everywhere prefers &#1488;&#1501;&#1470; &#1499;&#1497; (vid., under Comm. to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/1-2.htm">Psalm 1:2</a>).)<p>Thus 14b, connecting itself with &#1500;&#1502;&#1500;&#1498;, is to be translated: "although he was born (&#1504;&#1493;&#1500;&#1491;,not &#1504;&#1493;&#1500;&#1491;) in his kingdom as a poor man." <p>(Note: &#1504;&#1493;&#1500;&#1491; &#1512;&#1513; cannot mean "to become poor." Grtz appeals to the Mishnic language; but no intelligent linguist will use &#1504;&#1493;&#1500;&#1491; &#1512;&#1513;&#1473; of a man in any other sense than that he is originally poor.)<p>We cannot also concur with Zckler in the view that the suff. of :_b refers to the young upstart: in the kingdom which should afterwards become his; for this reason, that the suff. of &#1514;&#1495;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-16.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:16</a>, refers to the old king, and thus also that this designation may be mediated, &#1489;&#1501; must refer to him. &#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1493;&#1514; signifies kingdom, reign, realm; here, the realm, as at <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-35.htm">Nehemiah 9:35</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/5-11.htm">Daniel 5:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/6-29.htm">Daniel 6:29</a>. Grtz thinks <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:13-16</a> ought to drive expositors to despair. But hitherto we have found no room for despair in obtaining a meaning from them. What follows also does not perplex us. The author describes how all the world hails the entrance of the new youthful king on his government, and gathers together under his sceptre. </body></html>
