In private conversation care should be taken that no rash and unadvised words be spoken in haste, as were by Moses and David; and that no evil, nor even any idle word he uttered, since from, the abundance of the heart the mouth is apt to speak, and all is before, the Lord; not a word in the tongue but is altogether known by him, and must be accounted for to him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-33.htm">Psalm 106:33</a>. Jerom interprets this of words spoken concerning God; and careful men should be of what they say of him, of his nature and perfections, of his persons, and of his works; and it may be applied to a public profession of his name, and of faith in him; though this should be done with the heart, yet the heart and tongue should not be rash and hasty in making it; men should consider what they profess and confess, and upon what foot they take up and make a profession of religion; whether they have the true grace of God or no: and it will hold true of the public ministry of the word, in which everything that comes uppermost in the mind, or what is crude and undigested, should not be, uttered; but what ministers have thought of, meditated on, well weighed in their minds, and properly digested. Some understand this of rash vows, such as Jephthah's, is supposed to be, which are later repented of; but rather speaking unto God in prayer is intended. So the Targum, <p>"thy, heart shall not hasten to bring out speech at the time thou prayest before the Lord;'' <p>anything and everything that comes up into the mind should not be, uttered before God; not anything rashly and hastily; men should consider before they speak to the King of kings; for though set precomposed forms of prayer are not to be used, yet the matter of prayer should be thought of beforehand; what our wants are, and what we should ask for; whether for ourselves or others; this rule I fear we often offend against: the reasons follow; <p>for God is in heaven, and thou upon earth; his throne is in the heavens, he dwells in the highest heavens, though they cannot contain him; this is expressive of his majesty, sovereignty, and supremacy, and of his omniscience and omnipotence; he is the high and lofty One, that dwells in the high and holy place; he is above all, and sees and knows all persons and things; and he sits in the heavens, and does whatever he pleases; and therefore all should stand in awe of him, and consider what they say unto him. Our Lord seems to have respect to this passage when he directed his disciples to pray, saying, "Our Father, which art in heaven", <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-9.htm">Matthew 6:9</a>; and when we pray to him we should think what we ourselves are, that we are on the earth, the footstool of God; that we are of the earth, earthly; dwell in houses of clay, which have their foundation in the dust; crawling worms on earth, unworthy of his notice; are but dust and ashes, who take upon us to speak unto him; <p>therefore let, by words be few; of which prayer consists; such was the prayer of the publican, "God, be merciful to me, a sinner", <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-13.htm">Luke 18:13</a>; and such the prayer which Christ has given as a pattern and directory to his people; who has forbid vain repetitions and much speaking in prayer, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-7.htm">Matthew 6:7</a>; not that all lengthy prayers are to be condemned, or all repetitions in them; our Lord was all night in prayer himself; and Nehemiah, Daniel, and others, have used repetitions in prayer, which may be done with fresh affection, zeal, and fervency; but such are forbidden as are done for the sake of being heard for much speaking, as the Heathens; and who thought they were not understood unless they said a thing a hundred times over (p); or when done to gain a character of being more holy and religious than others, as the Pharisees. <p>(p) "Ohe jam desine deos obtundere----Ut nihil credas intelligere, nisi idem dictum eat centies."

We are reminded of our Lord’s warning against “vain repetitions,” after the manner of the heathen (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-7.htm" title="But when you pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.">Matthew 6:7</a>). The second clause, though parallel to the first, carries the thought further. The “heart” or mind of the worshipper also is to be calm and deliberate. We are not to turn every hasty wish into a prayer, but to ask ourselves whether it is one of the things for which we ought to pray. Here also the precept has its analogies in the counsels of the wise of heart outside the covenant of Israel. See especially Juven. <span class="ital">Sat</span>. x.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">therefore let thy words be few</span>] The Son of Sirach gives the same rule for our speech when in the presence of the “great men” of earth (<a href="http://apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/32-9.htm" title="If thou be among great men, make not thyself equal with them; and when ancient men are in place, use not many words.">Sir 32:9</a>), and <span class="ital">à fortiori</span> the reverence due to God should shew itself in the same form as our reverence for them. In a Talmudic precept we find the rule in nearly the same words, “the words of a man should always be few in the presence of God” (<span class="ital">Berachoth</span>, 61 <span class="ital">a</span>, quoted by Ginsburg). Comp. also Hooker <span class="ital">E. P.</span> 1. 2. § 3.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - Koheleth warns against thoughtless words or hasty professions in prayer, which formed another feature of popular religion. <span class="cmt_word">Be not rash with thy mouth.</span> The warning is against hasty and thoughtless words in prayer, words that go from the lips with glib facility, but come not from the heart. Thus our Lord bids those who pray not to use vain repetitions (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>), as the heathen, who think to be heard for their much speaking (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-7.htm">Matthew 6:7</a>). Jesus himself used the same words in his prayer in the garden, and he continually urges the lesson of much and constant prayer - a lessen enforced by apostolic admonitions (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-5.htm">Luke 11:5</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-6.htm">Philippians 4:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-17.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:17</a>); but it is quite possible to use the same words, and yet throw the whole heart into them each time that they are repeated. Whether the repetition is vain or not depends upon the spirit of the person who prays. <span class="cmt_word">Let not thine heart be hasty to utter any thing before God.</span> We should weigh well our wishes, arrange them discreetly, ponder whether they are such as we can rightly make subjects of petition, ere we lay them in words before the Lord. "Before God" may mean in the temple, the house of God, where he is specially present, as Solomon himself testified (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-27.htm">1 Kings 8:27, 30, 43</a>). <span class="cmt_word">God is in heaven</span>. The infinite distance between God and man, illustrated by the contrast of earth and the illimitable heaven, is the ground of the admonition to reverence and thoughtfulness (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/115-3.htm">Psalm 115:3, 16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/4.htm">Isaiah 4</a>:8, 9; 66:1). Therefore let thy words be few, as becomes one who speaks in the awful presence of God. Ben-Sirs seems to have had this passage in mind when he writes (Ecclus. 7:14), "Prate not in a multitude of elders, and repeat not (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>) the word in prayer." We may remember the conduct of the priests of Baal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-26.htm">1 Kings 18:26</a>). Ginsburg and Wright quote the Talmudic precept ('Beraehoth,' 68. a), "Let the words of a man always be few in the presence of God, according as it is written," and then follows the passage in our text. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ecclesiastes/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"And if one shall violently assail him who is alone, two shall withstand him; and (finally) a threefold cord is not quickly broken asunder." The form yithqepho for yithqephehu, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/15-24.htm">Job 15:24</a>, is like hirdepho, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/8-3.htm">Hosea 8:3</a>  equals  hirdephehu, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-40.htm">Judges 9:40</a>. If we take &#1514;&#1511;&#1507; in the sense of to overpower, then the meaning is: If one can overpower him who is alone, then, on the contrary, two can maintain their ground against him (Herzf.); but the two &#1488;&#1501;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:10</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:11</a>, which are equivalent to &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;, exclude such a pure logical &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;. And why should &#1514;&#1511;&#1507;, if it can mean overpowering, not also mean doing violence to by means of a sudden attack? In the Mishnic and Arab. it signifies to seize, to lay hold of; in the Aram. &#1488;&#1514;&#1511;&#1507;  equals  &#1492;&#1495;&#1494;&#1497;&#1511;, and also at <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-20.htm">Job 14:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-24.htm">Job 15:24</a> (vid., Comm.), it may be understood of a violent assault, as well as of a completed subjugation; as &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488; means to lift up and carry; &#1506;&#1502;&#1491;, to tread and to stand. But whether it be understood inchoat. or not, in any case &#1492;&#1488;&#1495;&#1491; is not the assailant, who is much rather the unnamed subj. in &#1497;&#1514;&#1511;&#1508;&#1497;, but the one (the solitarius) who, if he is alone, must succumb; the construction of hithqepho haehhad follows the scheme of <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/2-6.htm">Exodus 2:6</a>, "she saw it, the child." To the assault expressed by &#1514;&#1511;&#1507;, there stands opposed the expression &#1504;&#1490;&#1491; &#1506;&#1502;&#1491;, which means to withstand any one with success; as &#1506;&#1502;&#1491; &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-4.htm">2 Kings 10:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/147-17.htm">Psalm 147:17</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/8-7.htm">Daniel 8:7</a>, means to maintain one's ground. Of three who hold together, 12a says nothing; the advance from two to three is thus made in the manner of a numerical proverb (vid., Proverbs, vol. <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_peter/13.htm">1 Peter 13</a>). If two hold together, that is seen to be good; but if there be three, this threefold bond is likened to a cord formed of three threads, which cannot easily be broken. Instead of the definite specific art. &#1492;&#1495; &#1492;&#1501;, we make use of the indefinite. Funiculus triplex difficile rumpitur is one of the winged expressions used by Koheleth. </body></html>
