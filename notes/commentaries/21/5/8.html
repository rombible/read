(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/48-5.htm" title="They saw it, and so they marveled; they were troubled, and hurried away.">Psalm 48:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/26-11.htm" title="The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his reproof.">Job 26:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-8.htm" title="And they shall be afraid: pangs and sorrows shall take hold of them; they shall be in pain as a woman that travails: they shall be amazed one at another; their faces shall be as flames.">Isaiah 13:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-9.htm" title="And it shall come to pass at that day, said the LORD, that the heart of the king shall perish, and the heart of the princes; and the priests shall be astonished, and the prophets shall wonder.">Jeremiah 4:9</a>.) The verse then supplies the answer to the gloomy view of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-4.htm" title="Again, I considered all travail, and every right work, that for this a man is envied of his neighbor. This is also vanity and vexation of spirit.">Ecclesiastes 4:4</a>. In the view that the last clause speaks of the Divine rectification of earthly injustice, I am confirmed by observing that the author of this book delights in verbal assonances, and constantly links together words similar in sound. An English version might admit the meaning: “Over the high oppressor stands a higher, and over both, those who are higher still; “though even here there is the difficulty that the highest of all are spoken of in the plural number, of which it is a very awkward explanation that the “higher” is the king, and that the women and favourites who govern him are the “higher still.” But I cannot but think that the language of the Hebrew, that over the <span class= "ital">“gebōh” </span>there be “<span class= "ital">gebōhim,” </span>is intended to suggest <span class= "ital">Elohim </span>to the reader’s mind.<p>On the word “province,” see Note, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-8.htm" title="I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces: I got me men singers and women singers, and the delights of the sons of men, as musical instruments, and that of all sorts.">Ecclesiastes 2:8</a>; and on “matter,” <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-1.htm" title="To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven:">Ecclesiastes 3:1</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/ecclesiastes/5.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/5-8.htm" title="If you see the oppression of the poor, and violent perverting of judgment and justice in a province, marvel not at the matter: for he that is higher than the highest regards; and there be higher than they.">Ecclesiastes 5:8</a></span>. <span class="ital">If thou seest the oppression: </span>&c. — Here is an account of another vanity, and a sovereign antidote against it. <span class="ital">Marvel not </span>— As if it were inconsistent with God’s wisdom and justice to suffer such disorders. <span class="ital">For he that is higher than the highest — </span>The most high God, who is infinitely above the greatest of men. <span class="ital">Regardeth </span>— Not like an idle spectator, but a judge, who diligently observes, and will effectually punish them. <span class="ital">And there</span> <span class="ital">be higher than they </span>— Namely, God; it is an emphatical repetition of the same thing.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:4-8 When a person made engagements rashly, he suffered his mouth to cause his flesh to sin.

Such mockery of God would bring the Divine displeasure, which might blast what was thus unduly kept. We are to keep down the fear of man. Set God before thee; then, if thou seest the oppression of the poor, thou wilt not find fault with Divine Providence; nor think the worse of the institution of magistracy, when thou seest the ends of it thus perverted; nor of religion, when thou seest it will not secure men from suffering wrong.

Which is a very disagreeable sight, but often seen; the poor are oppressed, and judgment and justice perverted, and that in a very violent and flagrant manner, in open courts of judicature, in the several provinces and kingdoms of the world; <p>marvel not at the matter; as though it was some strange and uncommon thing, when nothing is more common: or "marvel not at the will" or "pleasure" (t); that is, of God, who suffers such things to be. So the Targum, Jarchi, and Aben Ezra, interpret it; stumble not at it, nor arraign the wisdom and justice of God; let not that temptation prevail in thee as it has done in some good men, who have been tempted from hence to think there was nothing in religion, nor no providence attending the affairs of this world; do not be frightened and astonished, and hurried into such a thought; nor be distressed at the calamities and oppressions of poor and innocent men; <p>for he that is higher than the highest regardeth: that is, God, who is the most high in all the earth; higher, than the kings of the earth, and all high and haughty oppressors; higher indeed than the heavens, and the angels there: he "regards" all his people, his eyes are on them, and he never withdraws them from them; he regards their cries, and hears and answers them; he regards their oppressors, and their oppressions; and will, in his own time, deliver them; or he "keeps" (u) his people as the apple of his eye, in the hollow of his hand, night and day, lest any hurt them; he keeps them by his power through faith unto salvation. It may be rendered, "the high One from on high observes" (w); God, who is the high and lofty One, looks down from the high heavens where he dwells, and takes notice of all the sons of men, and considers all their works; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-13.htm">Psalm 33:13</a>; <p>and there be higher than they; either the holy angels, who are higher than tyrannical oppressors, higher in nature, and excel in strength and power; and these are on the side of the oppressed, have the charge of saints, and encamp about them; and, whenever they have an order, can destroy their enemies in a moment: or rather the three divine Persons are meant, by the plural expression used, Father, Son, and Spirit; Jehovah the Father is above men, the greatest of men, in the things in which they deal proudly; be is greater than all, and none can pluck his sheep out of his hands, and worry them: Christ, the Son of the Highest, is higher than the kings, of the earth; he is King of kings, and Lord of lords, and able to deliver and save his people; and the Holy Spirit is the power of the Highest, and is greater than he or they that are in the world, the avowed enemies of the saints. Aben Ezra interprets it of the secret of the name of God, which he says is inexplicable. So the Midrash understands it of the holy blessed God; and in another tract it is said, on mention of this passage, there are three superiors above them in the way of emanation, and of them it is said (x), "there be higher than they." <p>(t)  "super voluntate", Montanus, Cocceius; "de divina volantate", Pagninus, Mercerus; "divinam voluntatem", Tigurine version; "de ista voluntate", Junius &amp; Tremellius, Gejerus.

As in ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-16.htm" title="There is no end of all the people, even of all that have been before them: they also that come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity and vexation of spirit.">Ecclesiastes 4:16</a>, the thinker looks on those disorders of the world, “the poor man’s wrong, the proud man’s contumely,” and teaches others how he has learnt to think of them. The words “wonder not” tells us with scarcely the shadow of a doubt who had been his teachers. In that counsel we have a distinct echo from one of the floating maxims of Greek proverbial wisdom, from the <span class="greekheb">Μηδὲν θαυμάζειν</span> (“wonder at nothing”) of Pythagoras, and Cebes (<span class="ital">Tabula</span>, p. 232), which has become more widely known through the <span class="ital">Nil admirari</span> of Horace (<span class="ital">Epist</span>. i. 6. 1). Why men were not to wonder at the prevalence of oppression is explained afterwards. The word for “province” may be noted as one distinctly belonging to later Hebrew, found chiefly in the books of the Persian period, Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther and Daniel; once only in those of earlier date, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_kings/20-14.htm" title="And Ahab said, By whom? And he said, Thus said the LORD, Even by the young men of the princes of the provinces. Then he said, Who shall order the battle? And he answered, You....">1 Kings 20:14-17</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">for he that is higher than the highest</span>] The first impression made by the verse is that the <span class="bld">Debater</span> tells men not to wonder or be dismayed at the prevalence of wrong, on the ground that God is higher than the highest of the tyrants of the earth and will in the end punish their wrong-doing. So understood, the first and the last “higher” both refer to “God,” or, as some take it, the last only, the first referring to the king as distinct from satraps or other officers, and the train of thought is supposed to be “Wonder not with the wonder of despair, at the seeming triumph of evil. The Supreme Judge (ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-17.htm" title="I said in my heart, God shall judge the righteous and the wicked: for there is a time there for every purpose and for every work.">Ecclesiastes 3:17</a>) will one day set all things right.” The last “higher” is however plural in the Hebrew, and if it be understood of God, it must be by a somewhat unusual construction connecting it with the plural form (<span class="ital">Elohim</span>) of the name of God. We have, it may be noted, another example of a like construction in the use of the plural form for Creator in ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-1.htm" title="Remember now your Creator in the days of your youth, while the evil days come not, nor the years draw near, when you shall say, I have no pleasure in them;">Ecclesiastes 12:1</a>, and for “the Holy” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-10.htm" title="The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge of the holy is understanding.">Proverbs 9:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-3.htm" title="I neither learned wisdom, nor have the knowledge of the holy.">Proverbs 30:3</a>. Over and above the grammatical difficulties, however (which, as has been shewn, are not insuperable), it may be said that this thought is hardly in keeping with the tone of the <span class="bld">Debater’s</span> mind at this stage of his progress. Belief in the righteous government of God can hardly remove, though it may perhaps silence, the wonder which men feel at the prevalence of evil. It seems better accordingly to fall back upon another interpretation. The observer looks upon the state of the Persian or Syrian or Egyptian Monarchy and sees a system of Satraps and Governors which works like that of the Pachas in modern Asiatic Turkey. There is one <span class="bld">higher than the high one</span>, the king who is despotic over the satraps: there are others (the court favourites, king’s friends, eunuchs, chamberlains) who are higher or, at least, of more power, than both together, each jealously watching the others, and bent on self-aggrandisement. Who can wonder that the result should be injustice and oppression? The system of government was rotten from the highest to the lowest, suspicion and distrust pervading its whole administration. Comp. Aristotle’s description of Asiatic monarchies as suppressing all public spirit and mutual confidence (<span class="ital">Pol</span>. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/5-11.htm" title="When goods increase, they are increased that eat them: and what good is there to the owners thereof, saving the beholding of them with their eyes?">Ecclesiastes 5:11</a>). It may be suggested, lastly, that the enigmatic form of the maxim may have been deliberately chosen, so that men might read either the higher or the lower interpretation into it, according to their capacities. It was a “word to the wise” after the measure of their wisdom. The grave irony of such an ambiguous utterance was quite after the Teacher’s method. See notes on ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ecclesiastes/11-1.htm" title="Cast your bread on the waters: for you shall find it after many days....">Ecclesiastes 11:1-2</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8-17.</span> - Section 7. <span class="accented">Perils to which one is exposed in a despotic state</span>, <span class="accented">and the unprofitableness of riches</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8, 9.</span> - In political life there is little that is satisfactory; yet one must not surrender one's belief in a superintending Providence. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If</span> <span class="cmt_word">thou seest the oppression of the poor</span>. From errors in the service of God, it is natural to turn to faults in the administration of the king (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-21.htm">Proverbs 24:21</a>). Koheleth has already alluded to these anomalies in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-16.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:16</a> and Ecclesiastes 4:1. <span class="cmt_word">Violent perverting</span>; literally, <span class="accented">robbery</span>; <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>so that judgment</span> is never rightly given, <span class="cmt_word">and justice</span> is withheld from applicants.

Be not surprised or dismayed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/26-11.htm">Job 26:11</a>) at such evil doings,, as though they were unheard of, or inexperienced, or disregarded. There is here nothing of the Greek maxim, reproduced by Horace in his "Nil admirari" ('Epist.,' 1:6. 1). It is like St. John's "Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-13.htm">1 John 3:13</a>); or St. Peter's "Think it not strange concerning the fiery trial among' you" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-12.htm">1 Peter 4:12</a>). The stupid and unintelligent observation of such disorders might lead to arraignment of Providence and distrust in the moral government of God. Against such mistakes the writer guards. <span class="cmt_word">For he that is higher than the highest regardeth.</span> Both the words are in the singular number. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f59;&#x3c8;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c8;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. One thinks of the Persian satraps, who acted much as the Turkish pashas in later times, the petty rulers oppressing the people, and being themselves treated in the same fashion by their superiors. The whole is a system of wrong-doing, where the weaker always suffers, and the only comfort is that the oppressor himself is subject to higher supervision. The verb (<span class="accented">shamar</span>) translated "regardeth" means to observe in a hostile sense, to watch for occasions of reprisal, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-11.htm">1 Samuel 19:11</a>; and the idea intended is that in the province there were endless plottings and counterplottings, mutual denunciations and recriminations; that such things were only to be expected, and were no sufficient cause for infidelity or despair. "The higher one" is the monarch, the despotic king who holds the supreme power over all these malad-ministrators and perverters of justice. <span class="cmt_word">And there be higher than they</span>. "Higher" is here plural (<span class="accented">gebohgm</span>), the plural of majesty, as it is called (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:1</a>), like <span class="accented">Elohim</span>, the word for "God," the assonance being probably here suggestive. Over the highest of earthly rulers there are other powers, angels, principalities, up to God himself, who governs the course of this world, and to whom we may leave the final adjustment. Who are meant seems purposely to be left undetermined; but the thought of the righteous Judge of all is intimated in accordance with the view of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:17</a>. This is a far more satisfactory explanation of the passage than that which regards as the highest of all "the court favorites, king's friends, eunuchs, chamberlains," etc. In this view Koheleth is merely asserting the general system of injustice and oppression, and neither accounting for it nor offering any comfort under the circumstances. But his object throughout is to show man's inability to secure his own happiness, and the need of submission to Divine providence. To demonstrate the anomalies in the events of the world, the circumstances of men's lives would be only one part of his task, which would not be completed without turning attention to the remedy against hasty and unfair conclusions. This remedy is the thought of the supreme Disposer of events, who holds all the strings in his hand, and will in the end bring good out of evil. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ecclesiastes/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"Be not hasty with thy mouth, and let not thy heart hasten to speak a word before God: for God is in heaven, and thou art upon earth; therefore let thy words be few. For by much business cometh dreaming, and by much talk the noise of fools." As we say in German: auf Flgeln fliegen [to flee on wings], auf Einem Auge nicht sehen [not to see with one eye], auf der Flte blasen [to blow on the flute], so in Heb. we say that one slandereth with (auf) his tongue (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/15-3.htm">Psalm 15:3</a>), or, as here, that he hasteth with his mouth, i.e., is forward with his mouth, inasmuch as the word goes before the thought. It is the same usage as when the post-bibl. Heb., in contradistinction to &#1492;&#1514;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492; &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1514;&#1489;, the law given in the Scripture, calls the oral law &#1492;&#1514; &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1492;, i.e., the law mediated &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1508;&#1492;, oraliter  equals  oralis traditio (Shabbath 31a; cf. Gittin 60b). The instrument and means is here regarded as the substratum of the action - as that which this lays as a foundation. The phrase: "to take on the lips," <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/16-4.htm">Psalm 16:4</a>, which needs no explanation, is different. Regarding &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1500;, festinare, which is, like &#1502;&#1492;&#1512;, the intens. of Kal, vid., once it occurs quite like our "sich beeilen" to hasten, with reflex. accus. suff., <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-21.htm">2 Chronicles 35:21</a>. Man, when he prays, should not give the reins to his tongue, and multiply words as one begins and repeats over a form which he has learnt, knowing certainly that it is God of whom and to whom he speaks, but without being conscious that God is an infinitely exalted Being, to whom one may not carelessly approach without collecting his thoughts, and irreverently, without lifting up his soul. As the heavens, God's throne, are exalted above the earth, the dwelling-place of man, so exalted is the heavenly God above earthly man, standing far beneath him; therefore ought the words of a man before God to be few, - few, well-chosen reverential words, in which one expresses his whole soul. The older language forms no plur. from the subst. &#1502;&#1506;&#1496; (fewness) used as an adv.; but the more recent treats it as an adj., and forms from it the plur. &#1502;&#1506;&#1496;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; (here and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/109-8.htm">Psalm 109:8</a>, which bears the superscription le-david, but has the marks of Jeremiah's style); the post-bibl. places in the room of the apparent adj. the particip. adj. &#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1496; with the plur. &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1496;&#1497;&#1501; (&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1496;&#1497;&#1503;), e.g., Berachoth 61a: "always let the words of a man before the Holy One (blessed be His name!) be few" (&#1502;&#1493;&#1506;). Few ought the words to be; for where they are many, it is not without folly. This is what is to be understood, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/5-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:2</a>, by the comparison; the two parts of the verse stand here in closer mutual relation than <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:1</a>, - the proverb is not merely synthetical, but, like <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/5-7.htm">Job 5:7</a>, parabolical. The &#1489; is both times that of the cause. The dream happens, or, as we say, dreams happen &#1506;&#1504;&#1497;&#1503; &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1489;; not: by much labour; for labour in itself, as the expenditure of strength making one weary, has as its consequence, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/5-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:11</a>, sweet sleep undisturbed by dreams; but: by much self-vexation in a man's striving after high and remote ends beyond what is possible (Targ., in manifold project-making); the care of such a man transplants itself from the waking to the sleeping life, it if does not wholly deprive him of sleep, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/5-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:11</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-16.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:16</a>, - all kinds of images of the labours of the day, and fleeting phantoms and terrifying pictures hover before his mind. And as dreams of such a nature appear when a man wearies himself inwardly as well as outwardly by the labours of the day, so, with the same inward necessity, where many words are spoken folly makes its appearance. Hitzig renders &#1499;&#1505;&#1497;&#1500;, in the connection &#1511;&#1493;&#1500; &#1499;&#1468;, as adj.; but, like &#1488;&#1493;&#1497;&#1500; (which forms an adj. e&#780;vi&#772;li&#772;), &#1499;&#1505;&#1497;&#1500; is always a subst., or, more correctly, it is a name occurring always only of a living being, never of a thing. There is sound without any solid content, mere blustering bawling without sense and intelligence. The talking of a fool is in itself of this kind (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:14</a>); but if one who is not just a fool falls into much talk, it is scarcely possible but that in this flow of words empty bombast should appear.<p>Another rule regarding the worship of God refers to vowing. </body></html>
