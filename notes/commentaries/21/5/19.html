We must not view our calling as a drudgery, but take pleasure in the calling where God puts us. A cheerful spirit is a great blessing; it makes employments easy, and afflictions light. Having made a proper use of riches, a man will remember the days of his past life with pleasure. The manner in which Solomon refers to God as the Giver, both of life and its enjoyments, shows they ought to be received and to be used, consistently with his will, and to his glory. Let this passage recommend to all the kind words of the merciful Redeemer, Labour not for the meat that perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life. Christ is the Bread of life, the only food of the soul.

Ginsburg connects the verse closely with the preceding one, supplying, "I have also seen that a man," etc. Whichever way we take the sentence, it comes to the same tiling, implying man's absolute dependence upon God's bounty. <span class="cmt_word">To whom God hath given riches and wealth</span>. Before he can enjoy his possessions a man must first receive them from God's hands. The two terms here used are not quite synonymous. While the former word, <span class="accented">osher</span>; is used for wealth of any kind whatever, the latter, <span class="accented">nekasim</span>, means properly "wealth in cattle," like the Latin <span class="accented">pecunia</span>, and thence used generally for riches (<span class="accented">volek</span>). <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Hath given him power to eat thereof.</span> Abundance is useless without the power to enjoy it. <span class="cmt_word">This is the gift of God</span>, a great and special bounty from a loving and gracious God.

There is a gradation of evils. &#1495;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492; &#1512;&#1506;&#1492; (cf. &#1512;&#1506; &#1495;&#1500;&#1497; &#1512;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/6-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:2</a>) is not an ordinary, but a morbid evil, i.e., a deep hurtful evil; as a wound, not a common one, but one particularly severe and scarcely curable, is called &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1492;, e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/3-19.htm">Nahum 3:19</a>. &#1492;&#1513;&#1473; ... &#1512;&#1488; is, as at <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:5</a>, an ellipt. relat. clause; cf. on the other hand, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/6-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:1</a>; the author elsewhere uses the scheme of the relat. clause without relat. pron. (vid., under <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-16.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:16</a>); the old language would use &#1512;&#1488;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497;&#1492;, instead of &#1512;&#1488;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497;, with the reflex. pron. The great evil consists in this, that riches are not seldom kept by their owner to his own hurt. Certainly &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; &#1500; can also mean that which is kept for another, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-24.htm">1 Samuel 9:24</a>; but how involved and constrained is Ginsburg's explanation: "hoarded up (by the rich man) for their (future) owner," viz., the heir to whom he intends to leave them! That &#1500; can be used with the passive as a designation of the subj., vid., Ewald, 295c; certainly it corresponds as little as &#1502;&#1503;, with the Greek &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;, but in Greek we say also &#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#837;&#834; &#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#837;, vid., Rost's Syntax, 112. 4. The suff. of lera'atho refers to be'alav, the plur. form of which can so far remain out of view, that we even say adonim qosheh, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-4.htm">Isaiah 19:4</a>, etc. "To his hurt," i.e., at the last suddenly to lose that which has been carefully guarded. The narrative explanation of this, "to his hurt," begins with vav explic. Regarding 'inyan ra'. It is a casus adversus that is meant, such a stroke upon stroke as destroyed Job's possessions. The perf. &#1493;&#1492;&#1493; supposes the case that the man thus suddenly made poor is the father of a son; the clause is logically related to that which follows as hypothet. antecedent, after the scheme. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/33-13.htm">Genesis 33:13</a>. The loss of riches would of itself make one who is alone unhappy, for the misfortune to be poor is less than the misfortunes to be rich and then to become poor; but still more unfortunate is the father who thought that by well-guarded wealth he had secured the future of his son, and who now leaves him with an empty hand.<p>What now follows is true of this rich man, but is generalized into a reference to every rich man, and then is recorded as a second great evil. As a man comes naked into the world, so also he departs from it again without being able to take with him any of the earthly wealth he has acquired. </body></html>
