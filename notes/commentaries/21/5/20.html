We must not view our calling as a drudgery, but take pleasure in the calling where God puts us. A cheerful spirit is a great blessing; it makes employments easy, and afflictions light. Having made a proper use of riches, a man will remember the days of his past life with pleasure. The manner in which Solomon refers to God as the Giver, both of life and its enjoyments, shows they ought to be received and to be used, consistently with his will, and to his glory. Let this passage recommend to all the kind words of the merciful Redeemer, Labour not for the meat that perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life. Christ is the Bread of life, the only food of the soul.

Be they more or fewer, as Jarchi: he will not think life long and tedious; nor dwell upon, and distress himself with, the troubles he has met with, or is likely to meet with; but, being content with the good things God has given him, and freely and cheerfully enjoying them, he passes away his time delightfully and pleasantly. Some, as Aben Ezra observes, and which he approves of, and is agreeably to the accents, render the words, "if he has not much, he remembers the days of his life" (t); if he has but little of the good things of this life, he remembers how few his days are he has to live; and doubts not he shall have enough to carry him to the end of his days, and therefore is quite easy and content; he calls to mind how he has been supplied all his days hitherto, and is persuaded that that God, who has provided for him, will continue his goodness to him, and that he shall not want any good thing; and therefore does not distress himself with what is to come; <p>because God answereth him in the joy of his heart; he calls upon God for a blessing on his labours, asks of him his daily food, and desires what may be proper and sufficient for him, or what he judges is necessary and convenient; and God answers his prayers and petitions, and good wishes, by filling his heart with food and gladness; and giving him that cheerfulness of spirit, and thankfulness of heart, in the enjoyment of every blessing; and especially if along with it he lifts up the light of his countenance, and grants him joy in the Holy Ghost; he will go on so pleasantly and comfortably as to forget all his former troubles; and it will dissipate his doubts and fears about how he shall live for the future. <p>(t)    "quod si non multum recordabitur dierum vitae suae", Junius &amp; Tremellius. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/ecclesiastes/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For he shall not much remember the days of his <span class="cverse3">{p}</span> life; because God answereth <i>him</i> in the joy of his heart.</span><p>(p) He will take no great thought for the pains that he has endured in times past.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/ecclesiastes/5.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">20</span>. <span class="ital">he shall not much remember the days of his life</span>] This follows the order of the Hebrew and gives a satisfying meaning: The man who has learnt the secret of enjoyment is not anxious about the days of his life, does not brood even over its transitoriness, but takes each day tranquilly, as it comes, as God’s gift to him. By some commentators, however, the sentence is construed so as to give just the opposite sense, “<span class="ital">He remembereth</span> (or <span class="ital">should remember</span>) <span class="ital">that the days of his life are not many</span>,” <span class="ital">i.e.</span> never loses sight of the shortness of human life. It is difficult to see how the translators of the A. V. could have been led to their marginal reading “<span class="ital">Though he give not much, yet he remembereth the days of his life</span>.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">because God answereth him in the joy of his heart</span>] The verb has been very variously rendered, (1) “<span class="ital">God occupies him with the joy</span> …,” or (2) “<span class="ital">God makes him sing with the joy</span> …,” or (3) “<span class="ital">God causeth him to work for the enjoyment</span> …,” or (4) “<span class="ital">God makes all answer</span> (<span class="ital">i.e. correspond with</span>) <span class="ital">his wishes</span>,” or (5) “<span class="ital">God himself corresponds to his joy</span>,” <span class="ital">i.e.</span> is felt to approve it as harmonizing, in its calm evenness, with His own blessedness. The last is, perhaps, that which has most to commend it. So taken, the words find a parallel in the teaching of Epicurus, “The Blessed and the Immortal neither knows trouble of its own nor causeth it to others. Wherefore it is not influenced either by wrath or favour,” (Diog. Laert. x. 1. 139). The tranquillity of the wise man mirrors, the Teacher implies, the tranquillity of God. So Lucretius;<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“Omnis enim per se divum natura necessest,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Immortali ævo summâ cum pace fruatur,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Semota ab nostris rebus sejunctaque longe;<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Nam privata dolore omni, privata periclis,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Ipsa suis pollens opibus, nil indiga nostri,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Nec bene promeritis capitur neque tangitur ira.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“The nature of the Gods must need enjoy<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Life everlasting in supreme repose,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Far from our poor concerns and separate:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>For from all pain exempt, exempt from risks,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Rich in its own wealth, needing nought of ours,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>’Tis neither soothed by gifts nor stirred by wrath.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">De Rer.

The man who has learned the lesson of calm enjoyment does not much concern himself with the shortness, uncertainty, or possible trouble of life. He carries out the counsel of Christ, "<span class="accented">Be</span> not anxious for the morrow, for the morrow will be anxious for itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-34.htm">Matthew 6:34</a>). Ginsburg gives an entirely opposite rendering to the clause, "<span class="accented">He</span> should remember that the days of his life are not many;" <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the thought of the shortness of life should urge us to enjoy it while it lasts. But the Authorized Version is supported by the Septuagint and Vulgate and most modern commentators, and seems most appropriate to the context. The marginal rendering, "<span class="accented">Though</span> he give <span class="accented">not much</span>, yet <span class="accented">he remembereth</span>," etc., which Ginsburg calls a literary curiosity, must have been derived from the version of Junius, which gives, "Quod si non multum (<span class="accented">supple</span>, est illud quod dederit Deus, <span class="accented">ex versu praec</span>.)," etc. <span class="cmt_word">Because God answereth him in the joy of his heart</span>. The man passes a calm and contented life, because God shows that he is pleased with him by the tranquil joy shed over his heart. The verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b2;&#x5e0;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span> (the hiph. participle of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>) is variously rendered. The Septuagint gives, <span class="greek">&#x1f49;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1fb7;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x1fc3;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, "God distracts him in the mirth of his heart;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">Eo quod Deus occupet deliciis cot ejus</span>;  Ginsburg, "God causeth him to work for the enjoyment of his heart," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. God assigns him work that he may thence derive enjoyment; Koster," God makes him sing in the joy of his heart;" Delitzsch, Wright, and Plumptre, "God answers (corresponds with) the joy of his heart," which the latter explains to mean "is felt to approve it as harmonizing, in its calm evenness, with his own blessedness, the tranquility of the wise man mirroring the tranquility of God." But this modified Epicureanism is alien from the teaching of Koheleth. Rather the idea is that God answers him with, imparts to him, joy of heart, makes him sensible of his favorable regard by this inward feeling of satisfaction and content. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ecclesiastes/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"There is a sore evil which I have seen under the sun, riches kept by their possessor to his hurt: the same riches perish by an evil event; and he hath begotten a son, thus this one hath nothing in his hand." There is a gradation of evils. &#1495;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492; &#1512;&#1506;&#1492; (cf. &#1512;&#1506; &#1495;&#1500;&#1497; &#1512;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/6-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:2</a>) is not an ordinary, but a morbid evil, i.e., a deep hurtful evil; as a wound, not a common one, but one particularly severe and scarcely curable, is called &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1492;, e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/3-19.htm">Nahum 3:19</a>. &#1492;&#1513;&#1473; ... &#1512;&#1488; is, as at <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:5</a>, an ellipt. relat. clause; cf. on the other hand, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/6-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:1</a>; the author elsewhere uses the scheme of the relat. clause without relat. pron. (vid., under <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-16.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:16</a>); the old language would use &#1512;&#1488;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497;&#1492;, instead of &#1512;&#1488;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497;, with the reflex. pron. The great evil consists in this, that riches are not seldom kept by their owner to his own hurt. Certainly &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; &#1500; can also mean that which is kept for another, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-24.htm">1 Samuel 9:24</a>; but how involved and constrained is Ginsburg's explanation: "hoarded up (by the rich man) for their (future) owner," viz., the heir to whom he intends to leave them! That &#1500; can be used with the passive as a designation of the subj., vid., Ewald, 295c; certainly it corresponds as little as &#1502;&#1503;, with the Greek &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;, but in Greek we say also &#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#837;&#834; &#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#837;, vid., Rost's Syntax, 112. 4. The suff. of lera'atho refers to be'alav, the plur. form of which can so far remain out of view, that we even say adonim qosheh, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-4.htm">Isaiah 19:4</a>, etc. "To his hurt," i.e., at the last suddenly to lose that which has been carefully guarded. The narrative explanation of this, "to his hurt," begins with vav explic. Regarding 'inyan ra'. It is a casus adversus that is meant, such a stroke upon stroke as destroyed Job's possessions. The perf. &#1493;&#1492;&#1493; supposes the case that the man thus suddenly made poor is the father of a son; the clause is logically related to that which follows as hypothet. antecedent, after the scheme. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/33-13.htm">Genesis 33:13</a>. The loss of riches would of itself make one who is alone unhappy, for the misfortune to be poor is less than the misfortunes to be rich and then to become poor; but still more unfortunate is the father who thought that by well-guarded wealth he had secured the future of his son, and who now leaves him with an empty hand.<p>What now follows is true of this rich man, but is generalized into a reference to every rich man, and then is recorded as a second great evil. As a man comes naked into the world, so also he departs from it again without being able to take with him any of the earthly wealth he has acquired. </body></html>
