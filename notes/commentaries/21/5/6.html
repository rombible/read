But even in the passage of Malachi there is no trace that the word “angel” had then become an ordinary name for the priest, such as would be intelligible if used in that sense without explanation from the context. Neither, again, is there reason for supposing that the priest had power to dispense with vows alleged to have been rashly undertaken. The power given him (Leviticus 27) is of a different nature. I therefore adhere to the obvious sense, which suggests that the real vow is observed and recorded by a heavenly angel. It falls in with this view that the phrase is “<span class= "ital">before </span>the angel.” If an excuse pleaded to a priest was intended, we should have, “Say not thou <span class= "ital">to </span>the priest.”<p><span class= "bld">Error.</span>—The word is that which describes sins of <span class= "ital">ignorance </span>(Numbers 15). The tacit assumption in this verse, that God interposes to punish when His name is taken in vain, clearly expresses the writer’s real conviction, and shows that such a verse as <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/9-2.htm" title="All things come alike to all: there is one event to the righteous, and to the wicked; to the good and to the clean, and to the unclean; to him that sacrifices, and to him that sacrifices not: as is the good, so is the sinner; and he that swears, as he that fears an oath.">Ecclesiastes 9:2</a> is only the statement of a speculative difficulty.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/ecclesiastes/5.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/5-6.htm" title="Suffer not your mouth to cause your flesh to sin; neither say you before the angel, that it was an error: why should God be angry at your voice, and destroy the work of your hands?">Ecclesiastes 5:6</a>. </span><span class="ital">Suffer not thy mouth </span>— By any rash vow, or in any other way; <span class="ital">to cause thy flesh to sin — </span>That is, thyself: the word <span class="ital">flesh </span>being often put for the whole man; <span class="ital">neither say thou before the angel — </span>That is, as some interpret the expression, before the blessed angels, (the singular number being put for the plural,) who are present in the public assemblies, in which these vows were generally paid, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/66-13.htm" title="I will go into your house with burnt offerings: I will pay you my vows,">Psalm 66:13</a>,) where they observe men’s religious performances, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-10.htm" title="For this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the angels.">1 Corinthians 11:10</a>,) and, as they rejoice in the conversion of a sinner, so are displeased with the sins of men.

The case supposes a man coming to the priest, and pretending that his vow was made rashly, and that it would be wrong to fulfil it. Such mockery of God would bring the Divine displeasure, which might blast what was thus unduly kept. We are to keep down the fear of man. Set God before thee; then, if thou seest the oppression of the poor, thou wilt not find fault with Divine Providence; nor think the worse of the institution of magistracy, when thou seest the ends of it thus perverted; nor of religion, when thou seest it will not secure men from suffering wrong.

That is, himself, who is corrupt and depraved; either by making a rash vow, which it is not in his power to keep; or such is the corruption of his nature, and the weakness of the flesh, that he cannot keep it; or by making sinful excuses after he has made the vow, and so is guilty of lying, or false swearing, or other sins of the flesh. Jarchi by "flesh" understands his children, on whom his iniquity may be visited and punished; and the Targum interprets this punishment of the judgment or condemnation of hell; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-25.htm">Proverbs 20:25</a>; <p>neither say thou before the angel that it was an error; that it was done ignorantly and through mistake: that it was not intended, and that this was not the meaning of the vow; and therefore desires to be excused performing it, or to offer a sacrifice in lieu of it. Interpreters are divided about the angel before whom such an excuse should not be made. Some think angel is put for angels in general, in whose presence, and before whom, as witnesses, vows are made; and who were signified by the cherubim in the sanctuary, where they were to be performed, and who are present in the worshipping assemblies of saints, where these things are done, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-21.htm">1 Timothy 5:21</a>; others think the guardian angel is meant, which they suppose every man has; and others that Christ, the Angel of the covenant, is designed, who is in the midst of his people, sees and knows all that is done by them, and will not admit of their excuses; but it is most probable the priest is intended, called the angel, or messenger, of the Lord of hosts, <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/2-7.htm">Malachi 2:7</a>; to whom such who had made vows applied to be loosed from them, acknowledging their error in making them; or to offer sacrifice for their sin of ignorance, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-4.htm">Leviticus 5:4</a>; <p>wherefore should God be angry at thy voice; either in making a rash and sinful vow, or in excusing that which was made; <p>and destroy the work of thine hands? wrought with success, for which the vow was made; and so, instead of its succeeding, is destroyed, and comes to nothing. Vows made by the Jews were chiefly about their houses, or fields, or cattle; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/27-28.htm">Leviticus 27:28</a>; and so the destruction suggested may signify the curse that God would bring upon any of these, for excusing or not performing the vow made. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/ecclesiastes/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Allow not thy mouth to cause thy <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> flesh to sin; neither say thou before the <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> angel, that it <i>was</i> an error: why should God be angry at thy voice, and destroy the work of thy hands?</span><p>(d) Do not cause yourself to sin by vowing rashly as they do who make a vow to live unmarried and such like.<p>(e) That is, before God's messenger when he will examine your doing, as though your ignorance should be a just excuse.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/ecclesiastes/5.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">6</span>. <span class="ital">Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin</span>] The “mouth” may refer either to the thoughtless utterance of the rash vow, such as that of Jephthah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-30.htm" title="And Jephthah vowed a vow to the LORD, and said, If you shall without fail deliver the children of Ammon into my hands,">Jdg 11:30</a>) or Saul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-24.htm" title="And the men of Israel were distressed that day: for Saul had adjured the people, saying, Cursed be the man that eats any food until evening, that I may be avenged on my enemies. So none of the people tasted any food.">1 Samuel 14:24</a>), or to the appetite which leads the man who has made a vow, say of the Nazarite type, to indulge in the drink or food which he had bound himself to renounce. The former meaning seems more in harmony with the context. The latter clause is translated by many Commentators <span class="ital">to bring punishment</span> (the expiation for sin) <span class="ital">upon thy flesh</span>, but the A.V. is probably correct. The “flesh” stands as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-3.htm" title="And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.">Genesis 6:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-39.htm" title="For he remembered that they were but flesh; a wind that passes away, and comes not again.">Psalm 78:39</a>, and in New Testament language (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-18.htm" title="For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwells no good thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not.">Romans 7:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-25.htm" title="I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.">Romans 7:25</a>), for the corrupt sensuous element in man’s nature. The context forbids the extension of the precept to sins of speech in general, as in the wider teaching of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/james/3-1.htm" title="My brothers, be not many masters, knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation....">James 3:1-12</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">neither say thou before the angel</span>] The words have been taken by most Jewish and some Christian interpreters as referring to the “angel” in the strict sense of the term, who was believed in Rabbinic traditions to preside over the Temple or the altar, and who, it is assumed, would punish the evasion of the vow on the frivolous excuse that it had been spoken inconsiderately. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-13.htm" title="Judge in yourselves: is it comely that a woman pray to God uncovered?">1 Corinthians 11:13</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-21.htm" title="I charge you before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the elect angels, that you observe these things without preferring one before another, doing nothing by partiality.">1 Timothy 5:21</a> are referred to as illustrations of the same thought. This interpretation, however, seems scarcely in harmony with the generally Hellenised tone of the book, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/1-13.htm" title="Then spoke Haggai the LORD's messenger in the LORD's message to the people, saying, I am with you, said the LORD.">Haggai 1:13</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/2-7.htm" title="For the priest's lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth: for he is the messenger of the LORD of hosts.">Malachi 2:7</a> we have distinct evidence that the term had come to be applied to prophets and priests, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-23.htm" title="Whether any do inquire of Titus, he is my partner and fellow helper concerning you: or our brothers be inquired of, they are the messengers of the churches, and the glory of Christ.">2 Corinthians 8:23</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-20.htm" title="The mystery of the seven stars which you saw in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches: and the seven candlesticks which you saw are the seven churches.">Revelation 1:20</a> it is used of ministers in the Christian Church, and this, it is obvious, gives a tenable, and, on the whole, a preferable meaning. The man comes to the priest with an offering less in value than he had vowed, or postpones the fulfilment of his vow indefinitely, and using the technical language of <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/15-25.htm" title="And the priest shall make an atonement for all the congregation of the children of Israel, and it shall be forgiven them; for it is ignorance: and they shall bring their offering, a sacrifice made by fire to the LORD, and their sin offering before the LORD, for their ignorance:">Numbers 15:25</a>, explains that the vow had been made in ignorance, and therefore that he was not bound to fulfil it to the letter. Other commentators again (Grätz) look on the word as describing a subordinate officer of the Temple.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">wherefore should God be angry at thy voice</span>] The question is in form like those of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/4-22.htm" title="Take heed now that you fail not to do this: why should damage grow to the hurt of the kings?">Ezra 4:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/7-23.htm" title="Whatever is commanded by the God of heaven, let it be diligently done for the house of the God of heaven: for why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons?">Ezra 7:23</a>, and is rhetorically more emphatic than a direct assertion. The words are a more distinct assertion of a Divine Government seen in earthly rewards and punishments than the book has as yet presented. The vow made, as was common, to secure safety or prosperity, could have no other result than loss and, it might be, ruin, if it were vitiated from the first by a rashness which took refuge in dishonesty.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin</span>. "Thy flesh" is equivalent to "thyself," the whole personality, the idea of the flesh, as a distinct part of the man, sinning, being alien from Old Testament ontology. The injunction means - Do not, by uttering rash or inconsiderate vows, which you afterwards evade or cannot fulfill, bring sin upon yourself, or, as others render, bring punishment upon yourself. Septuagint, "Suffer not thy mouth to Cause thy flesh to sin(<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f60;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>);" Vulgate, <span class="accented">Ut peccare facias carnem tuam</span>. Another interpretation, but not so suitable, is this - Do not let thy mouth (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. thy appetite) lead thee to break the vow of abstinence, and indulge in meat or drink from which (as, <span class="accented">e.g</span>., a Nazarite) thou wast bound to abstain. <span class="cmt_word">Neither say thou before the angel, that it was an error</span>. If we take "angel" (<span class="accented">malak</span>) in the usual sense (and there seems no very forcible reason why we should not), it must mean the angel of God in whose special charge you are placed, or the angel who was supposed to preside over the altar of worship, or that messenger of God whose duty it is to watch man's doings and to act as the minister of punishment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-16.htm">2 Samuel 24:16</a>). The workings of God's providence are often attributed to angels; and sometimes the names of God and angel are interchanged (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/16-9.htm">Genesis 16:9, 13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-2.htm">Genesis 18:2, 3</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-2.htm">Exodus 3:2, 4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-20.htm">Exodus 23:20</a>, etc.). Thus the Septuagint here renders, "Say not before the face of God (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;</span> <span class="accented">  =  </span><span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>)." If this interpretation be allowed, we have an argument for the literal explanation of the much-disputed passage in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-10.htm">1 Corinthians 11:10</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>. Thus, too, in 'The Testaments of the XII. Patriarchs,' we have, "The Lord is witness, and his angels are witnesses, concerning the word of your mouth" ('Levi,' 19). But most commentators consider that the word here means "messenger" of Jehovah, in the sense of priest, the announcer of the Divine Law, as in the unique passage <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/2-7.htm">Malachi 2:7</a>. Traces of a similar use of <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> may be found in the New Testament (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-20.htm">Revelation 1:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-1.htm">Revelation 2:1</a>, etc.). According to the first interpretation, the man comes before God with his excuse; according to the second, he comes to the priest, and confesses that he was thoughtless and overhasty in making his vow, and desires to be released from it, or, at any rate, by some means to evade its fulfillment. His excuse may possibly look to the cases mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/15-22.htm">Numbers 15:22</a>, etc., and he may wish to urge that the vow was made in ignorance (Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f4d;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, "It is an ignorance"), and that therefore he was not responsible for its incomplete execution. We do not know that a priest or any officer of the temple had authority to release from the obligation of a <span class="accented">Tow</span>, <span class="accented">so</span> that the excuse made "before" him would seem to be objectless, while the evasion of a solemn promise made in the Name of God might well be said to be done in the presence of the observing and recording angel. The Vulgate rendering, <span class="accented">Non eat providentia</span>, makes the man account for his neglect by assuming that God takes no heed of such things; he deems the long-suffering of God to be indifference and disregard (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/9-3.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:3</a>). The original does not bear this interpretation. <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore should God be angry at thy voice</span> - the words in which thy evasion and dishonesty are expressed - <span class="cmt_word">and destroy the work of thine hands?</span> <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. punish thee by calamity, want of success, sickness, etc., God's moral government being vindicated by earthly visitations. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ecclesiastes/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"I saw all the living which walk under the sun on the side of the youth, the second who shall enter upon the place of the former: no end of all the people, all those at whose head he stands." The author, by the expression "I saw," places himself back in the time of the change of government. If we suppose that he represents this to himself in a lively manner, then the words are to be translated: of the second who shall be his successor; but if we suppose that he seeks to express from the standpoint of the past that which, lying farther back in the past, was now for the first time future, then the future represents the time to come in the past, as at <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-27.htm">2 Kings 3:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-6.htm">Psalm 78:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-28.htm">Job 15:28</a> (Hitz.): of the second who should enter on his place (&#1506;&#1502;&#1491;, to step to, to step forth, of the new king, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-23.htm">Daniel 8:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/11-2.htm">Daniel 11:2</a>.; cf. &#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-20.htm">1 Kings 8:20</a>). The designation of the crowd which, as the pregnant &#1506;&#1501; expresses, gathered by the side of the young successor to the old king, by "all the living, those walking under the sun (&#1492;&#1502;&#1492;, perhaps intentionally the pathetic word for &#1492;&#1500;&#1499;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/42.htm">Isaiah 42</a>; 5)," would remain a hyperbole, even although the throne of the Asiatic world-ruler had been intended; still the expression, so absolute in its universality, would in that case be more natural (vid., the conjectural reference to Cyrus and Astygates). &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;, Ewald refers to the successor to the king, the second after the king, and translates: "to the second man who should reign in his stead;" but the second man in this sense has certainly never been the child of fortune; one must then think of Joseph, who, however, remains the second man. Hitzig rightly: "The youth is the second &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;, not &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;, in contrast to the king, who, as his predecessor, is the first." "Yet," he continues, "&#1492;&#1497;&#1500;&#1491; should be the appos. and &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497; the principal word," i.e., instead of: with the second youth, was to be expected: with the second, the youth. It is true, we may either translate: with the second youth, or: with the second, the youth - the_ form of expression has in its something incorrect, for it has the appearance as if it treated of two youths. But similar are the expressions, <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/8-21.htm">Matthew 8:21</a>, &#x3b5;&#788;&#768;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;.&#x3c4;.&#x3bb;., "another, and that, too, one of His disciples;" and <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-32.htm">Luke 23:32</a>, &#x3b7;&#787;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf; &#x3ba;.&#x3c4;.&#x3bb; All the world ranks itself by the side (thus we may also express it) of the second youthful king, so that he comes to stand at the head of an endless multitude. The lxx, Jerome, and the Venet. render incorrectly the all (the multitude) as the subject of the relative clause, which Luther, after the Syr., corrects by reading &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493; for &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501;: of the people that went for him there was no end. Rightly the Targ.: at whose head ( equals  &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1503;) he had the direction, &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;, as with &#1497;&#1510;&#1488; &#1493;&#1489;&#1488;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-16.htm">1 Samuel 18:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-10.htm">2 Chronicles 1:10</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/68-8.htm">Psalm 68:8</a>, etc. All the world congregates about him, follows his leadership; but his history thus splendidly begun, viewed backwards, is a history of hopes falsified.<p>"And yet they who come after do not rejoice in him: for that also is vain, and a grasping after the wind." For all that, and in spite of that (gam has here this meaning, as at <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/6-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-15.htm">Jeremiah 6:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/129-2.htm">Psalm 129:2</a>; Ewald, 354a), posterity (&#1492;&#1488;, as at <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:11</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-4.htm">Isaiah 41:4</a>) has no joy in this king, - the hopes which his contemporaries placed in the young king, who had seized the throne and conquered their hearts, afterwards proved to be delusions; and also this history, at first so beautiful, and afterwards so hateful, contributed finally to the confirmation of the truth, that all under the sun is vain. As to the historical reminiscence from the time of the Ptolemies, in conformity with which Hitzig (in his Comm.) thinks this figure is constructed; Grtz here, as always, rocks himself in Herodian dreams. In his Comm., Hitz. guesses first of Jeroboam, along with Rehoboam the &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497; &#1497;&#1500;&#1491;, who rebelled against King Solomon, who in his old age had become foolish. In an essay, "Zur Exeg. u. Kritik des B. Koheleth," in Hilgenfeld's Zeitschr. XIV 566ff., Saul, on the contrary, appears to him to be the old and foolish king, and David the poor wise youth who rose to the throne, and took possession of the whole kingdom, but in his latter days experienced desertion and adversities; for those who came after (the younger men) had no delight in him, but rebelled against him. But in relation to Saul, who came from the plough to be king, David, who was called from being a shepherd, is not &#1504;&#1493;&#1500;&#1491; &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;; and to Jewish history this Saul, whose nobler self is darkened by melancholy, but again brightens forth, and who to his death maintained the dignity of a king of Israel, never at any time appears as &#1493;&#1499;&#1505;&#1497;&#1500; ... &#1502;&#1500;&#1498;. Moreover, by both combinations of that which is related with the &#1492;&#1505;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; (for which &#1492;&#1505;&#1468; is written) of the history of the old Israelitish kings, a meaning contrary to the usage of the language must be extracted. It is true that &#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, as the so-called particip. perfecti, may mean "gone aside (to a distance)," <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-21.htm">Isaiah 49:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-13.htm">Jeremiah 17:13</a>; and we may, at any rate, by &#1505;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, think on that poor rabble which at first gathered around David, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-2.htm">1 Samuel 22:2</a>, regarded as outcasts from honourable society. But &#1489;&#1497;&#1514; will not accord therewith. That David came forth from the house (home) of the estranged or separated, is and remains historically an awkward expression, linguistically obscure, and not in accordance with the style of Koheleth. In order to avoid this incongruity, Bttcher regards Antiochus the Great as the original of the &#1497;&#1500;&#1491;. He was the second son of his father, who died 225. When a hopeful youth of fifteen years of age, he was recalled to the throne from a voluntary banishment into Farther Asia, very soon gained against his old cousin and rival Achaeus, who was supported by Egypt, a large party, and remained for several years esteemed as a prince and captain; he disappointed, however, at a later time, the confidence which was reposed in him. But granting that the voluntary exile of Antiochus might be designated as &#1492;&#1488;&#1505; &#1489;&#1497;&#1514;, he was yet not a poor man, born poor, but was the son of King Seleucus Callincus; and his older relative and rival Achaeus wished indeed to become king, but never attained unto it. Hence &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497; is not the youth as second son of his father, but as second on the throne, in relation to the dethroned king reckoned as the first. Thus, far from making it probable that the Book of Koheleth originated in the time of the Diadochs, this combination of Bttcher's also stands on a feeble foundation, and falls in ruins when assailed.<p>The section <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:12-4:16</a>, to which we have prefixed the superscription, "Koheleth's Experiences and their Results," has now reached its termination, and here for the first time we meet with a characteristic peculiarity in the composition of the book: the narrative sections, in which Koheleth, on the ground of his own experiences and observations, registers the vanities of earthly life, terminate in series of proverbs in which the I of the preacher retires behind the objectivity of the exhortations, rules, and principles obtained from experience, here recorded. The first of these series of proverbs which here follows is the briefest, but also the most complete in internal connection. </body></html>
