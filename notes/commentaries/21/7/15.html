It shelters from the storms and scorching heat of trouble. Wealth will not lengthen out the natural life; but true wisdom will give spiritual life, and strengthen men for services under their sufferings. Let us look upon the disposal of our condition as the work of God, and at last all will appear to have been for the best. In acts of righteousness, be not carried into heats or passions, no, not by a zeal for God. Be not conceited of thine own abilities; nor find fault with every thing, nor busy thyself in other men's matters. Many who will not be wrought upon by the fear of God, and the dread of hell, will avoid sins which ruin their health and estate, and expose to public justice. But those that truly fear God, have but one end to serve, therefore act steadily. If we say we have not sinned, we deceive ourselves. Every true believer is ready to say, God be merciful to me a sinner. Forget not at the same time, that personal righteousness, walking in newness of life, is the only real evidence of an interest by faith in the righteousness of the Redeemer. Wisdom teaches us not to be quick in resenting affronts. Be not desirous to know what people say; if they speak well of thee, it will feed thy pride, if ill, it will stir up thy passion. See that thou approve thyself to God and thine own conscience, and then heed not what men say of thee; it is easier to pass by twenty affronts than to avenge one. When any harm is done to us, examine whether we have not done as bad to others.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The days of my vanity - This does not imply that those days of vanity were ended (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:12</a> note).<p>The meaning may be best explained by a paraphrase. Solomon states how the wise man should regard the "crooked <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:13</a> work of God" when it bears upon him. He says in effect, "Do not think that thou couldest alter the two instances (described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:15</a>) of such crooked work so as to make it straight, that thou art more righteous or more wise than He is Who ordained these events. To set up thy judgment in opposition to His would imply an excess of wickedness and folly, deserving the punishment of premature death. But rather it is good for thee to grasp these seeming anomalies; if thou ponder them they will tend to impress on thee that fear of God which is a part of wisdom, and will guide thee safely through all the perplexities of this life" (compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:12-13</a>). The suggestion that these verses are intended to advocate a middle course between sin and virtue is at variance with the whole tenor of the book.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15.

What goes before and follows after, the various changes men are subject unto, both good and bad; these he had made his observations upon, throughout the course of his life, which had been a vain one, as every man's is, full of evil and trouble; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/6-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:12</a>; perhaps the wise man may have some respect to the times of his apostasy; and which might, among other things, be brought on by this; observing good men afflicted, and the wicked prosper, which has often been a stumbling to good men; <p>there is a just man that perisheth in his righteousness; not eternally; no truly just man ever perished, who is made so by the righteousness of Christ imputed to him; for though the righteous man is said to be scarcely saved, yet he is certainly saved: it can be true only in this sense of one that is only outwardly righteous, that trusts to his own righteousness, in which he may perish; but this is to be understood temporally and corporeally; one that is really just may perish in his name, in his substance, as well as at death, and that on account of his righteousness; he may lose his good name and character, and his substance, for righteousness's sake; yea, his life also, as Abel, Naboth, and others; this is the case "sometimes", as Aben Ezra observes, not always: or a just man, notwithstanding his righteousness, dies, and sometimes lives but a short time; which sense the antithesis seems to require; <p>and there is a wicked man that prolongeth his life in his wickedness; is very wicked, and yet, notwithstanding his great wickedness, lives a long time in the world; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-7.htm">Job 21:7</a>. <p>(u)  "illa omnia", Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator, Tigurine version, Gejerus; "omnia haec", Mercerus; "universa haec", Rambachius. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">All <i>things</i> have I seen in the days of my vanity: there is a just <i>man</i> that perisheth in his <span class="cverse3">{l}</span> righteousness, and there is a wicked <i>man</i> that prolongeth <i>his life</i> in his wickedness.</span><p>(l) Meaning that cruel tyrants put the godly to death and let the wicked go free.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">15</span>. <span class="ital">there is a just man that perisheth in his righteousness</span>] The writer looks back on what he calls “the days of his vanity,” his fleeting and profitless life, and notes, as before in ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-14.htm" title="The wise man's eyes are in his head; but the fool walks in darkness: and I myself perceived also that one event happens to them all.">Ecclesiastes 2:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-16.htm" title="For there is no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for ever; seeing that which now is in the days to come shall all be forgotten. And how dies the wise man? as the fool.">Ecclesiastes 2:16</a>, the disorders and anomalies of the world. The righteous are “of all men most miserable;” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-19.htm" title="If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.">1 Corinthians 15:19</a>) the ungodly “prosper in the world” and “come in no peril of death, but are lusty and strong,” <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-4.htm" title="For there are no bands in their death: but their strength is firm.">Psalm 73:4</a> (P. B. version). Here indeed those disorders present themselves in their most aggravated form. It is not only, as in ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-19.htm" title="For that which befalls the sons of men befalls beasts; even one thing befalls them: as the one dies, so dies the other; yes, they have all one breath; so that a man has no preeminence above a beast: for all is vanity.">Ecclesiastes 3:19</a>, that there is one event to the righteous and the wicked, but that there is an apparent inversion of the right apportionment of good and evil. The thought is the same as that of Psalms 73, and the <span class="bld">Debater</span> has not as yet entered, as the Psalmist did, into the sanctuary of God, and so learnt to “understand the end of these men” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-17.htm" title="Until I went into the sanctuary of God; then understood I their end.">Psalm 73:17</a>). The same problem in the moral order of the Universe furnishes a theme for the discussions of the Book of Job.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 15-22.</span> - Section 3. <span class="accented">Warnings against excesses</span>, <span class="accented">and praise of the golden mean</span>, which is practical wisdom and the art of living happily. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All things have I seen in the days of my vanity</span>. Koheleth gives his own experience of an anomalous condition which often obtains in human affairs. "All," being here defined by the article, must refer to the cases which he has mentioned or proceeds to mention. "The days of vanity" mean merely "fleeting, vain days" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/6-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:12</a>). The expression denotes the writer's view of the emptiness and transitoriness of life (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:2</a>), and it may also have special reference to his own vain efforts to solve the problems of existence. <span class="cmt_word">There is a just</span> (<span class="accented">righteous</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>man that perisheth in his righteousness</span>. Here is a difficulty about the dispensation of good and evil, which has always perplexed the thoughtful. It finds expression in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73.htm">Psalm 73</a>, though the singer propounds a solution (ver. 17) which Koheleth misses. The meaning of the preposition (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;</span>) before "righteousness" is disputed. Delitzsch, Wright, and others take it as equivalent to "in spite of," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-32.htm">Deuteronomy 1:32</a>, where "in this thing" means "notwithstanding," "for all this thing." Righteousness has the promise of long life and prosperity; it is an anomaly that it should meet with disaster and early death. We cannot argue from this that the author did not believe in temporal rewards and punishments; he states merely certain of his own experiences, which may be abnormal and capable of explanation. For his special purpose this was sufficient. Others take the preposition to mean "through," "in consequence of." Good men have always been persecuted for righteousness' sake (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-10.htm">Matthew 5:10, 11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-14.htm">John 17:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-12.htm">2 Timothy 3:12</a>), and so far the interpretation is quite admissible, and is perhaps supported by ver. 16, which makes a certain sort of righteousness the cause of disaster. But looking to the second clause of the present verse, where we can hardly suppose that the wicked man is said to attain to long life in consequence of his wickedness, we are safe in adopting the rendering, "in spite of." <span class="cmt_word">There is a wicked man that prolongeth his life in</span> (<span class="accented">in spite of</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>his wickedness</span>. The verb <span class="accented">arak</span>, "to make long," "to prolong," is used both with and without the accusative "days" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:12, 13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-33.htm">Deuteronomy 5:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-2.htm">Proverbs 28:2</a>). Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, There is an ungodly man remaining in his wickedness," which does not convey the sense of the original. According to the moral government of God experienced by the Hebrews in their history, the sinner was to suffer calamity and to be cut off prematurely. This is the contention of Job's friends, against which he argues so warmly. The writer of the Book of Wisdom has learned to look for the correction of such anomalies in another life. He sees that length of days is not always a blessing, and that retribution awaits the evil beyond the grave (Wisd. 1:9 Wisd. 3:4, 10 Wisd. 4:8, 19, etc.). Abel perished in early youth; Cain had his days prolonged. This apparent inversion of moral order leads to another reflection concerning the danger of exaggerations. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In this verse the author warns against this pride which, when everything does not go according to its mind, falls into passionate excitement, and thoughtlessly judges, or with a violent rude hand anticipates the end. &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1514;&#1468;&#1489;: do not overturn, hasten not, rush not, as at <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/5-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:1</a>. Why the word &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1498;, and not &#1489;&#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1498; or &#1489;&#1500;&#1489;&#1498;, is used, vid., Psychol. pp. 197-199: passionate excitements overcome a man according to the biblical representation of his spirit, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/25-28.htm">Proverbs 25:28</a>, and in the proving of the spirit that which is in the heart comes forth in the mood and disposition, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-13.htm">Proverbs 15:13</a>. &#1499;&#1468;&#1506;&#1493;&#1505; is an infin., like &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/5-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:11</a>. The warning has its reason in this, that anger or (&#1499;&#1506;&#1505;, taken more potentially than actually) fretfulness rests in the bosom of fools, i.e., is cherished and nourished, and thus is at home, and, as it were (thought of personally, as if it were a wicked demon), feels itself at home (&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;, as at <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-33.htm">Proverbs 14:33</a>). The haughty impetuous person, and one speaking out rashly, thus acts like a fool. In fact, it is folly to let oneself be impelled by contradictions to anger, which disturbs the brightness of the soul, takes away the considerateness of judgment, and undermines the health, instead of maintaining oneself with equanimity, i.e., without stormy excitement, and losing the equilibrium of the soul under every opposition to our wish.<p>From this point the proverb loses the form "better than," but tov still remains the catchword of the following proverbs. The proverb here first following is so far cogn., as it is directed against a particular kind of ka'as (anger), viz., discontentment with the present. </body></html>
