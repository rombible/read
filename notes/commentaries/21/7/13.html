It shelters from the storms and scorching heat of trouble. Wealth will not lengthen out the natural life; but true wisdom will give spiritual life, and strengthen men for services under their sufferings. Let us look upon the disposal of our condition as the work of God, and at last all will appear to have been for the best. In acts of righteousness, be not carried into heats or passions, no, not by a zeal for God. Be not conceited of thine own abilities; nor find fault with every thing, nor busy thyself in other men's matters. Many who will not be wrought upon by the fear of God, and the dread of hell, will avoid sins which ruin their health and estate, and expose to public justice. But those that truly fear God, have but one end to serve, therefore act steadily. If we say we have not sinned, we deceive ourselves. Every true believer is ready to say, God be merciful to me a sinner. Forget not at the same time, that personal righteousness, walking in newness of life, is the only real evidence of an interest by faith in the righteousness of the Redeemer. Wisdom teaches us not to be quick in resenting affronts. Be not desirous to know what people say; if they speak well of thee, it will feed thy pride, if ill, it will stir up thy passion. See that thou approve thyself to God and thine own conscience, and then heed not what men say of thee; it is easier to pass by twenty affronts than to avenge one. When any harm is done to us, examine whether we have not done as bad to others.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The work of God - The scheme of Divine Providence, the course of events which God orders and controls (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:11</a>).

This reason implies that there is a hand or work of God in all men’s actions, either effecting them if they be good, or permitting them if they be bad, and ordering and overruling them, whether they be good or bad.

This is dressed to those who thought the former days better than the present, and were ready to quarrel with the providence of God, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:10</a>; and are therefore advised to consider the work of God; not the work of creation, but of providence; which is the effect of divine sovereignty, and is conducted and directed according to the counsel of his will, and is always wisely done to answer the best ends and purposes: everything is beautiful in its season; contemplate, adore, and admire the wisdom, power, and goodness of God, displayed therein; it is such as cannot be made better, nor otherwise than it is; <p>for who can make that straight which he hath made crooked? or which seems to be so, irregular and disagreeable? No man can mend or make that better he finds fault with and complains of; nor can he alter the course of things, nor stay the hand, nor stop the providence of God: if it is his pleasure that public calamities should be in the world, or in such a part of it, as famine, pestilence, or the sword; or any affliction on families, and particular persons, or poverty and meanness in such and such individuals, there is no hindering it; whatever he has purposed and resolved, his providence effects, and there is no frustrating his designs; it signifies nothing for a creature to murmur and complain; it is best to submit to his will, for no alteration can be made but what he pleases. Some understand this of natural defects in human bodies, with which they are born, or which attend them, as blindness, lameness, &amp;c. so the Targum, <p>"consider the work of God, and his strength, who made the blind, the crooked, and the lame, to be wonders in the world; for who can make straight one of them but the Lord of the world, who made him crooked?'' <p>Others, of spiritual defects in such who walk in crooked ways, and are hardened in them; who can correct them, and make them other ways, if God does not give them his grace to convert them, and soften their hard hearts? he hardens whom he will, and who hath resisted his will? Jarchi's paraphrase is, <p>"who can make straight after death what he has made crooked in life?'' <p>See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:15</a>. Alshech interprets it of the first man Adam. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Consider the work of God: for who can make that straight, which he hath made crooked?</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">13</span>. <span class="ital">who can make that straight, which he hath made crooked</span>] The sequence of thought is as follows. To “consider the work of God” intelligently is one application of the wisdom which has been praised in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ecclesiastes/7-11.htm" title="Wisdom is good with an inheritance: and by it there is profit to them that see the sun....">Ecclesiastes 7:11-12</a>. In so considering, the mind of the <span class="bld">Debater</span> goes back to <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-10.htm" title="Say not you, What is the cause that the former days were better than these? for you do not inquire wisely concerning this.">Ecclesiastes 7:10</a>, and he bids men accept the outward facts of life as they come. If they are “crooked,” <span class="ital">i.e.</span> crossing and thwarting our inclinations, we cannot alter them. It is idle, to take up a Christian phrase that expresses the same thought, to seek to “change our cross.” We cannot alter the events of life, and our wisdom is not merely to accept them as inevitable, but to adapt ourselves to them. It is a striking example of Rabbinic literalism that the Chaldee Targum refers the words to the impossibility of removing bodily deformities, such as those of the blind, the hunchback, and the lame. The word and the thought are clearly the same as in ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-15.htm" title="That which is crooked cannot be made straight: and that which is wanting cannot be numbered.">Ecclesiastes 1:15</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Consider the work of God</span>. Here is another reason against murmuring and hasty judgment. True wisdom is shown by submission to the inevitable. In all that happens one ought to recognize God's work and God's ordering, and man's impotence. <span class="cmt_word">For who can make that straight, which he hath made crooked?</span> The things which God hath made crooked are the anomalies, the crosses, the difficulties, which meet us in life. Some would include bodily deformities, which seems to be a piece of unnecessary literalism. Thus the Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x7d;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c8;&#x1fc3;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>; "Who will be able to straighten him whom God has distorted?" and the Vulgate, <span class="accented">Nemo possit corrigere quem ille despexerit</span>, "No one can amend him whom he hath despised." The thought goes back to what was said in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:15</a>, "That which is crooked cannot be made straight;" and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/6-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:10</a>, man "cannot contend with him that is mightier than he." "As for the wondrous works of the Lord," says Ben-Sirs," there may be nothing taken from them, neither may anything be put unto them, neither can the ground of them be found out" (Ecclus. 18:6). We cannot arrange events according to our wishes or expectations; therefore not only is placid acquiescence a necessary duty, but the wise man will endeavor to accommodate himself to existing circumstances <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Without further trying to explain the mystery of the &#1499;&#1497;, we translate this verse: "... For oppression maketh wise men mad, and corruption destroyeth the understanding." From the lost first half of the verse, it appears that the subject here treated of is the duties of a judge, including those of a ruler into whose hands his subjects, with their property and life, are given. The second half is like an echo of <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-8.htm">Exodus 23:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-19.htm">Deuteronomy 16:19</a>. That which &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1491; there means is here, as at <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-27.htm">Proverbs 15:27</a>, denoted by &#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492;; and &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511; is accordingly oppression as it is exercised by one who constrains others who need legal aid and help generally to purchase it by means of presents. Such oppression for the sake of gain, even if it does not proceed to the perversion of justice, but only aims at courting and paying for favour, makes a wise man mad (&#1492;&#1493;&#1500;&#1500;, as at <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-17.htm">Job 12:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-25.htm">Isaiah 44:25</a>), i.e., it hurries him forth, since the greed of gold increases more and more, to the most blinding immorality and regardlessness; and such presents for the purpose of swaying the judgment, and of bribery, destroys the heart, i.e., the understanding (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/4-11.htm">Hosea 4:11</a>, Bereschith rabba, chap. lvi.), for they obscure the judgment, blunt the conscience, and make a man the slave of his passion. The conjecture &#1492;&#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; (riches) instead of the word &#1492;&#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511; (Burger, as earlier Ewald) is accordingly unnecessary; it has the parallelism against it, and thus generally used gives an untrue thought. The word &#1492;&#1493;&#1500;&#1500; does not mean "gives lustre" (Desvoeux), or "makes shine forth  equals  makes manifest" (Tyler); thus also nothing is gained for a better connection of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:7</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:6</a>. The Venet. excellently: &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;. Aben Ezra supposes that &#1502;&#1514;&#1504;&#1492; is here  equals  &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; &#1502;&#1514;; Mendelssohn repeats it, although otherwise the consciousness of the syntactical rule, Gesen. 147a, does not fail him. </body></html>
