Solomon may here be considered as speaking in the person of an ungodly man, who takes occasion to dissuade men from righteousness, because of the danger which attends it. Therefore, saith he, take heed of strictness, zeal, and forwardness in religion. And in consistency with this the next verse may be viewed as containing an antidote to this suggestion; “Yea, rather,” saith he, “be not wicked or foolish overmuch; for that will not preserve thee, as thou mayest imagine, but will occasion and hasten thy ruin.” It must, however, be acknowledged, “there are many parts or appearances of religion which may be carried to an extreme. A man may be over tenacious of insignificant forms or human inventions: he may pretend to kinds and degrees of righteousness which the Scriptures do not require. His conscientiousness may degenerate into superstition and scrupulousness; his benevolence into indiscretion, and his candour and good nature into folly: and in affecting to be acquainted with the whole of divine truth, he may become presumptuously curious, and intrude into unrevealed things. Thus many run into extremes, and expose themselves to needless persecution.” — Scott. Dr. Waterland renders it, <span class="ital">Do not exercise justice too rigorously, </span>according to the interpretation which Bishop Hall gives of it, namely, “Be not too rigorous in exacting the extremity of justice upon every occasion; neither do thou affect too much semblance and ostentation of more justice than thou hast. Neither do thou arrogate more wisdom to thyself than is in thee.” Others again expound this and the next verse of the public administration of justice, which ought to be neither too rigid nor too remiss and negligent. <span class="ital">“Non dubium est, </span>&c. There is no doubt,” says Melancthon, “but he speaks of political justice, which governs the things of this life; and consists of a mean between cruelty and negligence. Too much severity becomes cruelty: and too much indulgence confirms men in wickedness. A good governor takes a middle course. The like admonition,” adds he, “is subjoined about wisdom; for, as too much severity becomes cruelty, so too much wisdom, that is, subtlety, becomes caviling, sophistry, and cheating.” Dr. Hammond, however, understands these verses according to the interpretation first given, considering <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-16.htm" title="Be not righteous over much; neither make yourself over wise: why should you destroy yourself ?">Ecclesiastes 7:16</a>, <span class="ital">Be not righteous overmuch, </span>as the objection of a carnal, worldly man, or of a lukewarm professor;<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“who takes that, for an excess of duty which brings any damage, or worldly loss, upon him, which objection is answered,” says he, “in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-17.htm" title="Be not over much wicked, neither be you foolish: why should you die before your time?">Ecclesiastes 7:17</a>, <span class="ital">Be not wicked overmuch, </span>&c., that is, the fears, and, from thence, the prudential, but oftentimes very impious practices of the worldling, are the more probable path to the most hasty ruin.” — See Bishop Patrick. This interpretation certainly appears the most probable, and most consistent with the context.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:11-22 Wisdom is as good as an inheritance, yea better. It shelters from the storms and scorching heat of trouble. Wealth will not lengthen out the natural life; but true wisdom will give spiritual life, and strengthen men for services under their sufferings. Let us look upon the disposal of our condition as the work of God, and at last all will appear to have been for the best. In acts of righteousness, be not carried into heats or passions, no, not by a zeal for God. Be not conceited of thine own abilities; nor find fault with every thing, nor busy thyself in other men's matters. Many who will not be wrought upon by the fear of God, and the dread of hell, will avoid sins which ruin their health and estate, and expose to public justice. But those that truly fear God, have but one end to serve, therefore act steadily. If we say we have not sinned, we deceive ourselves. Every true believer is ready to say, God be merciful to me a sinner. Forget not at the same time, that personal righteousness, walking in newness of life, is the only real evidence of an interest by faith in the righteousness of the Redeemer. Wisdom teaches us not to be quick in resenting affronts. Be not desirous to know what people say; if they speak well of thee, it will feed thy pride, if ill, it will stir up thy passion. See that thou approve thyself to God and thine own conscience, and then heed not what men say of thee; it is easier to pass by twenty affronts than to avenge one. When any harm is done to us, examine whether we have not done as bad to others.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Destroy thyself - The Septuagint and Vulgate render it: "be amazed."

Holden makes Ec 7:16 the scoffing inference of the objector, and Ec 7:17 the answer of Solomon, now repentant. So (1Co 15:32) the skeptic's objection; (1Co 15:33) the answer. However, "Be not righteous over much," may be taken as Solomon's words, forbidding a self-made righteousness of outward performances, which would wrest salvation from God, instead of receiving it as the gift of His grace. It is a fanatical, pharisaical righteousness, separated from God; for the "fear of God" is in antithesis to it (Ec 7:18; 5:3, 7; Mt 6:1-7; 9:14; 23:23, 24; Ro 10:3; 1Ti 4:3).<p>over wise&#8212;(Job 11:12; Ro 12:3, 16), presumptuously self-sufficient, as if acquainted with the whole of divine truth.<p>destroy thyself&#8212;expose thyself to needless persecution, austerities and the wrath of God; hence to an untimely death. "Destroy thyself" answers to "perisheth" (Ec 7:15); "righteous over much," to "a just man." Therefore in Ec 7:15 it is self-justiciary, not a truly righteous man, that is meant.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This verse and the next have a manifest reference to <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-15.htm" title="All things have I seen in the days of my vanity: there is a just man that perishes in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man that prolongs his life in his wickedness.">Ecclesiastes 7:15</a></span>, being two inferences drawn from the two clauses of the observation there recorded. And this verse was delivered by Solomon, either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. In the name and person of an ungodly man, who taketh occasion to dissuade men from the practice of righteousness and true wisdom, because of the danger which attends it, and is expressed in the middle of the former, and the end of this verse. Therefore, saith he, it is not good to be more nice than wise, take heed of strictness, zeal, and forwardness in religion. And then the next verse contains an antidote to this poisonous suggestion; yea, rather, saith he, be not wicked or foolish over-much; for that will not preserve thee, as thou mayst imagine from the last clause of <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-15.htm" title="All things have I seen in the days of my vanity: there is a just man that perishes in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man that prolongs his life in his wickedness.">Ecclesiastes 7:15</a></span>, but will occasion and hasten thy ruin. But seeing these words are very capable of another sense, and there is no proof or evidence of this sense in them, as there is in all other places where Solomon speaks in the person of an epicure, this interpretation may seem to be dangerous, and liable to misconstruction. Or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. In his own person. And so these words are a caution to prevent, as far as may be, that destruction which oft attends upon righteous men, as was observed, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-15.htm" title="All things have I seen in the days of my vanity: there is a just man that perishes in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man that prolongs his life in his wickedness.">Ecclesiastes 7:15</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Be not righteous over-much; </span> either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. By being too severe in observing, censuring, and punishing the faults of others beyond the rules of equity, without giving any allowance for human infirmity, extraordinary temptations, the state of times, and other circumstances. Or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. By being more just than God requires, either laying those yokes and burdens upon a man’s self or others which God hath not imposed upon him, and which are too heavy for him, of which see on <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-4.htm" title="For they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay them on men's shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers.">Matthew 23:4</a></span>, or condemning or avoiding those things as sinful which God hath not forbidden, which really is superstition, but is here called righteousness abusively, because it is so in appearance, and in the opinion of such persons. So he gives them the name, but by adding <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">over-much, </span> denies the thing, because righteousness, as well as other virtues, avoids both the extremes, the excess as well as the deficit. Or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. By an imprudent and unseasonable ostentation or exercise of righteousness where it is not necessary, as if a protestant travelling in a popish country should publicly profess his religion to all whom he meets with, or when a man casts the pearl of reproof before swine, against that caution, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-6.htm" title="Give not that which is holy to the dogs, neither cast you your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you.">Matthew 7:6</a></span>. So this is a precept that men should manage their zeal with godly wisdom, and with condescension to others, as far as may be. But this is not to be understood, either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. Of such prudence as keeps a man from the practice of his duty, but only of that prudence which directs him in ordering the time, manner, and other circumstances of it. Or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. As if men could be too good, or too holy, since the strictest holiness which any man in this life can arrive at falls far short both of the rule of God’s word, and of those examples of God and Christ, and the holy angels, which are propounded in Scripture for our imitation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Neither make thyself over-wise; </span> be not wise in thine own conceit, nor above what is written, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-6.htm" title="And these things, brothers, I have in a figure transferred to myself and to Apollos for your sakes; that you might learn in us not to think of men above that which is written, that no one of you be puffed up for one against another.">1 Corinthians 4:6</a></span>, nor above what is meet; which he here implieth to be the cause of being righteous over-much. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Why shouldest thou destroy thyself?</span> for thereby thou wilt unnecessarily expose thyself to danger and mischief. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Be not righteous over much,.... This is not meant of true and real righteousness, even moral righteousness, a man cannot be too holy or too righteous; but of a show and ostentation of righteousness, and of such who would be thought to be more righteous and holy than others, and therefore despise those who, as they imagine, do not come up to them; and are very rigid and censorious in their judgment of others, and very severe in their reproofs of them; and, that they may appear very righteous persons, will do more than what the law requires of them to do, even works of supererogation, as the Pharisees formerly, and Papists now, pretend, and abstain from the lawful use of things which God has given to be enjoyed; and macerate their bodies by abstinence, fastings, pilgrimages, penance, scourges, and the like, as the Eremites among the Christians, and the Turks, as Aben Ezra on the place observes; and many there be, who, by an imprudent zeal for what they judge right, and which sometimes are mere trifles, and by unseasonable reproofs for what is wrong, expose themselves to resentment and danger. Some understand this of political and punitive justice, exercising it in too strict and rigorous a manner, according to the maxim, "summum jus saepe summa injuria est" (w); and Schultens (x), from the use of the word in the Arabic language, renders it, "be not too rigid"; and others, in a contrary sense, of too much mercy and pity to offenders. So the Midrash; and Jarchi illustrates it by the case of Saul, who had mercy on the wicked, and spared Agag. The Targum is, <p>"be not over righteous at a time that a sinner is found guilty of slaughter in thy court of judicature, that thou shouldest spare and not kill him;'' <p>neither make thyself over wise; above what is written, or pretend to be wiser than others. So the Arabic version, "show not too much wisdom"; do not affect, as not to be more righteous than others, so not more wise, by finding fault with present times, or with the dispensations of Providence, or with the manners and conduct of men; setting up for a critic and a censurer of men and things; or do not pry into things, and seek after a knowledge of them, which are out of your reach, and beyond your capacity; <p>why shouldest thou destroy thyself? either by living too strictly and abstemiously, or by studying too closely, or by behaving in such a manner to men, as that they will seek thy destruction, and bring it on thee: or "why shouldest thou", or "whereby", or "lest, thou shouldest be stupid" (y); lose thy sense and reason, as persons who study the knowledge of things they have not a capacity for: or why shouldest thou become foolish in the eyes of all men by thy conduct and behaviour? or, "why shouldest thou be desolate" (z); alone, and nobody care to have any conversation and acquaintance with thee? <p>(w) Terent.

Laert. i. 1, § 41). Even in that which is in itself good, virtue lies, as Aristotle had taught (<span class="ital">Eth. Nicom</span>. ii. 6. 7), in a mean between opposite extremes. Popular language has embodied the thought in the proverb, <span class="ital">Summum jus, summa injuria</span>. Even in the other sense of “righteousness,” as meaning personal integrity, personal religion, there might be, as in the ideal of the Pharisees and Essenes and Stoics, the “vaulting ambition” that o’erleaps itself.” And “what was true of righteousness was true also of speculative philosophy. The wisdom that will not be content to rest in ignorance of the unknowable is indeed unwisdom, and “fools rush in where angels fear to tread.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">why shouldest thou destroy thyself?</span>] The primary meaning of the verb in the form used here is that of “being amazed, stunned, astonished,” and may have been chosen to express the besotted and bedazed spiritual pride which St Paul paints by the participle “puffed up” (<span class="greekheb">τυφωθεὶς</span>) in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-5.htm" title="(For if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God?)">1 Timothy 3:5</a>, and which was but too commonly the accompaniment of fancied excellence in knowledge or in conduct.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Be not righteous over much</span>. The exhortation has been variously interpreted to warn against too scrupulous observance of ritual and ceremonial religion, or the mistaken piety which neglects all mundane affairs, or the Pharisaical spirit which is bitter in condemning others who fall short of one's own standard. Cox will have it that the advice signifies that a prudent man will not be very righteous, since he will gain nothing by it, nor very wicked, as he will certainly shorten his life by such conduct. But really Koheleth is condemning the tendency to immoderate asceticism which had begun to show itself in his day - a rigorous, prejudiced, indiscreet manner of life and conduct which made piety offensive, and afforded no real aid to the cause of religion. This arrogant system virtually dictated the laws by which Providence should be governed, and found fault with divinely ordered circumstances if they did not coincide with its professors' preconceived opinions. Such religionism might well be called being "righteous over much." <span class="cmt_word">Neither make thyself over wise</span>; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x3b7;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">Neque plus sapias quam necesse est</span>; better, <span class="accented">show not thyself too wise</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. do not indulge in speculations about God's dealings, estimating them according to your own predilections, questioning the wisdom of his moral government. Against such perverse speculation St. Paul argues (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-19.htm">Romans 9:19</a>, etc.). "Thou wilt say unto me, Why doth he still find fault? For who withstandeth his will? Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why didst thou make me thus?" A good principle carried to excess may bring evil results. <span class="accented">Summum jus</span>, <span class="accented">summa injuria</span>. The maxim, <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x3b7;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;</span>, Ne <span class="accented">quid nimis</span>, "Moderation in all things," is taught here; and Aristotle's theory of virtue being the mean between the two extremes of excess and defect is adumbrated ('Ethic. Nicom.,' 2:6. 15, 16): though we do not see that the writer is "reproducing current Greek thought" (Plumptre), or that independent reflection and observation could not have landed him at the implied conclusion without plagiarism. <span class="cmt_word">Why shouldest thou destroy thyself</span>? Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x1f75;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f72;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1fc7;&#x3c2;</span>, "Lest perchance thou be confounded;" Vulgate, Ne <span class="accented">obstupescas</span>, "Lest thou be stupefied." This is the primary meaning of the special form of the verb here used (hithp. of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5de;&#x5dd;</span>), and Plumptre supposes that the author intends thereby to express the spiritual pride which accompanies fancied excellence in knowledge and conduct, and by which the possessor is puffed up (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-6.htm">1 Timothy 3:6</a>). But plainly it is not a mental, internal effect that is contemplated, but something that affects comfort, position, or life, like the corresponding clause in the following verse. Hitzig and Ginsburg explain the word, "Make thyself forsaken," "Isolate thyself," which can scarcely be the meaning. The Authorized Version is correct. A man who professes to be wiser than others, and. indeed, wiser than Providence, incurs the envy and animosity of his fellow-men, and will certainly be punished by God for his arrogance and presumption. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"Say not: How comes it that the former times were better than these now? for thou dost not, from wisdom, ask after this." Cf. these lines from Horace (Poet. 173, 4):<p>"Difficilis, querulus, laudator temporis acti<p>Se puero, censor castigatorque minorum."<p>Such an one finds the earlier days - not only the old days described in history (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-32.htm">Deuteronomy 4:32</a>), but also those he lived in before the present time (cf. e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-29.htm">2 Chronicles 9:29</a>) - thus by contrast to much better than the present tones, that in astonishment he asks: "What is it  equals  how comes it that?" etc. The author designates this question as one not proceeding from wisdom: &#1502;&#1495;, like the Mishnic &#1495;&#1499;&#1502;&#1492; &#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1498;, and &#1506;&#1500; &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1500;, as at <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/1-2.htm">Nehemiah 1:2</a>; 'al-zeh refers to that question, after the ground of the contrast, which is at the same time an exclamation of wonder. The &#1499;&#1497;, assigning a reason for the dissuasion, does not mean that the cause of the difference between the present and the good old times is easily seen; but it denotes that the supposition of this difference is foolish, because in truth every age has its bright and its dark sides; and this division of light and shadow between the past and the present betrays a want of understanding of the signs of the times and of the ways of God. This proverb does not furnish any point of support for the determination of the date of the authorship of the Book of Koheleth. But if it was composed in the last century of the Persian domination, this dissatisfaction with the present times is explained, over against which Koheleth leads us to consider that it is self-deception and one-sidedness to regard the present as all dark and the past as all bright and rosy. </body></html>
