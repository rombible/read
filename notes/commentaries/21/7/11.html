It shelters from the storms and scorching heat of trouble. Wealth will not lengthen out the natural life; but true wisdom will give spiritual life, and strengthen men for services under their sufferings. Let us look upon the disposal of our condition as the work of God, and at last all will appear to have been for the best. In acts of righteousness, be not carried into heats or passions, no, not by a zeal for God. Be not conceited of thine own abilities; nor find fault with every thing, nor busy thyself in other men's matters. Many who will not be wrought upon by the fear of God, and the dread of hell, will avoid sins which ruin their health and estate, and expose to public justice. But those that truly fear God, have but one end to serve, therefore act steadily. If we say we have not sinned, we deceive ourselves. Every true believer is ready to say, God be merciful to me a sinner. Forget not at the same time, that personal righteousness, walking in newness of life, is the only real evidence of an interest by faith in the righteousness of the Redeemer. Wisdom teaches us not to be quick in resenting affronts. Be not desirous to know what people say; if they speak well of thee, it will feed thy pride, if ill, it will stir up thy passion. See that thou approve thyself to God and thine own conscience, and then heed not what men say of thee; it is easier to pass by twenty affronts than to avenge one. When any harm is done to us, examine whether we have not done as bad to others.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And by it there is profit ... - literally, And is profitable to the living.

It is good of itself. Or, "is as good as an inheritance" (n), as it may be rendered; it is a portion of itself, especially spiritual and divine wisdom. The Targum interprets it, the wisdom of the law, or the knowledge of that; but much more excellent is the wisdom of the Gospel, the wisdom of God in a mystery, the hidden wisdom; the knowledge of which, in an experimental way, is preferable to all earthly inheritances: but this with an inheritance is good, yea, better than without one; for wisdom, without riches, is generally overlooked and despised in men; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/9-16.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:16</a>; when wealth, with wisdom, makes a man regarded; this commands respect and attention; as well as he is in a better condition to do good, if willing to share, and ready to distribute; <p>and by it there is profit to them that see the sun; mortals in this present state, who are described as such that see the sun rise and set, and enjoy the heat and light of it, receive much advantage from men who are both wise and rich: or, "and it is an excellency to them that see the sun"; it is an excellency to mortals and what gives them superiority to others, that they have both wisdom and riches. <p>(n)  "aeque ac haereditas", Gejerus, Schmidt. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Wisdom <i>is</i> good with an <span class="cverse3">{h}</span> inheritance: and <i>by it there is</i> profit to them that see the sun.</span><p>(h) He answers to them who do not value wisdom unless riches are joined with it, showing that both are the gifts of God, but that wisdom is far more excellent and may be without riches.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">11</span>. <span class="ital">Wisdom is good with an inheritance</span>] The words fall on our ears with something like a ring of cynicism, as though the teacher said with a sneer, “wisdom is all very well if you have property to fall back upon.” If that sense were however admissible at all, it could only be by emphasizing the word “inheritance,” as contrasted with the treasure which a man heaps up for himself. The inherited estate, be it great or small, does not interfere with wisdom as money-making does. The <span class="greekheb">ἀρχαιόπλουτοι</span> (“rich with ancestral wealth”) are, as Aristotle taught, of a nobler stamp than those who make their fortunes (<span class="ital">Rhet</span>. ii. 9. 9). Comp. Aesch. <span class="ital">Agam</span>. 1043. Even so taken, however, the tone is entirely out of harmony with the immediate context, and a far more satisfactory meaning is obtained by taking the preposition as a particle of comparison (it is often so used, as in ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-17.htm" title="Therefore I hated life; because the work that is worked under the sun is grievous to me: for all is vanity and vexation of spirit.">Ecclesiastes 2:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-5.htm" title="They are not in trouble as other men; neither are they plagued like other men.">Psalm 73:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/120-4.htm" title="Sharp arrows of the mighty, with coals of juniper.">Psalm 120:4</a> (probably); <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-20.htm" title="If I justify myself, my own mouth shall condemn me: if I say, I am perfect, it shall also prove me perverse.">Job 9:20</a>); and so we get “Wisdom is good <span class="bld">as</span> an inheritance.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and by it there is profit to them that see the sun</span>] Better, <span class="bld">And it is profitable for them that see the sun.</span> It stands instead of both inherited and acquired wealth. In the use of the term “those that see the sun” as an equivalent we note again an echo of Greek poetic feeling. The very phrase <span class="greekheb">ὁρᾶν φάος ἡελίοιο</span> (“to see the light of the sun”) is essentially Homeric. Here, as in chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-7.htm" title="Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit shall return to God who gave it.">Ecclesiastes 12:7</a>, it seems chosen as half conveying the thought that there is after all a bright side of life.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - Such hasty judgment is incompatible with true wisdom and sagacity. <span class="cmt_word">Wisdom is good with an inheritance</span>; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>. Vulgate, <span class="accented">Utilior eat sapientia cam divitiis</span>. The sentence thus rendered seems to mean that wealth lends a prestige to wisdom, that the man is happy who possesses both. The inheritance spoken of is an hereditary one; the man who is "rich with ancestral wealth" is enabled to employ his wisdom to good purpose, his position adding weight to his words and actions, and relieving him from the low pursuit of money-making. To this effect Wright quotes Menander - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f15;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span><br /><span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x1fc6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x7d;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x1fc3;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Blest is the man who wealth and wisdom hath,<br />For he can use his riches as he ought."</span> (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-24.htm">Proverbs 14:24</a>.) Many commentators, thinking such a sentiment alien front the context, render the particle <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5dd;</span> not "with," but "as" Wisdom is [as] good as an inheritance" (see on Ecclesiastes 2:16). This is putting wisdom on rather a low platform, and one would have expected to read some such aphorism as "Wisdom is better than rubies" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-11.htm">Proverbs 8:11</a>), if Koheleth had intended to make any such comparison. It appears then most expedient to take <span class="accented">im</span> in the sense of "moreover," "as well as," "<span class="accented">and"</span> (camp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-42.htm">1 Samuel 17:42</a>, "ruddy, and (<span class="accented">ira</span>) of a fair countenance"). "Wisdom is good, and an inheritance is good; 'both are good, but the advantages of the former, as ver. 12 intimates, far outweigh those of the latter. <span class="cmt_word">And by it there is profit to them that see the sun</span>; rather, <span class="accented">and an advantage for those that see the</span>, <span class="accented">sun</span>. However useful wealth may be, wisdom is that which is really beneficial to all who live and rejoice in the light of day. In Homer the phrase, <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3c1;&#x1fb6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x1f71;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f20;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;</span>, "to see the light of the sun" ('Iliad,' 18:61), signifies merely "to live;" Plumptre considers it to be used here and in Ecclesiastes 19:7 in order to convey the thought that, after all, life has its bright side. Cox would take it to mean to live much in the sun, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. <span class="accented">to</span> lead an active life - which is an imported modern notion. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>A fourth proverb of that which is better (&#1502;&#1503; &#1496;&#1493;&#1489;) presents, like the third, the fools and the wise over against each other: "Better to hear the reproof of a wise man, than that one should hear the song of fools. For like the crackling of Nesseln (nettles) under the Kessel (kettle), so the laughter of the fool: also this is vain." As at <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-1.htm">Proverbs 13:1</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-10.htm">Proverbs 17:10</a>, &#1490;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512;&#1492; is the earnest and severe words of the wise, which impressively reprove, emphatically warn, and salutarily alarm. &#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1512; in itself means only song, to the exclusion, however, of the plaintive song; the song of fools is, if not immoral, yet morally and spiritually hollow, senseless, and unbridled madness. Instead of &#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;, the words &#1502;&#1488; &#1513;&#1473; are used, for the twofold act of hearing is divided between different subjects. A fire of thorn-twigs flickers up quickly and crackles merrily, but also exhausts itself quickly (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/118-12.htm">Psalm 118:12</a>), without sufficiently boiling the flesh in the pot; whilst a log of wood, without making any noise, accomplishes this quietly and surely.<p>We agree with Knobel and Vaihinger in copying the paronomasia [Nessel-Kessel]. When, on the other hand, Zckler remarks that a fire of nettles could scarcely crackle, we advise our friend to try it for once in the end of summer with a bundle of stalks of tall dry nettles. They yield a clear blaze, a quickly expiring fire, to which here, as he well remarks, the empty laughter of foolish men is compared, who are devoid of all earnestness, and of all deep moral principles of life. This laughter is vain, like that crackling.<p>There is a hiatus between <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:6</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:7</a>. For how <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:7</a> can be related to <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:6</a> as furnishing evidence, no interpreter has as yet been able to say. Hitzig regards <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:6</a> as assigning a reason for <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:5</a>, but 6b as a reply (as <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:7</a> containing its motive shows) to the assertion of <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:5</a>, - a piece of ingenious thinking which no one imitates. Elster translates: "Yet injustice befools a wise man," being prudently silent about this "yet." Zckler finds, as Knobel and Ewald do, the mediating thought in this, that the vanity of fools infects and also easily befools the wise. But the subject spoken of is not the folly of fools in general, but of their singing and laughter, to which <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:7</a> has not the most remote reference. Otherwise Hengst.: "In <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:7</a>, the reason is given why the happiness of fools is so brief; first, the mens sana is lost, and then destruction follows." But in that case the words ought to have been &#1499;&#1505;&#1497;&#1500; &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1500;&#1500;; the remark, that &#1495;&#1499;&#1501; here denotes one who ought to be and might be such, is a pure volte. Ginsburg thinks that the two verses are co-ordinated by &#1499;&#1497;; that <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:6</a> gives the reason for <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:5</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:7</a> that for <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:5</a>, since here, by way of example, one accessible to bribery is introduced, who would act prudently in letting himself therefore be directed by a wise man. But if he had wished to be thus understood, the author would have used another word instead of &#1495;&#1499;&#1501;, 7a, and not designated both him who reproves and him who merits reproof by the one word - the former directly, the latter at least indirectly. We do not further continue the account of the many vain attempts that have been made to bring <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:7</a> into connection with <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:6</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:5</a>. Our opinion is, that <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:7</a> is the second half of a tetrastich, the first half of which is lost, which began, as is to be supposed, with tov. The first half was almost the same as <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/37-16.htm">Psalm 37:16</a>, or better still, as <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-8.htm">Proverbs 16:8</a>, and the whole proverb stood thus:<p>&#1496;&#1493;&#1489; &#1502;&#1506;&#1496; &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1491;&#1511;&#1492;<p>&#1502;&#1512;&#1489; &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488; &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;&#1475;<p>[and then follows <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:7</a> as it lies before us in the text, formed into a distich, the first line of which terminates with &#1495;&#1499;&#1501;]. We go still further, and suppose that after the first half of the tetrastich was lost, that expression, "also this is vain," added to <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:6</a> by the punctuation, was inserted for the purpose of forming a connection for &#1499;&#1497; &#1506;&#1513;&#1511;: Also this is vain, that, etc. (&#1499;&#1497;, like asher, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:14</a>). </body></html>
