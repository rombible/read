It will do more good to go to a funeral than to a feast. We may lawfully go to both, as there is occasion; our Saviour both feasted at the wedding of his friend in Cana, and wept at the grave of his friend in Bethany. But, considering how apt we are to be vain and indulge the flesh, it is best to go to the house of mourning, to learn the end of man as to this world. Seriousness is better than mirth and jollity. That is best for us which is best for our souls, though it be unpleasing to sense. It is better to have our corruptions mortified by the rebuke of the wise, than to have them gratified by the song of fools. The laughter of a fool is soon gone, the end of his mirth is heaviness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>House of mourning ... house of mirth - These phrases acquire a forcible significance from the Eastern custom of prolonging both festive and mournful celebrations through several days.

To listen to it diligently, receive it cordially, and act according to it; though it may be disagreeable to the flesh, and give present pain, yet the effect and issue will be good, and show that man to be wise that hears it, as well as he that gives it; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/141-1.htm">Psalm 141:1</a>; <p>than for a man to hear the song of fools; the vain and impure songs that foolish men sing in the house of mirth; or the flatteries of foolish men, which tickle and please the mind, as music and songs do: or, "than a man that hears the song of fools" (i), and is pleased with it. <p>(i)    "quam vir audiens canticum stultorum", Montanus, Mercerus; "prae viro audiente canticum stultorum", Rambachius. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to hear the song of fools.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">5</span>. <span class="ital">It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise</span>] The word for “rebuke” is characteristic of the sapiential books of the Old Testament (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-1.htm" title="A wise son hears his father's instruction: but a scorner hears not rebuke.">Proverbs 13:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-10.htm" title="A reproof enters more into a wise man than an hundred stripes into a fool.">Proverbs 17:10</a>). Here also the teacher finds the moral that “pain is gain.” The “rebuke” is not pleasant, but it acts with a power to heal. The “song of fools” points to the type of lyric poetry of which we have examples in Anacreon, perhaps to the more wanton and impure poems which entered so largely into Greek life, and are preserved in such abundance in the <span class="ital">Anthologia Græca</span>. The comic drinking songs of a people represent at all times the lowest form of its animal life, and with these also, either in his own country or in Greek-speaking lands, the writer of the book had become acquainted. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-5.htm" title="That chant to the sound of the viol, and invent to themselves instruments of music, like David;">Amos 6:5</a> indicates the existence of a like form of revelry in the older life of Israel. Such songs left a taint behind them and the man was permanently the worse for it. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-4.htm" title="Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks.">Ephesians 5:4</a> we may probably trace a reference to the same form of literature.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise.</span> <span class="accented">Gearah</span>, "rebuke," is the word used in Proverbs for the grave admonition which heals and strengthens while it wounds (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-1.htm">Proverbs 13:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-10.htm">Proverbs 17:10</a>). The silent lessons which a man learns from the contemplation of others' sorrow are rightly supplemented by the salutary correction of the wise man's tongue. <span class="cmt_word">Than for a man to hear the song of fools.</span> <span class="accented">Shir</span>, "<span class="accented">song</span>," is a general term used of sacred or profane song; the connection here with the second clause of ver. 4, etc., leads one to think of the hoister-cue, reckless, often immodest, singing heard in the house of revelry, such as Amos (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-5.htm">Amos 6:5</a>) calls "idle songs to the sound of the viol" Koheleth might have heard these in his own country, without drawing his experience from the license of Greek practice or the impurity of Greek lyrics. The Vulgate renders the clause, <span class="accented">Quum stultorum adulatione decipi</span>, Than to be deceived by the flattery of tools." This is a paraphrase; the correctness is negatived by the explanation given in the following verse. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ecclesiastes/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"For there are many words which increase vanity: What cometh forth therefrom for man?" The dispute (objection), &#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503;, takes place in words; &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; here will thus not mean "things" (Hengst., Ginsb., Zckl., Bullock, etc.), but "words." As that wrestling or contending against God's decision and providence is vain and worthless, nothing else remains for man but to be submissive, and to acknowledge his limitation by the fear of God; thus there are also many words which only increase yet more the multitude of vanities already existing in this world, for, because they are resultless, they bring no advantage for man. Rightly, Elster finds herein a hint pointing to the influence of the learning of the Jewish schools already existing in Koheleth's time. We know from Josephus that the problem of human freedom and of God's absoluteness was a point of controversy between opposing parties: the Sadducees so emphasized human freedom, that they not only excluded (Antt. xiii. 5. 9; Bell. ii. 8. 14) all divine predetermination, but also co-operation; the Pharisees, on the contrary supposed an interconnection between divine predetermination (&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;) and human freedom (Antt. xiii. 5. 9, xviii. 1. 3; Bell. ii. 8. 14). The Talm. affords us a glance at this controversy; but the statement in the Talm. (in Berachoth 33a, and elsewhere), which conditions all by the power of God manifesting itself in history, but defends the freedom of the religious-moral self-determination of man, may be regarded as a Pharisaic maxim. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/9.htm">Romans 9</a>, Paul places himself on this side; and the author of the Book of Koheleth would subscribe this passage as his testimony, for the "fear God" is the "kern und stern" kernel and star of his pessimistic book. </body></html>
