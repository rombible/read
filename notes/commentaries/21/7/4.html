It will do more good to go to a funeral than to a feast. We may lawfully go to both, as there is occasion; our Saviour both feasted at the wedding of his friend in Cana, and wept at the grave of his friend in Bethany. But, considering how apt we are to be vain and indulge the flesh, it is best to go to the house of mourning, to learn the end of man as to this world. Seriousness is better than mirth and jollity. That is best for us which is best for our souls, though it be unpleasing to sense. It is better to have our corruptions mortified by the rebuke of the wise, than to have them gratified by the song of fools. The laughter of a fool is soon gone, the end of his mirth is heaviness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>House of mourning ... house of mirth - These phrases acquire a forcible significance from the Eastern custom of prolonging both festive and mournful celebrations through several days. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/50-10.htm">Genesis 50:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/14-17.htm">Judges 14:17</a>. This verse indicates that a life of enjoyment, does not mean the abandonment of ourselves to pleasures, but the thankful and sober use of the beautiful things which God gives us. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3.

So Hebrew, for "good," equivalent to "cheerful" (Ec 11:9); but the parallel clause supports English Version.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The heart of the wise is in the house of morning, </span> even when their bodies are absent. They are constantly, or very frequently, meditating upon sad and serious firings, such as death and judgment, the vanity of this life, and the reality and eternity of the next, because they know that these thoughts, though they be not grateful to the sensual part, yet they are absolutely necessary, and highly profitable, and most comfortable in the end, which every wise man most regards. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The heart of fools is in the house of mirth; </span> their minds and affections are wholly set upon feasting and jollity, because, like fools and brutish creatures, they regard only their present delight, and mind not how dearly they must pay for them. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning,.... When his body is not; when it does not suit him to go thither in person, his mind is there, and his thoughts are employed on the useful subjects of the frailty and mortality of human nature, of death, a future judgment, and a world to come; which shows him to be a wise man, and concerned for the best things, even for his eternal happiness in another state; <p>but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth; where jovial company is, merry songs are sung, and the cup or glass passes briskly round, and all is gay and brilliant: here the fool desires to be oftener than he is, and when he cannot; which shows the folly of his mind, what a vain taste he has, and how thoughtless he is of a future state, and of his eternal welfare. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">4</span>. <span class="ital">The heart of the wise</span>] This follows as the natural sequel.

This is the natural conclusion from what was said in vers. 2, 3.

According to the usage of the tense, it would be more correct to translate: That which (at any time) has made its appearance, the name of which was long ago named, i.e., of which the What? and the How? were long ago determined, and, so to speak, formulated. This &#1513;&#1473; ... &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; does not stand parallel to &#1492;&#1497;&#1492; &#1499;&#1489;&#1512;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:10</a>; for the expression here does not refer to the sphere of that which is done, but of the predetermination. Accordingly, &#1488;&#1491;&#1501; ... &#1493;&#1504;&#1493; is also to be understood. Against the accents, inconsistently periodizing and losing sight of the comprehensiveness of &#1488;&#1491;&#1501; ... &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, Hitzig renders: "and it is known that, if one is a man, he cannot contend," etc., which is impossible for this reason, that &#1488;&#1491;&#1501; &#1492;&#1493;&#1488; cannot be a conditional clause enclosed within the sentence &#1497;&#1493;&#1499;&#1500; ... &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;. Obviously &#1493;&#1504;&#1493;&#1491;&#1506;, which in the sense of constat would be a useless waste of words, stands parallel to &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1493; &#1504;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488;, and signifies known, viz., previously known, as passive of &#1497;&#1491;&#1506;, in the sense of <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-7.htm">Zechariah 14:7</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-1.htm">Psalm 139:1</a>. Bullock rightly compares <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-18.htm">Acts 15:18</a>. After &#1497;&#1491;&#1506;, asher, like ki, which is more common, may signify "that," <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-26.htm">Ezekiel 20:26</a>; but neither "that he is a man" (Knobel, Vaih., Luzz., Hengst., Ginsb.), nor "that he is the man" (Ewald, Elst., Zckler), affords a consistent meaning. As mah after yada' means quid, so asher after it may mean quod  equals  that which (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/8-19.htm">Daniel 8:19</a>, although it does not at all stand in need of proof); and id quod homo est (we cannot render &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; without the expression of a definite conception of time) is intended to mean that the whole being of a man, whether of this one or that one, at all times and on all sides, is previously known; cf. to this pregnant substantival sentence, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:13</a>.

The verb, however, especially in the perf., is in the passage before us less appropriate. In &#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500; lie together the ideas of physical (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/43-32.htm">Genesis 43:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-17.htm">Deuteronomy 12:17</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-5.htm">Deuteronomy 16:5</a>, etc.) and moral inability. </body></html>
