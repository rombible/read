It shelters from the storms and scorching heat of trouble. Wealth will not lengthen out the natural life; but true wisdom will give spiritual life, and strengthen men for services under their sufferings. Let us look upon the disposal of our condition as the work of God, and at last all will appear to have been for the best. In acts of righteousness, be not carried into heats or passions, no, not by a zeal for God. Be not conceited of thine own abilities; nor find fault with every thing, nor busy thyself in other men's matters. Many who will not be wrought upon by the fear of God, and the dread of hell, will avoid sins which ruin their health and estate, and expose to public justice. But those that truly fear God, have but one end to serve, therefore act steadily. If we say we have not sinned, we deceive ourselves. Every true believer is ready to say, God be merciful to me a sinner. Forget not at the same time, that personal righteousness, walking in newness of life, is the only real evidence of an interest by faith in the righteousness of the Redeemer. Wisdom teaches us not to be quick in resenting affronts. Be not desirous to know what people say; if they speak well of thee, it will feed thy pride, if ill, it will stir up thy passion. See that thou approve thyself to God and thine own conscience, and then heed not what men say of thee; it is easier to pass by twenty affronts than to avenge one. When any harm is done to us, examine whether we have not done as bad to others.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Destroy thyself - The Septuagint and Vulgate render it: "be amazed."

The “ten mighty men” stand as a vague number, <span class="ital">certus pro incerto</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-7.htm" title="And your father has deceived me, and changed my wages ten times; but God suffered him not to hurt me.">Genesis 31:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-22.htm" title="Because all those men which have seen my glory, and my miracles, which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and have tempted me now these ten times, and have not listened to my voice;">Numbers 14:22</a>), and it is a fantastic line of interpretation to connect them with any definite political organization, Assyrian viceroys, Persian vice-satraps, Roman decurions, or the like. It is, however, an interesting coincidence, pointed out by Mr Tyler, that a city was defined by the Mishna (<span class="ital">Megila</span> i. 3) to be a town in which there were ten <span class="ital">Batlanim</span>, or men of leisure, to constitute a synagogue. A striking parallel is found in <a href="http://apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/37-14.htm" title="For a man's mind is sometime wont to tell him more than seven watchmen, that sit above in an high tower.">Sir 37:14</a>, “A man’s mind is wont to tell him more than seven men that sit upon a tower.” What is meant is generally that the wisdom that fears God is better than mere force, that moral strength is in the long run mightier than material. Wise statesmen may do more than generals.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wisdom strengtheneth the wise</span>. The moderation enjoined is the only true wisdom, which, indeed, is the most powerful incentive and support. "Wisdom proves itself stronger" (as the verb is put intransitively) "<span class="accented">to</span> the wise <span class="accented">man</span>." Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>," will help;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">confortuvit</span>, "hath strengthened." The spiritual and moral force of <span class="accented">the</span> wisdom grounded upon the fear of God is here signified, and is all the more insisted upon to counteract any erroneous impression conveyed by the caution against over-wisdom in ver. 16 (see note on ver. 17, at the end). <span class="cmt_word">More than ten mighty men which are in the city.</span> The number <span class="accented">ten indicates completeness</span>, <span class="accented">containing in it</span>self the whole arithmetical system, and used representatively for an indefinite multitude. Thus Job (Job 19:3) complains that his friends have reproached him ten times, and Elkanah asks his murmuring wife, "Am I not better to thee than ten sons?" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-8.htm">1 Samuel 1:8</a>). Delitzsch thinks that some definite political arrangement is referred to, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, the dynasties placed by Persian kings over conquered countries; and Tyler notes that in the Mishna a city is defined to be a place containing ten men of leisure; and we know that ten men were required for the establishment of a synagogue in any locality. The same idea was present in the Angle-Saxon arrangement of <span class="accented">tything</span> and <span class="accented">hundred</span>. The number, however, is probably used indefi<span class="accented">nitely</span> here as <span class="accented">seven in the</span> parallel passage of Ecclesiasticus (37:14), "<span class="accented">A</span> man's mind is sometime wont to tell him more than seven watchmen that sit above in a high tower." The sentence may be compared with <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-15.htm">Proverbs 10:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-22.htm">Proverbs 21:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-5.htm">Proverbs 24:5</a>. The word rendered "mighty men" (<span class="accented">shallitim</span>) <span class="accented">is</span> not necessarily a military <span class="accented">designation</span>; it is translated "ruler" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:5</a>, and "governor" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/42-6.htm">Genesis 42:6</a>.

The persons intended are not primarily men of valor in war, like David's heroes, but rulers of sagacity, prudent statesmen, whose moral force is far greater and more efficacious than any merely physical excellence (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/9-16.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:16</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>There now follows a proverb of devout submission to the providence of God, connecting itself with the contents of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:10</a> : "Consider the work of God: for who can make that straight which He hath made crooked! In the good day be of good cheer, and in the day of misfortune observe: God hath also made this equal to that, to the end that man need not experience anything (further) after his death." While &#1512;&#1488;&#1492;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:10</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-27.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:27</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-29.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:29</a>, is not different from &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/9-9.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:9</a> has the meaning of "enjoy," here the meaning of contemplative observation, mental seeing, connects itself both times with it. &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; before &#1502;&#1497; can as little mean quod, as asher, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/6-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:12</a>, before mi can mean quoniam. "Consider God's work" means: recognise in all that is done the government of God, which has its motive in this, that, as the question leads us to suppose, no creature is able (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/6-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:10</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:15</a>) to put right God's work in cases where it seems to contradict that which is right (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-3.htm">Job 8:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-12.htm">Job 34:12</a>), or to make straight that which He has made crooked (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/146-9.htm">Psalm 146:9</a>).<p>14a. The call here expressed is parallel to Sir. 14:14 (Fritz.): "Withdraw not thyself from a good day, and let not thyself lose participation in a right enjoyment." The &#1489; of &#1489;&#1468;&#1496;&#1493;&#1489;is, as little as that of &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1500;, the beth essentiae - it is not a designation of quality, but of condition: in good, i.e., cheerful mood. He who is, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-17.htm">Jeremiah 44:17</a>, personally tov, cheerful ( equals  tov lev), is betov (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/25-13.htm">Psalm 25:13</a>, also <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-13.htm">Job 21:13</a>). The reverse side of the call, 14ab, is of course not to be translated: and suffer or bear the bad day (Ewald, Heiligst.), for in this sense we use the expression &#1512;&#1506;&#1492; &#1512;&#1488;&#1492;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-17.htm">Jeremiah 44:17</a>, but not &#1489;&#1512;&#1506;&#1492; &#1512;&#1488;&#1492;, which much rather, <a href="http://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-13.htm">Obadiah 1:13</a>, means a malicious contemplation of the misfortune of a stranger, although once, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/21-16.htm">Genesis 21:16</a>, &#1489; &#1512;&#1488;&#1492; also occurs in the sense of a compassionate, sympathizing look, and, moreover, the parall. shows that &#1512;&#1506;&#1492; &#1489;&#1497;&#1493;&#1501; is not the obj., but the adv. designation of time. Also not: look to  equals  be attentive to (Salomon), or bear it patiently (Burger), for &#1512;&#1488;&#1492; cannot of itself have that meaning.<p>(Note: Similarly also Sohar (Par. (&#1502;&#1495;&#1493;&#1512;): &#1492;&#1493;&#1497; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;, i.e., cave et circumspice, viz., that thou mayest not incur the judgment which is pronounced.)<p>But: in the day of misfortune observe, i.e., perceive and reflect: God has also made (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/2-10.htm">Job 2:10</a>) the latter &#1500;&#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1514; corresponding, parallel, like to (cf. under <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/5-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:15</a>) the former.<p>So much the more difficult is the statement of the object of this mingling by God of good and evil in the life of man. It is translated: that man may find nothing behind him; this is literal, but it is meaningless. The meaning, according to most interpreters, is this: that man may investigate nothing that lies behind his present time, - thus, that belongs to the future; in other words: that man may never know what is before him. But aharav is never (not at <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/6-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:12</a>)  equals  in the future, lying out from the present of a man; but always  equals  after his present life. Accordingly, Ewald explains, and Heiligst. with him: that he may find nothing which, dying, he could take with him. But this rendering (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/5-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:14</a>) is here unsuitable. Better, Hitzig: because God wills it that man shall be rid of all things after his death, He puts evil into the period of his life, and lets it alternate with good, instead of visiting him therewith after his death. This explanation proceeds from a right interpretation of the words: idcirco ut (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-18.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:18</a>) non inveniat homo post se quidquam, scil. quod non expertus sit, but gives a meaning to the expression which the author would reject as unworthy of his conception of God. What is meant is much more this, that God causes man to experience good and evil that he may pass through the whole school of life, and when he departs hence that nothing may be outstanding (in arrears) which he has not experienced. </body></html>
