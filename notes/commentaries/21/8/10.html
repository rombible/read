Consequently some understand the verse, “The wicked receive an honourable burial, while those who have acted well are driven away from the holy place (viz. Jerusalem, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-2.htm" title="For they call themselves of the holy city, and stay themselves on the God of Israel; The LORD of hosts is his name.">Isaiah 48:2</a>; Neh. xi, 1, 18) and forgotten.” But we prefer to translate the word “so” the second time, as well as the first, where it occurs in the verse; and to take the meaning to be that the oppressor’s prosperity is but temporary, for soon comes death, burial, and forgetfulness of his honour.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:9-13 Solomon observed, that many a time one man rules over another to his hurt, and that prosperity hardens them in their wickedness.

Others interpret the verse: "I have seen wicked men buried; and (others) came into the world, and from the Holy place they went out of the world, and were forgotten in the city where they had done rightly" (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/7-9.htm">2 Kings 7:9</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ecclesiastes/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. the wicked&#8212;namely, rulers (Ec 8:9).<p>buried&#8212;with funeral pomp by man, though little meriting it (Jer 22:19); but this only formed the more awful contrast to their death, temporal and eternal, inflicted by God (Lu 16:22, 23).<p>come and gone from the place of the holy&#8212;went to and came from the place of judicature, where they sat as God's representatives (Ps 82:1-6), with pomp [Holden]. Weiss translates, "Buried and gone (utterly), even from the holy place they departed." As Joab, by Solomon's command, was sent to the grave from the "holy place" in the temple, which was not a sanctuary to murderers (Ex 21:14; 1Ki 2:28, 31). The use of the very word "bury" there makes this view likely; still "who had come and gone" may be retained. Joab came to the altar, but had to go from it; so the "wicked rulers" (Ec 8:9) (including high priests) came to, and went from, the temple, on occasions of solemn worship, but did not thereby escape their doom.<p>forgotten&#8212;(Pr 10:7).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ecclesiastes/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">And so, </span> in like manner, or such another vanity or disorder, I saw the wicked; wicked princes or rulers, as the next clause limits this. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Buried; </span> die quietly in their beds, and afterward be buried with state and pomp, whereas in truth they deserved an untimely end, and no other than the burial of an ass. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Who had come and gone; </span> who had administered public justice and government, which is frequently signified by the phrase of coming in and <span class="ital">going out before the people</span>, as <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/27-17.htm" title="Which may go out before them, and which may go in before them, and which may lead them out, and which may bring them in; that the congregation of the LORD be not as sheep which have no shepherd.">Numbers 27:17</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-2.htm" title="And he said to them, I am an hundred and twenty years old this day; I can no more go out and come in: also the LORD has said to me, You shall not go over this Jordan.">Deu 31:2</a></span>.

Or "truly" (k), verily, as the Targum, this is matter of fact; or "then I saw", as Aben Ezra and others, upon applying his heart to every work; or when be observed particularly wicked magistrates, he took notice that some of them continued in their power until death, and died in their beds, and were carried to their graves in great pomp and state, and interred in a very magnificent manner, when they deserved no burial at all, but, as King Jeconiah, to be buried with the burial of an ass; <p>who had come and gone from the place of the holy; which most understand of the same persons, of wicked magistrates buried, who kept their posts of honour and places of power and authority as long as they lived; and went to and came from the courts of judicature and tribunals of justice, in great state and splendour; where they presided as God's vicegerents, and therefore called the place of the holy, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/82-1.htm">Psalm 82:1</a>; or though they were sometimes deposed, yet they were restored again to their former dignity; or though they died and were buried, yet in a sense rose again in their children that succeeded them, so Aben Ezra: but it seems better to understated it of other persons, and render the, words thus, "and they came, and from the place of the holy", or "the holy place they walked" (l); that is, multitudes came to attend the funeral of such rich and mighty men, and walked after or followed the corpse; and ever, the priests and Levites from the temple made a part of the funeral procession, and walked in great solemnity from thence to the place of interment, which was usually without the city; <p>and they were forgotten in the city where they had done; all their evil deeds were forgotten, their acts of oppression and injustice, as if they had never been done by them. The Septuagint and Vulgate Latin versions are, "and they were praised in the city"; panegyrics upon them were written and rehearsed, monuments were erected to their honour, with large encomiums of them; and so it may be read by the change of a letter; and Jarchi says, do not read "forgotten", but "praised"; and so he says it is interpreted by their Rabbins. The whole may be considered in a very different view thus "but then I saw", &amp;c. such arbitrary rulers die, and laid in the grave, one after another, and their names have been buried in oblivion, and never remembered more in the city where they have exercised so much power and authority. The latter part of the text is by many understood of good men, and rendered thus, "and" or "but on the contrary they were forgotten in the city where they had done right" (m); their persons and their good deeds were remembered no more; but this seems contrary to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/112-6.htm">Psalm 112:6</a>. The Targum paraphrases the whole thus; <p>"and in truth I have seen sinners that are buried and destroyed out of the world, from the holy place where the righteous dwell, who go to be burned in hell; and they are forgotten among the inhabitants of the city; and as they have done, it is done to them;'' <p>this is also vanity; the pompous funeral of such wicked magistrates. <p>(k) "et vere", Vatablus.

In the burial of the wicked we have a parallel to the pregnant significance of the word in the parable of Dives and Lazarus, where “the rich man died and was buried” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-22.htm" title="And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried;">Luke 16:22</a>). This, from the Jewish standpoint, was the fit close of a prosperous and honoured life (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-14.htm" title="And they buried him in his own sepulchers, which he had made for himself in the city of David, and laid him in the bed which was filled with sweet odors and divers kinds of spices prepared by the apothecaries' are: and they made a very great burning for him.">2 Chronicles 16:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-23.htm" title="So Uzziah slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in the field of the burial which belonged to the kings; for they said, He is a leper: and Jotham his son reigned in his stead.">2 Chronicles 26:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-27.htm" title="And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city, even in Jerusalem: but they brought him not into the sepulchers of the kings of Israel: and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead.">2 Chronicles 28:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/22-18.htm" title="Therefore thus said the LORD concerning Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah; They shall not lament for him, saying, Ah my brother! or, Ah sister! they shall not lament for him, saying, Ah lord! or, Ah his glory!...">Jeremiah 22:18-19</a>). It implied a public and stately ceremonial. The words “they are gone” are not, as some have thought, equivalent to “they have entered into rest” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-2.htm" title="He shall enter into peace: they shall rest in their beds, each one walking in his uprightness.">Isaiah 57:2</a>), but, as in ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-4.htm" title="One generation passes away, and another generation comes: but the earth stays for ever.">Ecclesiastes 1:4</a>, are given as the way in which men speak respectfully of the dead as “gone” or “gathered to their fathers.” So the Latins said <span class="ital">Abiit ad plures</span>. So we speak, half-pityingly, of the dead, “Ah, he’s gone!”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The “holy place” may possibly mean the consecrated ground (I do not use the word in its modern technical sense) of sepulture, but there is no evidence that the term was ever so used among the Jews, and it is more natural to take it, as explained by the use of the same term in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-15.htm" title="When you therefore shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place, (whoever reads, let him understand:)">Matthew 24:15</a>, as referring to the Temple. The writer has in his mind those whose names had been cast out as evil, who had been, as it were, excommunicated, “put out of the synagogue” (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-22.htm" title="These words spoke his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess that he was Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.">John 9:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-42.htm" title="Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue:">John 12:42</a>), compelled to leave the Temple they had loved and worshipped in, departing with slow and sorrowing tread (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-6.htm" title="I am troubled; I am bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the day long.">Psalm 38:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-28.htm" title="I went mourning without the sun: I stood up, and I cried in the congregation.">Job 30:28</a>). And soon their place knows them no more. A generation rises up that knows them not, and they are forgotten in the very city where they had once been honoured. The reflection was, perhaps, the result of a personal experience. The <span class="bld">Debater</span> himself may have been so treated. The hypocrites whom he condemned (ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ecclesiastes/5-1.htm" title="Keep your foot when you go to the house of God, and be more ready to hear, than to give the sacrifice of fools: for they consider not that they do evil....">Ecclesiastes 5:1-7</a>) may have passed their sentence upon him as heretical, as some did afterwards upon his writings (see <span class="ital">Introduction</span>, ch. iii). If he was suspected of being in any way a follower of Epicurus, that would seem to them a sufficient ground for their anathemas. Epicureanism was, as it were, to the later Rabbis the deadliest of all heresies, and when they wanted to brand the believers in Christ with the last stigma of opprobrium, they called them not Christians, or even Nazarenes, but Epicureans. Something of this feeling may be traced, as has been shewn in the <span class="ital">Introduction</span>, ch. v., even in the <span class="ital">Wisdom of Solomon</span>. The main thought, so far as it refers only to the perishableness of human fame, has been common to the observers of the mutability of human things in all ages, and the <span class="bld">Debater</span> had himself dwelt on it (chaps. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-11.htm" title="There is no remembrance of former things; neither shall there be any remembrance of things that are to come with those that shall come after.">Ecclesiastes 1:11</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/6-4.htm" title="For he comes in with vanity, and departs in darkness, and his name shall be covered with darkness.">Ecclesiastes 6:4</a>). It finds, perhaps, its most striking echo in a book which has much in common with one aspect of Ecclesiastes, the <span class="ital">De Imitatione Christi</span> of à Kempis (B. i. 3). In substituting “such as acted rightly” for “where they had so done,” I follow the use of the word which the A. V. translates as “so” (<span class="ital">ken</span>); in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/7-9.htm" title="Then they said one to another, We do not well: this day is a day of good tidings, and we hold our peace: if we tarry till the morning light, some mischief will come on us: now therefore come, that we may go and tell the king's household.">2 Kings 7:9</a> (“we do not <span class="ital">well</span>”); <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/27-7.htm" title="The daughters of Zelophehad speak right: you shall surely give them a possession of an inheritance among their father's brothers; and you shall cause the inheritance of their father to pass to them.">Numbers 27:7</a> (“speak <span class="ital">right</span>”); <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-29.htm" title="And Moses said, You have spoken well, I will see your face again no more.">Exodus 10:29</a> (“thou hast spoken <span class="ital">well</span>”); <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/2-4.htm" title="And the woman took the two men, and hid them, and said thus, There came men to me, but I knew not from where they were:">Joshua 2:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-7.htm" title="The lips of the wise disperse knowledge: but the heart of the foolish does not so.">Proverbs 15:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-6.htm" title="We have heard of the pride of Moab; he is very proud: even of his haughtiness, and his pride, and his wrath: but his lies shall not be so.">Isaiah 16:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-6.htm" title="I listened and heard, but they spoke not aright: no man repented him of his wickedness, saying, What have I done? every one turned to his course, as the horse rushes into the battle.">Jeremiah 8:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-10.htm" title="For the land is full of adulterers; for because of swearing the land mourns; the pleasant places of the wilderness are dried up, and their course is evil, and their force is not right.">Jeremiah 23:10</a>, and other passages.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>I have given what seems to me (following wholly, or in part, on the lines of Ginsburg, Delitzsch, Knobel, and Bullock), the true meaning of this somewhat difficult verse, and it does not seem expedient, in a work of this nature, to enter at length into a discussion of the ten or twelve conflicting and complicated interpretations which seem to me, on various grounds, untenable. The chief points at issue are (1) whether the “departing from the place of the holy” belongs to “the wicked” of the first clause, or to those who are referred to in the second; (2) whether it describes that which was looked on as honourable or dishonourable, a stately funeral procession from temple or synagogue, or a penal and disgraceful expulsion; and (3) whether the latter are those who “act <span class="ital">so,” i.e.</span> as the wicked, or, as above, those who act rightly; and out of the varying combinations of the answers to these questions and of the various meanings attached to the phrases themselves, we get an almost indefinite number of theories as to the writer’s meaning.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">this is also vanity</span>] The recurrence of the <span class="ital">refrain</span> of the book at this point is interesting. It is precisely the survey of the moral anomalies of the world that originates and sustains the feeling so expressed.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10-15.</span> - Section 6. Koheleth is troubled by apparent anomalies in God's moral government. He notes <span class="accented">the prosperity of the godless and the misery of the righteous</span>, God's abstention and the seeming impunity of sinners make men incredulous of Providence; but God is just in reward and punishment, as the end will prove. Meantime, returning to his old maxim, he advises men patiently to acquiesce in things as they are, and to make the best of life. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And so</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span>); then, in like manner, under the same circumstances (<a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/4-16.htm">Esther 4:16</a>). The writer notes some apparent exceptions to the law of retribution of which he has just been speaking, the double particle at the beginning of the verse implying the connection with the preceding statement. <span class="cmt_word">I saw the wicked buried</span>. "The wicked" are especially the despots (ver. 9). These are carried to their graves with every outward honor and respect, like the rich man in the parable, who "died, and was buried" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-22.htm">Luke 16:22</a>). Such men, if they had received their due reward, far from having a pompous and magnificent funeral (which would befit only a good and honored life), would have been buried with the burial of an ass (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-19.htm">Isaiah 14:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-19.htm">Jeremiah 22:19</a>). So far the Authorized Version is undeniably correct. What follows is as certainly inaccurate as it is unintelligible. <span class="cmt_word">Who had come and gone from the place of the holy</span>; literally, <span class="accented">and they came, and from the place of the holy they went</span>. The first verb seems to mean, "they came to their rest," they died a natural death. The words, in themselves ambiguous, are explained by the connection in which they stand (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-2.htm">Isaiah 57:2</a>). Wright renders, "they came into being," and explains it with the following clause, "they went away from the holy place," as one generation coming and another going, in constant succession. But if, as we suppose, the paragraph applies to the despot, such an interpretation is unsuitable. Cox's idea, that oppressive despots "come again" in the persons of their wicked children, is wholly unsupported by the text. The verse admits and has received a dozen explanations differing more or less from one another. A good deal depends upon the manner in which the succeeding clause is translated, <span class="cmt_word">And they were forgotten in the city where they had so done.</span> As the particle rendered "so" (<span class="accented">ken</span>) may also mean "well," "rightly," we get the rendering, "even such as acted justly," and thus introduce a contrast between the fate of the wicked man who is honored with a sumptuous funeral, and that of the righteous whose name is cast out as pollution and soon forgotten. So Cheyne ('Job and Solomon') gives, "And in accordance with this I have seen ungodly men honored, and that too in the holy place (the temple, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/18-7.htm">Isaiah 18:7</a>), but those who had acted rightly had to depart, and were forgotten in the city." Against this interpretation, which has been adopted by many, it may reasonably be urged that in the same verse <span class="accented">ken</span> would hardly be used in two different senses, and that there is nothing in the text to indicate a change of subject. It seems to me that the whole verse applies to the wicked man. He dies in peace, he leaves the holy place; the evil that he has done is forgotten in the very city where he had so done, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> done wickedly. "The place of the holy" is Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-2.htm">Isaiah 48:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-53.htm">Matthew 27:53</a>) or the temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-15.htm">Matthew 24:15</a>). He is removed by death from that spot, the very name of which ought to have cried shame on his crimes and impiety. The expression seems to picture a great procession of priests and Levites accompanying the corpse of the deceased tyrant to the place of burial, while the final clause implies that no long lamentation was made over him, no monument erected to his memory (see the opposite of this in the treatment of Josiah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-24.htm">2 Chronicles 35:24, 25</a>). They who consider "the righteous " to be the subject of the last clauses see in the words, "from the holy place they departed," an intimation that these were excommunicated from the synagogue or temple, or banished from the promised land, on account of their opinions. I would translate the passage thus: <span class="accented">In like manner have I seen the wicked buried, and they came to their rest, and they went from the holy place, and were forgotten in the city where they had so</span> (wickedly) acted. The versions have followed various readings. Thus the Septuagint: "And then I saw the impious brought unto graves, and from the holy place; and they departed and were praised in the city, because they had so done;" Vulgate, "I have seen the impious buried, who also, while they still lived, were in the holy place, and were praised in the city as if men of just doings." Commenting oh this version, St. Gregory writes, "The very tranquility of the peace of the Church conceals many under the Christian name who are beset with the plague of their own wickedness. But if a light breath of persecution strikes them, it sweeps them away at once as chaff from the threshing-floor. But some persons wish to bear the mark of Christian calling, because, since the name of Christ has been exalted on high, nearly all persons now look to appear faithful, and from seeing others called thus, they are ashamed not to seem faithful themselves; but they neglect to be that which they beast of being called. For they assume the reality of inward excellence, to adorn their outward appearance; and they who stand before the heavenly Judge, naked from the unbelief of their heart, are clothed, in the sight of men, with a holy profession, at least in words" ('Moral.,' 25:26). <span class="cmt_word">This is also vanity</span>. The old refrain recurs to the writer as he thinks on the prosperity of the wicked, and the conclusions which infidels draw therefrom. Here is another example of the vanity that prevails in all earthly circumstances. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ecclesiastes/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"Inasmuch as the word of a king is powerful; and who can say to him: What doest thou?"

The adjectival impers. use of the noun shilton  equals  potestatem habens, is peculiar; in the Talm. and Midrash, shilton, like the Assyr. siltannu, <p>(Note: Vid., Fried. Delitzsch's Assyr.
