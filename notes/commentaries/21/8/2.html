The italics with which our translators fill <span class= "ital">the </span>gap no doubt give the right sense.

It is idle to quote the fact recorded by Josephus that Ptolemy Lagus secured the allegiance of his Jewish subjects by exacting an oath from them. This book has no connection with Egypt, and we need not look beyond the Bible for proof that an oath of vassalage was imposed on the Jews by their foreign masters, and that the breach of such an oath was regarded by the prophets as sin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-13.htm" title="And he also rebelled against king Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him swear by God: but he stiffened his neck, and hardened his heart from turning to the LORD God of Israel.">2Chronicles 36:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-13.htm" title="And has taken of the king's seed, and made a covenant with him, and has taken an oath of him: he has also taken the mighty of the land:">Ezekiel 17:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-16.htm" title="As I live, said the Lord GOD, surely in the place where the king dwells that made him king, whose oath he despised, and whose covenant he broke, even with him in the middle of Babylon he shall die.">Ezekiel 17:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-18.htm" title="Seeing he despised the oath by breaking the covenant, when, see, he had given his hand, and has done all these things, he shall not escape.">Ezekiel 17:18</a>).

Or, "to observe the mouth of the king" (w); what he says, and do according to it when it is agreeably to the law of God, and according to the laws of the kingdom, by which he is to govern; for kings are to be honoured, obeyed, and submitted to, in the lawful discharge of their office: and such counsel and advice as this is wholesome; and, being taken, contributes much, as to the honour of kings, so to the good of kingdoms and states, and to a man's own peace and comfort. Aben Ezra supplies it, <p>"I command thee, or I admonish thee;'' <p>for it may be either a charge, or art advice, respecting this and what follows. Jarchi supplies and paraphrases it thus, <p>"I have need, and am prepared, to observe the mouth (or keep the commandment) of the King of the world;'' <p>and so Alshech, <p>"observe that which goes out of the mouth of the King of the world.'' <p>And indeed, to understand it, not of an earthly king, but of the King of kings, as it is understood by other interpreters also, suits better with what is said of this King in the following verses; whose commandments, which are not grievous, but to be loved above fine gold, should be kept from a principle of love, without mercenary and selfish views, as they are delivered out by him, and to his glory; and such a charge as this should be attended to, and such counsel be received; <p>and that in regard of the oath of God; who has swore, that if his children forsake his law, and walk not in his statutes, he will visit their transgressions with a rod, and their iniquities with stripes; and therefore should be careful to keep his commandments, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-30.htm">Psalm 89:30</a>. Those who interpret this of an earthly king, by the oath of God understand the oath of allegiance and fidelity to him, taken in the name and presence of God, and therefore for conscience's sake should obey him: or render it, "but so that thou observest the manner of the oath of God" (x); or takest care to obey him; or do nothing in obedience to kings, which is contrary to the will of God; for God is to be obeyed rather than men, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-19.htm">Acts 4:19</a>; especially, and above all things, that is to be regarded. <p>(w)   "os regis observes", Tigurine version, Pagninus, Mercerus; "observa", Montanus, Vatablus, Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator, Cocceius, Gejerus, Rambachius.

We have therefore to supply a verb, <span class="ital">I, for my part, say</span>, which is practically equivalent to the English Version. The reference to the king is not without its bearing on the political surroundings of the writer and therefore on the date of the book. It is a natural inference from it that the writer, whether living in Palestine or elsewhere, was actually under a kingly government and not under that of a Satrap or Governor under the Persian King, and that the book must therefore have been written after the Persian rule had become a thing of the past. On this view Ptolemy Philopator has been suggested by one writer (Hitzig); Herod the Great by another (Grätz). See <span class="ital">Introduction</span>, ch. ii. The interpretation which explains the word as referring to the Divine King must be rejected as allegorising and unreal. The whole tone of the passage, it may be added, is against the Solomonic authorship of the book. The writer speaks as an observer studying the life of courts from without, not as a king asserting his own prerogative. Even on the assumption that <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/proverbs/25-2.htm" title="It is the glory of God to conceal a thing: but the honor of kings is to search out a matter....">Proverbs 25:2-6</a> came from the lips of Solomon, they are pitched in a very different key from that which we find here.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and that in regard of the oath of God</span>] It is not without significance as bearing on the question of the date and authorship of the book, that Josephus relates (<span class="ital">Ant.</span> xii. 1) that Ptolemy Soter, the Son of Lagus, carried into Egypt a large number of captives from Judæa and Samaria, and settled them at Alexandria, and knowing their scrupulous reverence for oaths, bound them by a solemn covenant to obey him and his successors. Such an oath the <span class="bld">Debater</span> bids men observe, as St Paul bade Christians obey the Emperor, “not only for wrath but also for conscience’ sake” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-5.htm" title="Why you must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake.">Romans 13:5</a>). Submission was the part of a wise man seeking for tranquillity, however bad the government might be. Of such covenants between a people and their king we have an example in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-24.htm" title="And all the princes, and the mighty men, and all the sons likewise of king David, submitted themselves to Solomon the king.">1 Chronicles 29:24</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I counsel thee to keep the king's commandment</span>. The pronoun <span class="accented">I</span> stands in the Hebrew without a verb (the Vulgate, <span class="accented">Ego os regis observo</span>, is not warranted by the grammar of the clause), and some take it as the answer to the question in ver. 1, "Who is like the wise man?" I, who am now teaching you. But it is better to regard the pronoun as emphasizing the following rule, supplying some verb (which may possibly have dropped out of the text), as, "Say, advise - I, for my part, whatever others may do or advise, I counsel thee;" the injunction being given in the imperative mood. The Septuagint and Syriac omit the pronoun altogether. The warning implies that the writer was living under kingly, and indeed despotic, government, and it was the part of a wise man to exhibit cheerful obedience. Ben-Sira observes that wise men teach us how to serve great men (Ecclus. 8:8). Such conduct is not only prudent, but really a religious- duty, even as the prophets counsel submission to Assyrian and Chaldean rulers (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-12.htm">Jeremiah 27:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-7.htm">Jeremiah 29:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-15.htm">Ezekiel 17:15</a>). The liege lord, being God's vicegerent, must be reverenced and obeyed. St. Paul, though he does not quote Ecclesiastes, may have had this passage in mind when he wrote (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1</a>), "Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God," etc.; and (ver. 5), "Ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience' sake." The "king" in the text is understood by some to mean God, but the following clause renders this improbable, and it is wisdom in its political aspect that is here regarded. <span class="cmt_word">And that in regard of the oath of God.</span> The <span class="accented">ray</span> is explicative; "in regard of," or "because of," as <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-18.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:18</a>. "The oath of God" is the oath of allegiance to the king, taken in the name of God, under his invocation (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-11.htm">Exodus 22:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-43.htm">1 Kings 2:43</a>). So we read (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-17.htm">2 Kings 11:17</a>) of a covenant between king and people, and people and king, in the time of Jehoiada; Nebuchadnezzar made Zedekiah swear by God to be his vassal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-13.htm">2 Chronicles 36:13</a>); and Josephus ('Ant.,' 12:1; 11:8. 3) relates that Ptolemy Soter, son of Lagus (following herein the example of Darius), exacted an oath from the Jews in Egypt to be true to him and his successors. We know that both Babylonian and Persian monarchs exacted an oath of fealty from conquered nations, making them swear by the gods whom they worshipped, the selection of deities being left to them, <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>But, on the other side, he can bear testimony to himself that he has honestly exercised himself in seeking to go to the foundation of things: "I turned myself, and my heart was there to discern, and to explore, and to seek wisdom, and the account, and to perceive wickedness as folly, and folly as madness." Regarding sabbothi, vid., under <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-20.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:20</a> : a turning is meant to the theme as given in what follows, which, as we have to suppose, was connected with a turning away form superficiality and frivolity. Almost all interpreters-as also the accentuation does - connect the two words &#1493;&#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497; &#1488;&#1504;&#1497;; but "I and my heart" is so unpsychological an expression, without example, that many Codd. (28 of Kennicott, 44 of de Rossi) read &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497; daer )i with my heart. The erasure of the vav (as e.g., Luther: "I applied my heart") would at the same time require the change of &#1505;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497; into &#1492;&#1505;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;. The Targ., Jerome, and the Venet. render the word &#1489;&#1500;&#1489;&#1497;; the lxx and Syr., on the contrary, &#1493;&#1500;&#1489;&#1497;; and this also is allowable, if we place the disjunctive on &#1488;&#1504;&#1497; and take &#1493;&#1500;&#1489;&#1497; as consequent: my heart, i.e., my striving and effort, was to discern (Aben Ezra, Herzf., Stuart), - a substantival clause instead of the verbal &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497; &#1493;&#1504;&#1514;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:13</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:17</a>.

Of the two accus. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-25.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:25</a> following &#1500;&#1491;&#1506;&#1514;, the first, as may be supposed, and as the determination in the second member shows, is that of the obj., the second that of the pred. (Ewald, 284b): that &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;, i.e., conduct separating from God and from the law of that which is good, is ke&#780;se&#780;l, Thorheit, folly (since, as Socrates also taught, all sinning rests on a false calculation, to the sinner's own injury); and that hassichluth, Narrheit, foolishness, stultitia (vid., sachal, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:17</a>), is to be thus translated (in contradistinction to &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1500;), i.e., an intellectual and moral obtuseness, living for the day, rising up into foolery, not different from holeloth, fury, madness, and thus like a physical malady, under which men are out of themselves, rage, and are mad. Koheleth's striving after wisdom thus, at least is the second instance (&#1493;&#1500;&#1491;&#1506;&#1514;), with a renunciation of the transcendental, went towards a practical end. And now he expresses by &#1493;&#1502;&#1493;&#1510;&#1488; one of the experiences he had reached in this way of research. How much value he attaches to this experience is evident from the long preface, by means of which it is as it were distilled. We see him there on the way to wisdom, to metaphysical wisdom, if we may so speak - it remains as far off from him as he seeks to come near to it. We then see him, yet not renouncing the effort after wisdom, on the way toward practical wisdom, which exercises itself in searching into the good and the bad; and that which has presented itself to him as the bitterest of the bitter is - a woman. </body></html>
