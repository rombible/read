"Who" is to be accounted "equal to the wise man? &#8230; Who (like him) knoweth the interpretation" of God's providences (for example, Ec 7:8, 13, 14), and God's word (for example, see on [665]Ec 7:29; Pr 1:6)?<p>face to shine&#8212;(Ec 7:14; Ac 6:15).

Maurer translates, "The shining (brightness) of his face is doubled," arguing that the Hebrew noun for "boldness" is never used in a bad sense (Pr 4:18).

Who is as the first man, that was made upright, and was a wise man? not one of his sons. Or who is as the wise man, meaning himself? no man; he was the wisest of men; and yet he could not find out wisdom, and the reason of things, and the wickedness of folly, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-25.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:25</a>; how therefore should any other man? what can the man do that comes after the king? Or who is like to a wise man, to he compared to him for honour and dignity? none; not those of the highest birth and blood, of the greatest wealth and riches, or in the highest places of power and authority; a wise man is above them, they being without wisdom; and especially such as are wise to salvation; these are the excellent in the earth, and the most worthy among men. Or who is a truly wise man? is there really such a person in the world, that has got to the perfection of wisdom? not one; and very few they are that can, in a true and proper sense, be called wise men. The Targum is, <p>"who is a wise man, that can stand against the wisdom of the Lord?'' <p>and who knoweth the interpretation of a thing? or "a word" (q)? the word of God, which is not of private interpretation? none know it rightly, but such who have the Spirit of God, the enditer of the word: Christ is the interpreter, one among a thousand; and, next to him are those who have his mind, and rightly divide the word of truth. The Targum is, <p>"and to know the interpretation of the words in the prophets:'' <p>this may be understood of the solution of any difficulties in things natural or civil; and of the interpretation of any of the works of God, either in nature or providence, as well as of his word; and he is a wise man, that not only has wisdom in himself, but is able to teach others, and make them wise; can solve doubts, remove difficulties, interpret nature, the works and word of God. Aben Ezra repeats the note of similitude from the former clause, and so it may be rendered, "Who is as he that knows the interpretation of a thing", or "word?" such an one as Solomon was, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-6.htm">Proverbs 1:6</a>; <p>a man's wisdom maketh his face to shine: as Moses, when he came down from the mount, full fraught with the knowledge of the will of God, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-29.htm">Exodus 34:29</a>; and as Stephen, whose wisdom and spirit, by which he spoke, were irresistible, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-10.htm">Acts 6:10</a>; wisdom, which discovers itself in a man's words and actions, gives comeliness to his person, makes him look amiable and lovely in the eyes of others: or, it "enlightens his face" (r); by it he is able to see the difference between truth and falsehood, and what is to be done and not done; what way he should walk in, and what he should shun and avoid; <p>and the boldness of his face shall be changed; the ferocity and austerity of his countenance, the impudence and inhumanity that appeared in him before, through his wisdom and knowledge, are changed into meekness, gentleness, and humanity; of an impudent, fierce, and badly behaved man, he becomes meek, modest, affable, and humane; this effect natural wisdom and knowledge has on men (s); and much more spiritual and evangelical wisdom, which comes from above, and is first pure, then peaceable and gentle, <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/3-17.htm">James 3:17</a>. Some read it, "the strength of his face shall be doubled", or "renewed" (t); he shall be changed into the same image, from glory to glory; his spiritual strength shall be renewed, and his light and knowledge increase yet more and more, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-18.htm">2 Corinthians 3:18</a>.

Something there was in what he is about to add, to be read between the lines. It required a á man to “know the interpretation” (the noun is Chaldaean and is found, with a slight variation, as the prominent word in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-5.htm" title="I saw a dream which made me afraid, and the thoughts on my bed and the visions of my head troubled me.">Daniel 4:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-7.htm" title="Then came in the magicians, the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers: and I told the dream before them; but they did not make known to me the interpretation thereof.">Daniel 4:7</a>) of the “thing” or better, “of the <span class="bld">word.</span>” We find the probable explanation of this suggestive question in the fact that the writer veils a protest against despotism in the garb of the maxims of servility.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">a man’s wisdom maketh his face to shine</span>] Literally, <span class="bld">illuminates his face.</span> The word paints with a wonderful vividness the almost trans-figuring effect of the “sweetness and light” of a serene wisdom, or of the joy that brightens a man’s countenance when he utters his <span class="ital">Eureka</span> over the solution of a long-pondered problem.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the boldness of his face shall be changed</span>] Literally, <span class="bld">the strength of face</span>, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> its <span class="bld">sternness.</span> The words have been very variously translated, (1) as in the LXX. “his shameless face shall be hated,” (2) as by Ewald “the brightness of his countenance shall be doubled.” There is no ground, however, for rejecting the Authorised Version. The “boldness of the face” is, as in the “fierce countenance” of <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-50.htm" title="A nation of fierce countenance, which shall not regard the person of the old, nor show favor to the young:">Deuteronomy 28:50</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-23.htm" title="And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors are come to the full, a king of fierce countenance, and understanding dark sentences, shall stand up.">Daniel 8:23</a>, the “impudent face” of <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-13.htm" title="So she caught him, and kissed him, and with an impudent face said to him,">Proverbs 7:13</a>, the coarse ferocity of ignorance, and this is transformed by culture. The maxim is like that of the familiar lines of Ovid,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“Adde quod ingenuas didicisse fideliter artes,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Emollit mores nec sinit esse feros.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“To learn in truth the nobler arts of life,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Makes manners gentle, rescues them from strife.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Epp. ex Ponto</span> ii. 9. 47.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-9.</span> - Section 5. There is no use in repining or rebelling; <span class="accented">true wisdom counsels obedience to the powers that be</span>, <span class="accented">and submission to the dispensations of Providence</span>. However oppressive a tyrant may prove sure retribution awaits him. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who is as the wise man?</span> <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. Who is like, equal to, the wise man? The somewhat sudden question occurs naturally after the results of the search for wisdom mentioned at the end of the last chapter. The thought is not, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/14-9.htm">Hosea 14:9</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-12.htm">Jeremiah 9:12</a>, "Who is wise?" but - No one Call be compared with a wise man; he has no compeer. <span class="cmt_word">And who</span> [like him] <span class="cmt_word">knoweth the interpretation of a thing?</span> Who, so well as the wise man, understands the proper relation of circumstances, sees into human affairs and God's dispensations in the case of nations and individuals? Such a one takes the right view of life. The word <span class="accented">pesher</span>, "interpretation," occurs (<span class="accented">peshar</span>) continually in Daniel, and nowhere else and is Chaldaic. The Vulgate, which connects these two clauses with <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Ecclesiastes 7</a>, renders, <span class="accented">Quis cognovit solutionem verbi?</span> So the Septuagint. The "word" or "saying" may be the question proposed above Concerning the happy life, or the proverb that immediately follows. But <span class="accented">dabar</span> is better rendered "thing," as <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:8</a>. <span class="cmt_word">A man's wisdom maketh his face to shine</span>; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>, "will enlighten, illuminate." The serene light within makes itself visible in the outward expression; the man is contented arid cheerful, and shows this in his look and bearing. This is an additional praise of wisdom. Thus Ecclus. 13:25, 26, "The heart of man changeth his countenance, whether it be for good or evil. A cheerful countenance is a token of a heart that is in prosperity." Cicero, 'De Orat.,' 3:57, "Omnes enim motus animi suum quemdam a natura habet vultum et sonum et gestum; corpusque totum homiuis et ejus omnis vultus omnesque voces, ut nervi in fidibus, ita sonant, ut motu animi quoque sunt pulsae." <span class="cmt_word">And the boldness of his face shall be changed</span>. The word translated "boldness" is <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b9;&#x5d6;</span>, which means properly "strength," and is best taken of the coarseness and impudence engendered by ignorance and want of culture. Wisdom, when it fills the heart, changes the countenance to an open genial look, which wins confidence and love. Delitzsch refers to the well-worn lines of Ovid, 'Epist.,' 2:9. 47 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Adde, quod ingenuas didicisse fideliter artes<br />Emollit mores, nec sinit esse feros."</span> The Septuagint, "And a man shameless in countenance will be hated," shows an alteration in the text, and does not agree with the context. Vulgate, <span class="accented">Et potentissimus faciem illius commutabit</span>, "And the Almighty will change his face," where again the text is not accurately followed. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"For that which is, is far off, and deep, - yes, deep; who can reach it?" Knobel, Hitz., Vaih., and Bullock translate: for what is remote and deep, deep, who can find it? i.e., investigate it; but mah-shehayah is everywhere an idea by itself, and means either id quod fuit, or id quod exstitit, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-9.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/6-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:10</a>; in the former sense it is the contrast of mah-she&#780;ihye&#780;h, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:7</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:14</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-22.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:22</a>; in the latter, it is the contrast of that which does not exist, because it has not come into existence. In this way it is also not to be translated: For it is far off what it (wisdom) is (Zckl.) [ equals  what wisdom is lies far off from human knowledge], or: what it is (the essence of wisdom), is far off (Elst.) - which would be expressed by the words &#1502;&#1492;&#1470;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1492;&#1497;&#1488;. And if &#1502;&#1492;&#1470;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492; is an idea complete in itself, it is evidently not that which is past that is meant (thus e.g., Rosenm. quod ante aderat), for that is a limitation of the obj. of knowledge, which is unsuitable here, but that which has come into existence. Rightly, Hengst.: that which has being, for wisdom is &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c2;, Wisd. 7:17. He compares <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/3-11.htm">Judges 3:11</a>, "the work which God does," and <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:17</a>, "the work which is done under the sun." What Koheleth there says of the totality of the historical, he here says of the world of things: this (in its essence and its grounds) remains far off from man; it is for him, and also in itself and for all creatures, far too deep (&#1506;&#1502;&#1511; &#1506;&#1502;&#1511;, the ancient expression for the superlative): Who can intelligibly reach (&#1497;&#1502;&#1509;, from &#1502;&#1510;&#1488;, assequi, in an intellectual sense, as at <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:17</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/11-7.htm">Job 11:7</a>) it (this all of being)? The author appears in the book as a teacher of wisdom, and emphatically here makes confession of the limitation of his wisdom; for the consciousness of this limitation comes over him in the midst of his teaching. </body></html>
