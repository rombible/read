Solomon commended joy, and holy security of mind, arising from confidence in God, because a man has no better thing under the sun, though a good man has much better things above the sun, than soberly and thankfully to use the things of this life according to his rank. He would not have us try to give a reason for what God does. But, leaving the Lord to clear up all difficulties in his own time, we may cheerfully enjoy the comforts, and bear up under the trials of life; while peace of conscience and joy in the Holy Ghost will abide in us through all outward changes, and when flesh and heart shall fail.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ecclesiastes/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>These verses supplement <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:15</a> with the reflection that the man who goes beyond that limited sphere within which he can labor and be contented, and investigates the whole work of God, will find that his finite intelligence cannot grasp it.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-16.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:16</a><p>Business - Or, "travail" <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:10</a>.

Reply to Ec 8:14, 15. When I applied myself to observe man's toils after happiness (some of them so incessant as not to allow sufficient time for "sleep"), then (Ec 8:17, the apodosis) I saw that man cannot find out (the reason of) God's inscrutable dealings with the "just" and with the "wicked" here (Ec 8:14; Ec 3:11; Job 5:9; Ro 11:33); his duty is to acquiesce in them as good, because they are God's, though he sees not all the reasons for them (Ps 73:16). It is enough to know "the righteous are in God's hand" (Ec 9:1). "Over wise" (Ec 7:16); that is, Speculations above what is written are vain.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ecclesiastes/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Then, </span> Heb. <span class="ital">and</span>, or <span class="ital">moreover</span>, I beheld all the work of God; I considered the counsels and ways of God, and the various methods of his providence towards good and bad men, and the reasons of them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">A man cannot find out; </span> no man, though never so wise, and inquisitive, and studious, as it follows, is able fully and perfectly to understand these things; and therefore it is best for man not to perplex himself with endless and fruitless inquiries about these matters, but quietly to submit to God’s will and providence, and to live in the fear of God, and the comfortable enjoyment of his blessings. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/ecclesiastes/8.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then I beheld all the work of God,....

The English reader may be reminded of Bishop Butler’s Sermon (xv.) on the “Ignorance of Man,” of which these verses supply the text. What is noticeable here is that the ignorance (we may use a modern term and say the Agnosticism) is not atheistic. That which the seeker contemplates he recognises as the work of God. Before that work, the wise man bows in reverence with the confession that it lies beyond him. The Finite cannot grasp the Infinite. We may compare Hooker’s noble words “Dangerous it were for the feeble brain of man to wade far into the doings of the Most High; whom although to know be life, and joy to make mention of His name; yet our soundest knowledge is to know that we know Him not as indeed He is, neither can know Him, and our safest eloquence concerning Him is our silence, when we confess without confession that His glory is inexplicable, His greatness above our capacity and reach. He is above, and we upon earth; therefore it behoveth our words to be wary and few” (<span class="ital">Eccl. Pol.</span> i. 2, § 3).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then I beheld all the work of God</span>.

The interpreters waver between "how much so ever," and "wherefore a man labors." The latter seems to be best. <span class="cmt_word">Though a wise man think to know it, yet shall he not be able to find it.</span> It is the part of wisdom to determine to know all that can be known; but the resolution is baffled here (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-23.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:23</a>). The two verses, with their repetitions and tautologous expressions, seem to denote perturbation of mind in the author and his sense of the gravity of his assertions. He is overwhelmed with the thought of the inscrutability of God's judgments, while he is forced to face the facts. An exquisite commentary on this passage is found in Hooker, 'Eccl. Pol.,' 1:2. &sect; 2, quoted by Plumptre; and in Bishop Butler's sermon 'On the Ignorance of Man,' where we read, "From it [the knowledge of our ignorance] we may learn with what temper of mind a man ought to inquire into the subject of religion, namely, with what expectation of finding difficulties, and with a disposition to take up and rest satisfied with any evidence whatever which is real. A man should beforehand expect things mysterious, and such as he will not be able thoroughly to comprehend or go to the bottom of.... Our ignorance is the proper answer to many things which are called objections  against religion, particularly to those which arise from the appearance of evil and irregularity in the constitution of nature and the government of the world Since the constitution of nature and the methods and designs of Providence in the government of the world are above our comprehension, we should acquiesce in and rest satisfied with our ignorance, turn our thoughts from that which is above and beyond us, and apply ourselves to that which is level to our capacities, and which is our real business and concern .... Lastly, let us adore that infinite wisdom and power and goodness which is above our comprehension (Ecclus. 1:6). The conclusion is that in all lowliness of mind we set lightly by ourselves; that we form our temper to an implicit submission to the Divine Majesty, beget within ourselves an absolute resignation to all the methods of his providence in his dealings with the children of men; that in the deepest humility of our souls we prostrate ourselves before him, and join in that celestial song, 'Great and marvelous are thy works, Lord God Almighty; just and true are thy ways, thou King of saints. Who shall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy Name?' (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/15-3.htm">Revelation 15:3, 4</a>) (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-33.htm">Romans 11:33</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ecclesiastes/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"Because judgment against the work of the wicked man is not speedily executed, for this reason the heart of the children of men is full within them, to this, that they do evil." The clause with asher is connected first with the foregoing &#1470;&#1502;&#1490; havel: thus vain, after the nature of a perverted world (inversus ordo) events go on, because ... (asher, as at <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-3.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/6-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:12</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-24.htm">Deuteronomy 3:24</a>); but the following clause with 'al-ken makes this clause with asher reflex. an antecedent of itself (asher  equals  'al-asher) - originally it is not meant as an antecedent.&#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1490;&#1501; <p>(Note: With &#1490; raph. in H. P. and the older edd., as also <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/1-20.htm">Esther 1:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/3-16.htm">Daniel 3:16</a>. Thus also the punctuator Jekuthil in his En hakore to <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/1-20.htm">Esther 1:20</a>.)<p>(here to be written after &#1504;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492;, with &#1508; raph., and, besides, also with &#1490; raph.), in the post-exilian books, is the Persian paigam, Armen. patgam, which is derived from the ancient Pers. paiti-gama: "Something that has happened, tidings, news." The Heb. has adopted the word in the general sense of "sentence;" in the passage before us it signifies the saying or sentence of the judge, as the Pers. word, like the Arab. nabazn, is used principally of the sayings of a prophet (who is called peigha&#770;m-bar). Zirkel regards it as the Greek &#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;; but thus, also, the words &#1488;&#1494;&#1502;&#1500;, &#1488;&#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503; strangely agree in sound with &#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b7; &#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, without being borrowed from the Greek. The long a of the word is, as Elst. shows, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-20.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:20</a>, invariable; also here &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1490;&#1501; is the constr. To point &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1490;&#1501;, with Heiligst. and Burg., is thus unwarrantable. It is more remarkable that the word is construed fem. instead of mas. For since &#1488;&#1497;&#1503; is construed <p>(Note: Ginsburg points in favour of &#1504;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; as fin. to <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/3-2.htm">Exodus 3:2</a>, but there &#1488;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500; is particip.; to <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-5.htm">Jeremiah 38:5</a>, but there &#1497;&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500; (if it is not to be read &#1497;&#1499;&#1493;&#1500;) represents an attributive clause; and to <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/35-15.htm">Job 35:15</a>, but there the word is rightly pointed &#1488;&#1497;&#1503;, not &#1488;&#1497;&#1503;; and this, like the vulg. Arab. laysa, is used as an emphatic &#1500;&#1488;.)<p>neither in the bibl. nor in the Mishnic style with the finite of the verb, &#1504;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; is not the 3rd pret., but the particip. It is not, however, necessary, with Hitz., to read &#1504;&#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492;. The foreign word, like the (Arab.) firdans, &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, admits of use in the double gend. (Ewald, 174g); but it is also possible that the fem. &#1504;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; is per. attract. occasioned by &#1492;&#1512;&#1506;&#1492;, as Kimchi, Michlol 10a, supposes (cf. besides, under <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:15</a>). &#1502;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; is const. governed by phithgam, and hara'ah is thus obj. gen. The lxx, Syr., and Jerome read &#1502;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;, which would be possible only if phithgam min - after the analogy of the Heb.-Aram. phrase, niphra' ('ithpera') min, to take one's due of any one, i.e., to take vengeance on him, to punish him - could mean the full execution of punishment on any one; but it means here, as Jerome rightly translates, sententia; impossible, however, with me'ose hara'ah, sententia contra malos. Hengst. supposes that not only the traditional text, but also the accentuation, is correct, for he construes: because a sentence (of the heavenly Judge) is not executed, the work of wickedness is haste, i.e., speedy. Thus also Dachselt in the Biblia accentuata. Mercerus, on the contrary, remarks that the accents are not in the first instance marks of interpunction, but of cantillation. In fact, genit. word-connections do not exclude the keeping them asunder by distinctives such as Pashta and Tiphcha, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-2.htm">Isaiah 10:2</a>, and also Zakeph, as e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/1-4.htm">Esther 1:4</a>. The lxx well renders: "Therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully persuaded in them to do evil;" for which Jerome, freely, after Symm.: absque timore ullo filii hominum perpetrant mala. The heart of one becomes full to do anything, is  equals  it acquires full courage thereto (Luzzatto, 590: gli blast l'animo); cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/7-5.htm">Esther 7:5</a> : "Where is he who has his heart filled to do?" (thus rightly, Keil), i.e., whom it has encourage to so bold an undertaking. &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1501; in itself unnecessarily heightens the expression of the inwardness of the destructive work (vid., Psychol. p. 151f.). The sentence of punishment does not take effect mehera, hastily (adv. accus. for bimherah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:12</a>), therefore men are secure, and they give themselves with full, i.e., with fearless and shameless, boldness to the practice of evil. The author confirms this further, but not without expressing his own conviction that there is a righteous requital which contradicts this appearance. </body></html>
