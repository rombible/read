Notwithstanding their now worshipping the rising sun, the heir-apparent, I reflected that "there were no bounds, no stability (2Sa 15:6; 20:1), no check on the love of innovation, of all that have been before them," that is, the past generation; so<p>also they that come after&#8212;that is, the next generation,<p>shall not rejoice in him&#8212;namely, Rehoboam. The parallel, "shall not rejoice," fixes the sense of "no bounds," no permanent adherence, though now men rejoice in him.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ecclesiastes/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">There is no end of all the people:</span> the sense is either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

Or rather, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. Before the present generation of subjects, who earnestly desired and promoted the change of government here expressed; for these are evidently opposed to <span class="ital">them that come after</span>, which all interpreters understand of the people, not of the kings. And so here are three generations of people noted, the authors of the present change, and their parents, and their children, and all are observed to have the same inclinations in these matters. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Shall not rejoice in him; </span> they shall be as weary of the successor, though a wise and worthy prince, as their parents were of his foolish predecessor; the reason whereof is partly from that itch of novelty and curiosity which is natural and common to mankind, and partly from their vain and foolish hopes of advantage from such changes. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/ecclesiastes/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>There is no end of all the people, even of all that have been before them,.... Before the present generation, the living that walked under the sun; a vast number they were that lived before them, and they were of the same restless temper and disposition; changeable in their affection and behaviour towards their governors; no end of their number, nor any stable affection for, nor settled satisfaction in, their rulers; but this itch of novelty, of having new princes over them, went from age to age, from generation to generation. Some understand this of the king and his son, the predecessor and successor, and of those that went before them; and of their behaviour to the kings that reigned before them; the people have not their end or satisfaction in their governors, but are restless: which comes to the same sense; <p>they also that come after shall not rejoice in him; that come after the present generation, and after both the reigning prince, and even after his successor; they will not rejoice long in him that shall be upon the throne after them, any more than the present subjects of the old king, or those that now pay their court to the heir apparent; they will be so far from rejoicing in him, that they will loath and despise him, and wish him dead or dethroned, and another in his room. <p>Surely this also is vanity and vexation of spirit; to a king, to see himself thus used by his subjects; for a short time extolled and praised, and then despised and forsaken. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/ecclesiastes/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><i>There is</i> no <span class="cverse3">{l}</span> end of all the people, <i>even</i> of all that have been before them: they also that come after shall not rejoice in him.

The people are before their king, or rather, <span class="bld">he is before them all</span>, going in and out before them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-16.htm" title="But all Israel and Judah loved David, because he went out and came in before them.">1 Samuel 18:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-10.htm" title="Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people: for who can judge this your people, that is so great?">2 Chronicles 1:10</a>), ruling and guiding. The reference of the words to the Messianic child of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-14.htm" title="Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.">Isaiah 7:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-6.htm" title="For to us a child is born, to us a son is given: and the government shall be on his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.">Isaiah 9:6</a>, falls under the same category as the interpretation which finds the doctrine of the Trinity in the “threefold cord” of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-12.htm" title="And if one prevail against him, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.">Ecclesiastes 4:12</a>. It is true of both that they may be devout applications of the words, but are in no sense explanatory of their meaning.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">they also that come after</span>] This is added as the crowning stroke of the irony of history. The reign which begins so brightly shares the inevitable doom, and ends in darkness, and murmuring and failure. “<span class="ital">Il n’y a pas d’homme necessaire</span>,” and the popular hero of the hour finds himself slighted even in life, and is forgotten by the next generation. The glory of the most popular and successful king shares the common doom and is but as a <span class="bld">feeding upon wind.</span> Here again the statement is so wide in its generalization that it is not easy to fix on any historical identification. David, Solomon himself, Jeroboam, Cyrus, Antiochus the Great, Herod have been suggested by the ingenuity of commentators.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - There is <span class="cmt_word">no end of all the people, even of all that have been before them.</span> The paragraph plainly is carrying on the description of the popular enthusiasm for the new favorite. The Authorized Version completely obscures this meaning. It is better to translate, <span class="accented">Numberless were the people</span>, <span class="accented">all</span>, <span class="accented">at whose head he stood</span>. Koheleth places himself in the position of a spectator, and marks how numerous are the adherents who flock around the youthful aspirant. "Nullus finis omni populo, omnibus, quibus praefuit" (Gesenius, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Volck). Yet his popularity was not lasting and his influence was not permanent. <span class="cmt_word">They also that come after shall not rejoice in him</span>. In spite of his cleverness, and notwithstanding the favor with which he is now regarded, those of a later generation shall flout his pretensions and forget his benefits. If we still continue the allusion to Joseph, we may see here in this last clause a reference to the change that supervened when another king arose who knew him not (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/1-8.htm">Exodus 1:8</a>), and who, oblivious of the services of this great benefactor, heavily oppressed the Israelites. This experience leads to the same result; it is all <span class="cmt_word">vanity and vexation of spirit.</span>  <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ecclesiastes/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"For if they fall, the one can raise up his fellow: but woe to the one who falleth, and there is not a second there to lift him up."
