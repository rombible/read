But the grace and mercy of God, and the free gift of righteousness and salvation, are through Jesus Christ, as man: yet the Lord from heaven has brought the multitude of believers into a more safe and exalted state than that from which they fell in Adam. This free gift did not place them anew in a state of trial, but fixed them in a state of justification, as Adam would have been placed, had he stood. Notwithstanding the differences, there is a striking similarity. As by the offence of one, sin and death prevailed to the condemnation of all men, so by the righteousness of one, grace prevailed to the justification of all related to Christ by faith. Through the grace of God, the gift by grace has abounded to many through Christ; yet multitudes choose to remain under the dominion of sin and death, rather than to apply for the blessings of the reign of grace. But Christ will in nowise cast out any who are willing to come to him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/romans/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And not ... - This is the second point in which the effects of the work of Christ differ from the sin of Adam The first part <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-15.htm">Romans 5:15</a> was, that the evil consequences flowed from the sin of one man, Adam; and that the benefits flowed from the work of one man, Jesus Christ. The point in this verse is, that the evil consequences flowed from one crime, one act of guilt; but that the favors had respect to many acts of guilt. The effects of Adam's sin, whatever they were, pertained to the one sin; the effects of the work of Christ, to many sins.<p>By one that sinned - &#x3b4;&#x3b9; &#787; &#x3b5;&#788;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  di' henos he&#772;marte&#772;santos. By means of one (man) sinning; evidently meaning by one offence, or by one act of sin. So the Vulgate, and many manuscripts. And the connection shows that this is the sense.<p>The gift - The benefits resulting from the work of Christ.<p>The judgment - The sentence; the declared penalty. The word expresses properly the sentence which is passed by a judge. Here it means the sentence which God passed, as a judge, on Adam for the one offence, involving himself and his posterity in ruin, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-17.htm">Genesis 2:17</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/3-17.htm">Genesis 3:17-19</a>.<p>Was by one - By one offence; or one act of sin.<p>Unto condemnation - Producing condemnation; or involving in condemnation. It is proved by this, that the effect of the sin of Adam was to involve the race in condemnation, or to secure this as a result that all mankind would be under the condemning sentence of the Law, and be transgressors. But in what way it would have this effect, the apostle does not state. He does not intimate that his sin would be imputed to them; or that they would be held to be personally guilty for it. He speaks of a broad, everywhere perceptible fact, that the effect of that sin had been somehow to overwhelm the race in condemnation. In what mode this was done is a fair subject of inquiry; but the apostle does not attempt to explain it.<p>The free gift - The unmerited favor, by the work of Christ.<p>Is of many offences - In relation to many sins. It differs thus from the condemnation. That had respect to one offence; this has respect to many crimes. Grace therefore abounds.<p>Unto justification - Note, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-24.htm">Romans 3:24</a>. The work of Christ is designed to have reference to many offences, so as to produce pardon or justification in regard to them all. But the apostle here does not intimate how this is done. He simply states the fact, without attempting in this place to explain it; and as we know that that work does not produce its effect to justify without some act on the part of the individual, are we not hence, led to conclude the same respecting the condemnation for the sin of Adam? As the work of Christ does not benefit the race unless it is embraced, so does not the reasoning of the apostle imply, that the deed of Adam does not involve in criminality and ill-desert unless there be some voluntary act on the part of each individual? However this may be, it is certain that the apostle has in neither case here explained the mode in which it is done. He has simply stated the fact, a fact which he did not seem to consider himself called on to explain. Neither has he affirmed that in the two cases the mode is the same. On the contrary, it is strongly implied that it is not the same, for the leading object here is to present, not an entire resemblance, but a strong contrast between the effects of the sin of Adam and the work of Christ. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/romans/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16. And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift&#8212;"Another point of contrast may be mentioned."<p>for the judgment&#8212;"sentence."<p>was by one&#8212;rather, "was of one," meaning not "one man," but, as appears from the next clause, "one offense."<p>to condemnation, but the free gift&#8212;"gift of grace."<p>is of many offences unto justification&#8212;a glorious point of contrast. "The condemnation by Adam was for one sin; but the justification by Christ is an absolution not only from the guilt of that first offense, mysteriously attaching to every individual of the race, but from the countless offenses it, to which, as a germ lodged in the bosom of every child of Adam, it unfolds itself in his life." This is the meaning of "grace abounding towards us in the abundance of the gift of righteousness." It is a grace not only rich in its character, but rich in detail; it is a "righteousness" not only rich in a complete justification of the guilty, condemned sinner; but rich in the amplitude of the ground which it covers, leaving no one sin of any of the justified uncancelled, but making him, though loaded with the guilt of myriads of offenses, "the righteousness of God in Christ."<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/romans/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> q.d.

The apostle goes on with the dissimilitude between the effects of Adam's sin, and Christ's righteousness: <p>for the judgment was by one to condemnation; by "judgment" is meant, not the judgment of God, or the judiciary sentence pronounced by God on Adam and his posterity for sin; but the guilt of the one man's sin, which is imputed to all men to condemnation, on account of which the sentence of condemnation passed on all men; the law transgressed, became a ministration of condemnation to them: <p>but the free gift is of many offences unto justification; the righteousness of Christ, which stands opposed to the guilt of Adam's sin, being imputed to all his offspring, is to the justification of them; and that not only from the guilt of that particular offence, but from many other offences, even all their actual sins and transgressions, of every sort; which is another instance of the exuberance, or abounding of the grace of God, in the righteousness of Christ, not only over the sin of the one man, but also over the sins of many, even all the elect of God; for the last clause may be also thus rendered, "the free gift is of the offences of many, unto justification". <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/romans/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{15}</span> And not as <i>it was</i> by one that sinned, <i>so is</i> the gift: for the judgment <i>was</i> by one to condemnation, but the free gift <i>is</i> of many offences unto <span class="cverse3">{t}</span> justification.</span><p>(15) Another inequality consists in this, that by Adam's one offence men are made guilty, but the righteousness of Christ imputed unto us freely, does not only absolve us from that one fault, but from all others.<p>(t) To the sentence of absolution, by which we are acquitted and pronounced righteous.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/romans/5.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-16.htm" title="And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift: for the judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many offenses to justification.">Romans 5:16</a>.

Any other course is arbitrary and artificial.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1321] .<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. <span class="greekheb">καὶ τὰ λοιπά</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1322] c. <span class="ital">scilicet</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1325] c. <span class="ital">scilicet</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1326] In consequence of the way in which Hofmann has supplemented the first half of the verse, we should now take, in the one instance, <span class="greekheb">ἐξ ἐνὸς εἰς κατάκριμα εἰς τοὺς πολλοὺς ἐπερίσσευσεν</span> as predicate to <span class="greekheb">τὸ κρῖμα</span>; and in the other instance, <span class="greekheb">ἐκ πολλῶν παραπτωμάτων εἰς δικαίωμα εἰς τοὺς πολλοὺς ἐπερίσσευσεν</span> as predicate to <span class="greekheb">τὸ χάρισμα</span>,—notwithstanding that in both cases a definition with <span class="greekheb">εἰς</span> is already given by Paul himself. How enigmatically and misleadingly he would have written!<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1328] Where <span class="greekheb">τὰ δικαιώματα τῶν ἁγίων</span> are the divine verdicts of justification, which the saints have received. The pure byssus is their symbol. Compare Ewald, <span class="ital">Joh. Schr. in loc.</span> p. 330. Düsterdieck understands it otherwise (righteous acts).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/romans/5.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-16.htm" title="And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift: for the judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many offenses to justification.">Romans 5:16</a>. A fresh point of contrast. That which God bestows (for <span class="greekheb">δώρημα</span>, see Mayor on <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-17.htm" title="Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and comes down from the Father of lights, with whom is no ficklenss, neither shadow of turning.">Jam 1:17</a>) is not as through one that sinned: the analogy with Adam breaks down here. For the Divine judgment (<span class="greekheb">κρίμα</span> neutral) starting from one (person) resulted in condemnation (for all); whereas the free gift, starting from many offences (which appealed to the mercy of God), has resulted in a sentence of justification (for all). This abstract way of looking at the matter disregards what the Apostle insists on elsewhere, that this “sentence of justification” only takes effect for the individual on the condition of faith. The <span class="greekheb">ἐκ πολλῶν παραπτωμάτων</span> in this verse is a decisive argument for the meaning given above to <span class="greekheb">πάντες ἥμαρτον</span>: redemption is not inspired merely by the fall of the race in Adam, but by its actual and multiplied offences, and this is its glory. <span class="greekheb">ἐξ ἑνὸς</span>: <span class="greekheb">ἑνὸς</span> is masculine, resuming the <span class="greekheb">ἑνὸς ἁμαρτήσαντος</span> of the previous clause; not neuter, with <span class="greekheb">παραπτώματος</span> anticipated from the following clause.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/romans/5.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">16</span>. <span class="ital">And not</span>, &c.] The line of thought here is less difficult if we take <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-17.htm" title="For if by one man's offense death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.)">Romans 5:17</a> in close connexion, and read the words from “<span class="ital">for the judgment</span>” to “<span class="ital">unto justification</span>” as a parenthetic statement of the two facts before us. We may then paraphrase <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/5-16.htm" title="And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift: for the judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many offenses to justification....">Romans 5:16-17</a> thus: “The Gift, in wonder and greatness of quality, far exceeds the Ruin, though each is the result of one Person’s act: (for, as we know, the sentence and execution <span class="ital">was</span> the result of one man’s one sin, while the atonement and justification is the result, in a sense, of many men’s many sins:)—I say the Gift exceeds the Ruin; for while the result of Adam’s sin was just the lawful reign of death over <span class="ital">men</span> as sinners, the result of Christ’s work shall be not a mere reversal of this, but the reign of <span class="ital">justified men</span> over death in glory.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">And not</span>, &c.] The Gr. here is more exactly, <span class="bld">And not as by means of the sinning of one, [is] the gift: for the sentence [resulted] from one [person] unto condemnation; but the boon [resulted] from many offences unto acquittal</span>. Here the “<span class="ital">one</span>” is plainly Adam; and the contrast is between his <span class="ital">one-ness</span>, and that of his sin, and the <span class="ital">many</span> offences of his many sons. St Paul estimates the greatness of the pardon of all the sins of all the justified from the tremendous legal results of the one sin of Adam. Such is sin, that Adam’s <span class="ital">sin</span> brought death on all men; such is grace, that innumerable <span class="ital">sins</span> are, through the Propitiation, “abundantly pardoned.”—The phrase above, “resulted from,” has of course a different bearing in the two clauses. The first sin was the <span class="ital">strict</span> cause of the sentence; while the “many offences” “caused” the boon, only as <span class="ital">calling forth</span> the mercy.—<span class="ital">“The sentence … unto condemnation;” “the boon … unto acquittal:”</span>—in each of these phrases the last word explains the first: the sentence <span class="ital">amounted to</span> sentence of death; the gift was <span class="ital">nothing less than</span> acquittal.—The hereditary guilt and doom of the Fall is very distinctly taught in this verse. The sentence of death on man as man came “by means of the sinning of <span class="ital">one</span>,” in a sense expressly distinguished from the guilt of the “many offences” of the many.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/romans/5.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-16.htm" title="And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift: for the judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many offenses to justification.">Romans 5:16</a>. <span class="greekheb">Καὶ</span>, <span class="ital">and</span>) The meaning is to this effect: <span class="ital">and not, as by one that sinned</span> (is the judgment) (so by one, the author of righteousness is) <span class="ital">the gift</span> [Engl.
