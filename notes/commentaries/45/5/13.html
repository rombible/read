But here comes the difficulty. Sin there was, but why guilt? And why death, the punishment of guilt? The pre-Mosaic man sinned indeed, but could not rightly be condemned for his sin until there was a law to tell him plainly the distinction between right and wrong.<p>It will be observed that the law of nature (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/1-19.htm" title="Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God has showed it to them.">Romans 1:19-20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/2-14.htm" title="For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law to themselves:">Romans 2:14-15</a>) is here left out of consideration. In the places mentioned, St. Paul speaks of the law of nature only as applicable to his contemporaries or to comparatively recent times. He does not throw back its operation into the primitive ages of the world; neither does he pronounce upon the degree of responsibility which men, as moral agents, then incurred. This would fall in with the doctrine that the consciousness of right and wrong was gradually formed. It is not, indeed, to be said that St. Paul exactly anticipated the teachings of the inductive school of moralists, but there is much in their system, or at any rate in the results to which they seem to be coming, that appears to fall into easy and harmonious relations with the teaching of the Apostle.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:12-14 The design of what follows is plain. It is to exalt our views respecting the blessings Christ has procured for us, by comparing them with the evil which followed upon the fall of our first father; and by showing that these blessings not only extend to the removal of these evils, but far beyond. Adam sinning, his nature became guilty and corrupted, and so came to his children. Thus in him all have sinned. And death is by sin; for death is the wages of sin. Then entered all that misery which is the due desert of sin; temporal, spiritual, eternal death. If Adam had not sinned, he had not died; but a sentence of death was passed, as upon a criminal; it passed through all men, as an infectious disease that none escape. In proof of our union with Adam, and our part in his first transgression, observe, that sin prevailed in the world, for many ages before the giving of the law by Moses. And death reigned in that long time, not only over adults who wilfully sinned, but also over multitudes of infants, which shows that they had fallen in Adam under condemnation, and that the sin of Adam extended to all his posterity. He was a figure or type of Him that was to come as Surety of a new covenant, for all who are related to Him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/romans/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For until the law ... - This verse, with the following verses to the 17th, is usually regarded as a parenthesis. The Law here evidently means the Law given by Moses. "Until the commencement of that administration, or state of things under the law." To see the reason why he referred to this period between Adam and the Law, we should recall the design of the apostle, which is, to show the exceeding grace of God in the gospel, abounding, and superabounding, as a complete remedy for all the evils introduced by sin. For this purpose he introduces three leading conditions, or states, where people sinned, and where the effects of sin were seen; in regard to each and all of which the grace of the gospel superabounded. The first was that of Adam, with its attendant train of ills <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/5-12.htm">Romans 5:12</a>, which ills were all met by the death of Christ, <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/5-15.htm">Romans 5:15-18</a>. The second period or condition was that long interval in which men had only the light of nature, that period occurring between Adam and Moses. This was a fair representation of the condition of the world without revelation, and without law, <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/5-13.htm">Romans 5:13-14</a>. Sin then reigned - reigned everywhere where there was no law. But the grace of the gospel abounded over the evils of this state of man. The third was under the Law, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-20.htm">Romans 5:20</a>. The Law entered, and sin was increased, and its evils abounded. But the gospel of Christ abounded even over this, and grace triumphantly reigned. So that the plan of justification met all the evils of sin, and was adapted to remove them; sin and its consequences as flowing from Adam; sin and its consequences when there was no written revelation; and sin and its consequences under the light and terrors of the Law.<p>Sin was in the world - People sinned. They did what was evil.<p>But sin is not imputed - Is not charged against people, or they are not held guilty of it where there is no law. This is a self-evident proposition, for sin is a violation of law; and if there is no law, there can be no wrong. Assuming this as a self-evident proposition, the connection is, that there must have been a law of some kind; a "law written on their hearts," since sin was in the world, and people could not be charged with sin, or treated as sinners, unless there was some law. The passage here states a great and important principle, that people will not be held to be guilty unless there is a law which binds them of which they are apprized, and which they voluntarily transgress; see the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-15.htm">Romans 4:15</a>. This verse, therefore, meets an objection that might be started from what had been said in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-15.htm">Romans 4:15</a>. The apostle had affirmed that "where no law is there is no transgression." He here stated that all were sinners. It might be objected, that as during this long period of time they had no law, they could not be stoners. To meet this, he says that people were then in fact sinners, and were treated as such, which showed that there must have been a law. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/romans/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13, 14.

It appears there was a law before the law of Moses, for if there had been no law all that while, then sin would not have been imputed to men, so as to make them liable to punishment or death; but sin was imputed or charged upon men before the law of Moses, and death passed upon all. Therefore there must have been a law, by the transgression of which men were sinners, before that time. And that was either the law of nature, or the positive law which God gave to Adam, the transgression whereof is imputed to all, as we shall see, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-19.htm" title="For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.">Romans 5:19</a></span>. Some think the apostle doth here obviate a cavil: q.d. Let no man think that sin began to have its being together with the law, for there was sin before there was any written law to forbid it. The same acts that were forbidden afterwards by the law, were before committed, and were really sinful in the sight of God. But sin was not so well known, nor so strictly charged upon the sinner, as it is since the law was given. It was not imputed comparatively, though absolutely it was, as may appear by many instances, as the drowning of the world, the destruction of Sodom, &c. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/romans/5.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For until the law, sin was in the world,.... This is a proof of sin's having entered into the world, by one man's transgression of the positive law of God, which forbid him the eating of the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil; since it was in the world before the law of Moses was given: the sin of Adam and the guilt of that were in the world before, and came upon all men to condemnation; the general corruption of nature appeared before; and actual sins, and transgressions of all sorts were committed before; as by the immediate posterity of Adam, by the men of the old world, by the inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah, by the patriarchs and their posterity, by the Egyptians, Canaanites, and others. They were all guilty of sin, corrupted by it, and under the dominion of it, except such as were released from it by the grace of God: now when sin is said to be until this time, the meaning is not that it existed and continued until the law of Moses took place, and then ceased; for that law did not, and could not take away sin, it rather increased it, at least it became more known by it; but that it was in being before it, and had influence and power over the sons of men, so as to subject them to death: <p>but sin is not imputed when there is no law. This looks like an objection, that if there was no law before Moses's time, then there was no sin, nor could any action of man be known or accounted by them as sinful, or be imputed to them to condemnation; or rather it is a concession, allowing that where there is no law, sin is not imputed; but there was a law before that law of Moses, which law was transgressed, and the sin or transgression of it was imputed to men to condemnation and death, as appears from what follows. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/romans/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{11}</span> (For until <span class="cverse3">{o}</span> the law sin was in the world: but sin is not <span class="cverse3">{p}</span> imputed when there is no law.</span><p>(11) That this is so, that both guiltiness and death began not after the giving and transgressing of law of Moses, is evident in that men died before that law was given: for in that they died, sin, which is the cause of death, existed then: and in such a way, that it was also imputed: because of this it follows that there was then some law, the breach of which was the cause of death.<p>(o) Even from Adam to Moses.<p>(p) Where there is no law made, no man is punished as faulty and guilty.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/romans/5.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-13.htm" title="(For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law.">Romans 5:13</a> f. <span class="ital">Demonstration</span>, that the death of all has its ground in the sin of <span class="ital">Adam</span>, and the causal connection of that sin with death. This argument, conducted with great conciseness, <span class="ital">sets out</span> from the undoubted historical certainty (it is already sufficiently attested in Genesis 4-6) that during the entire period prior to the law (<span class="greekheb">ἄχρι νόμου</span> = <span class="greekheb">ἀπὸ Ἀδὰμ μέχρι Μωϋσέως</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-14.htm" title="Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come.">Romans 5:14</a>) there was sin in humanity; <span class="ital">then further argues</span> that the death of individuals, which yet has affected those also who have not like Adam sinned against a positive command, cannot be derived from that sin prior to the law, because in the non-existence of law there is no imputation; <span class="ital">and allows it to be thence inferred</span> that consequently the death of all has been caused (<span class="greekheb">ἐφʼ ᾧ πάντες ἥμαρτον</span>) by the sin of Adam (not by their individual sins). Paul however leaves this <span class="ital">inference</span> to the reader himself; he does not expressly declare it, but instead of doing so he says, returning to the comparison begun in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-12.htm" title="Why, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed on all men, for that all have sinned:">Romans 5:12</a> : <span class="greekheb">ὄς ἐστι τύπος τοῦ μέλλοντος</span>, for in that death-working operation of Adam’s sin for all lay, in fact, the very ground of the typical relation to Christ. Chrysostom aptly says: <span class="greekheb">εἰ γὰρ ἐξ ἁμαρτίας ὁ θάνατος τὴν ῥίζαν ἔσχε</span>, <span class="greekheb">νόμου δὲ οὐκ ὄντος ἡ ἁμαρτία οὐκ ἐλλογεῖται</span>, <span class="greekheb">πῶς ὁ θάνατος ἐκράτει</span>; <span class="greekheb">ὅθεν δῆλον ὄτι οὐκ αὐτὴ ἡ ἁμαρτία ἡ τῆς τοῦ νόμου παραβάσεως</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀλλʼ ἐκείνη τῆς τοῦ Ἀδὰμ παρακοῆς</span>, <span class="greekheb">αὕτη ἦν ἡ πάντα λυμαινομένη</span>. <span class="greekheb">Καὶ τίς ἡ τούτου ἀπόδειξις</span>; <span class="greekheb">τὸ καὶ πρὸ τοῦ νόμου πάντας ἀποθνήσκειν</span>· <span class="greekheb">ἐβασίλευσε γὰρ κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>[1275] Compare Oecumenius.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἌΧΡΙ ΝΌΜΟΥ</span></span></span>] <span class="ital">i.e.</span> in the period previous to the giving of the law, comp <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-14.htm" title="Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come.">Romans 5:14</a>; consequently not during the period of the law, <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἝΩς Ὁ ΝΌΜΟς ἘΚΡΆΤΕΙ</span></span></span>,[1277] Theodoret; comp Origen, Chrysostom, and Theodore of Mopsuestia.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐλλογεῖται</span>] preserved nowhere else except in Boeckh, <span class="ital">Inscript</span>.

Comp <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-15.htm" title="Because the law works wrath: for where no law is, there is no transgression.">Romans 4:15</a>. The proposition itself: “<span class="ital">Sin is not imputed, if the law is absent</span>,” is set down as something universally <span class="ital">conceded, as</span> an <span class="ital">axiom;</span> therefore with repetition of the subject (in opposition to Hofmann, who on account of this repetition separates <span class="greekheb">ἁμαρτία δέ κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>[1281] from the first half of the verse and attaches it to what follows), and with the verb in the <span class="ital">present</span>. The proposition itself, inserted as an intervening link in the argument with the metabatic <span class="greekheb">δέ</span>, without requiring a preceding <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΜΈΝ</span></span></span>, which Hofmann is wrong in missing (see Dietzsch and Kühner, II. 2, p. 814), has its truth as well as its more precise application in the fact, that in the absence of law the action, which in and by itself is unlawful, is no <span class="ital">transgression</span> of the <span class="ital">law</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-15.htm" title="Because the law works wrath: for where no law is, there is no transgression.">Romans 4:15</a>), and cannot therefore be brought into account <span class="ital">as such</span>. That Paul regarded the matter in this light, and had not, as Hofmann thinks, sinning generally, “as it was one and the same thing in the case of all,” in view apart from the sins of individuals, is plain also from <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἐπὶ τοὺς μὴ ἁμαρτ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐπὶ τῷ ὁμοιώματι τῆς παραβάσ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Ἀδάμ</span>, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-14.htm" title="Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come.">Romans 5:14</a>. His thought is: If the death of men after Adam had been caused by their own sin, then in the case of all those, who have died during the period from Adam till the law, the sin which they have committed must have been already reckoned to them as transgression of the law, just as Adam’s sin was the transgression of the positive divine command, and as such brought upon him death; but this is inconceivable, because the law was not in existence. In this Paul leaves out of consideration the Noachian commands (Genesis 9), as well as other declarations of God as to His will given before the law, and likewise individual punitive judgments, such as in the case of Sodom, just because he has only the strict idea of real and formal legislation before his mind, and this suggests to him simply the great epochs of the Paradisaic and Sinaitic legislations. A view, which does not subvert the truth of his demonstration, because mankind in general were without law from Adam until Moses, the natural law, because not given positively, remaining out of the account; it makes the act at variance with it appear as sin (<span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἉΜΑΡΤΊΑ</span></span></span>), but not as <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΑΡΆΒΑΣΙς</span></span> <span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΝΌΜΟΥ</span></span></span>, which as such <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΛΛΟΓΕῖΤΑΙ</span></span></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-14.htm" title="Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come.">Romans 5:14</a>. <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΛΛʼ</span></span></span>] <span class="ital">at, yet</span>, although sin is not put to account in the absence of the law. It introduces an apparently contradictory phenomenon, confronting the <span class="greekheb">ἁμαρτία οὐκ ἐλλογεῖται <span class="bld"><span class="ital">Κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Λ</span></span></span>[1282]; one, however, which just proves that men have died, not through their own special sin, but through the sin of Adam, which was put to their account. <span class="greekheb">ἐβασίλευσεν</span>] prefixed with emphasis: death has not perchance been powerless, no, it has <span class="ital">reigned, i.e.</span> has exercised its power which deprives of life (comp <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/5-17.htm" title="For if by one man's offense death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.)...">Romans 5:17-21</a>). Hofmann (comp also Holsten, Aberle, and Dietzsch) finds in the emphatic <span class="greekheb">ἐβασ</span>. the <span class="ital">absolute</span> and <span class="ital">abiding</span> dominion, which death has exercised independently of the imputation of sins (<span class="greekheb">ἀλλὰ</span> being taken as the simple <span class="ital">but</span>), “just as a king, one by virtue of his <span class="ital">personal</span> position <span class="ital">once and for all</span> entitled to do so, exercises dominion over those who, in virtue of their belonging to his domain, are <span class="ital">from the outset subject</span> to him.” But no reader could educe this qualitative definite sense of the <span class="greekheb">βασιλεύειν</span>, with the highly essential characteristic elements ascribed to it, from the mere verb itself; nor could it be gathered from the position of the word at the head of the sentence; on the contrary, it must unquestionably have been <span class="ital">expressed</span> (by <span class="greekheb">ἐτυράννευσεν</span> possibly, or <span class="greekheb">τυραννικῶς ἐβασίλευσεν</span>) seeing that the subsequent <span class="greekheb">καί</span> (<span class="ital">even</span> over those, etc.) does not indicate a <span class="ital">mode</span> of the power of the (personified) death, but only appends the fact of its dominion being without exception.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">μέχρι Μωῢσ</span>.] equivalent to <span class="greekheb">ἄχρι νόμου</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-13.htm" title="(For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law.">Romans 5:13</a>. A distinction of sense between <span class="greekheb">μέχρι</span> and <span class="greekheb">ἄχρι</span> is (contrary to the opinion of Tittmann, <span class="ital">Synon.</span> p. 33 f.) purely fanciful.

Even these it did not spare. It is erroneous with Chrysostom (but not Theodoret and Theophylact) to connect <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΠῚ Τᾯ ὉΜΟΙΏΜΑΤΙ</span></span> <span class="bld"><span class="ital">Κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Λ</span></span></span>[1288] with <span class="greekheb">ἐβασίλ</span>. So Finckh again does, following Castalio and Bengel: “quia illorum eadem atque Adami transgredientis ratio fuit.… i.e. <span class="ital">propter reatum ab Adamo contractum</span>.” Erroneous for this reason, that Paul, apart from the little children or those otherwise incapable of having sin imputed, whom however he must have indicated more precisely, could not conceive at all (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-23.htm" title="For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;">Romans 3:23</a>) of persons who had not sinned (<span class="greekheb">μὴ ἁμαρτήσαντες</span> without any modal addition more precisely defining it), and a limitation <span class="ital">mentally supplied</span> (<span class="ital">sine lege</span> peccarunt, Bengel) is purely fanciful. The <span class="greekheb">καί</span>, <span class="ital">even</span>, refers to the fact that in the period extending from Adam till Moses, excluding the latter, positively given divine commands were certainly transgressed by individuals to whom they were given, but it was not <span class="ital">these merely</span> who died (as must have been the case, had death been brought on by their own particular sins); it was <span class="ital">also those</span>,[1289] who etc. <span class="ital">Their</span> sin was not <span class="greekheb">ἐπὶ τῷ ὁμοιώμ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τῆς παραβ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Ἀδάμ</span> (<span class="greekheb">ἐπί</span> used of the <span class="ital">form</span>, in which anything occurs, see Bernhardy, p. 250); they did not sin in such a way, <span class="ital">that their action was of like shape with the transgression of Adam</span>, “quia non habebant ut ille <span class="ital">revelatam certo oraculo</span> Dei voluntatem,” Calvin. For other definitions of the sense see Fritzsche, p. 316, and Reiche, <span class="ital">Commentar. crit.</span> I. p. 45 ff. Reiche himself explains it of those who have transgressed no command <span class="ital">expressly threatening death</span>. So also Tholuck. But this peculiar limitation is not suggested by the context, in which, on the contrary, it is merely the previous <span class="greekheb">μὴ ὄντος νόμου</span> which supplies a standard for determining the sense of the similarity. According to Hofmann <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἐπὶ τοὺς</span> down to <span class="greekheb">Ἀδάμ</span> is meant to be one and the same with the previous <span class="greekheb">ἀπὸ Αδὰμ μέχρι Μωϋσέως</span>, inasmuch as a transgression similar to that of Adam could only then have occurred, “<span class="ital">when God placed a people in the same position in which Adam found himself, when he received a divine command on the observance or transgression of which his life or death depended</span>. This misconception, springing from the erroneous interpretation of <span class="greekheb">ἐφʼ ᾧ πάντες ἥμαρτον</span>, is already excluded by <span class="greekheb">καί</span>,[1290] as well as, pursuant to the tenor of thought, by the fact that in the <span class="ital">pre-legal</span> period in question all those, who transgressed a command divinely given to them by way of revelation, sinned like Adam. Their sin had thereby the same moral form as the act of Adam; but not only had <span class="ital">they</span> to die, but also (<span class="greekheb">καί</span>) those who had <span class="ital">not</span> been in <span class="ital">that</span> condition of sinning.

The type is always something historical (a person, thing, saying), which is destined, in accordance with the divine plan, to prefigure something corresponding to it in the future,—in the connected scheme of sacred historical teleology, which is to be discerned from the standpoint of the antitype. Typical historical parallels between Adam and the Messiah (so that the latter is even expressly termed the last Adam) are found also in Rabbinical authors (e.g. <span class="ital">Neve Schalom</span> f. 160, 2 : “Quemadmodum homo primus fuit primus in peccato, sic Messias erit ultimus ad auferendum peccatum penitus;” <span class="ital">Neve Schalom</span> 9, 9 : Adamus postremus est Messias”), and are based in them on the doctrine of the <span class="greekheb">ἀποκατάστασις πάντων</span>.

So Fritzsche. Or: in order to show “<span class="ital">in Adamo causam quaerendam esse, cur hominum peccata mors secuta sit</span>,” Paul declares that death has reigned over all from Adam till Moses, whether they sinned like Adam or differently.

But however it may be turned, the probative element has first of all to be read into the passage; and even then the alleged proof (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-14.htm" title="Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come.">Romans 5:14</a>) would only be a reasoning backwards from the historical <span class="ital">phenomenon</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-14.htm" title="Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come.">Romans 5:14</a> to the <span class="ital">cause asserted</span> by <span class="greekheb">ἐφʼ ᾧ π</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἥμαρτ</span>., and consequently a mere clumsy argument in a circle, which again <span class="ital">assumes</span> the assertion to be proved—id quod erat demonstrandum—in the phenomenon brought forward in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-14.htm" title="Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come.">Romans 5:14</a> : and moreover utterly breaks down through the proposition that sin is not imputed in the absence of law. Ewald, in his former view (<span class="ital">Jahrb.</span> II.) rightly deduces from <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-14.htm" title="Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come.">Romans 5:14</a>; <span class="ital">consequently it only appears the more certain, that death propagated itself to them only by means of Adam’s</span>,” but attributes to this inference, consistently with his view of <span class="greekheb">ἐφʼ ᾧ π</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἥμ</span>., the sense: “<span class="ital">that they all sinned unto death just in the same way as, and because, Adam had sinned unto it</span>.” In his later view (<span class="ital">Sendschr. d. Ap.

These two verses are rather obscure, but must be intended (<span class="greekheb">γὰρ</span>) to prove what has been asserted in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-12.htm" title="Why, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed on all men, for that all have sinned:">Romans 5:12</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἄχρι γὰρ νόμου</span> = <span class="greekheb">ἀπὸ Ἀδὰμ μέχρι Μωυσέως</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-14.htm" title="Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come.">Romans 5:14</a>, the law meant being the Mosaic. The sin which was in the world before the law is not the guilt of Adam’s fall imputed to the race as fallen in him, but the actual sin which individuals had committed. Now if law has no existence, sin is not imputed. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-15.htm" title="Because the law works wrath: for where no law is, there is no transgression.">Romans 4:15</a>. The natural inference would seem to be that the sins committed during this period could not be punished. But what was the case? The very opposite of this. Death <span class="ital">reigned</span> all through this period. This unrestrained tyranny of death (observe the emphatic position of <span class="greekheb">ἐβασίλευσεν</span>) over persons whose sins cannot be imputed to them, seems at variance with the explanation just adopted of <span class="greekheb">πάντες ἥμαρτον</span>. Indeed Meyer and others use it to refute that explanation. The reign of death, apart from imputable individual sin, implies, they argue, a corresponding objective reign of sin, apart from individual acts: in other words, justifies the interpretation of <span class="greekheb">ἐφʼ ᾧ πάντες ἥμαρτον</span> according to which all men sinned in Adam’s sin, and <span class="ital">so</span> (<span class="ital">and only so</span>) became subject to death. But the empirical meaning of <span class="greekheb">ἥμαρτον</span> is decidedly to be preferred, and we must rather fill out the argument thus: “all sinned. For there was sin in the world before Moses; and though sin is not imputed where there is no law, and though therefore no <span class="ital">particular</span> penalty—death or another—could be expected for the sins here in question, yet all that time death reigned, for in the act of Adam sin and death had been inseparably and for ever conjoined.” <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἐπὶ τοὺς μὴ ἁμαρτήσαντας ἐπὶ τῷ ὁμοιώματι κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.—even over those who did not sin after the likeness of Adam’s transgression. For <span class="greekheb">ἐπὶ</span>, <span class="ital">cf.</span> Winer, p. 492. This describes not some, but all of those who lived during the period from Adam to Moses. None of them had like Adam violated an express prohibition sanctioned by the death penalty. Yet they all died, for they all sinned, and in their first father sin and death had been indissolubly united. And this Adam is <span class="greekheb">τύπος τοῦ μέλλοντος</span> <span class="ital">sc.</span> <span class="greekheb">Ἀδάμ</span>. In the coming Adam and his relations to the race there will be something on the same pattern as this. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-6.htm" title="Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted.">1 Corinthians 10:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-11.htm" title="Now all these things happened to them for ensamples: and they are written for our admonition, on whom the ends of the world are come.">1 Corinthians 10:11</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-14.htm" title="How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?">Hebrews 9:14</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-22.htm" title="For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.">1 Corinthians 15:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-45.htm" title="And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit.">1 Corinthians 15:45</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-49.htm" title="And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.">1 Corinthians 15:49</a>. Parallels of this sort between Adam and the Messiah are common in Rabbinical writings: <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, Schöttgen quotes <span class="ital">Neve Schalom</span>, f. 160–2. “Quemadmodum homo primus fuit unus in peccato, sic Messias erit postremus, ad auferendum peccatum penitus;” and 9, 9 has “Adamus postremus est Messias”. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> Delitzsch: <span class="ital">Brief an die Römer</span>, p. 82 f. The extent to which the thoughts of this passage on sin and death, and on the consequences of Adam’s sin to his descendants, can be traced in Jewish writers, is not quite clear. As a rule (see above on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-12.htm" title="Why, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed on all men, for that all have sinned:">Romans 5:12</a>) they admit the dependence of death on sin, though Schöttgen quotes a Rabbi Samuel ben David as saying, “Etiamsi Adamus primus non peccasset, tamen mors fuisset”. On the unity and solidarity of the race in sin and its consequences, they are not perfectly explicit. Weber (<span class="ital">Die Lehren des Talmud</span>, p. 217) gives the following summary: “There is an inherited guilt, but not an inherited sin; the fall of Adam has brought death upon the whole race, not however sinfulness in the sense of a necessity to commit sin; sin is the result of each individual’s decision; it is, as far as experience goes, universal, yet in itself even after the Fall not absolutely necessary”. This seems to agree very closely with the Apostle’s teaching as interpreted above. It is the appeal to <span class="ital">experience</span> in Paul (<span class="greekheb">πάντες ἥμαρτον</span>), crossing with a transcendent view of the unity of the race in Adam, which gives rise to all the difficulties of interpretation; but without this appeal to experience (which many like Bengel, Meyer and Gifford reject) the whole passage would hang in the air, unreal. There must be something which involves the individual in Adam’s fate; that something comes into view in <span class="greekheb">πάντες ἥμαρτον</span>, and there only; and without it our interest dies. A sin which we commit in Adam (and which never becomes ours otherwise) is a mere fancy to which one has nothing serious to say.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/romans/5.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">13</span>. <span class="ital">for until the law</span>] This and the following verses are not a parenthesis: see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-12.htm" title="Why, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed on all men, for that all have sinned:">Romans 5:12</a>.—“<span class="ital">Until</span>” here practically = “<span class="ital">before</span>.” The period “from Adam to Moses” is in view, the Law of Moses being taken as the first <span class="ital">elaborate</span> statute-giving of God for man. “Laws” existed long before Moses; e.g. those of Marriage, of the sanctity of Life, and of the Sabbath. But the Mosaic Law <span class="ital">covered the field of duty</span> in a way unknown before; so as to suggest the question whether human beings, in <span class="ital">the previous ages</span>, in <span class="ital">some instances</span>, had not satisfied the claims of <span class="ital">then-known</span> duty, and so <span class="ital">escaped death</span>. But no: in those ages, as in the Mosaic, “death reigned;” therefore there was sin; therefore there was broken law; and that law, in numberless cases, (viz. infantine,) must have been broken <span class="ital">only</span> “in Adam;” for it was unknown to the persons in question.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">law … law</span>] Both these words in the Gr. are without the article.

The fact that all died before the giving of the law.”<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/romans/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 13, 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For until Law</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> all through the time previous to the revelation of law) <span class="cmt_word">sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law. Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression</span>. Though <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, where it first occurs in ver. 13, refers definitely, as appears from the context, to the Law of Moses, yet it is without the article, as denoting the principle of law, of which the Mosaic code was the embodiment; and it has therefore, in accordance with the rule laid down in this translation, been rendered as above. The purport of these two verses, connected by <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span> with <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> of ver. 12, is to prove that the primeval sin did really infect and implicate the whole race of mankind. It might be supposed that those only would be implicated who had themselves transgressed, as Adam did, a known command; it being an acknowledged principle of Divine justice that only sin against law of which the sinner is conscious is imputed to him for con-detonation (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-15.htm">Romans 4:15</a>; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-41.htm">John 9:41</a>). Nay. but the universal dominion of death, the doom of sin, over all alike, whether or not they had themselves so sinned, was proof that sin was all along dominant in the world, infecting all. The Mosaic Law is spoken of as the distinct revelation of Divine Law to man; and therefore attention is first drawn to the fact that before that revelation, no less than after it, death had reigned over all. But is it thus implied that until the Law from Mount Sinai men had been without any kind of law, for transgressing which they were responsible? Not so. That Law is indeed regarded as the first definite enunciation of law under evident Divine sanction, after which, to those that were under it, sin became indubitably and exceeding sinful; but that men are conceived as having sinned previously against law of some kind, appears from the phrase, "<span class="accented">Even</span> <span class="accented">over those</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span>) who had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> consciously against a known command. This surely implies that some had so sinned; and thus the essential point of the argument is that even over those who had not so sinned (such as the unenlightened and invincibly ignorant, or persons dying in infancy) death had equally reigned. <span class="cmt_word">Who is the figure of him that was to come</span>. This is added so as to bring round the thought to the main subject of the chapter, viz. the reconciliation of all mankind through Christ, to which the scriptural account of the condemnation of all mankind through Adam had, at ver. 12, been adduced as analogous. <span class="accented">Who</span> refers to Adam, who has just been for the first time named; <span class="accented">he that was to come</span> is Christ, who is called, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-45.htm">1 Corinthians 15:45</a>, "the last Adam." Adam was a type (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) of Christ in that both represented entire humanity; one as the representative and author of fallen, the other of restored, humanity - the transgression of the one and the obedience of the other alike affecting all (see vers 18, 19). But there is a difference between the two cases; and this is pointed out in vers. 15, 16, 17, which follow. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/romans/5.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Until the law<p>In the period between Adam and Moses.<p>Is not imputed (&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;)<p>Put to account so as to bring penalty.
