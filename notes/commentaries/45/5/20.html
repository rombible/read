Now he returns to the topic, and in order to complete his historical view of the origin of sin through Adam, and its atonement through Christ, he considers what was its effect upon the former, and how that effect was met and neutralised by the latter. Mankind had already been led into sin by Adam. The Law came in to make matters still worse. It substituted conscious sin for unconscious, and so heightened its guilt. But all this is more than retrieved by grace.<p>(20) <span class= "bld">Entered.</span>—A graphic metaphorical expression: “Came in to the side of” the sin already existing; “took its place,” as it were, “by the side of” sin, and joined forces with it, thus greatly adding to its extent and power.<p><span class= "bld">Abound.</span>—This word should be reserved for the last of the three places in this verse in which it appears in the Authorised version. The original in the other two places is different, and has the force of “Might be multiplied,” or “increased”—<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> made more and made worse.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:20,21 By Christ and his righteousness, we have more and greater privileges than we lost by the offence of Adam. The moral law showed that many thoughts, tempers, words, and actions, were sinful, thus transgressions were multiplied. Not making sin to abound the more, but discovering the sinfulness of it, even as the letting in a clearer light into a room, discovers the dust and filth which were there before, but were not seen. The sin of Adam, and the effect of corruption in us, are the abounding of that offence which appeared on the entrance of the law. And the terrors of the law make gospel comforts the more sweet. Thus God the Holy Spirit has, by the blessed apostle, delivered to us a most important truth, full of consolation, suited to our need as sinners. Whatever one may have above another, every man is a sinner against God, stands condemned by the law, and needs pardon. A righteousness that is to justify cannot be made up of a mixture of sin and holiness. There can be no title to an eternal reward without a pure and spotless righteousness: let us look for it, even to the righteousness of Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/romans/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Moreover - But. What is said in this verse and the following, seems designed to meet the Jew, who might pretend that the Law of Moses was intended to meet the evils of sin introduced by Adam, and therefore that the scheme defended by the apostle was unnecessary. He therefore shows them that the effect of the Law of Moses was to increase rather than to diminish the sins which had been introduced into the world. And if such was the fact, it could not be pled that it was adapted to overcome the acknowledged evils of the apostasy.<p>The law - The Mosaic laws and institutions. The word seems to be used here to denote all the laws which were given in the Old Testament.<p>Entered - This word usually means to enter secretly or surreptitiously. But it appears to be used here simply in the sense that the Law came in, or was given. It came in addition to, or it supervened the state before Moses, when people were living without a revelation.<p>That sin ... - The word "that" &#x3b9;&#788;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;  hina in this place does not mean that it was the design of giving the Law that sin might abound or be increased, but that such was in fact the effect. It had this tendency, not to restrain or subdue sin, but to excite and increase it. That the word has this sense may be seen in the lexicons. The way in which the Law produces this effect is stated more fully by the apostle in <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/7-7.htm">Romans 7:7-11</a>. The Law expresses the duty of man; it is spiritual and holy; it is opposed to the guilty passions and pleasures of the world; and it thus excites opposition, provokes to anger, and is the occasion by which sin is called into exercise, and shows itself in the heart. All law, where there is a disposition to do wrong, has this tendency. A command given to a child that is disposed to indulge his passions, only tends to excite anger and opposition. If the heart was holy, and there was a disposition to do right, law would have no such tendency. See this subject further illustrated in the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/7-7.htm">Romans 7:7-11</a>.<p>The offence - The offence which had been introduced by Adam, that is, sin. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-15.htm">Romans 5:15</a>.<p>Might abound - Might increase; that is, would be more apparent, more violent, more extensive. The introduction of the Mosaic Law, instead of diminishing the sins of people, only increases them.<p>But where sin abounded - Alike in all dispensations - before the Law, and under the Law. In all conditions of the human family before the gospel, it was the characteristic that sin was prevalent.<p>Grace - Favor; mercy.<p>Did much more abound - Superabounded. The word is used no where else in the New Testament, except in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-4.htm">2 Corinthians 7:4</a>. It means that the pardoning mercy of the gospel greatly triumphed over sin, even over the sins of the Jews, though those sins were greatly aggravated by the light which they enjoyed under the advantages of divine revelation. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/romans/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20, 21. Moreover the law&#8212;"The law, however." The Jew might say, If the whole purposes of God towards men center in Adam and Christ, where does "the law" come in, and what was the use of it? Answer: It<p>entered&#8212;But the word expresses an important idea besides "entering." It signifies, "entered incidentally," or "parenthetically." (In Ga 2:4 the same word is rendered, "came in privily.") The meaning is, that the promulgation of the law at Sinai was no primary or essential feature of the divine plan, but it was "added" (Ga 3:19) for a subordinate purpose&#8212;the more fully to reveal the evil occasioned by Adam, and the need and glory of the remedy by Christ.<p>that the offence might abound&#8212;or, "be multiplied." But what offense? Throughout all this section "the offense" (four times repeated besides here) has one definite meaning, namely, "the one first offense of Adam"; and this, in our judgment, is its meaning here also: "All our multitudinous breaches of the law are nothing but that one first offense, lodged mysteriously in the bosom of every child of Adam as an offending principal, and multiplying itself into myriads of particular offenses in the life of each." What was one act of disobedience in the head has been converted into a vital and virulent principle of disobedience in all the members of the human family, whose every act of wilful rebellion proclaims itself the child of the original transgression.<p>But where sin abounded&#8212;or, "was multiplied."<p>grace did much more abound&#8212;rather, "did exceedingly abound," or "superabound." The comparison here is between the multiplication of one offense into countless transgressions, and such an overflow of grace as more than meets that appalling case.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/romans/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Here he shows the reason why the law was given; although (as it is in <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-13.htm" title="(For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law.">Romans 5:13</a></span>) before that time sin was in the world, it was <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">that the offence might abound; </span> either strictly, the offence of that one man, or rather largely, the offence of every man.

There is this difference to be observed; that the first end is universal, for in all men, both good and bad, the law worketh the increase and knowledge of sin; but tho other is particular, and peculiar to the elect: to them only the grace of God is superabundant after that they have abounded in sin, and by how much the greater is their guilt, by so much the greater is the grace of God in the free forgiveness thereof. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/romans/5.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Moreover, the law entered,.... By "the law" is meant, not the law of nature, much less the law of sin; rather the ceremonial law, which came in over and above the moral law; it entered but for a time; by which sin abounded, and appeared very sinful; and through it the grace of God much more abounded, in the sacrifice of Christ prefigured by it: but the moral law, as it came by Moses, is here intended; which entered with great pomp and solemnity on Mount Sinai; and intervened, or came between Adam's sin and Christ's sacrifice; and also came in besides, or over and above the promise of life by Christ; and may moreover be said to enter into the conscience of a sinner, with the power and energy of the Spirit of God: and the end of its entrance is, <p>that the offence might abound; meaning either the sin of Adam, he had been speaking of under that name, that that itself, and the imputation of it to his posterity, and also the pollution of human nature by it, together with all the aggravating circumstances of it, might appear more manifest; or sin in general, any and all actual transgressions, which abound through the law's discovering the evil nature of them, and so taking away all excuse, or pretext of ignorance: by prohibiting them, whereby the corrupt nature of man becomes more eager after them; and by accusing, threatening, terrifying, and condemning, on account of them: one view of the apostle in this, doubtless, is to show, that there can be no justification by the law: <p>but where sin abounded, grace did much more abound: sin has abounded in human nature, in all the individuals of it; and grace has superabounded in the same nature, being assumed by the Son of God, and united to him, who has appeared in it "full of grace and truth", <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>, sin has abounded in all the powers and faculties of the soul, in the understanding, will, and affections, of an unregenerate man; but in regeneration, the grace of God much more abounds in the same powers and faculties, enlightening the understanding, subduing the will, and influencing the affections with love to divine things: sin abounded in the Gentile world, before the preaching of the Gospel in it; but afterwards grace did superabound in the conversion of multitudes in it from idols, to serve the living God; and where sin has abounded in particular persons to a very great height, grace has exceeded it, as in Manasseh, Mary Magdalene, Saul, and others. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/romans/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{19}</span> Moreover the law <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> entered, that the offence might abound.

It was God's purpose from the first that grace should in the end triumph over sin; but in the mean time law came in (cf. <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span> in the cognate passage, <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-19.htm">Galatians 3:19</a>). For what end? Not in itself to accomplish the purpose, not to interfere with its accomplishment, but as an intervening dispensation to prepare for its accomplishment, by convincing of sin, and making it exceeding sinful, and so establishing the need of, and exciting a craving for, redemption. This intervening preparatory office of the Mosaic Law is set forth more at length in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-19.htm">Galatians 3:19-26</a>; and the working of the principle of law to this end in the human consciousness is analyzed in ch. 7. of this Epistle. <span class="accented">Additional Note on ver.</span>12The significance of the words "life" and "death," as used in St. Paul's Epistles and elsewhere, demands peculiar attention. They evidently bear a sense in many places different from that of ordinary use; and this in accordance with our Lord's own recorded language, as, for instance, in his memorable words to Martha, given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-25.htm">John 11:25, 26</a>. The following considerations may aid our comprehension of what is meant. The mysterious principle or potency of life, even in the common acceptation of the term, varies not only in degree, but in kind; and the same living organism may be at the same time alive with respect to its own mode of vitality, and dead with respect to some higher one which vivifies others. The plant, while alive with respect to its own kind of life, is dead to the higher life of sentient beings. The brute beast, while alive with respect to mere animal life, is dead, as it were, to the higher life of intelligent man. A whole world of environing influences to which the mind of man responds, so as to live in them, are to the brute as nothing; it may be said to be dead to them. Now, Scripture teaches, and we believe, that there is a spiritual sphere of things above and beyond this visible sphere, which man is capable of apprehending, being influenced by, and living a still higher life than his natural life therein. He is thus capable through the higher and diviner part of his mysterious being, called by St. Paul his <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-23.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:23</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f59;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>), when in touch with the Divine <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>. For man to be in vital correspondence with his spiritual environments is spiritual life; to be out of correspondence with them is spiritual death. And so, as the plant is dead to sentient life, though alive in its own life; or as the brute may be said to be dead to the higher life of man, though alive in mere animal life; so man may be dead as to <span class="accented">spiritual</span> life, though alive as to <span class="accented">psychical</span> life; and thus "dead while he liveth" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-14.htm">1 Corinthians 2:14</a>, "The natural man (<span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God; for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned." In other words, he is dead to them). Further, this spiritual life, unlike the psychical life, is ever spoken of as <span class="accented">eternal.</span> For it consists in intercommunion of man's immortal part with the spiritual sphere of things which is eternal. Nor does natural death interrupt it; for it is not dependent for its continuance, as is psychical life, on environments from which we are severed by the body's death, but on such as are eternal. Thus, too, we see how it is that eternal life is regarded, not as one that will have its commencement after death, but as one to be enjoyed at present, and to which we are to rise in Christ even now. This idea is notably expressed in our Lord's words above referred to: "I am the Resurrection, and the Life: he that believeth in me, though he die, yet shall he live; and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-25.htm">John 11:25, 26</a>). Doubtless we are bidden to look forward to a fulness and perfection of the eternal life, of which our present enjoyment of it is but an earnest, in the <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-44.htm">1 Corinthians 15:44</a>) in store for us hereafter - cf. "Beloved, now are we children of God, and it is not yet manifested what we shall be," etc. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-2.htm">1 John 3:2</a>) - but still this is regarded as but the consummation of a life already begun. On the other hand, whatever penal consequences of a state of spiritual death may be spoken of as in store hereafter for the wicked, it is regarded as being itself but the continuance of a state of death in which they are before they pass away (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-11.htm">Revelation 22:11</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-12.htm">Romans 5:12</a>, etc., to which this note refers, the above view of what is often meant by "death" ought to be kept before us. For, though the apostle seems evidently to be speaking of the natural death that comes to all, he must be taken as regarding it as but the symbol and evidence of the sway of that spiritual death to which all men are now, in their fallen nature, liable. The thoughts embodied in the above note have been derived from, or suggested by, 'Natural Law in the Spiritual World,' by Henry Drummond, F.R.S.E., F.G.S. (Hodder and Stoughton: 1888). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/romans/5.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>The law entered (&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;)<p>Rev., literally, came in beside, giving the force of &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769; beside.
