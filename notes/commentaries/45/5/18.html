As if he had said, On the whole you see, as I began to observe to you before, that <span class="ital">as by the offence of one, judgment came upon all men to condemnation </span>— Or, the condemnatory sentence was passed upon all men; <span class="ital">even so, by the righteousness of one </span>— The obedience of Christ, <span class="ital">the free gift </span>— Or gift of grace; <span class="ital">came upon all men </span>— Is provided for, and offered to, the whole human race, and is actually conferred on all the spiritual seed of the second Adam, on all true believers; <span class="ital">unto justification of life </span>— Unto that justification by grace through faith, whereby we have a right and title to eternal life. Or, leaving out the words in Italics, which are not in the original, the verse may be paraphrased thus: “As the consequence of <span class="ital">one offence </span>on the one hand extended to <span class="ital">all men, to </span>bring <span class="ital">condemnation </span>upon them; <span class="ital">so also, </span>on the other side, the consequence of <span class="ital">one </span>grand <span class="ital">Acts of righteousness </span>extended <span class="ital">to all men, </span>who receive and embrace it; securing to them that <span class="ital">justification </span>which will be crowned with the enjoyment of eternal <span class="ital">life.” For, as by one man’s disobedience many </span>— That is, all men; <span class="ital">were made, </span>or <span class="ital">constituted sinners </span>— Being then in the loins of their first parent, the common head and representative of them all, and became obnoxious to death; <span class="ital">so by the obedience of one </span>— By his obedience unto death, by his dying for us; <span class="ital">many </span>— Namely, all that believe with a faith working by love; <span class="ital">shall be, </span>or are, constituted <span class="ital">righteous </span>— That is, pardoned, justified, and sanctified, and shall be treated as such in the day of God’s final account; though they have no perfect righteousness of their own to plead, in consequence of which they should stand before God and claim the reward. With respect to Dr. Taylor’s scheme of interpretation, it is justly observed here by Dr. Doddridge, that although “to become liable to death for the offence of another is indeed being thereby constituted, or rather treated, as a sinner, since death is in its primary view to be considered as the wages of sin, or the animadversion of a righteous God upon it;” yet, “simply to be raised from the dead is not being made righteous, or treated as a righteous person; since it is a very supposable case, and will in fact be the case of millions, that a sinner may be raised in order to more condign and dreadful punishment. The whole interpretation, therefore, which Dr. Taylor has given of this text, in this view, appears to me destitute of a sufficient foundation.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/5-20.htm" title="Moreover the law entered, that the offense might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound:...">Romans 5:20-21</a>, </span><span class="ital">Moreover the law entered </span>— <span class="ital">Made a little entrance, </span>as Dr. Doddridge translates <span class="greekheb">παρε ισηλθεν</span>; the sense also given it by the Vulgate, <span class="ital">sub intravit. </span>Thus the partial and limited entrance of the law is distinguished from that universal entrance of sin which passed on all. Others, however, as L’Enfant and Wesley, render it, <span class="ital">The law intervened, </span>or came between Adam and Christ, the offence and the free gift; <span class="ital">that the offence might abound </span>— That is, the consequence (not the design) of the law’s coming in, was not the taking away of sin, but the increase of it; <span class="ital">yet where sin abounded, grace did much more abound </span>— Not only in the remission of that sin which Adam brought on us, but of all our own sins; not only in remission of sins, but infusion of holiness; not only in deliverance from death, but admission to everlasting life; a far more noble and excellent life than that which we lost by Adam’s fall. <span class="ital">That as sin hath reigned unto death </span>— In the wide and universal destruction made of those whom it had brought under that fatal sentence; <span class="ital">so grace might reign </span>— Which could not reign before the fall, before man had sinned; <span class="ital">through righteousness </span>— Imputed, implanted, and practised; through the justification of men’s persons, the renovation of their nature, and their practical obedience to God’s holy law; <span class="ital">unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord </span>— Here is pointed out, 1st, The source of all our blessings, the rich and free grace of God. 2d, The meritorious cause; not any works or righteousness of man, but the alone merits of our Lord Jesus Christ. 3d, The effect or end of all; not only pardon, but life, divine life, leading to glory. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:15-19 Through one man's offence, all mankind are exposed to eternal condemnation. But the grace and mercy of God, and the free gift of righteousness and salvation, are through Jesus Christ, as man: yet the Lord from heaven has brought the multitude of believers into a more safe and exalted state than that from which they fell in Adam. This free gift did not place them anew in a state of trial, but fixed them in a state of justification, as Adam would have been placed, had he stood. Notwithstanding the differences, there is a striking similarity. As by the offence of one, sin and death prevailed to the condemnation of all men, so by the righteousness of one, grace prevailed to the justification of all related to Christ by faith. Through the grace of God, the gift by grace has abounded to many through Christ; yet multitudes choose to remain under the dominion of sin and death, rather than to apply for the blessings of the reign of grace. But Christ will in nowise cast out any who are willing to come to him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/romans/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Therefore - Wherefore (&#x391;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1; &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#834;&#x3bd;  ara oun). This is properly a summing up, a recapitulation of what had been stated in the previous verses. The apostle resumes the statement or proposition made in <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/5-12.htm">Romans 5:12</a>, and after the intermediate explanation in the parenthesis <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/5-13.htm">Romans 5:13-17</a>, in this verse and the following, sums up the whole subject. The explanation, therefore, of the previous verses is designed to convey the real meaning of <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/5-18.htm">Romans 5:18-19</a>.<p>As by the offence of one - Admitting this as an undisputed and everywhere apparent fact, a fact which no one can call in question.<p>Judgment came - This is not in the Greek, but it is evidently implied, and is stated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-16.htm">Romans 5:16</a>. The meaning is, that all have been brought under the reign of death by one man.<p>Upon all men - The whole race. This explains what is meant by "the many" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-15.htm">Romans 5:15</a>.<p>To condemnation - <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-16.htm">Romans 5:16</a>.<p>Even so - In the manner explained in the previous verses. With the same certainty, and to the same extent. The apostle does not explain the mode in which it was done, but simply scares the fact.<p>By the righteousness of one - This stands opposed to the one offence of Adam, and must mean, therefore, the holiness, obedience, purity of the Redeemer. The sin of one man involved people in ruin; the obedience unto death of the other <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-8.htm">Philippians 2:8</a> restored them to the favor of God.<p>Came upon all men - (&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;  eis pantas anthro&#772;pous. Was with reference to all people; had a bearing upon all people; was originally adapted to the race. As the sin of Adam was of such a nature in the relation in which he stood as to affect all the race, so the work of Christ in the relation in which he stood was adapted also to all the race. As the tendency of the one was to involve the race in condemnation, so the tendency of the other was to restore them to acceptance with God. There was an original applicability in the work of Christ to all people - a richness, a fulness of the atonement suited to meet the sins of the entire world, and restore the race to favor.<p>Unto justification of life - With reference to that justification which is connected with eternal life. That is, his work is adapted to produce acceptance with God, to the same extent as the crime of Adam has affected the race by involving them in sin and misery The apostle does not affirm that in fact as many will be affected by the one as by the other; but that it is suited to meet all the consequences of the fall; to be as wide-spread in its effects; and go be as salutary as that had been ruinous. This is all that the argument requires. Perhaps there could not be found a more striking declaration any where, that the work of Christ had an original applicability to all people; or that it is in its own nature suited to save all. The course of argument here leads inevitably to this; nor is it possible to avoid it without doing violence to the obvious and fair course of the discussion.<p>It does not prove that all will in fact be saved, but that the plan is suited to meet all the evils of the fall. A certain kind of medicine may have an original applicability to heal all persons under the same disease; and may be abundant and certain, and yet in fact be applied to few. The sun is suited to give light to all, yet many may be blind, or may voluntarily close their eyes. Water is adapted to the needs of all people, and the supply may be ample for the human family, yet in fact, from various causes, many may be deprived of it. So of the provisions of the plan of redemption. They are adapted to all; they are ample, and yet in fact, from causes which this is not the place to explain, the benefits, like those of medicine, water, science, etc. may never be enjoyed by all the race. Calvin concurs in this interpretation, and thus shows, that it is one which commends itself even to the most strenuous advocates of the system which is called by his name. He says, "He (the apostle) makes the grace common to all, because it is offered to all, not because it is in fact applied to all. For although Christ suffered for the sins or the whole world (nam etsi passus est Christus pro peccatis totius mundi), and it is offered to all without distinction (indifferenter), yet all do not embrace it." See Cal. Commentary on this place.  <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/romans/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18. Therefore&#8212;now at length resuming the unfinished comparison of Ro 5:12, in order to give formally the concluding member of it, which had been done once and again substantially, in the intermediate verses.<p>as by the offence of one judgment came&#8212;or, more simply, "it came."<p>upon all men to condenmation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came&#8212;rather, "it came."<p>upon all men to justification of life&#8212;(So Calvin, Bengel, Olshausen, Tholuck, Hodge, Philippi). But better, as we judge: "As through one offense it [came] upon all men to condemnation; even so through one righteousness [it came] upon all men to justification of life"&#8212;(So Beza, Grotius, Ferme, Meyer, De Wette, Alford, Revised Version). In this case, the apostle, resuming the statement of Ro 5:12, expresses it in a more concentrated and vivid form&#8212;suggested no doubt by the expression in Ro 5:16, "through one offense," representing Christ's whole work, considered as the ground of our justification, as "ONE RIGHTEOUSNESS." (Some would render the peculiar word here employed, "one righteous act" [Alford, &c.]; understanding by it Christ's death as the one redeeming act which reversed the one undoing act of Adam. But this is to limit the apostle's idea too much; for as the same word is properly rendered "righteousness" in Ro 8:4, where it means "the righteousness of the law as fulfilled by us who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit," so here it denotes Christ's whole "obedience unto death," considered as the one meritorious ground of the reversal of the condemnation which came by Adam. But on this, and on the expression, "all men," see on [2200]Ro 5:19. The expression "justification of life," is a vivid combination of two ideas already expatiated upon, meaning "justification entitling to and issuing in the rightful possession and enjoyment of life").<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/romans/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Here, after a long parenthesis, the apostle returns to what he had begun to say in <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-12.htm" title="Why, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed on all men, for that all have sinned:">Romans 5:12</a></span>; and now he makes the comparison full in both members, which there, by reason of intervening matter, was left imperfect, as I before hinted. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Judgment; </span> guilt, which exposeth to judgment. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Came upon all men; </span> all the posterity, or natural seed, of the first Adam. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The free gift; </span> that which all along he calls <span class="ital">the free gift, </span> seems to be the benefit believers have by Christ’s obedience. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Came upon all men; </span> not all universally, but all sorts of men indifferently, Gentiles as well as Jews; or all that are his spiritual seed.

Or by one offence, as before, the guilt of which is imputed to, and <p>judgment came upon all men to condemnation; which word is used in a legal sense, and intends condemnation to eternal death, as appears from the antithesis in the text; for if "justification of life", means an adjudging to eternal life, as it certainly does, the judgment or guilt, which is unto condemnation, must design a condemnation to eternal death, the just wages of sin: and this sentence of condemnation comes upon all men, all the sons of Adam without exception, even upon the elect of God themselves; though it is not executed upon them, but on their surety, whereby they are delivered from it: <p>even so by the righteousness of one, the free gift came upon all men to justification of life; the righteousness of Christ being freely imputed without works, as it is to all the men that belong to the second Adam, to all his seed and offspring, is their justification of life, or what adjudges and entitles them to eternal life. The sentence of justification was conceived in the mind of God from eternity, when his elect were ordained unto eternal life, on the foot of his Son's righteousness; this passed on Christ at his resurrection from the dead, and on all his people as considered in him, when they, in consequence of it, were quickened together with him; and this passes upon the conscience of a sinner at believing, when he may, as he should, reckon himself alive unto God, and is what gives him a right and title to everlasting life and glory. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/romans/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{17}</span> Therefore as by the offence of one <i>judgment came</i> upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one <i>the free gift came</i> upon all men unto <span class="cverse3">{x}</span> justification of life.</span><p>(17) Therefore, to be short, as by one man's offence the guiltiness came on all men to make them subject to death, so on the opposite side, the righteousness of Christ, which by God's mercy is imputed to all believers, justifies them, that they may become partakers of everlasting life.<p>(x) Not only because our sins are forgiven us, but also because the righteousness of Christ is imputed to us.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/romans/5.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-18.htm" title="Therefore as by the offense of one judgment came on all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came on all men to justification of life.">Romans 5:18</a> f.

It is the One declaration of what is now of right, that is, the judicial verdict of the being reconciled, which took place on the part of God on the ground of Christ’s sacrificial death—<span class="ital">the consequence therefore, of</span> His <span class="greekheb">ὑπακοή</span> rendered in death—and which so far may appear as the antithesis to the fall of Adam with the same right as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-15.htm" title="But not as the offense, so also is the free gift. For if through the offense of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, has abounded to many.">Romans 5:15</a> the grace and gift were adduced as the contrast to that fall. To take the <span class="greekheb">ἑνός</span> as <span class="ital">masculine</span> (Vulgate, Theodoret, Theophylact, Erasmus, Luther, Calvin, and many others, including Tholuck, Fritzsche, Nielsen, Picard, Klöpper, Philippi, and Hofmann), is, seeing that no article is annexed, unwarranted according to the analogy of the immediate context, vv 17, 19; or Paul would have only expressed himself in a way liable to be misunderstood (how differently in ver 16!). Equally unwarranted is it to conceive the verb to be supplied in the apodosis as <span class="ital">in the future</span> (Philippi, Dietzsch). The judicial verdict <span class="ital">is given</span> and <span class="ital">has redounded</span> once and for ever to justification of eternal life for all; that is the great historical fact of salvation, which Paul has in view and sets forth as a concrete event (not under the point of view of a timeless abstraction, as Rothe thought) without considering how far it is now or in the future appropriated through faith by the subjects.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In both halves of the verse <span class="greekheb">πάντες ἄνθρωποι</span> is simply <span class="ital">all men</span>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-12.htm" title="Why, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed on all men, for that all have sinned:">Romans 5:12</a>. At the same time it must be noted that in the second half the relation is conceived in its <span class="ital">objectivity</span>. On the part of God it has come to justification for <span class="ital">all;</span> thus the case stands <span class="ital">objectively;</span> the <span class="ital">subjective attainment</span> of this universal justification, the realisation of it for the <span class="ital">individuals</span>, depends upon whether the latter believingly apprehend the <span class="greekheb">δικαίωμα</span> for their own subjective <span class="greekheb">δικαίωσις</span>, or unbelievingly reject it. This dependence on a subjective condition, however, did not belong to the scope of our passage, in which the only object was to set forth the all-embracing blessed objective consequence of the <span class="greekheb">ἓ δικαίωμα</span>, in contrast to the all-destructive objective consequence of the <span class="greekheb">ἕν παράπτωμα</span>. Hence just as little can anything be deduced from our passage as from <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-32.htm" title="For God has concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy on all.">Romans 11:32</a> in favour of a final <span class="greekheb">ἀποκατάστασις</span>. The distinction imported by Hofmann and Lechler: that <span class="greekheb">πάντες ἄνθρωποι</span> means all <span class="ital">without distinction</span>, and <span class="greekheb">πάντες οἱ ἄνθρωποι</span>, on the other hand, all <span class="ital">without exception</span>, the <span class="ital">sum total</span> of mankind, is purely fanciful; <span class="greekheb">πάντες</span> means <span class="ital">omnes, nemine excepto</span>, alike whether the substantive belonging to it, in accordance with the connection, has or has not the article (“articulus, cum sensus fert additus vel omissus, discrimen sententiae non facit,” Ellendt, <span class="ital">Lex.

Only when the article stands <span class="ital">before</span> <span class="greekheb">πάντες</span> (consequently <span class="greekheb">οἱ πάντες ἄνθ</span>.) does <span class="ital">the</span> distinction emerge, that we have to think of “<span class="ital">cunctos</span> sive <span class="ital">universos</span>, i. e. singulos <span class="ital">in unum corpus colligatos</span>” (Ellendt, p. 521); comp Krüger, § 50, 11, 12; Kühner, II. 1, p. 545.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1335] <span class="greekheb">Ἄρα</span>, “ad internam potius causam spectat,” <span class="greekheb">οὖν</span>, “magis ad externam,” Klotz, <span class="ital">ad Devar.</span> p. 717.

So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.">Romans 7:25</a>, and often in Paul) the conclusion of the argument is introduced. It is simplest to take <span class="greekheb">ἑνὸς</span> in both clauses as neuter. “As through one offence the result for all men was condemnation, so also through one righteous act the result for all men is justification of life.” The result in both cases is mediated; in the former, by men’s actual sin; in the latter, by their faith in Christ. It has been questioned whether <span class="greekheb">δικαίωμα</span> can mean a “righteous act,”—that which Christ achieved in His death, conceived as one thing commanding the approval of God. This sense seems to be required by the contrast with <span class="greekheb">παράπτωμα</span>, but Meyer and others argue that, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-16.htm" title="And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift: for the judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many offenses to justification.">Romans 5:16</a>, the meaning must be “a sentence of justification”. “Through one justifying sentence (pronounced over the world because of Christ’s death) the result for all men is justification of life.” But this justifying sentence <span class="ital">in vacuo</span> is alien to the realism of Paul’s thinking, and no strain is put upon <span class="greekheb">δικαίωμα</span> (especially when we observe its correspondence with <span class="greekheb">παράπτωμα</span>) in making it signify Christ’s work as a thing in which righteousness is, so to speak, embodied. Lightfoot (<span class="ital">Notes on Epistles of St. Paul</span>, p. 292) adopts this meaning, “a righteous deed,” and quotes Arist., <span class="ital">Rhet.</span>, i., 13, <span class="greekheb">τὰ ἀδικήματα πάντα καὶ τὰ δικαιώματα</span>, and <span class="ital">Etk. Nic.</span>, v., 7 (10): <span class="greekheb">καλεῖται δὲ μᾶλλον δικαιοπράγημα τὸ κοινόν</span>: <span class="greekheb">δικαίωμα δὲ τὸ ἐπανόρθωμα τοῦ ἀδικήματος</span>. This sense of an act by which an injustice is rectified is exactly suitable here. Through this the result for all men is <span class="greekheb">δικαίωσις ζωῆς</span>: for the genitive, see Winer, p. 235. Simcox, <span class="ital">Language of the N.T.</span>, 85. When God justifies the sinner, he enters into and inherits life. But Lightfoot makes it <span class="ital">Genesis appos.</span><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/romans/5.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">18</span>. <span class="ital">Therefore</span>] In <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/5-18.htm" title="Therefore as by the offense of one judgment came on all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came on all men to justification of life....">Romans 5:18-19</a> the argument, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-12.htm" title="Why, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed on all men, for that all have sinned:">Romans 5:12</a>, is summed up as to its main substance; namely, the parallel of Adam and Christ; the illustration of the work of Christ by Adam’s position in respect of his descendants and the effect on them of his sin.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">as by the offence of one</span>] Better, <span class="bld">as by one offence</span>, as in marg. E. V.—The Gr. is elliptical here. We may supply “the result was,” in each part of the verse; <span class="bld">as through one offence the result was, unto all men, to condemnation; so through one righteous act the result was, unto all men, to justification of life</span>.—The word rendered here <span class="bld">righteous act</span> is the same as that rendered “acquittal” in the note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-16.htm" title="And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift: for the judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many offenses to justification.">Romans 5:16</a>, q.v. Its strict original meaning is a <span class="ital">thing righteously done</span>. Its usual actual meaning is <span class="ital">an ordinance of justice</span>. But in one N. T. passage at least it appears to mean <span class="ital">a righteous act</span> or course of acts. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-8.htm" title="And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white: for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints.">Revelation 19:8</a>, “the <span class="ital">righteousnesses</span> of the saints.”) It thus is possible to interpret it in one place here as an <span class="ital">ordinance of acquittal</span>, in the other as the great <span class="ital">Acts of righteousness</span> (which becomes also, as it were, a <span class="ital">statute</span> of righteousness,) done by the Redeemer for His brethren. Such a change of reference is not alien to St Paul’s style.—If, however, the interpretation <span class="ital">righteous ordinance</span> should seem more necessary than it seems to us, it would fairly suit the context. Christ’s obedience is (as suggested just above) viewed thus as the embodied ordinance, or institute, of Justification. This last, on the whole, is Meyer’s explanation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">all men … all men</span>] What is the reference of these words in the two cases respectively? In the first, certainly, <span class="ital">all mankind</span> is meant. Every man, not in theory only but fact, incurred sentence of death in Adam. In the second case also, many commentators, (e.g. Meyer,) hold that all mankind is intended: not that all actually receive justification, but that all are within the scope of Christ’s work. Without entering on the profound question of the Divine Intentions, and merely seeking for St Paul’s <span class="ital">special thought here</span>, we prefer to take the second “all men” <span class="ital">with a limit</span>, as meaning “all who are connected with the Second Adam;” all “His brethren.” For through this whole context St Paul is dealing with results and facts, not with abstract theory. From the dreadful fact of the result of death from the Fall he reasons to the results of Christ’s work; and the parallel would be most imperfect (and such as precisely to <span class="ital">contradict</span> the “<span class="ital">much more</span>” of <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-15.htm" title="But not as the offense, so also is the free gift. For if through the offense of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, has abounded to many.">Romans 5:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-17.htm" title="For if by one man's offense death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.)">Romans 5:17</a>,) if while in the one case condemnation was a fact and act, Justification should be only a possibility in the other. If Adam brings death in <span class="ital">fact</span> on all concerned, Christ must bring life <span class="ital">in fact</span> on all concerned also. Again, a limitation is suggested by the whole reasoning of the Epistle, and specially by <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-30.htm" title="Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.">Romans 8:30</a>, where the justified are identical with the “foreknown” and “glorified,” in the plain sense of the passage.—The use of “all men” with this change of reference is fairly illustrated by <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/15-22.htm" title="For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive....">1 Corinthians 15:22-23</a>. For through that whole ch. the Resurrection <span class="ital">of the Church</span> is the sole subject; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-23.htm" title="But every man in his own order: Christ the first fruits; afterward they that are Christ's at his coming.">1 Corinthians 15:23</a> explicitly refers to “them that are Christ’s:” and yet, when the parallel of Adam and Christ is in view, the word “all” is equally used there in both cases.—See for other illustrations, though less exact, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-32.htm" title="And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to me.">John 12:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-11.htm" title="For the grace of God that brings salvation has appeared to all men,">Titus 2:11</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The view of Christ as the Head of <span class="ital">all Mankind</span> is, to say the least, far less distinct in Scripture than that of Christ as the Head of <span class="ital">justified Mankind</span>, the true Church.
