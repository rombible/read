The Christian is entirely freed from the law of sin and death, and from the condemnation that it entails. But he is so upon the condition that this freedom is for him a reality—that it really proceeds from the indwelling Spirit of Christ.<p>(1) <span class= "bld">Therefore.</span>—The Apostle had already, at the end of the last chapter, “touched the confines” of that state of deliverance and of liberty which he is now going on to describe. The opening of this chapter is, therefore, connected in form with the close of the last. The intervention of Christ puts an end to the struggle waged within the soul. There is <span class= "ital">therefore</span> no condemnation, &c.<p><span class= "bld">Condemnation.</span>—The condemnation which in the present and final judgment of God impends over the sinner, is removed by the intervention of Christ, and by the union of the believer with Him. By that union the power and empire of sin are thrown off and destroyed. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-3.htm" title="For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:">Romans 8:3</a>.) There is a certain play on the word “condemn.” By “condemning” the law of sin, Christ <span class= "ital">removed</span> “condemnation” from the sinner. He removed it objectively, or in the nature of things, and this removal is completed subjectively in the individual through that bond of mystical and moral attachment which makes what Christ has done his own act and deed.<p><span class= "bld">To them which are in Christ Jesus.</span>—Those “who live and move and have their (spiritual) being” in Christ. To “have the Spirit of Christ” is a converse expression for the same idea. In the one case the believer is regarded as reaching upwards, as it were, through faith, and so incorporating and uniting himself with the Spirit of Christ; in the other case, the Spirit of Christ reaches downwards and infuses itself into the believer. This is the peculiar mysticism of the Apostle.<p><span class= "bld">Who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.</span>—These words are wanting in the foremost representatives of every group of authorities (except, perhaps, those which belong to the region of Syria), and must certainly be omitted.

God forbid: yes, we establish the law.">Romans 3:31</a>, that the doctrine of justification by faith made void the law, the apostle here proceeds, with great feeling and energy, to display the many powerful motives which that doctrine, as explained in the preceding chapters, suggests, for engaging both the understanding and the affections of believers to a continued pursuit of holiness. The first motive which he mentions is that contained in this verse, that now, under the new dispensation of the covenant of grace, namely, that of the Messiah, <span class="ital">there is no condemnation </span>to true believers, who walk as he here describes, although they may not observe the ceremonies of the Mosaic law. “This greatest of all considerations the apostle begins with, after having pathetically described the terror of the awakened sinner arising from his consciousness of guilt, because if mercy were not with God, he could neither be loved nor obeyed by men.” <span class="ital">There is therefore now </span>— In respect of all that has been advanced, since things are as has been shown; <span class="ital">no condemnation </span>— From God, either for things present or past.

By their union with Christ through faith, they are thus secured. What is the principle of their walk; the flesh or the Spirit, the old or the new nature, corruption or grace? For which of these do we make provision, by which are we governed? The unrenewed will is unable to keep any commandment fully. And the law, besides outward duties, requires inward obedience. God showed abhorrence of sin by the sufferings of his Son in the flesh, that the believer's person might be pardoned and justified. Thus satisfaction was made to Divine justice, and the way of salvation opened for the sinner. By the Spirit the law of love is written upon the heart, and though the righteousness of the law is not fulfilled by us, yet, blessed be God, it is fulfilled in us; there is that in all true believers, which answers the intention of the law. The favour of God, the welfare of the soul, the concerns of eternity, are the things of the Spirit, which those that are after the Spirit do mind. Which way do our thoughts move with most pleasure? Which way go our plans and contrivances? Are we most wise for the world, or for our souls? Those that live in pleasure are dead, 1Ti 5:6. A sanctified soul is a living soul; and that life is peace. The carnal mind is not only an enemy to God, but enmity itself. The carnal man may, by the power of Divine grace, be made subject to the law of God, but the carnal mind never can; that must be broken and driven out. We may know our real state and character by inquiring whether we have the Spirit of God and Christ, or not, ver. 9. Ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit. Having the Spirit of Christ, means having a turn of mind in some degree like the mind that was in Christ Jesus, and is to be shown by a life and conversation suitable to his precepts and example.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/romans/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>There is, therefore, now - This is connected with the closing verses of <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/7.htm">Romans 7</a>. The apostle had there shown that the Law could not effect deliverance from sin, but that such deliverance was to be traced to the gospel alone; <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/7-23.htm">Romans 7:23-25</a>. It is implied here that there was condemnation under the Law, and would be still, but for the intervention of the gospel.<p>No condemnation - This does not mean that sin in believers is not to be condemned as much as any where, for the contrary is everywhere taught in the Scriptures; but it means,<p>(1) That the gospel does not pronounce condemnation like the Law. Its function is to pardon; the function of the law is to condemn. The one never affords deliverance, but always condemns; the object of the other is to free from condemnation, and to set the soul at liberty.<p>(2) there is no final condemnation under the gospel. The function, design, and tendency of the gospel is to free from the condemning sentence of law. This is its first and its glorious announcement, that it frees lost and ruined people from a most fearful and terrible condemnation.<p>(The first verse of this chapter seems to be an inference from the whole preceding discussion. The apostle having established the doctrine of justification, and answered the objections commonly urged against it, now asserts his triumphant conclusion, "There is therefore, etc.; that is to say, it follows from all that has been said concerning the believer's justification by the righteousness of Christ, and his complete deliverance from the Law as a covenant, that to him there can be no condemnation. The design of Paul is not so much to assert the different functions of the Law and the gospel, as simply to state the fact in regard to the condition of a certain class, namely, those who are in Christ. To them there is no condemnation whatever; not only no final condemnation, but no condemnation now, from the moment of their union to Christ, and deliverance from the curse of the Law. The reason is this: that Christ hath endured the penalty, and obeyed the precept of the Law in their stead.<p>"Here," says Mr. Haldane on the passage, "it is often remarked that the apostle does not say, that there is in them (believers) neither matter of accusation, nor cause of condemnation; and yet this is all included in what he does say. And afterward, in express terms, he denies that they can be either accused or condemned, which they might be, were there any ground for either. All that was condemnable in them, which was sin, has been condemned in their Surety, as is shown in the third verse.")<p>Which are in Christ Jesus - Who are united to Christ. To be in him is an expression not seldom used in the New Testament, denoting close and intimate union. <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-1.htm">Philippians 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-9.htm">Philippians 3:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/16-7.htm">Romans 16:7-11</a>. The union between Christ and his people is compared to that between the vine and its branches <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/15-1.htm">John 15:1-6</a>, and hence, believers are said to be in him in a similar sense, as deriving their support from him, and as united in feeling, in purpose, and destiny. (See the supplementary note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-10.htm">Romans 8:10</a>.) Who walk. Who conduct, or live. Note, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-12.htm">Romans 4:12</a>. Not after the flesh. Who do not live to gratify the corrupt desires and passions of the flesh; Note, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-18.htm">Romans 7:18</a>. This is a characteristic of a Christian. What it is to walk after the flesh may be seen in <a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/5-19.htm">Galatians 5:19-21</a>. It follows that a man whose purpose of life is to gratify his corrupt desires, cannot be a Christian. Unless he lives not to gratify his flesh, he can have no evidence of piety. This is a test which is easily applied; and if every professor of religion were honest, there could be no danger of mistake, and there need be no doubts about his true character.<p>But after the Spirit - As the Holy Spirit would lead or prompt. What the Spirit produces may be seen in <a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-23</a>. If a man has these fruits of the Spirit, he is a Christian; if not, he is a stranger to religion, whatever else he may possess. And this test also is easily applied. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/romans/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 8<p>Ro 8:1-39. Conclusion of the Whole Argument&#8212;The Glorious Completeness of Them That Are in Christ Jesus.<p>In this surpassing chapter the several streams of the preceding argument meet and flow in one "river of the water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb," until it seems to lose itself in the ocean of a blissful eternity.<p>First: The Sanctification of Believers (Ro 8:1-13).<p>1. There is therefore now, &c.&#8212;referring to the immediately preceding context [Olshausen, Philippi, Meyer, Alford, &c.]. The subject with which the seventh chapter concludes is still under consideration. The scope of Ro 8:1-4 is to show how "the law of sin and death" is deprived of its power to bring believers again into bondage, and how the holy law of God receives in them the homage of a living obedience [Calvin, Fraser, Philippi, Meyer, Alford, &c.].<p>no condemnation: to them which are in Christ Jesus&#8212;As Christ, who "knew no sin," was, to all legal effects, "made sin for us," so are we, who believe in Him, to all legal effects, "made the righteousness of God in Him" (2Co 5:21); and thus, one with Him in the divine reckoning. there is to such "NO CONDEMNATION." (Compare Joh 3:18; 5:24; Ro 5:18, 19).

The apostle having discoursed largely in the preceding chapter, concerning the struggle and combat believers feel within themselves, and opened the true causes and reasons of the saints' grievances and complaints, and what gives them the greatest uneasiness in this life, proceeds in this to take notice of the solid ground and foundation they have of spiritual peace and joy; which arise from their justification and adoption, the purposes and decrees of God, and particularly the everlasting and unchangeable love of God in Christ, the source, spring, and security, of all the blessings of grace. The chapter begins with a most comfortable account of the safety of believers in Christ; the apostle does not say there is nothing condemnable in them, for sin is in them and is condemnable, and condemned by them; and is hurtful to their spiritual joy and comfort, though it cannot bring them into condemnation, because of their being in Christ Jesus: he says there is , "not one condemnation" to them, or one sentence of condemnation against them; which must be understood not of illegal ones, for they are liable to many condemnations from their hearts, from the world and the devil; but of legal, justifiable ones, and there are none such, neither from God the Father, for he justifies; nor from the Son, for by his righteousness they are justified; nor from the Holy Spirit, who bears witness to their spirits, that they are in a state of justification: there is not one condemnation lies against them, with respect to their numerous sins, original and actual, though every sin deserves one; not one from the law of God, of which sin is a transgression, for though that is a condemning law, yet it is only so to them that are under it; not to them that are Christ's, whom he has redeemed from it: moreover, the apostle says, that there is no condemnation now to the saints; which "now" must not be considered, as if it supposes that there was formerly condemnation to them; it is true indeed they were under a sentence of condemnation, as considered in Adam, and under a covenant of works with him, and in their own apprehensions when convicted; but as considered in Christ, as the elect of God always were, and who was their surety, and so their security from all eternity, they never were in a state of condemnation: nor does this suppose, that there may be condemnation to them hereafter, though not now; for sin, the cause of condemnation, is removed; Christ has bore the condemnation their sins deserved in himself; their justification is from all sin, past, present, and to come; their union to Christ is indissoluble, and neither the love of Christ, nor the justice of God, will admit of their condemnation; for this "now", is not an "adverb" of time, but a "note of illation"; the apostle inferring this privilege, either from the grace of God, which issues in eternal life, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>; or from that certain deliverance believers shall have from sin, for which he gives thanks, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-24.htm">Romans 7:24</a>; The privilege itself here mentioned is, "no condemnation": condemnation is sometimes put for the cause of it, which is sin, original and actual; now though God's elect are sinners, both by nature and practice, and after conversion have sin in them, their sanctification being imperfect, yet there is none in them with respect to justification; all is transferred to Christ, and he has removed all away; he has procured the pardon of all by his blood, he has abolished all by his sacrifice, he justifies from all by his righteousness, and saves his people from all their sins: condemnation may also be considered with respect to guilt; all mankind are guilty of Adam's sin, and are guilty creatures, as they are actual transgressors of the law; and when convinced by the Spirit of God, acknowledge themselves to be so; and upon the repetition of sin, contract fresh guilt on their consciences; but an heart sprinkled with the blood of Christ, is clear of guilt; for all the guilt of sin is removed to Christ, and he has took it away; hence there is no obligation to punishment on them, for whom Christ died: again, condemnation may design the sentence of it: now though the law's sentence passed upon all in Adam, and so upon God's elect, as considered in him; yet as this sentence has been executed on Christ, as their surety, in their room and stead, there is none lies against them: once more, condemnation may mean actual damnation, or eternal death, the wages of sin, which those who are in Christ shall never die; they are ordained to eternal life, and are redeemed from this death; they are made alive by Christ, and have eternal life secured to them in him, and which they shall certainly enjoy: the persons interested in this privilege are described, as such <p>which are in Christ Jesus; not as mere professors are in Christ, who may be lost and damned: but this being in Christ, respects either that union and interest which the elect of God have in Christ, from everlasting: being loved by him with an everlasting love; betrothed to him in a conjugal relation; chosen in him before the foundation of the world; united to him as members to an head; considered in him in the covenant of grace, when he engaged for them as their surety; and so they were preserved in him, notwithstanding their fall in Adam; in time he took upon him their nature, and represented them in it; they were reckoned in him when he hung upon the cross, was buried, rose again, and sat down in heavenly places; in consequence of which union to Christ, and being in him, they are secure from all condemnation: or this may respect an open and manifestative being in Christ at conversion, when they become new creatures, pass from death to life, and so shall never enter into condemnation: hence they stand further described, as such <p>who walk not after the flesh; by which is meant, not the ceremonial law, but the corruption of nature, or the corrupt nature of man, called "flesh"; because propagated by carnal generation, has for its object fleshly things, discovers itself mostly in the flesh, and makes persons carnal and fleshly; the apostle does not say, there is no condemnation to them that have no flesh in them, for this regenerate persons have; nor to them that are in the flesh, that is, the body; but who walk not after the flesh, that is, corrupt nature; and it denotes such, who do not follow the dictates of it, do not make it their guide, or go on and persist in a continued series of sinning: <p>but after the spirit, by which is meant, not spiritual worship, in opposition to carnal ordinances; but rather, either a principle of grace, in opposition to corrupt nature, called "Spirit", from the author, subject, and nature of it; or the Holy Spirit of God, the efficient cause of all grace: to walk after him, is to make him our guide, to follow his dictates, influences, and directions; as such do, who walk by faith on Christ, and in imitation of him, in the ways of righteousness and holiness; and such persons walk pleasantly, cheerfully, and safely: now let it be observed, that this walk and conversation of the saints, is not the cause of there being no condemnation to them; but is descriptive of the persons interested in such a privilege; and is evidential of their right unto it, as well as of their being in Christ: and it may be further observed, that there must be union to Christ, or a being in him, before there can be walking after the Spirit. The phrase, "but after the Spirit", is left out in the Alexandrian copy, and in the Vulgate Latin, and Syriac versions; and the whole description of the persons in some copies, and in the Ethiopic version. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/romans/8.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><i>There is</i> <span class="cverse3">{1}</span> therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who <span class="cverse3">{2}</span> walk not after the <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> flesh, but after the Spirit.</span><p>(1) A conclusion of all the former discussion, from Ro 1:16 to this verse: seeing that we, being justified by faith in Christ, obtain remission of sins and imputation of righteousness, and are also sanctified, it follows from this that those who are grafted into Christ by faith, need have no fear of condemnation.<p>(2) The fruits of the Spirit, or effects of sanctification, which are begun in us, do not ingraft us into Christ, but declare that we are grafted into him.<p>(a) Do not follow the flesh as their guide: for he is not said to live after the flesh that has the Holy Spirit for his guide, even though he sometimes takes a step off of the path.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/romans/8.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-1.htm" title="There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.">Romans 8:1</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἄρα</span>] draws an inference from the immediately preceding <span class="greekheb">αὐτὸς ἐγώ</span>.… <span class="greekheb">ἁμαρτίας</span>.

To the discussion of the inner conflict just previous? Or to something remoter in the argument? The text is sometimes so printed as to carry on the connexion unbroken from ch. 7 some distance into this ch., and thus to make the discussion in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/7-7.htm" title="What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. No, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, You shall not covet....">Romans 7:7-25</a> the premiss of this “therefore.” But against this we think that, (<span class="ital">a</span>), both in contents and in tone, ch. 8 is a whole in itself, with one grand topic, the Security of the Saints, traceable throughout; and that (<span class="ital">b</span>) there is nothing in the last paragraphs of ch. 7 to <span class="ital">suggest directly</span> the present statement, though much to illustrate and enforce it. Had ch. 7 <span class="ital">ended</span> with “I thank God, through Jesus Christ our Lord,” it might have <span class="ital">seemed</span> otherwise, (though see note on those words;) but ch. 7 actually ends with the strongest assertion of the sin-awaking and sin-detecting power of the Law and the consequent strife of the soul. It is thus far better to refer this exordium of ch. 8 to the <span class="ital">whole</span> previous argument, but specially to such parts of it as detail the way of Justification. More specially still it is connected with chh. 5 and 6, and the first section of ch. 7, which state (under various imagery) the union of the justified with their Head, Master, and Bridegroom.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Hitherto the Epistle has discussed and explained, from many sides, the great matter of Justification, and its immediate results, (union with Christ, bondservice to God, the liberation of the will, &c.). The last topic thus considered is the <span class="ital">attitude of the Law</span> towards the soul—an attitude such that the Law cannot (in the regenerate or unregenerate) <span class="ital">subdue</span> sin, but can only expose and condemn it. This has been shewn partly to vindicate the holiness of the Law, partly to expose the malignity of sin, partly to re-inforce the truth, already proved, that Justification is to be attained by another way.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Now, to the close of ch. 8, the argument (without wholly leaving former topics and reasonings) rises to a fuller view of present results, and to the first full statement of the eternal Sequel. It is needless to point out the majesty and splendour which mark the whole passage.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">no condemnation</span>] The word “<span class="ital">no</span>” is strongly emphatic in the Greek. The Gr. for “<span class="ital">condemnation</span>” here occurs elsewhere in N. T. only ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-16.htm" title="And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift: for the judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many offenses to justification.">Romans 5:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-18.htm" title="Therefore as by the offense of one judgment came on all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came on all men to justification of life.">Romans 5:18</a>. The cognate verb is frequent, and occurs e. g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/16-16.htm" title="He that believes and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believes not shall be damned.">Mark 16:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-32.htm" title="But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.">1 Corinthians 11:32</a> (last clause). As regards the soul, the verb means <span class="ital">to pass sentence of death</span>. Such sentence “<span class="ital">is not</span>,” for those who are in Christ; they “shall not come into condemnation, but are passed from death unto life.” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-24.htm" title="Truly, truly, I say to you, He that hears my word, and believes on him that sent me, has everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death to life.">John 5:24</a>.) “Who is he that condemneth?” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-34.htm" title="Who is he that comdemns? It is Christ that died, yes rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also makes intercession for us.">Romans 8:34</a>.)<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Observe that the word “<span class="ital">is</span>” is not in the Gr. There is no specification of time. Q. d., “such a condemnation is inconceivable.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in Christ Jesus</span>] See for parallels to this important phrase, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-11.htm" title="Likewise reckon you also yourselves to be dead indeed to sin, but alive to God through Jesus Christ our Lord.">Romans 6:11</a>, (E. V. “<span class="ital">through</span>, &c.,”) <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-5.htm" title="So we, being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another.">Romans 12:5</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-7.htm" title="Salute Andronicus and Junia, my kinsmen, and my fellow-prisoners, who are of note among the apostles, who also were in Christ before me.">Romans 16:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-2.htm" title="To the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, with all that in every place call on the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and our's:">1 Corinthians 1:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-18.htm" title="Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished.">1 Corinthians 15:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-17.htm" title="Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>, &c. And cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-30.htm" title="For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.">Ephesians 5:30</a>, where the key to its special meaning appears. The brethren of the Second Adam are regarded as <span class="ital">solidaire</span> with Him in the sense both of holy dearness and inseparable interest; specially the latter. The former idea is conveyed rather under the figure of the Spouse; the latter under that of the Body and the Head.—The whole previous argument of the Epistle makes it plain that those who are “in Christ” are those who have been “justified through faith.” (Ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-1.htm" title="Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ:">Romans 5:1</a>.). No merely external position of opportunity or privilege can satisfy the phrase, in view of such a verse as this, or as <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-17.htm" title="Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>. On the other hand, the phrase (strictly speaking) indicates not the <span class="ital">inner experience</span> of the justified—which rather appears in the phrase of “<span class="ital">Christ in them</span>” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-27.htm" title=" To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory:">Colossians 1:27</a>, &c.,)—but their <span class="ital">standing and interest</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">who walk</span>, &c.] Better, <span class="bld">walking, as they do, not according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit</span>. If these words are retained, they must be taken as a <span class="ital">description</span> rather than a <span class="ital">definition</span>. The <span class="ital">condition</span> of freedom from doom is, to “be in Christ Jesus;” but that happy position does, as a fact, result in, and so is characterized by, a “walk after the Spirit.” The words will thus serve as a caution against the abuse of the doctrine of gratuitous justification; <span class="ital">but not as a modification of it</span>. The point is admirably elucidated by Calvin’s remark, that “it is faith alone which justifies, but the faith which justifies can never be alone.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But it is probable that the words from “who walk” to “after the Spirit” are to be <span class="ital">omitted</span> here. Almost for certain the <span class="ital">last</span> clause, “but after the Spirit,” must so be omitted. Very possibly they were inserted here by copyists, who conceived the previous statement <span class="ital">too absolute to be trusted alone to the reader</span>, and so borrowed a quasi-note from <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-4.htm" title="That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.">Romans 8:4</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/romans/8.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-1.htm" title="There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.">Romans 8:1</a>. <span class="greekheb">Οὐδέν ἄρα νῦν κατάκριμα</span>, <span class="ital">There is therefore now no condemnation</span>) The apostle comes now to deliverance and liberty.

All we can say about it is that it has pleased God to subject it for a time to vanity and the bondage of corruption, but so as to leave hope alive. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="pc_st_rem">Romans 8:23 <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - And we too, while in this mortal body, must needs share in this universal groaning; but, having already the firstfruits of the Spirit - the earnest already of a diviner life - we especially yearn all the more for deliverance, and expect it hopefully. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="pc_st_rem">Romans 8:24-25 <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 24, 25.</span> - When we entered on our state of salvation as Christians, it was in hope; our essential condition became then one of hope, which is incompatible with present attainment of our hope; we must, therefore, needs endure and waif, bearing these present trials. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="pc_st_rem">Romans 8:26-27 <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 26, 27.</span> - And if our trials are great, and we know not ourselves what relief to pray for, we have the comfort of believing that the Holy Spirit intercedes for us within ourselves by inspiring all these unutterable yearnings, which he that searcheth the heart knows the meaning of, and will answer according to the mind of the Spirit who inspired them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="pc_st_rem">Romans 8:28 <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - We know, too, that all things, even all these present trials, far from harming us, work together for good to them that love God, being called according to his purpose. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="pc_st_rem">Romans 8:29-30 <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 29, 30.</span> - Yes, called according to his purpose; here is a further ground of hopeful assurance. For his having called us to be Christians at all, and justified us through faith, shows that it was his eternal purpose in so calling us, to conform us to the image of his Son, that he might be the Firstborn among many brethren; and that so we, being thus made his brethren, might inherit with him. In short, his having preordained us to our present state of salvation carries with it his preordaining us also to its end and purpose, which is glory. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="pc_st_rem">Romans 8:31-34 <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 31-34.</span> - If God be thus for us, who can be against us? He who has already given up his own Son for us all will surely grant us all. And, if God has chosen us, who shall arraign us? God himself, who already justifies us? No. Christ, who died, rose again, ascended to the right hand of God, and now intercedes for us? No. And against them what other power can possibly prevail? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="pc_st_rem">Romans 8:35-37 <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 35-37.</span> - Certainly not these present trials and calamities, however severe; though "we are killed all day long, and are appointed as sheep for the slaughter." Through Christ, who so loved us as to share them, we are conquerors all the more by means of them. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/romans/8.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Therefore now<p>Connecting with <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-25.htm">Romans 7:25</a>.
