By their union with Christ through faith, they are thus secured. What is the principle of their walk; the flesh or the Spirit, the old or the new nature, corruption or grace? For which of these do we make provision, by which are we governed? The unrenewed will is unable to keep any commandment fully. And the law, besides outward duties, requires inward obedience. God showed abhorrence of sin by the sufferings of his Son in the flesh, that the believer's person might be pardoned and justified. Thus satisfaction was made to Divine justice, and the way of salvation opened for the sinner. By the Spirit the law of love is written upon the heart, and though the righteousness of the law is not fulfilled by us, yet, blessed be God, it is fulfilled in us; there is that in all true believers, which answers the intention of the law. The favour of God, the welfare of the soul, the concerns of eternity, are the things of the Spirit, which those that are after the Spirit do mind. Which way do our thoughts move with most pleasure? Which way go our plans and contrivances? Are we most wise for the world, or for our souls? Those that live in pleasure are dead, 1Ti 5:6. A sanctified soul is a living soul; and that life is peace. The carnal mind is not only an enemy to God, but enmity itself. The carnal man may, by the power of Divine grace, be made subject to the law of God, but the carnal mind never can; that must be broken and driven out. We may know our real state and character by inquiring whether we have the Spirit of God and Christ, or not, ver. 9. Ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit. Having the Spirit of Christ, means having a turn of mind in some degree like the mind that was in Christ Jesus, and is to be shown by a life and conversation suitable to his precepts and example.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/romans/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But ye - You who are Christians. This is the opposite character to what he had been describing, and shows the power of the gospel.<p>Not in the flesh - Not under the full influence of corrupt desires and passions.<p>But in the Spirit - That is, you are spiritually minded; you are under the direction and influence of the Holy Spirit.<p>The Spirit of God - The Holy Spirit.<p>Dwell in you - The Holy Spirit is often represented as dwelling in the hearts of Christians (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-16.htm">1 Corinthians 2:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-19.htm">1 Corinthians 6:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-16.htm">2 Corinthians 6:16</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-21.htm">Ephesians 2:21-22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-6.htm">Galatians 4:6</a>); and the meaning is not that there is a personal or physical indwelling of the Holy Spirit, but that he influences, directs, and guides Christians, producing meekness, love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, etc. <a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-23</a>. The expression, to dwell in one, denotes intimacy of connection, and means that those things which are the fruits of the Spirit are produced in the heart. (See the supplementary note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-10.htm">Romans 8:10</a>.)<p>Have not the Spirit of Christ - The word "Spirit" is used in a great variety of significations in the Scriptures. It most commonly in the New Testament refers to the third person of the Trinity, the Holy Spirit. But the expression "the Spirit of Christ" is not, I believe, any where applied to him, except it may be <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-11.htm">1 Peter 1:11</a>. He is called often the Spirit of God <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-16.htm">Matthew 3:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-28.htm">Matthew 12:28</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-11.htm">1 Corinthians 2:11</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-14.htm">1 Corinthians 2:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-16.htm">1 Corinthians 3:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-11.htm">1 Corinthians 6:11</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-30.htm">Ephesians 4:30</a>, but not the Spirit of the Father. The word "spirit" is often used to denote the temper, disposition; thus we say, a man of a generous spirit, or of a revengeful spirit, etc. It may possibly have this meaning here, and denotes that he who has not the temper or disposition of Christ is not his, or has no evidence of piety. But the connection seems to demand that it should be understood in a sense similar to the expression "the Spirit of God," and "the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus" <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-11.htm">Romans 8:11</a>; and if so, it means the Spirit which Christ imparts, or sends to accomplish his work <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/14-26.htm">John 14:26</a>, the Holy Spirit, sent to make us like Christ, and to sanctify our hearts. And in this sense it evidently denotes the Spirit which Christ would send to produce in us the views and feelings which he came to establish, and which shall assimilate us to himself. If this refers to the Holy Spirit, then we see the manner in which the apostle spoke of the Saviour. He regarded "the Spirit" as equally the Spirit of God and of Christ, as proceeding from both; and thus evidently believed that there is a union of nature between the Father and the Son. Such language could never be used except on the supposition that the Father and Son are one; that is, that Christ is divine.<p>Is none of his - Is not a Christian. This is a test of piety that is easily applied; and this settles the question. If a man is not influenced by the meek, pure, and holy spirit of the Lord Jesus, if he is not conformed to his image, if his life does not resemble that of the Saviour, he is a stranger to religion. No test could be more easily applied, and none is more decisive. It matters not what else he may have. He may be loud in his professions, amiable in his temper, bold in his zeal, or active in promoting the interests of his own party or denomination in the church; but if he has not the temper of the Saviour, and does not manifest his Spirit, it is as sounding brass or a tinkling cymdal. May all who read this, honestly examine themselves; and may they have what is the source of the purest felicity, the spirit and temper of the Lord Jesus. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/romans/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. But ye are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you&#8212;This does not mean, "if the disposition or mind of God dwell in you"; but "if the Holy Ghost dwell in you" (see 1Co 6:11, 19; 3:16, &c.). (It thus appears that to be "in the spirit" means here to be under the dominion of our own renewed mind; because the indwelling of God's Spirit is given as the evidence that we are "in the spirit").<p>Now&#8212;"But."<p>if any man have not the Spirit of Christ&#8212;Again, this does not mean "the disposition or mind of Christ," but the Holy Ghost; here called "the Spirit of Christ," just as He is called "the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus" (see on [2225]Ro 8:2). It is as "the Spirit of Christ" that the Holy Ghost takes possession of believers, introducing into them all the gracious, dove-like disposition which dwelt in Him (Mt 3:16; Joh 3:34).

That is, ye are not carnal, but spiritual men; or ye are not in a state of unregeneracy, but in a state of grace: the reason proving this is, <p>if so be, or "seeing" <p>that the Spirit of God dwell in you; the inhabitation of the Spirit is a distinguishing character of a regenerate man; which is to be understood not of his omnipresence, nor of a participation of his gifts, whether ordinary or extraordinary: nor does the Spirit of God only dwell in his people by his graces, but in person as in office, and in a way of special favour; as a spirit of illumination, regeneration, sanctification, and faith, as a comforter, a spirit of adoption, an intercessor, and as a pledge and seal of happiness: which inhabitation is personal; is not peculiar to him to the exclusion of the Father and of the Son; is expressive of property and dominion; is not confined to the souls of men, for he also dwells in their bodies; it is operative, powerful, and perpetual; it is the security of the saints' perseverance, and the pledge of their resurrection and future glory. This is owing not to any goodness in them, or to any fitness and preparations of theirs to receive him; but to a federal union to Christ and relation to him, to our Lord's ascension and intercession, and to the love and grace of the Father; and this proves a man to be a regenerate man, to be in the Spirit, and not in the flesh; for the Spirit of God is never in this sense in an unregenerate man, nor is he in any such sense without his grace; so that the indwelling of the Spirit is the grand evidence of relation to God, of an interest in Christ and union to him, and of a man's state and condition God-ward; <p>now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his. By "the Spirit of Christ", is not meant the human soul of Christ; nor his divine nature; nor his Gospel, which is the Spirit that gives life; but the Holy Ghost, the third person in the Trinity, the same which is called the Spirit before; and proves Christ to be God, he proceeds from him as from the Father, is sent by him, and with which Christ's human nature was fitted and filled. The Jews (x) often speak of , or  "the spirit of the Messiah". Now to have him is not barely to partake of his gifts, but of his graces; to be possessed of him as one's own; to have communion with him, and to have him dwelling in us. There are some who have him not, nor never will have him, being none of Christ's; and God's elect, whilst in an unregenerate state, are without him; and whilst such, though they are his chosen and adopted ones, they are his by his Father's gift and his own purchase, they are his pardoned ones through his blood, and his justified ones through his righteousness; yet they are not his regenerated, called, and sanctified ones; nor can they claim any interest in him; nor are they known to be his by themselves or others; nor have they any communion with him, or enjoyment of him. <p>(x) Zohar in Gen. fol. 19. 3. &amp; 107. 3. &amp; 128. 3.

Anab</span>. vi. 1. 26). But in the present instance the context does not afford the smallest ground for this view; on the contrary, the conditional signification: <span class="ital">if certainly, if otherwise</span> (see Klotz, <span class="ital">ad Devar</span>. p. 528; Baeuml. <span class="ital">Partik</span>. p. 202), is perfectly suitable, and with it the following antithetic <span class="greekheb">εἰ δέ</span> corresponds. It conveys an indirect incitement to self-examination. We may add that Paul might also have written <span class="greekheb">εἴγε</span> without changing the sense (in opposition to Hermann’s canon, <span class="ital">ad Viger</span>. p. 834).

Respecting the matter itself and the conception, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-16.htm" title="Know you not that you are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?">1 Corinthians 3:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-17.htm" title="But he that is joined to the Lord is one spirit.">1 Corinthians 6:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-19.htm" title="What? know you not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which you have of God, and you are not your own?">1 Corinthians 6:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-14.htm" title="That good thing which was committed to you keep by the Holy Ghost which dwells in us.">2 Timothy 1:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-23.htm" title="Jesus answered and said to him, If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come to him, and make our stayed with him.">John 14:23</a>. Comp. also Ev. Thom. 10 : <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα Θεοῦ ἐνοικεῖ ἐν τῷ παιδίῳ τούτῳ</span>. See passages from Rabbinic writers on the dwelling of the Holy Spirit in man, quoted by Schoettgen, p. 527; Eisenmenger, <span class="ital">entdecktes Judenthum</span>, I. p. 268. The <span class="greekheb">ἐν πνεύματι</span>, which is not to be taken as “in the spiritual nature” (Philippi), and the <span class="greekheb">πν</span>. <span class="greekheb">Θεοῦ οἰκεῖ ἐν ὑμῖν</span> said with a significant more precise definition of <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span>, stand towards one another in an essential mutual relation. The former is conditioned by the latter; for if the Spirit of God do not dwell in the man, He cannot be the determining element in which the latter lives. Compare the Johannine: “<span class="ital">ye in me, and I in you</span>.” According to Hofmann, the relation consists in the Spirit being on the one hand, “<span class="ital">as active life-ground</span>,” the absolutely <span class="ital">inward</span>, and on the other “<span class="ital">as active ground of all life,” that which embraces all living</span>. This, however, is a deviation from the specific strict sense of the <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span>, which, in accordance with the context, can only be <span class="ital">that Holy Spirit</span> who is given to believers; and the concrete conception of the apostle receives the stamp of an abstraction.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">εἰ δέ τις πνεῦμα Χριστοῦ κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.] Antithesis of <span class="greekheb">εἴπερ</span> … <span class="greekheb">ὑμῖν</span>, rendering very apparent the <span class="ital">necessity</span> of that assumption. “<span class="ital">If, on the other hand, any one have not the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to Him</span>,” is not in communion of life with Christ, is not a true Christian; for <span class="greekheb">αὐτοῦ</span> refers to <span class="ital">Christ</span>, not to <span class="ital">God</span> (van Hengel). Moreover, it is not the <span class="ital">non</span>-Christians, but the <span class="ital">seeming</span>-Christians (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-13.htm" title="Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he has given us of his Spirit.">1 John 4:13</a>), who are characterized as those who have not the Spirit.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα Χριστοῦ</span>] (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-19.htm" title="For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,">Php 1:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-11.htm" title="Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow.">1 Peter 1:11</a>) is <span class="ital">none other than the Holy Ghost</span>, the Spirit of God.

But a distinction between them is not required by <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/8-10.htm" title="And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness....">Romans 8:10-11</a> (see on that passage), and is decisively forbidden by <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-6.htm" title="And because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.">Galatians 4:6</a>, compared with <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/8-14.htm" title="For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God....">Romans 8:14-16</a>. We cannot even say, therefore, with Umbreit: “the Spirit of Christ is the medium, through which man obtains the Spirit of God;” nor, with van Hengel, who compares <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-55.htm" title="But he turned, and rebuked them, and said, You know not what manner of spirit you are of.">Luke 9:55</a> : “si vero quis <span class="ital">Spiritum, qui Christi est, cum eo non habet communem</span>,” with which Paul would here be aiming at the (alleged) Judaism of the Romans.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/romans/8.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-9.htm" title="But you are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you.

To be “<span class="ital">in the Spirit</span>” is to be in that state of soul which results in a “walk after the Spirit;” a state therefore in which the Holy Ghost is the ruling influence.—The meaning is illustrated by the use of the same phrase for ecstatic inspiration, (another result of the same Agency,) <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-10.htm" title="I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet,">Revelation 1:10</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">if so be</span>] The Gr. particle is more than merely “if,” (which often = “since,” or “as,”) and suggests just such <span class="ital">doubt and enquiry</span> as would amount to self-examination. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-5.htm" title="Examine yourselves, whether you be in the faith; prove your own selves.

The word indicates the intimacy and permanence of the Holy Spirit’s action and influence in the regenerate man.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in you</span>] i.e. of course, as individuals.

On the other hand, it is scarcely a text in point on the great mystery of the “Procession” of the Holy Ghost; the emphasis of the words here being rather on the <span class="ital">work</span> of the Holy Ghost as the <span class="ital">Revealer of Christ</span> to the soul. See again <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-16.htm" title="That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man;">Ephesians 3:16</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">none of his</span>] See again <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-5.htm" title="Examine yourselves, whether you be in the faith; prove your own selves.

Evidently St Paul reminds the reader that a vital requisite to union with Christ is the present veritable indwelling of His Spirit; such an indwelling as he is treating of here, which determines the man to be “not in the flesh.”—The question thus solemnly suggested was to be answered (we may be sure) by no visionary tests, but by a self-searching enquiry for “the fruit of the Spirit.” See the whole passage, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/galatians/5-16.htm" title="This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh....">Galatians 5:16-26</a>; and cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-24.htm" title="And he that keeps his commandments dwells in him, and he in him.

We observe here how "the Spirit of Christ" is identified with "the Spirit of God," so as to imply the essential Deity of Christ, and also to lend support to the doctrine of the double procession of the Holy Ghost (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-11.htm">1 Peter 1:11</a>). Observe, too, how persistently and continually the apostle presses his protest against antinomian abuse of the doctrine of grace, with which he began this section of his Epistle, at ch. 6:1, He never loses sight of it; it pervades the whole. If St. Paul, especially in this Epistle, is, on the one hand, the great exponent of the doctrine of justification by faith only, he is, on the other, no less the persistent preacher of the necessity of works. Sanctification is continually pressed as the necessary result, as well as evidence, of justification. He only shuts out human works from the office of justifying. </body></html>
