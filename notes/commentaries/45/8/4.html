By their union with Christ through faith, they are thus secured. What is the principle of their walk; the flesh or the Spirit, the old or the new nature, corruption or grace? For which of these do we make provision, by which are we governed? The unrenewed will is unable to keep any commandment fully. And the law, besides outward duties, requires inward obedience. God showed abhorrence of sin by the sufferings of his Son in the flesh, that the believer's person might be pardoned and justified. Thus satisfaction was made to Divine justice, and the way of salvation opened for the sinner. By the Spirit the law of love is written upon the heart, and though the righteousness of the law is not fulfilled by us, yet, blessed be God, it is fulfilled in us; there is that in all true believers, which answers the intention of the law. The favour of God, the welfare of the soul, the concerns of eternity, are the things of the Spirit, which those that are after the Spirit do mind. Which way do our thoughts move with most pleasure? Which way go our plans and contrivances? Are we most wise for the world, or for our souls? Those that live in pleasure are dead, 1Ti 5:6. A sanctified soul is a living soul; and that life is peace. The carnal mind is not only an enemy to God, but enmity itself. The carnal man may, by the power of Divine grace, be made subject to the law of God, but the carnal mind never can; that must be broken and driven out. We may know our real state and character by inquiring whether we have the Spirit of God and Christ, or not, ver. 9. Ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit. Having the Spirit of Christ, means having a turn of mind in some degree like the mind that was in Christ Jesus, and is to be shown by a life and conversation suitable to his precepts and example.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/romans/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>That the righteousness of the law - That we might be conformed to the Law, or be obedient to its requirements, and no longer under the influence of the flesh and its corrupt desires.<p>Might be fulfilled - That we might be obedient, or comply with its demands.<p>Who walk - Note, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-1.htm">Romans 8:1</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/romans/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4.

Christ’s being a sacrifice for sin was not sufficient to answer all the ends and demands of the law; there must be doing of what it commanded, as well as suffering of what it threatened: therefore Christ was sent for both, and both were accomplished by him; and what he did and suffered is accounted unto us as if we had done and suffered it.

By the righteousness of the law, is not meant the righteousness of the ceremonial law, though that was fulfilled by Christ; but of the moral law, which requires holiness of nature, righteousness of life, and death in case of disobedience; active righteousness, or obedience to the precepts of the law, is designed here. This is what the law requires; obedience to the commands of it is properly righteousness; and by Christ's obedience to it we are made righteous, and this gives the title to eternal life: now this is said to be "fulfilled in us"; this is not fulfilled by us in our own persons, nor can it be; could it, where would be the weakness of the law? man might then be justified by it, and so the grace of God, and the righteousness of Christ, must be set aside: there never was any mere man that could fulfil it; for obedience to it must not only be performed perfectly, but with intenseness of mind and spirit; a man must be sinless in thought, word, and deed; and this would be to put man upon a level with Adam in a state of innocence, and the angels in heaven: nor is this to be understood of any righteousness inherent in man; internal holiness is never called the righteousness of the law; and could it be thought to be righteousness, yet it can never be reckoned the whole righteousness of the law: and though it is a fruit of Christ's death, it is the work of the Spirit, and is neither the whole, nor any part of our justification: but this is to be understood of the righteousness of the law fulfilled by Christ, and imputed to us; Christ has fulfilled the whole righteousness of the law, all the requirements of it; this he has done in the room and stead of his people; and is imputed to them, by virtue of a federal union between him and them, he being the head, and they his members; and the law being fulfilled by him, it is reckoned all one as it was fulfilled in, or if by them; and hence they are personally, perfectly, and legally justified; and this is the end of Christ's being sent, of sin being laid on him, and condemned in him.

It denotes either (<span class="ital">a</span>) human nature as conditioned by the body; (e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-3.htm" title="For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my brothers, my kinsmen according to the flesh:">Romans 9:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-5.htm" title="Whose are the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came, who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen.">Romans 9:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-8.htm" title="That is, They which are the children of the flesh, these are not the children of God: but the children of the promise are counted for the seed.">Romans 9:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-5.htm" title="For, when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we were troubled on every side; without were fights, within were fears.">2 Corinthians 7:5</a>, &c. &c.;) or (<span class="ital">b</span>) human nature as conditioned by the Fall, or in other words by the dominion of sin, which then began, and which works so largely through the conditions of <span class="ital">bodily</span> life that those conditions are almost, in language, identified with sinfulness. (See e.g. the present passage, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-5.htm" title="For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit to death.">Romans 7:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-18.htm" title="For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwells no good thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not.">Romans 7:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-25.htm" title="I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.">Romans 7:25</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-14.htm" title="But put you on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfill the lusts thereof.">Romans 13:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/galatians/5-17.htm" title="For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that you cannot do the things that you would....">Galatians 5:17-24</a>, &c., &c.) In the <span class="ital">first</span> connexion “the flesh” may bear a neutral, or a holy, meaning; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-14.htm" title="And the Word was made flesh, and dwelled among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.">John 1:14</a>;) in the <span class="ital">second</span>, it means a state which is essentially evil, and which may be described with practical correctness as (1) the state of man unregenerate, and (2), in the regenerate, the state of that element of the being which still resists grace. For manifestly (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-17.htm" title="For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that you cannot do the things that you would.">Galatians 5:17</a>) “the flesh” <span class="ital">is</span> an element still in the regenerate, not only in the sense of <span class="ital">corporeal</span> conditions, but in that of <span class="ital">sinful</span> conditions. But, in the latter sense, they are no longer <span class="ital">characterized</span> by it; they are not “fleshly,” because the <span class="ital">dominant</span> element is now not “the flesh,” but the renewed will, energized by the Divine Spirit.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>B. <span class="ital">The Spirit</span>. In the present context this word, in our view, denotes the Holy Ghost, except in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-10.htm" title="And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness.">Romans 8:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-16.htm" title="The Spirit itself bears witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God:">Romans 8:16</a>, where the <span class="ital">human</span> spirit is spoken of. That it means here the Holy Ghost seems plain, because it is regarded as a <span class="ital">regulating</span> principle, and immediately below (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/8-13.htm" title="For if you live after the flesh, you shall die: but if you through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, you shall live....">Romans 8:13-14</a>) the Divine Spirit is described as the <span class="ital">regulator</span> of the will of the saints. We do not of course deny the reality of the <span class="ital">human</span> spirit, even in the unregenerate (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-11.htm" title="For what man knows the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knows no man, but the Spirit of God.">1 Corinthians 2:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-7.htm" title="Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit shall return to God who gave it.">Ecclesiastes 12:7</a>). But here, as in a large majority of N. T. passages, the personal Divine Spirit is depicted as in such a sense inhabiting and informing the regenerate human spirit that He, rather than it, is regarded as the dominant rule and influence in the being. Thus, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-9.htm" title="But you are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.">Romans 8:9</a>, the regenerate are said to be “in the Spirit,” not “in the flesh,” not because their <span class="ital">human spirits</span> are in command of their being, but because <span class="ital">the Divine Spirit dwells in them</span>. He does not dispossess their spirit, but so possesses it that He in and through it is the ruler of the man.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>As regards the <span class="ital">human spirit</span>, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-10.htm" title="And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness.">Romans 8:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-16.htm" title="The Spirit itself bears witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God:">Romans 8:16</a>;) the word, in both O. T. and N. T., has now a wider, now a narrower meaning. Now it is the whole incorporeal element of the being—the whole antithesis of “<span class="ital">the body;</span>” now it is the “nobler powers” of that element—the antithesis of “<span class="ital">the soul</span>,” in that narrower sense of “soul” which concerns instincts rather than conscience, reflection, and deliberate affections. Man is thus sometimes “body and soul;” (e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-28.htm" title="And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.">Matthew 10:28</a>, and cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-9.htm" title="And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held:">Revelation 6:9</a>;) and sometimes “body, soul, and spirit;” (e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-23.htm" title="And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.">1 Thessalonians 5:23</a>). And in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-44.htm" title="It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.">1 Corinthians 15:44</a>, in the Gr., a remarkable contrast is drawn between the present body, “<span class="ital">characterized by soul</span>,” and the future body, “<span class="ital">characterized by spirit</span>.”—It must be remembered, however, that, unless in passages of exceptional antithesis, the distinction of soul and spirit may easily be pressed too far, and that in no case are they to be thought of as distinct in the sense in which they both are distinct from the body. We have no hint that they are two separable elements; they are rather different aspects and exercises of the same incorporeal element.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/romans/8.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-4.htm" title="That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.">Romans 8:4</a>. <span class="greekheb">Τὸ δικαίωμα</span>, <span class="ital">the law’s just commandment</span> [<span class="ital">jus</span>.

This, then, is the purpose of Christ's victory over sin - that the requirement of the Law in us too may be fulfilled; which evidently means more -than that his victory may be <span class="accented">imputed to</span> us, on the ground of our faith only, while we remain as we were. The expression, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f76;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;</span>, and also the condition appended at the end of the verse, imply that the "Spirit of life" must so dominate over the flesh in ourselves that the Law may forfeit its claims over us. The sinful propensions of the flesh remain in us still (as the verses that follow distinctly show); but the Spirit that is in us is strong enough to overcome them now (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-16.htm">Galatians 5:16-18</a>). It does not follow from this that any Christians will actually avoid all sin, or that they can be accepted <span class="accented">on the</span> <span class="accented">ground of</span> their own performance: to say this would be to contradict other Scripture (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-10.htm">James 2:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-8.htm">1 John 1:8</a>); and Paul confessed himself to be not already perfected (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-12.htm">Philippians 3:12</a>). But perfection, through Christ who lives in them, is put before us as, at any rate, the aim of the regenerate (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-48.htm">Matthew 5:48</a>); and by actual and progressive holiness they are to show that their union with Christ is real.
