Or, as Dr. Doddridge paraphrases the verse, “Since it is certain the gratifications of the flesh can do nothing for us like that which will be done at the resurrection; and since all present enjoyments are mean and worthless when compared with that; here is a most substantial argument for that mortification and sanctity which the gospel requires. And it necessarily follows that we are debtors to the Spirit, which gives us such exalted hopes, and not unto the flesh, that we should live after the dictates, desires, and appetites thereof.” “To be a debtor,” says Dr. Macknight, “is to be under a constraining obligation, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-14.htm" title="I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to the wise, and to the unwise.">Romans 1:14</a>. The apostle’s meaning is, Since men are under the gracious dispensation of the gospel, which furnishes them with the most powerful assistances for correcting the depravity of their nature, and for performing good actions, they are under no necessity, either moral or physical, to gratify the lusts of the flesh, as they would be, if, in their present weakened state, they had no advantages but what they derived from mere law,” the law of Moses, or law of nature. “Further, we are under no obligation to live according to the flesh, as it offers no pleasures of any consequence to counterbalance the misery which God will inflict on all who live according to it.” <span class="ital">For if ye </span>— Though professing Christians, and even eminent for a high and distinguishing profession; <span class="ital">live after the flesh </span>— Be governed by your animal appetites, and corrupt nature; (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/8-4.htm" title="That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit....">Romans 8:4-9</a>;) <span class="ital">ye shall die </span>— Shall perish by the sentence of a holy and just God, no less than if you were Jews or heathen. <span class="ital">But if ye through the Spirit</span> — Through his enlightening, quickening, and sanctifying influences, and the exercise of those graces which by regeneration he has implanted in your souls; <span class="ital">do mortify </span>— Resist, subdue, and destroy; Gr. <span class="greekheb">θανατουτε</span>, <span class="ital">make dead; the deeds of the body </span>— Or of the flesh, termed, <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-19.htm" title="Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,">Galatians 5:19</a>, <span class="ital">the works of the flesh: </span>and including, not only evil actions, but those carnal affections and inclinations, whence all the corrupt deeds arise, wherein the body or flesh is concerned; <span class="ital">ye shall live </span>— The life of faith, love, and obedience, more abundantly here, and the life of glory hereafter. Here we have the fourth motive to holiness: the Spirit of God dwelling in believers, to enable them to mortify their corrupt passions and tempers.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:10-17 If the Spirit be in us, Christ is in us. He dwells in the heart by faith. Grace in the soul is its new nature; the soul is alive to God, and has begun its holy happiness which shall endure for ever. The righteousness of Christ imputed, secures the soul, the better part, from death. From hence we see how much it is our duty to walk, not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. If any habitually live according to corrupt lustings, they will certainly perish in their sins, whatever they profess. And what can a worldly life present, worthy for a moment to be put against this noble prize of our high calling? Let us then, by the Spirit, endeavour more and more to mortify the flesh. Regeneration by the Holy Spirit brings a new and Divine life to the soul, though in a feeble state. And the sons of God have the Spirit to work in them the disposition of children; they have not the spirit of bondage, which the Old Testament church was under, through the darkness of that dispensation. The Spirit of adoption was not then plentifully poured out. Also it refers to that spirit of bondage, under which many saints were at their conversion. Many speak peace to themselves, to whom God does not speak peace. But those who are sanctified, have God's Spirit witnessing with their spirits, in and by his speaking peace to the soul. Though we may now seem to be losers for Christ, we shall not, we cannot, be losers by him in the end.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/romans/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>We are debtors - We owe it as a matter of solemn obligation. This obligation arises,<p>(1) From the fact that the Spirit dwells in us;<p>(2) Because the design of his indwelling is to purify us;<p>(3) Because we are thus recovered from the death of sin to the life of religion; and he who has imparted life, has a right to require that it be spent in his service.<p>To the flesh - To the corrupt propensities and passions.

The appellation, "brethren", is not used, because they were so by nation or by blood, though many in the church at Rome were Jews; nor merely in a free familiar way of speaking; but rather on account of church membership, and especially because they were in the same spiritual relation to God and Christ: and the use of it by the apostle, shows his great humility and condescension, and his love and affection for them, and is designed to engage their attention and regard to what he was about to say, to them and of them; as that they were "debtors"; which is to be understood of them not as sinners, who as such had been greatly in debt, and had nothing to pay, and were liable to the prison of hell; for no mere creature could ever have paid off their debts; but Christ has done it for them, and in this sense they were not debtors: but they were so as saints, as men freed from condemnation and death; which doctrine of Christian liberty is no licentious one; it does not exempt from obedience, but the more and greater the favours are which such men enjoy, the more obliged they are to be grateful and obey; they are debtors, or trader obligation, <p>not to the flesh, to corrupt nature, <p>to live after the flesh, the dictates of that; nor should they be, both on God's account, since that is enmity to him, and is not subject to his law; and on their own account, because it is an enemy to them, brings reproach on them, and exposes them to death; but though it is not expressed, it is understood, that they are debtors to God; to God the Father, both as the God of nature, and of grace, as their covenant God and Father in Christ, who has blessed them with all spiritual blessings in him; to Christ himself, who has redeemed them by his blood: and to the Spirit of God who is in them, and for what he has been, is, and will be to them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/romans/8.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{14}</span> Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh.</span><p>(14) An exhortation to oppress the flesh daily more and more by the power of the Spirit of regeneration, because (he says) you are debtors to God, in that you have received so many benefits from him.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/romans/8.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-12.htm" title="Therefore, brothers, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh.">Romans 8:12</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἄρα οὖν</span>] Draws the inference not merely from <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-11.htm" title="But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwells in you.">Romans 8:11</a>, but from the contents closely in substance bound up together of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/8-10.htm" title="And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness....">Romans 8:10-11</a>. “Since these blissful consequences are conditioned by the <span class="ital">Spirit</span> that dwelleth in us, we are not bound to give service to the <span class="ital">flesh</span>.” That has not deserved well of us!<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">οὐ τῇ σαρκὶ</span> … <span class="greekheb">ζῆν</span>] In the lively progress of his argument, Paul leaves the counterpart, <span class="greekheb">ἀλλὰ τῷ πνεύματι</span>, <span class="greekheb">τοῦ κατὰ πνεῦμα ζῆν</span>, without direct expression; but it results self-evidently for every reader from <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-13.htm" title="For if you live after the flesh, you shall die: but if you through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, you shall live.">Romans 8:13</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τοῦ κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ς</span>. <span class="greekheb">ζῆν</span>] <span class="ital">in order to live carnally</span>.

Fritzsche thinks that it belongs to <span class="greekheb">ὀφ</span>.: “Sumus debitores non carni obligati, nempe debitores vitae ex carnis cupiditatibus instituendae;” so also Winer, p. 306 [E.

Since he here says <span class="greekheb">τοῦ ζῆν</span>, that <span class="ital">telic</span> view is all the more to be preferred, by which the <span class="ital">contents</span> of the obligation (so Hofmann) is brought out as its <span class="ital">destination</span> for us.

The general idea may be stated thus: If ye live after the flesh, the power in you to which you give your allegiance and adhesion will involve you in its own doom, death; but if ye live after the Spirit, you identify yourselves with the Spirit of life that is in you, whereby you will be emancipated at last even from these your mortal bodies, whose doings you already slay. </body></html>
