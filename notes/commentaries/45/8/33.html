It seems best on the whole to connect together the two clauses at the end of <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-33.htm" title="Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifies.">Romans 8:33</a>, and beginning of <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-34.htm" title="Who is he that comdemns? It is Christ that died, yes rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also makes intercession for us.">Romans 8:34</a>. The whole passage to the end of the chapter will then form a continuous proof of the certainty that all things shall be freely given to the Christian. Nothing can frustrate this: either on the side of <span class= "ital">God,</span> for when He justifies none can condemn; or on the side of <span class= "ital">Christy</span> whose death, and resurrection, and ascension, and intercession are pledges that nothing can separate us from His love.<p>What have we to fear? When God pronounces our acquittal there is none who can pronounce our condemnation. Literally, <span class= "ital">God is He who justifies, who then can condemn?</span> And answering to this in the next verse we have, Christ is He that died, &c. This is the two-fold answer to the question, “Who shall come forward to accuse God’s elect?” It is a conclusive reply to this to state the relation in which the accused stand to God and to Christ.<p><span class= "bld">God’s elect.</span>—Christians as such with especial reference to the process which the Apostle has been describing in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/8-29.htm" title="For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers.">Romans 8:29-30</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/romans/8.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/8-33.htm" title="Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifies....">Romans 8:33-34</a></span>. <span class="ital">Who shall lay any thing to the charge </span>— Any matter of guilt, which should bring them into condemnation, or shall bring an accusation against <span class="ital">God’s elect </span>— That is, against true believers, who have so received Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-12.htm" title="But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name:">John 1:12</a>) as to have obtained the privilege of becoming God’s children, and who only have the title of God’s elect in the New Testament, God having chosen such, and only such, for his people, instead of the disobedient Jews, whom he rejected for their unbelief. See note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/8-28.htm" title="And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose....">Romans 8:28-30</a>. To explain this a little further, in the words of a writer, quoted here by Mr. Wesley: — “Long before the coming of Christ, the heathen world revolted from the true God, and were therefore <span class="ital">reprobated, </span>or rejected. But the nation of the Jews were chosen to be the people of God, and were therefore styled, <span class="ital">the children, </span>or <span class="ital">sons, of God, a holy people, a chosen seed, the elect, the called of God. </span>And these titles were given to all the nation of Israel, including both good and bad. Now the gospel, having the most strict connection with the books of the Old Testament, where these phrases frequently occur; and our Lord and his apostles being native Jews, and beginning to preach in the land of Israel, the language in which they preached would, of course, abound with the phrases of the Jewish nation. And hence it is easy to see, why such of them as would not receive him were styled <span class="ital">reprobated. </span>For they no longer continued to be <span class="ital">the people of God: </span>whereas this, and those other honourable titles, were continued to all such Jews as embraced Christianity. And the same appellations which once belonged to the Jewish nation, were now given to the Gentile Christians also, together with which they were invested with all the privileges of <span class="ital">the chosen people of God; </span>and nothing could cut them off from these, but their own wilful apostacy. It does not appear that even good men were ever termed God’s <span class="ital">elect, </span>till above two thousand years from the creation. God’s <span class="ital">electing, </span>or <span class="ital">choosing, </span>the nation of Israel, and separating them from the other nations, who were sunk in idolatry and all wickedness, gave the first occasion to this sort of language. And as the separating the Christians from the Jews was a like event, no wonder it was expressed in like words and phrases: only with this difference, the term <span class="ital">elect </span>was of old applied to all the members of the <span class="ital">visible church, </span>whereas, in the New Testament, it is applied only to the members of the <span class="ital">invisible,” </span>to truly spiritual Christians, possessed of the faith working by love. <span class="ital">It is God that justifieth </span>— Acquits them from condemnation, and accounts them righteous; and his power and authority are supreme over all creatures: he can and will answer all objections against them, and pronounce them absolved now, and at the day of final judgment. To <span class="ital">justify, </span>here, being opposed to laying a charge, or bringing an accusation, against God’s people, must be understood in the forensic sense; for a judicial acquittal from that of which the justified persons were accused, and from all the consequences which would have followed if they had not been acquitted. <span class="ital">Who is he that condemneth? — </span>What is his authority or power; he can but be a creature; and surely no creature, man or angel, can frustrate the Creator’s sentence. On what ground can any one accuse or condemn them? Is it on that of their past guilt, or their present remaining depravity? <span class="ital">It is Christ that died </span>— Namely, to expiate the former, and to procure for them grace to mortify and destroy the latter. <span class="ital">Yea rather, that is risen again </span>— For their justification, now and at the day of judgment; <span class="ital">who is even at the right hand of God </span>— Exalted to the highest degree of honour and power, even to the government of the universe; and that for this very end, to protect them against their enemies, deliver them from the guilt and power of their sins, and confer upon them his regenerating, sanctifying Spirit. The apostle seems here to allude to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110-1.htm" title="The LORD said to my Lord, Sit you at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool.">Psalm 110:1</a>, where the empire of the Messiah, after his resurrection, is foretold. Christ, who died to save God’s people, and who, since his resurrection, governs the world for their benefit, will neither condemn them himself, when he sitteth in judgment upon them, nor suffer any other to condemn them. <span class="ital">Who also maketh intercession for us </span>— By presenting to his Father his obedience and sufferings, whereby, as our surety, he hath made satisfaction for our sins, and by manifesting his desire and will, in his prayers offered for us, that we should be made partakers of all the blessings procured by his sacrifice, and by presenting our prayers sanctified, and rendered acceptable through him. Dr. Doddridge, following Augustine, reads and interprets these clauses interrogatively, thus: <span class="ital">Who shall lodge any accusation, </span>&c. Is it <span class="ital">God? </span>What! <span class="ital">he who </span>himself <span class="ital">justifieth? Who is he that condemneth? </span>Is it <span class="ital">Christ, </span>whom we know to be appointed as the final Judge? What! doth he condemn, who died to expiate our guilt, and rescue us from condemnation? <span class="ital">Yea rather, who is risen again? </span>Shall he undo the purposes of his death and resurrection? He who is now at the right hand of God, where he appears under a quite contrary character, <span class="ital">and is also making intercession for us; </span>and therefore, far from accusing us, appears ready to answer all accusations brought against us, and to frustrate all the designs of our enemies? But, as Macknight observes, the common translation, at least of the first clause, is better, as it avoids the impropriety of representing God as an accuser at the tribunal of his Son. Besides, it is fully as emphatical as the other. God having declared his purpose of justifying his believing and obedient people through faith, will any one, after that, presume to bring any accusation against them?<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:32-39 All things whatever, in heaven and earth, are not so great a display of God's free love, as the gift of his coequal Son to be the atonement on the cross for the sin of man; and all the rest follows upon union with him, and interest in him. All things, all which can be the causes or means of any real good to the faithful Christian. He that has prepared a crown and a kingdom for us, will give us what we need in the way to it. Men may justify themselves, though the accusations are in full force against them; but if God justifies, that answers all. By Christ we are thus secured. By the merit of his death he paid our debt. Yea, rather that is risen again. This is convincing evidence that Divine justice was satisfied. We have such a Friend at the right hand of God; all power is given to him. He is there, making intercession. Believer! does your soul say within you, Oh that he were mine! and oh that I were his; that I could please him and live to him! Then do not toss your spirit and perplex your thoughts in fruitless, endless doubtings, but as you are convinced of ungodliness, believe on Him who justifies the ungodly. You are condemned, yet Christ is dead and risen. Flee to Him as such. God having manifested his love in giving his own Son for us, can we think that any thing should turn aside or do away that love? Troubles neither cause nor show any abatement of his love. Whatever believers may be separated from, enough remains. None can take Christ from the believer: none can take the believer from Him; and that is enough. All other hazards signify nothing. Alas, poor sinners! though you abound with the possessions of this world, what vain things are they! Can you say of any of them, Who shall separate us? You may be removed from pleasant dwellings, and friends, and estates. You may even live to see and seek your parting. At last you must part, for you must die. Then farewell, all this world accounts most valuable. And what hast thou left, poor soul, who hast not Christ, but that which thou wouldest gladly part with, and canst not; the condemning guilt of all thy sins! But the soul that is in Christ, when other things are pulled away, cleaves to Christ, and these separations pain him not. Yea, when death comes, that breaks all other unions, even that of the soul and body, it carries the believer's soul into the nearest union with its beloved Lord Jesus, and the full enjoyment of him for ever.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/romans/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Who shall lay anything to the charge - This expression is taken from courts of law, and means, who shall accuse, or condemn, or so charge with crime before the tribunal of God as to cause their condemnation?<p>God's elect - His chosen people. Those who have been chosen according to his eternal purpose; Note, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>. As they are the chosen of God, they are dear to him; and as he purposed to save them, he will do it in such a way as that none can bring against them a charge that would condemn them.<p>It is God that justifieth - That is, who has pardoned them, and admitted them to his favor; and pronounced them just in his sight; Notes, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-17.htm">Romans 1:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-24.htm">Romans 3:24</a>. It would be absurd to suppose that he would again condemn them. The fact that he has justified them is, therefore, a strong proof that they will be saved. This may be read with more force as a question, "Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect? Shall God who justifieth?" The Greek will bear either mode of rendering. The passage implies that there would be a high degree of absurdity in supposing that the same being would both justify and condemn the same individual. The Christian, therefore, is secure. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/romans/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>33, 34.

They were Christ’s words there, and spoken of God’s justifying him; they are every believer’s words here, and intended of God’s justifying them.

The elect of God are a certain select number of persons, whom he has so loved, as of his sovereign good will and pleasure, to choose in Christ before the foundation of the world, unto eternal life and salvation, by certain ways and means of his own appointing, as sanctification and faith, so that they are peculiarly his: but are these persons chargeable with nothing criminal? yes, with Adam's sin; with a want of original righteousness; with multitudes of sins before conversion, some of them with very great ones; and all, even after conversion, with frequent infirmities and backslidings: and will none rise up and exhibit charges of this nature against them? yes, even now, they very often bring charges against themselves; they are very apt to charge one another; Satan, the accuser of the brethren, lays many things to their charge very frequently, and so do the men of the world; but all these charges avail nothing, since none of the divine persons, Father, Son, and Spirit, lay anything against them: not God the Father, for <p>it is God that justifieth; he against whom sin is committed, who is the lawgiver, and the righteous judge, justifies them from every charge; not by teaching them the way of justification, nor by infusing righteousness into them, or on account of any works of righteousness done by them, but by pronouncing them righteous through the imputation of the righteousness of his Son unto them: observe, that "God's elect", as such, are the objects of justification; which proves the eternity of it; the speciality of it as belonging to particular persons, and the everlasting security and continuance of it. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/romans/8.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{27}</span> Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? <i>It is</i> <span class="cverse3">{p}</span> God that justifieth.</span><p>(27) A most glorious and comfortable conclusion of the whole second part of this epistle, that is of the treatise of justification. There are no accusers that we have need to be afraid of before God, seeing that God himself absolves us as just: and therefore much less need we to fear damnation, seeing that we rest upon the death and resurrection, the almighty power and defence of Jesus Christ. Therefore what can there be so weighty in this life, or of so great force and power, that might cause us to fear, as though we might fall from the love of God, with which he loves us in Christ?

It is impossible that this <span class="greekheb">σὺν αὐτῷ τὰ πάντα ἡμῖν χαρίσεται</span> should be frustrated, either on the side of <span class="ital">God</span>, with whom no accusation of His elect can have the result of their condemnation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-33.htm" title="Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect?

In the analysis of this swelling effusion we must return to the method for which Origen, Chrysostom, Theodoret, and other Fathers paved the way, and which Erasmus followed: namely, that to the <span class="ital">question</span> <span class="greekheb">τίς ἐγκαλέσει κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. the <span class="ital">answer</span> is: <span class="greekheb">Θεὸς ὁ δικαιῶν</span>· <span class="greekheb">τίς ὁ κατακρίνων</span>; and then follows, moulded in similar form to that answer, the expression, passing over from God to Christ, <span class="greekheb">Χριστὸς</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἡμῶν</span>· <span class="greekheb">τίς ἡμᾶς χωρίσει κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.; so that after <span class="greekheb">δικαιῶν</span>, and also after <span class="greekheb">ὑπὲρ ἡμῶν</span>, only a colon is to be inserted. <span class="ital">Who shall raise accusation against the elect of God?</span> Answer, in a boldly triumphant counter-question,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">God is the justifier, who the condemner?</span> (there is consequently no one there to condemn, and every accusation is without result! Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/50-8.htm" title="He is near that justifies me; who will contend with me? let us stand together: who is my adversary? let him come near to me.">Isaiah 50:8</a>.) And as regards <span class="ital">Christ: Christ is He that has died, yea rather also has risen again, who also is at the right hand of God, who also intercedes for us: who shall separate us from the love of Christ?</span> This view (followed also by van Hengel, but by Hofmann only with respect to the first portion as far as <span class="greekheb">κατακρίνων</span>), though abandoned by nearly all modern expositors, is corroborated by its entire accordance with the sense, by the harmony of the soaring rhetorical form, and by its freedom from those insuperable difficulties which beset the modes of division that differ from it. Of the latter, two in particular fall to be considered. 1. Luther, Castalio, Beza, Calvin, Grotius, Wolf, and many others, including Ammon, Tholuck, Flatt, Fritzsche, Philippi, Reithmayr, and Ewald, take <span class="greekheb">Θεὸς ὁ δικαιῶν</span> as affirmative answer to <span class="greekheb">τίς ἐγκαλέσει κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.; then <span class="greekheb">τίς ὁ κατακρίνων</span> as a new question, and as the affirmative answer thereto: <span class="greekheb">Χριστὸς ὁ ἀποθανὼν κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., thus: <span class="ital">Who shall accuse</span>, etc.? <span class="ital">God is the justifier</span> (consequently no accuser shall succeed). <span class="ital">Who is the condemner? Christ is He that has died</span>, etc. (so that He cannot, therefore, condemn us in judgment). But against this view it may be urged, (<span class="ital">a</span>) that <span class="greekheb">Θεὸς ὁ δικαιῶν</span> and <span class="greekheb">τίς ὁ κατακρινῶν</span> are, as regards both substance (<span class="greekheb">δικαιῶν</span> and <span class="greekheb">κατακριν</span>.) and form (Paul has not written <span class="greekheb">τίς κατακρινεῖ</span> to correspond with <span class="greekheb">τίς ἐγκαλέσει</span>), correlative, and therefore may not, without arbitrariness, be separated; (<span class="ital">b</span>) that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-34.htm" title="Who is he that comdemns? It is Christ that died, yes rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also makes intercession for us.">Romans 8:34</a> Christ is not at all described as a judge, which would be in keeping with the <span class="greekheb">ὁ κατακρινῶν</span>, but, on the contrary, as redeemer and intercessor; (<span class="ital">c</span>) that, if <span class="greekheb">τίς ἐγκαλέσει</span> is at once disposed of by <span class="greekheb">Θεὸς ὁ δικαιῶν</span>, it must be already quite self-evident that there can be no <span class="greekheb">κατακρίνων</span>, and consequently <span class="greekheb">τίς ὁ κατακ</span>., as a new question, would be something superfluous and out of keeping with so compressed an utterance of emotion; (<span class="ital">d</span>) and, finally, that in the entire context there is no mention of the last judgment. 2. The theory, that came into vogue after Augustine, <span class="ital">doctr. Chr</span>. iii. 3, and Ambrosiaster (adopted in modern times by Koppe, Reiche, Köllner, Olshausen, Baumgarten-Crusius, de Wette, and Maier, also by Griesbach and Lachmann; Tholuck is undecided), consists in supplying <span class="greekheb">ἐγκαλέσει</span> with <span class="greekheb">Θεὸς ὁ δικαιῶν</span>, and taking it as a question, and dealing in a corresponding manner with <span class="greekheb">Χριστὸς</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἡμῶν</span> also: <span class="ital">Who shall accuse?</span> Shall <span class="ital">God</span> do so, <span class="ital">who justifies? Who shall condemn?</span> Shall <span class="ital">Christ</span> do so, <span class="ital">who has died</span>, etc.? But against this view it suffices to urge the decisive reason, that to conceive of God as <span class="ital">accuser</span> (before Christ) is destitute of scriptural analogy, and could not at all have occurred to the apostle. Hofmann takes <span class="greekheb">Χριστὸς</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἐντυγχ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὑπὲρ ἡμ</span>. as a <span class="ital">question with two dissimilar relative adjuncts</span>, of which the first declares how it was possible, after the question <span class="greekheb">τίς ὁ κατακρ</span>., to subjoin the further question, whether it might not be feared with regard to Christ that He should condemn where God acquits; while the second shows the impossibility of such a fear. But this artificial interpretation, in connection with which the first and second <span class="greekheb">καὶ</span> (see the critical remarks) are condemned as not genuine and this condemnation is acutely turned to account, fails, so far as the substance is concerned, on the very ground that the thought of its being possible perhaps for <span class="ital">Christ</span> to <span class="ital">condemn</span> where <span class="ital">God acquits</span> would be an <span class="ital">absurd</span> idea, which could not occur to a Christian consciousness; and, so far as form is concerned, on the ground that the second relative clause is annexed to the first with entire similarity, and therefore does not warrant our explaining it, as if Paul, instead of <span class="greekheb">ὃς καὶ ἐντ</span>., should have written <span class="greekheb">ἀλλὰ καὶ ἐντ</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In detail, observe further: The designation of Christians in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-33.htm" title="Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect?

Köllner’s objections to our view do not touch its <span class="ital">true</span> sense, since the point in question is not a possible interruption of the love of Christ to us, nor yet the hindering of our access to it (Philippi), but a possible <span class="ital">separation from the love of Christ</span> (that helps to victory, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-37.htm" title="No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.">Romans 8:37</a>) <span class="ital">through hindrances intervening between it and us, which might nullify its manifestation and operation upon us and might thus dissolve our real fellowship with it.</span> It was therefore very unwarranted in de Wette (comp.

It is even possible to read every clause interrogatively, though that is less effective. <span class="greekheb">τίς ἐγκαλέσει κατὰ ἐκλεκτῶν θεοῦ</span>; who shall bring a charge against persons who are God’s chosen?

It describes Christians as persons who owe their standing as such to the act of God’s grace. All Christians are conscious that this is the truth about their position: they belong to God, because He has taken them for His own. To say that the word designates “not those who are destined for final salvation, but those who are ‘summoned’ or ‘selected’ for the privilege of serving God and carrying out His will” (S. and H.), is to leave the rails of the Apostle’s thought altogether. There is nothing here (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/8-28.htm" title="And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose....">Romans 8:28-30</a>) about the privilege of serving God and carrying out His will; the one thing Paul is concerned with is the security given by the eternal love of God that the work of salvation will be carried through, in spite of all impediments, from foreknowledge to final glory. The <span class="greekheb">ἐκλεκτοὶ θεοῦ</span> are those who ought to have such security: they should have a faith and an assurance proportioned to the love of God. Paul is one of them, and because he is, he is sure, not that he is called to serve God, but that nothing can ever separate him from God’s love in Christ. The question <span class="greekheb">τίς ἐγκαλέσει</span> is best answered by taking both the following clauses together: “It is God that justifieth: who is he that shall condemn?” (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/50-8.htm" title="He is near that justifies me; who will contend with me? let us stand together: who is my adversary? let him come near to me.">Isaiah 50:8</a> f.). But many make <span class="greekheb">τίς ὁ κατακρινῶν</span> a new question, and find the answer in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-34.htm" title="Who is he that comdemns? It is Christ that died, yes rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also makes intercession for us.">Romans 8:34</a> : <span class="greekheb">Χριστὸς</span> [<span class="greekheb">Ἰησοῦς</span>] <span class="greekheb">ὁ ἀποθανών</span> = the only person who can condemn is the Judge, <span class="ital">viz.</span>, Christ, but He is so far from condemning that He has done everything to deliver us from condemnation. What Christian, Paul seems to ask, can speak of <span class="greekheb">κατάκριμα</span> with his eye on Christ, who died for our sins? <span class="greekheb">μᾶλλον δὲ ἐγερθεὶς</span> [<span class="greekheb">ἐκ νεκρῶν</span>]: <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-9.htm" title="But now, after that you have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn you again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto you desire again to be in bondage?">Galatians 4:9</a>; and chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-25.htm" title="Who was delivered for our offenses, and was raised again for our justification.">Romans 4:25</a>. The correction in <span class="greekheb">μᾶλλον</span> is formal (Weiss): Paul does not mean that the resurrection is more important than the cross; he improves upon an expression which has not conveyed all that was in his mind. Our position depends upon Jesus Christ who died, nay rather, over whom death no more has dominion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-9.htm" title="Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dies no more; death has no more dominion over him.">Romans 6:9</a>), who is at God’s right hand (this phrase, which describes Christ’s exaltation as a sharing in the universal sovereignty of God, is borrowed from <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110-1.htm" title="The LORD said to my Lord, Sit you at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool.">Psalm 110:1</a>, and is oftener used in the N.T. than any other words of the Old), who also makes intercession on our behalf. <span class="greekheb">ὂς καὶ ἐντυγχάνει</span>: a solemn climax is marked by the repetition of <span class="greekheb">ὃς</span>, and by the <span class="greekheb">καὶ</span> which deliberately adds the intercession to all that has gone before. The Christian consciousness, even in an apostle, cannot transcend this. This is Paul’s final security—the last ground of his triumphant assurance: Jesus Christ, at God’s right hand, with the virtue of His atoning death in Him, pleads His people’s cause. <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-24.htm" title="For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us:">Hebrews 9:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-25.htm" title="Why he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come to God by him, seeing he ever lives to make intercession for them.">Hebrews 7:25</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-1.htm" title="My little children, these things write I to you, that you sin not.

The word “elect,” (chosen,) is always used in N. T. in connexions that indicate the highest dignity and worth in the sight of God. The present passage throws as much light on the greatness of its meaning as any other. Cp. with it specially <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/1-4.htm" title="According as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love:...">Ephesians 1:4-5</a>.—In the O.

In the N.

As with the old so with the new Israel, the choice is emphatically sovereign.
