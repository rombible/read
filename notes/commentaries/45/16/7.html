It probably means members of the same nation—Jew like myself.<p><span class= "bld">Fellow-prisoners.</span>—It is not at all known to what this refers. The only imprisonment of St. Paul recorded in the Acts after this date would be that at Philippi, but allusions such as those in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-5.htm" title="In stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labors, in watchings, in fastings;">2Corinthians 6:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-23.htm" title="Are they ministers of Christ?

It is decidedly more probable that James, the Lord’s brother, who is called an Apostle in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-19.htm" title="But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord's brother.">Galatians 1:19</a>, and elsewhere, was not identical with James the son of Alphæus. And, however this may be, there can be no question about Barnabas, who is called an Apostle in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-14.htm" title="Which when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of, they rent their clothes, and ran in among the people, crying out,">Acts 14:14</a>.

My fellow-prisoners </span>— That is, imprisoned for the gospel as I was. At the time when this epistle was written, Paul had been in prison often, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-23.htm" title="Are they ministers of Christ?

From these two persons being Christians before Paul, joined with their being of note among the apostles, Origen infers that they were of the number of the seventy disciples: but that is quite uncertain. Their being called the apostle’s <span class="ital">kinsmen, </span>does not necessarily imply that they were his relations: he might term them so, as well as several others, mentioned in this chapter, merely because they were of the same nation with himself. The names, however, of many here saluted, show them to have been Greeks, or of Greek extraction. We may therefore conjecture, that they had formerly settled themselves at Rome, for the sake of commerce, or of exercising their particular trades; but, being afterward banished, by the Emperor Claudius, under the denomination of Jews, they had retired, some of them into Greece, others into the Lesser Asia, and others into Judea, where, it is supposed, they became known to the apostle in the course of his travels through these countries. These, with many others, returned to Rome in consequence of the death of Claudius, and re-established the church in its former lustre.

Paul asks help for one that had been helpful to many; he that watereth shall be watered also himself. Though the care of all the churches came upon him daily, yet he could remember many persons, and send salutations to each, with particular characters of them, and express concern for them. Lest any should feel themselves hurt, as if Paul had forgotten them, he sends his remembrances to the rest, as brethren and saints, though not named.

But as many others who were Jews are mentioned here without this appellation, and as he especially designates these persons, and Herodian <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/16-11.htm">Romans 16:11</a>, it seems probable that they were remote relatives of the apostle.<p>My fellow-prisoners - Paul was often in prison; and it is probable that on some of those occasions they had been confined with him; compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-23.htm">2 Corinthians 11:23</a>, "In prisons more frequent."<p>Who are of note - The word translated "of note" &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;  epise&#772;moi, denotes properly those who are "marked," designated, or distinguished in any way, used either in a good or bad sense; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-16.htm">Matthew 27:16</a>. Here it is used in a good sense.<p>Among the apostles - This does not mean that they "were" apostles, as has been sometimes supposed. For,<p>(1) There is no account of their having been appointed as such.<p>(2) the expression is not one which would have been used if they "had" been. It would have been "who were distinguished apostles;" compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-1.htm">Romans 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-1.htm">1 Corinthians 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-1.htm">2 Corinthians 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-1.htm">Philippians 1:1</a>.<p>(3) it by no means implies that they were apostles All that the expression fairly implies is, that they were known to the other apostles; that they were regarded by them as worthy of their affection and confidence; that they had been known by them, as Paul immediately adds, before "he" was himself converted. They had been converted "before" he was, and were distinguished in Jerusalem among the early Christians, and honored with the friendship of the other apostles.<p>(4) the design of the office of "apostles" was to bear "witness" to the life, death, resurrection, doctrines, and miracles of Christ; compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/10.htm">Matthew 10</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/1-21.htm">Acts 1:21</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-26.htm">Acts 1:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-15.htm">Acts 22:15</a>. As there is no evidence that they had been "witnesses" of these things; or appointed to it, it is improbable that they were set apart to the apostolic office.<p>(5) the word "apostles" is used sometimes to designate "messengers" of churches; or those who were "sent" from one church to another on some important business, and "if" this expression meant that they "were" apostles, it could only be in some such sense as having obtained deserved credit and eminence in that business; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-25.htm">Philippians 2:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-23.htm">2 Corinthians 8:23</a>.<p>Who were in Christ ... - Who were "converted" before I was.

The expression, "in Christ," means to be united to him, to be interested in his religion, to be Christians. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/romans/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. Andronicus and Junia&#8212;or, as it might be, "Junias," a contracted form of "Junianus"; in this case, it is a man's name. But if, as is more probable, the word be, as in our version, "Junia," the person meant was no doubt either the wife or the sister of Andronicus.<p>my kinsmen&#8212;or, "relatives."<p>and my fellow prisoners&#8212;on what occasion, it is impossible to say, as the apostle elsewhere tells us that he was "in prisons more frequent" (2Co 11:23).<p>which are of note among the apostles&#8212;Those who think the word "apostle" is used in a lax sense, in the Acts and Epistles, take this to mean "noted apostles" [Chrysostom, Luther, Calvin, Bengel, Olshausen, Tholuck, Alford, Jowett]; others, who are not clear that the word "apostle" is applied to any without the circle of the Twelve, save where the connection or some qualifying words show that the literal meaning of "one sent" is the thing intended, understand by the expression used here, "persons esteemed by the apostles" [Beza, Grotius, De Wette, Meyer, Fritzsche, Stuart, Philippi, Hodge]. And of course, if "Junia" is to be taken for a woman, this latter must be the meaning.<p>who also were in Christ before me&#8212;The apostle writes as if he envied them this priority in the faith. And, indeed, if to be "in Christ" be the most enviable human condition, the earlier the date of this blessed translation, the greater the grace of it. This latter statement about Andronicus and Junia seems to throw some light on the preceding one. Very possibly they may have been among the first-fruits of Peter's labors, gained to Christ either on the day of Pentecost or on some of the succeeding days. In that case they may have attracted the special esteem of those apostles who for some time resided chiefly at Jerusalem and its neighborhood; and our apostle, though he came late in contact with the other apostles, if he was aware of this fact, would have pleasure in alluding to it.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/romans/16.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Salute Andronicus and Junia; </span> it may be rendered Junius.

According to the flesh, being perhaps not only of the same nation, Jews, but also of the same tribe, the tribe of Benjamin, and even of the same family, and might be nearly allied in blood. And though the apostle did not value himself upon his carnal descent, yet he had a very great value and affection for his relations after the flesh, even though they were only of the same nation; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-3.htm">Romans 9:3</a>; and especially for such as were partakers of the grace of God, as these his kinsmen were. These were their Gentile names, the one Greek, the other Latin; but both were Jews. Grotius thinks that their Jewish names were, the one Masinissa, and the other Naarah; and that the latter was the wife of the former, but they rather seem both to be men; Junia should be read Junias, a contraction of Junilius: <p>and my fellow prisoners; either at Philippi, or in some other place; for though we read only of the apostle's being in prison at that place, and at Rome, yet it is certain from his own account, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-23.htm">2 Corinthians 11:23</a>; that he was frequently imprisoned; and Clement of Rome says, he was seven times in bonds (o), at one of which times these were bound with him, but when and where is not known. This is a greater character of them, and a greater honour to them, than to be called his kinsmen after the flesh: <p>who are of note among the apostles; were well known by, and in great account with the twelve apostles, though not of their number; they might be converted by them, and be followers of them in Judea; they are thought by some to be of the number of the seventy disciples, whom Christ himself sent forth to preach: Andronicus particularly is mentioned among them, and said to be bishop of Pannonia, or rather of Spain; See Gill on ; however, they might be preachers of the Gospel, and be persons of great fame and renown as such; for which reason they might be called apostles, that being a name sometimes given to ordinary ministers of the word, and to such who were messengers of the churches, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-23.htm">2 Corinthians 8:23</a>, as these might be, and were famous for their prudent, faithful, and diligent discharge of their office and duty: <p>who also were in Christ before me; which is to be understood, not of their secret being in Christ, as being loved by him, chosen in him, given to him, and represented by him in the covenant of grace; for they had not a place in Christ's heart, or a share in his love before him; wherefore the Arabic version is not only a bad one, but carries a false sense in it; which renders the clause thus, "who were in the love of Christ before me": nor were they chosen in Christ before him, for all the elect were chosen together in him before the foundation of the world; nor were they given to him, put into his hands, and made his care and charge before him; nor were they considered in Christ as their covenant head before him; Christ became their surety for them together, and received grace, blessings, and promises for them, and they in him before the world began; and was their common head and representative in time, in their nature; and they were all together crucified, buried, and raised with him, and set down with him in heavenly places together. But they were in the profession of faith, and in the church of Christ, and in the ministry of the word before him, being converted and brought to the faith of Christ before he was; which is the saints' open being in Christ, and is the effect and evidence of their being secretly in him from everlasting: this is to be created in Christ, or made new creatures in him; to be brought to believe in him, and even into him for righteousness, pardon, peace, acceptance, and eternal life, which are in him; and to live upon him, and in him, and derive all light and life, grace and strength, joy, peace, and comfort from him, as the branch derives its sap and nourishment from the vine, in which it is; and in this sense these men were in Christ before the apostle; they were converted persons, professors of religion, members of a church, and Gospel ministers before him: and though this is nothing in the business of salvation, who is called first or last; the one is equally as safe and as happy as the other; the thief that was called at the last hour, and the last man that will be called by grace in the world; yet it is a great blessing and mercy to be converted early; hereby a multitude of sins is prevented, and more, service done for Christ. And doubtless the apostle had this in view, and therefore gives these his kinsmen the preference to himself, that whilst he was a blasphemer of Christ, a persecutor of his people, and injurious to his interest, these made a profession of his name, preached his Gospel, and served his cause: it shows also, that they were persevering Christians, were pillars in the house of God, and never went out; and on account of their constancy and long standing, were worthy of respect. The apostle rises gradually in the character of these persons; as it was more to be fellow prisoners with him than to be his kinsmen, so it was more to be of note among the apostles, or to be eminent preachers of the Gospel, than to be fellow prisoners with him; and it was more to be in Christ than them all, than to be Paul's kinsmen, fellow prisoners with him, or to be known and approved of by the apostles, to be messengers of churches, preachers of the word, or even to be apostles themselves, and the chiefest of them; for such are blessed with all spiritual blessings in Christ, are complete and perfect in him, are safe and secure, and can never perish; and being once in Christ, are always in him, and will be found in him living and dying, and at judgment. <p>(o) Epist. ad Corinth. p. 14. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/romans/16.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Salute Andronicus and Junia, my kinsmen, and my fellowprisoners, who are of note among the apostles, who also were in <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> Christ before me.</span><p>(d) Ingrafted by faith.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/romans/16.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-7.htm" title="Salute Andronicus and Junia, my kinsmen, and my fellow-prisoners, who are of note among the apostles, who also were in Christ before me.">Romans 16:7</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἰουνίαν</span>] is taken by Chrysostom, Grotius, and others, including Reiche, as <span class="ital">feminine</span> (<span class="ital">Junia</span>, who is then to be regarded probably as the wife or sister of Andronicus); but by most of the more recent expositors as a <span class="ital">masculine</span> name, Junias, equivalent to Junianus (therefore to be accented <span class="greekheb">Ἰουνιᾶς</span>).

But Reiche’s reason—that Andronicus and Junias are expressly designated as Jews, because it would just be non-Jews who were saluted—is quite futile, since the nationality of those previously saluted is unknown to us, and Aquila and Prisca were likewise Jews.[42] Just as groundlessly, Hofmann thinks that in an epistle to the <span class="ital">Gentile</span>-Christian church the <span class="ital">kinsmen</span> of the apostle would be <span class="ital">Jews</span>.

An arbitrary play of interpretation occurs in Hofmann: those <span class="ital">whom Christ has won from the world and made His own</span>, just as the apostle himself.

Andronicus is a Greek name, which, like most names in this chapter, can be illustrated from inscriptions. <span class="greekheb">Ἰουνίαν</span> may be masculine (from <span class="greekheb">Ἰουνίας</span>, or <span class="greekheb">Ἰουνιᾶς</span> contraction of Junianus), or feminine (from <span class="greekheb">Ἰουνία</span>): probably the former. <span class="greekheb">τοὺς συγγενεῖς μου</span>: <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, Jews. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-3.htm" title="For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my brothers, my kinsmen according to the flesh:">Romans 9:3</a>.

The <span class="greekheb">αἰχμάλωτος</span> is a prisoner of war: Paul and his friends were all Salvation Army men. The phrase <span class="greekheb">ἐπίσημοι ἐν τοῖς ἀποστόλοις</span>, men of mark among the Apostles, has the same ambiguity in Greek as in English. It might mean, well-known to the apostolic circle, or distinguished as Apostles. The latter sense is that in which it is taken by “all patristic commentators” (Sanday and Headlam), whose instinct for what words meant in a case of this kind must have been surer than that of a modern reader. It implies, of course, a wide sense of the word Apostle: for justification of which reference may be made to Lightfoot’s essay on the name and office of an Apostle (<span class="ital">Galatians</span>, 92 ff.) and Harnack, <span class="ital">Lehre der zwölf Apostel</span>, . 111–118. On the other hand, <span class="ital">Paul’s</span> use of the word Apostle is not such as to make it easy to believe that he thought of a large class of persons who might be so designated, a class so large that two otherwise unknown persons like Andronicus and Junias might be conspicuous in it. Hence scholars like Weiss and Gifford hold that what is meant here is that Andronicus and Junias were honourably known to the Twelve. <span class="greekheb">οἱ καὶ πρὸ ἐμοῦ γέγοναν ἐν Χριστῷ</span>: they had evidently been converted very early, and, like Mnason the Cypriot, were <span class="greekheb">ἀρχαῖοι μαθηταί</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-16.htm" title="There went with us also certain of the disciples of Caesarea, and brought with them one Mnason of Cyprus, an old disciple, with whom we should lodge.">Acts 21:16</a>. On <span class="greekheb">γέγοναν</span> see Burton, <span class="ital">Moods and Tenses</span>, § 82. The English idiom does not allow of a perfect translation, but “were” is more idiomatic than “have been”.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/romans/16.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">7</span>. <span class="ital">Andronîcus and Junia</span>] Or, perhaps, <span class="bld">Juntas</span>, i.e. <span class="bld">Junianus</span> (in a contracted form, as <span class="ital">Lucas</span> for <span class="ital">Lucanus, Silas</span> for <span class="ital">Silvanus</span>, &c.). There is no various reading, but the Gr. accusative may belong to either <span class="ital">Junia</span> (feminine) or <span class="ital">Junias</span> (masculine). It is impossible to decide, but perhaps the following expressions favour the view that we have here two Christian <span class="ital">men</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">my kinsmen</span>] Of course in a literal sense, which alone can be <span class="ital">distinctive</span> here.

The last passage is specially instructive as proving that the Acts is a narrative of <span class="ital">selection</span> only.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">of note among the apostles</span>] The words may mean either (1) “<span class="ital">distinguished Apostles</span>,” or (2) “<span class="ital">well known to, and honoured by, the Apostles</span>.” If (1) is right, the word “Apostle” is used (as in the Gr. of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-23.htm" title="Whether any do inquire of Titus, he is my partner and fellow helper concerning you: or our brothers be inquired of, they are the messengers of the churches, and the glory of Christ.">2 Corinthians 8:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-25.htm" title="Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, and companion in labor, and fellow soldier, but your messenger, and he that ministered to my wants.">Php 2:25</a>;) in its literal and wider sense of a messenger, and here probably (if so) a messenger of the Gospel, a <span class="ital">missionary</span>. The context, however, in 2 Corinthians 8 and Philippians 2, is of a kind which <span class="ital">explains</span>, and so justifies, such a reference more distinctly than the context here. We may suppose that St Paul would more naturally have written here, had (1) been his meaning, “of note among <span class="ital">the apostles of the churches</span>.” We incline, then, to the explanation (2):—these two Christians, possibly because of special deeds of love and help to others of the Apostles besides St Paul, were particularly honoured by the apostolic body.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in Christ before me</span>] A beautiful and affecting tribute to these his “senior saints.”<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/romans/16.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-7.htm" title="Salute Andronicus and Junia, my kinsmen, and my fellow-prisoners, who are of note among the apostles, who also were in Christ before me.">Romans 16:7</a>. <span class="greekheb">Συγγενεῖς</span>, <span class="ital">kinsmen</span>) So <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-11.htm" title="Salute Herodion my kinsman.
