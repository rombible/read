Though the care of all the churches came upon him daily, yet he could remember many persons, and send salutations to each, with particular characters of them, and express concern for them. Lest any should feel themselves hurt, as if Paul had forgotten them, he sends his remembrances to the rest, as brethren and saints, though not named.

Likewise the church that is in their house&#8212;The Christian assembly that statedly met there for worship. "From his occupation as tent-maker, he had probably better accommodations for the meetings of the church than most other Christians" [Hodge]. Probably this devoted couple had written to the apostle such an account of the stated meetings at their house, as made him feel at home with them, and include them in this salutation, which doubtless would be read at their meetings with peculiar interest.<p>Salute my well beloved Ep&aelig;netus, who is the first-fruits&#8212;that is, the first convert<p>of Achaia unto Christ&#8212;The true reading here, as appears by the manuscripts, is, "the first-fruits of Asia unto Christ"&#8212;that is, Proconsular Asia (see Ac 16:6). In 1Co 16:15 it is said that "the household of Stephanas was the first-fruit of Achaia"; and though if Ep&aelig;netus was one of that family, the two statements might be reconciled according to the received text, there is no need to resort to this supposition, as that text is in this instance without authority. Ep&aelig;netus, as the first believer in that region called Proconsular Asia, was dear to the apostle. (See Ho 9:10; Mic 7:1). None of the names mentioned from Ro 16:5-15 are otherwise known. One wonders at the number of them, considering that the writer had never been at Rome. But as Rome was then the center of the civilized world, to and from which journeys were continually taken to the remotest parts, there is no great difficulty in supposing that so active a travelling missionary as Paul would, in course of time, make the acquaintance of a considerable number of the Christians then residing at Rome.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/romans/16.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Likewise greet the church that is in their house; </span> the word greet is supplied to fill up the sense: q.d.

There is one of this name, said to be one of the seventy disciples, and bishop of Carthage; See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-1.htm">Luke 10:1</a>. <p>Who is the firstfruits of Achaia unto Christ; that is, either he was one of the chief and principal for gifts and grace, or one of the first that was converted to Christ in those parts: the allusion is to the firstfruits under the law, which were offered unto the Lord, and were pledges of, and sanctified the rest. The Vulgate Latin, instead of Achaia, reads "Asia": and so it is read in the Alexandrian copy, and others: the reason of this different reading seems to be, because the house of Stephanas are said to be the firstfruits of Achaia, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-15.htm">1 Corinthians 16:15</a>. But this hinders not but that Epaenetus might be so too, for he might be one of the family of Stephanas, who was now removed to Rome. If he was a Jew, his Jewish name might be Judah, the same with Epaenetus, in Greek. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/romans/16.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Likewise <i>greet</i> the <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> church that is in their house.

Considering the size of Rome, it may be readily conceived that, besides the full assembly of the collective church, particular sectional assemblies were also formed, which were wont to meet in the houses of prominent members of the church. Such a house was that of Aquila and Priscilla, who had also in Ephesus given their dwelling for a similar object, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-19.htm" title="The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house.">1 Corinthians 16:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-15.htm" title=" Salute the brothers which are in Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the church which is in his house.">Colossians 4:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-2.htm" title="And to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church in your house:">Philemon 1:2</a>. Such house-churches are related therefore to the collective community, to which, as such, the epistles are directed, simply as the part, which has in addition its own special greeting, to the whole. Others (following Origen, Chrysostom, Theophylact, etc., with Koppe, Flatt, Klee, Glöckler) hold that <span class="ital">the inmates of the household</span> are intended. An arbitrary assumption of an unexampled hyperbole in the use of <span class="greekheb">ἐκκλησία</span>. That all the following saluted persons, up to <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-12.htm" title="Salute Tryphena and Tryphosa, who labor in the Lord.

VIII. ch. i.) collects the allusions to Christian places of assembly in the first century. He makes it clear that special <span class="ital">chambers</span> were set apart for holy uses, but does <span class="ital">not</span> make it clear that <span class="ital">whole buildings</span> were, in those first days, built for, or devoted to, worship. No doubt the circumstances of society and the inexpediency of <span class="ital">obtruding</span> Christian worship on the view of the heathen, made this a natural and wise practice at first. But the existence of Jewish synagogues alone would make it equally natural, in due time, to dedicate whole buildings.

Bishop Lightfoot says there is no clear example of a separate building set apart for christian worship within the limits of the Roman Empire before the third century. The Christian congregations were, therefore, dependent upon the hospitality of prominent church members who furnished their own houses for this purpose. Hence their places of assembly were not called temples until late; but houses of God; houses of the churches; houses of prayer.<p>Numerous guilds or clubs existed at Rome for furnishing proper burial rites to the poor. Extant inscriptions testify to the existence of nearly eighty of these, each consisting of the members of a different trade or profession, or united in the worship of some deity. The Christians availed themselves of this practice in order to evade Trajan's edict against clubs, which included their own ordinary assemblies, but which made a special exception in favor of associations consisting of poorer members of society, who met to contribute to funeral expenses. This led to the use of the catacombs, or of buildings erected over them for this purpose.<p>The expression here denotes, not the whole church, but that portion of it which met at Aquila's house.<p>Epaenetus<p>A Greek name, meaning praised. It is, however; impossible to infer the nationality from the name with any certainty, since it was common for the Jews to have a second name, which they adopted during their residence in heathen countries.
