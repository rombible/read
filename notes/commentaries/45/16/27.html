The Greek stands literally thus, “To the only wise God, through Jesus Christ, <span class= "ital">to whom</span> be glory for ever.” “To whom,” if it refers to God, as it is decidedly more probable that it was intended to refer, is ungrammatical. If it is inserted, the words “To him that is able . . . to God, the only wise,” are left without government. This might, indeed, under ordinary circumstances be got over, as such broken constructions are frequent with St. Paul, but it is somewhat different in the last solemn words of an Epistle, and would be especially so if this doxology were composed by itself separately from the rest of the Epistle. There would not then be the usual excuse of haste; and for so short a passage it may be doubted whether the Apostle would even employ an amanuensis. The difficulty is heightened when we ask what is meant by the phrase, “through Jesus Christ.” Separated, as it would then be, from the ascription of glory, and joined to “the only wise God,” it would seem to be impossible to get any really satisfactory sense out of it. “To God, who through Christ has shown Himself as the alone wise,” is maintained, but is surely very forced. Our conclusion then, prior to the evidence, would be that there was a mistake in the reading, and that the words “to whom” had slipped in without warrant. And now we find that a single uncial MS., but that precisely the oldest and best of all the uncials, the <span class= "ital">Codex Vaticanus,</span> with two cursives, omits these words. The suspicion would indeed naturally arise that they had been left out specially on account of their difficulty. But this is a suspicion from which on the whole, the Vatican MS. is peculiarly free. And, on the other hand, it is just as natural to assume that another common cause of corruption has been at work. Doxologies so frequently begin with the relative, “To whom be glory,” &c., that the copyist would be liable to fall into the phrase, even in places where it was not originally written. The probabilities of corruption may therefore be taken to balance each other, and it will seem, perhaps, on the whole, the most probable solution that the relative has really slipped in at a very early date, and that the English version as it stands is substantially right. There are some exceptions to the rule that “the more difficult reading is to be preferred,” and this is perhaps one.<p>The subscription in its present form hardly dates back beyond the ninth century. The earliest form of subscription up to the sixth century was simply “To the Romans.”<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/16.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>16:25-27 That which establishes souls, is, the plain preaching of Jesus Christ. Our redemption and salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ, are, without controversy, a great mystery of godliness. And yet, blessed be God, there is as much of this mystery made plain as will bring us to heaven, if we do not wilfully neglect so great salvation. Life and immortality are brought to light by the gospel, and the Sun of Righteousness is risen on the world. The Scriptures of the prophets, what they left in writing, is not only made plain in itself, but by it this mystery is made known to all nations. Christ is salvation to all nations. And the gospel is revealed, not to be talked of and disputed about, but to be submitted to. The obedience of faith is that obedience which is paid to the word of faith, and which comes by the grace of faith. All the glory that passes from fallen man to God, so as to be accepted of him, must go through the Lord Jesus, in whom alone our persons and doings are, or can be, pleasing to God. Of his righteousness we must make mention, even of his only; who, as he is the Mediator of all our prayers, so he is, and will be, to eternity, the Mediator of all our praises. Remembering that we are called to the obedience of faith, and that every degree of wisdom is from the only wise God, we should, by word and deed, render glory to him through Jesus Christ; that so the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ may be with us for ever.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/romans/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>To God only wise - The apostle here resumes the doxology which had been interrupted by the parenthesis. The attribute of "wisdom" is here brought into view, because it had been particularly displayed in this plan which was now revealed. It evinced, in an eminent degree, the "wisdom" of God. That wisdom was evinced in devising the plan; in adapting it to the renewing of the heart; the justification of the sinner; his preservation, guidance, and sanctification; and in the manner in which the divine attributes had all been seen to harmonize. All this the apostle had illustrated in the previous parts of the Epistle; and now, full of the convictions of this wisdom, he desires that all the praise and honor should be to God. The "tendency" of the plan is to promote his glory. The "obligation" on all who are benefitted by it is to give him praise.<p>Be glory - Praise; honor.<p>Through Jesus Christ - By means of the work which Jesus Christ has performed; through him now as mediator and intercessor in the heavens.<p>The subscription, "written to the Romans," etc. is evidently added by some other hand, but by whom is unknown. Paul assuredly would not write this to inform the Romans that it was sent by Phebe, whom he had just commended to their kindness. It has been shown, moreover, that no reliance is to be placed on any of the subscriptions to the Epistles. Some of them are known to be false. By whom they were added is unknown. In this case, however, the fact which it states is correct, that it was written from Corinth and sent by Phoebe. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/romans/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>27. To God, &c.&#8212;"To the only wise God through Jesus Christ, be"&#8212;literally, "to whom be"; that is, "to Him, I say, be the glory for ever. Amen." At its outset, this is an ascription of glory to the power that could do all this; at its close it ascribes glory to the wisdom that planned and that presides over the gathering of a redeemed people out of all nations. The apostle adds his devout "Amen," which the reader&#8212;if he has followed him with the astonishment and delight of him who pens these words&#8212;will fervently echo.<p>On this concluding section of the Epistle, Note, (1) In the minute and delicate manifestations of Christian feeling, and lively interest in the smallest movements of Christian life, love, and zeal, which are here exemplified, combined with the grasp of thought and elevation of soul which this whole Epistle displays, as indeed all the writings of our apostle, we have the secret of much of that grandeur of character which has made the name of Paul stand on an elevation of its own in the estimation of enlightened Christendom in every age, and of that influence which under God, beyond all the other apostles, he has already exercised, and is yet destined to exert, over the religious thinking and feeling of men. Nor can any approach him in these peculiarities without exercising corresponding influence on all with whom they come in contact (Ro 16:1-16). (2) "The wisdom of the serpent and the harmlessness of the dove"&#8212;in enjoining which our apostle here only echoes the teaching of his Lord (Mt 10:16)&#8212;is a combination of properties the rarity of which among Christians is only equalled by its vast importance. In every age of the Church there have been real Christians whose excessive study of the serpent's wisdom has so sadly trenched upon their guileless simplicity, as at times to excite the distressing apprehension that they were no better than wolves in sheep's clothing. Nor is it to be denied, on the other hand, that, either from inaptitude or indisposition to judge with manly discrimination of character and of measures, many eminently simple, spiritual, devoted Christians, have throughout life exercised little or no influence on any section of society around them. Let the apostle's counsel on this head (Ro 16:19) be taken as a study, especially by young Christians, whose character has yet to be formed, and whose permanent sphere in life is but partially fixed; and let them prayerfully set themselves to the combined exercise of both those qualities. So will their Christian character acquire solidity and elevation, and their influence for good be proportionably extended. (3) Christians should cheer their own and each other's hearts, amidst the toils and trials of their protracted warfare, with the assurance that it will have a speedy and glorious end; they should accustom themselves to regard all opposition to the progress and prosperity of Christ's cause&#8212;whether in their own souls, in the churches with which they are connected, or in the world at large&#8212;as just "Satan" in conflict, as ever, with Christ their Lord; and they should never allow themselves to doubt that "the God of peace" will "shortly" give them the neck of their Enemy, and make them to bruise the Serpent's head (Ro 16:20). (4) As Christians are held up and carried through solely by divine power, working through the glorious Gospel, so to that power, and to the wisdom that brought that Gospel nigh to them, they should ascribe all the glory of their stability now, as they certainly will of their victory at last (Ro 16:25-27). (5) "Has the everlasting God &#8230; commanded" that the Gospel "mystery," so long kept hid but now fully disclosed, shall be "made known to all nations for the obedience of faith" (Ro 16:26)? Then, what "necessity is laid upon" all the churches and every Christian, to send the Gospel "to every creature!" And we may rest well assured that the prosperity or decline of churches, and of individual Christians, will have not a little to do with their faithfulness or indifference to this imperative duty.<p>The ancient subscription at the end of this epistle&#8212;though of course of no authority&#8212;appears to be in this case quite correct.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/romans/16.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The second attribute in the description of God, is his wisdom; he is said to be <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">wise, </span> and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">only wise.</span> See the like, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-17.htm" title="Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honor and glory for ever and ever.

As an adverb: so it is used in the beginning of speech, and signifies verily; or in the end of speech, and so it notes assent. Therefore it was used of old by the Jews, not only at prayer, but at all the sermons and expositions of their rabbins, to testify that they assented and agreed to all that they taught: see <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-16.htm" title="Else when you shall bless with the spirit, how shall he that occupies the room of the unlearned say Amen at your giving of thanks, seeing he understands not what you say?">1 Corinthians 14:16</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. As a verb; and so it is as much as: So be it, having the nature of a prayer: hence Jeremiah said <span class="ital">Amen</span> to the prophecy of Hananiah, though false, concerning the sudden return from the Babylonish captivity, to show how earnestly he desired it might be so, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/28-6.htm" title="Even the prophet Jeremiah said, Amen: the LORD do so: the LORD perform your words which you have prophesied, to bring again the vessels of the LORD's house, and all that is carried away captive, from Babylon into this place.">Jeremiah 28:6</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Written to the Romans from Corinthus, (and sent) by Phebe servant of the church at Cenchrea.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This was not added by the apostle Paul, nor by Tertius his amanuensis, but by a later and unknown hand; yet there is nothing in the Epistle itself, nor in any ancient or modern writer, that may induce us to question the verity thereof. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/romans/16.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>To God only wise, be glory through Jesus Christ,.... This may be understood of God the Father, who is the only wise God, originally, essentially, and infinitely; though not to the exclusion of the Son and Spirit; and whose infinite wisdom appears in the works of creation and providence, in redemption and salvation by Christ, and in the whole scheme of the Gospel so largely commended in the foregoing verses: and the glory of all is displayed in, and to be given to him through Christ as Mediator; as the glory of his power and wisdom, particularly mentioned, who is the wisdom of God and the power of God; and the glory of the Gospel, of which Christ is the sum and substance; and the glory of salvation by him, and indeed of all his perfections; which is most illustriously manifested in it, in the contrivance, impetration, and application of it; and this glory is to be ascribed to him <p>for ever, throughout the endless ages of eternity, as it will be by angels and men; to which the apostle sets his <p>Amen, as wishing that so it might be, and as firmly believing that so it will be: the subscription of the epistle runs thus, "written to the Romans from Corinthus", and sent "by Phebe, servant of the church at Cenchrea": which though it is not in every copy, nor are the subscriptions at the end of the epistles always to be depended upon; yet this seems to be a right and true one, both with respect to the place from whence, and the person by whom it was sent, as well as with respect to the persons to whom it is inscribed, of which there is no doubt. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/romans/16.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">To God only wise, be glory through Jesus Christ for ever.

Amen.">Romans 11:36</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[56] For the suggestion that in this passage from the <span class="ital">Martyr. Polyc</span>. <span class="greekheb">τῷ δυναμ</span>. is dependent on the preceding <span class="greekheb">ἐκλογάς</span> (Hofmann), is simply a violent and very unsuitably devised evasion. Dressel has the unbiassed and correct punctuation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/romans/16.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-27.htm" title="To God only wise, be glory through Jesus Christ for ever. Amen.">Romans 16:27</a>. <span class="greekheb">μόνῳ σοφῷ θεῷ</span>: this description of God suits all that has just been said about His great purpose in human history, and the hiding and revealing of it in due time. The true text in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-17.htm" title="Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honor and glory for ever and ever. Amen.">1 Timothy 1:17</a> has no <span class="greekheb">σοφῷ</span>. The absence of the article here indicates that it is in virtue of having this character that God is able to stablish the Romans according to Paul’s Gospel. <span class="greekheb">ᾧ ἡ δόξα</span>: it is impossible to be sure of the reading here. If <span class="greekheb">ᾧ</span> be omitted, there is no grammatical difficulty whatever: glory is ascribed to God through Jesus Christ, through Whom the eternal purpose of the world’s redemption has in God’s wisdom been wrought out. But its omission is almost certainly a correction made for simplification’s sake. If it be retained, to whom does it refer? (1) Some say, to Jesus Christ; and this is grammatically the obvious way to take it. But it seems inconsistent with the fact that in <span class="greekheb">τῷ δὲ δυναμένῳ</span> and <span class="greekheb">μόνῳ σοφῷ θεῷ</span> Paul wishes unequivocally to ascribe the glory to God. And though it saves the grammar of the last clause, it sacrifices that of the whole sentence. Hence (2) it seems necessary to refer it to God, and we may suppose, with Sanday and Headlam, that the structure of the sentence being lost amid the heavily-loaded clauses of the doxology, the writer concludes with a well-known formula of praise, <span class="greekheb">ᾦ ἡ δόξα κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-15.htm" title="But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called me by his grace,">Galatians 1:15</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-18.htm" title="And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve me to his heavenly kingdom: to whom be glory for ever and ever.

Amen.">Hebrews 13:21</a>). This might be indicated by putting a dash after <span class="greekheb">Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ</span>. The thread is lost, and the writer appends his solemn conclusion as best he can.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/romans/16.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">27</span>. <span class="ital">to God only wise</span>] So certainly; though the Gr. equally allows the rendering <span class="bld">to the only wise God</span>. But the assertion of His glory as the Only (absolutely) Wise <span class="ital">Being</span> is far more in harmony with the height and fulness of the language here, than the assertion that among all <span class="ital">Divinities</span>, real or supposed, He only is wise.—The eternal <span class="ital">Wisdom</span> is here emphasized because the Gospel is its supreme expression. See especially the profound words of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-10.htm" title="To the intent that now to the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God,">Ephesians 3:10</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-17.htm" title="Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honor and glory for ever and ever. Amen.">1 Timothy 1:17</a> (with its connexion). Cp. also “Christ … the wisdom of God,” <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-24.htm" title="But to them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.">1 Corinthians 1:24</a>.—In Jude 25, the word “wise” is probably to be omitted.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">be glory</span>, &c.] The lit. order and rendering of the remaining words is—<span class="bld">through Jesus Christ, to whom be the glory for ever. Amen</span>. Here the construction becomes involved by the use of the relative, “<span class="ital">to whom;</span>” and this is equally so whether the relative refers to God or to Christ. That it refers to God seems to be proved, (1) by the opening words of <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-25.htm" title="Now to him that is of power to establish you according to my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery, which was kept secret since the world began,">Romans 16:25</a>, which lead us to expect, through the whole passage, an ascription of praise to the <span class="ital">Father;</span> (2) by the name of Christ occurring in a phrase (see next note) which indicates His <span class="ital">mediatorial</span> work, as the Channel through which praise rises to the Father.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">through Jesus Christ</span>] Meyer connects these words closely with the phrase “to God only wise,” and explains them to mean that the absolute Wisdom of God <span class="ital">acts and is revealed through Jesus Christ</span>. But this, though in itself eternally true, involves a grammatical construction sufficiently peculiar to recommend the more obvious one which takes the words “through Jesus Christ” to refer to the Son of God as <span class="ital">our Channel of thanks and praise</span>. Cp. ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-8.htm" title="First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world.">Romans 1:8</a>.—We now explain the abrupt construction (see last note) as if St Paul had fully written, “Now to Him that is of power to stablish you, &c., <span class="ital">we give thanks;</span> even to God Only Wise, through Jesus Christ; to whom (i.e. to God) be the glory for ever.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The construction of this Doxology is remarkable not only in itself, but in the fact that it was evidently left unaltered by St Paul and his friends. No various reading of the least importance occurs throughout it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">for ever. Amen</span>] See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-25.htm" title="Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.">Romans 1:25</a>, and on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-33.htm" title="O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out!">Romans 11:33</a>, &c. Justly does the great Epistle end with the highest of all thoughts, the Glory of God everlastingly manifested and confessed.

This ancient “Subscription” is no doubt true to fact. In this it differs from those appended to 1 Cor., Galat., 1 Tim., which are contradictory to the contents of the respective Epistles; and from those appended to Thess. and Titus, which are difficult to be reconciled with the contents.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>These “Subscriptions” (to St Paul’s Epistles) are said to be the work of Euthalius, a Bishop of the fifth century.
