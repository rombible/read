He wished them to be established also in the steady, persevering performance of every Christian duty, whether toward God or man: or, in <span class="ital">seeking glory, honour, and immortality; </span>by a <span class="ital">patient continuance in well-doing </span>— By being <span class="ital">steadfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord: according to the revelation of the mystery </span>— Of the admission of the Gentiles into the church of God, without subjecting them to the law of Moses; <span class="ital">which, </span>as plainly as it was foretold in the prophets, was still hid from many even of the believing Jews, and is therefore called a mystery, (in allusion to the mysteries of the heathen, which used to be concealed from all but the initiated,) <span class="ital">kept secret since the world began </span>— Or, as <span class="greekheb">χρονοις αιωνιοις σεσιγημενου</span>, may be rendered, <span class="ital">kept in silence from eternal ages; </span>or in all former ages from the beginning of the world. <span class="ital">But now is made manifest </span>— By the preaching of the gospel; <span class="ital">and by, </span>or according to, <span class="ital">the scriptures of the prophets, </span>the meaning whereof is now set forth and elucidated by the revelation of the Spirit; not by chance, but <span class="ital">according to the commandment </span>(which is the chief foundation of the apostolical office) <span class="ital">of the everlasting God </span>— A more proper epithet could not be used. A new dispensation infers no change in God. Known unto him are all his works, and every variation of them, from eternity. <span class="ital">Made known to all nations </span>— To the Gentile nations as well as the people of Israel; <span class="ital">for the obedience of the faith </span>— That they might not only know the blessings of the gospel, but enjoy them also, by believing in Christ, and in the truths and promises of his gospel, as they are commanded to do. <span class="ital">To God only wise </span>— Whose manifold wisdom is known in the church through the gospel, and who has so prudently contrived, and so effectually executed, this grand scheme. Dr. Macknight renders the clause, <span class="ital">To the wise God alone, </span>thinking that is the true translation, both here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-17.htm" title="Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honor and glory for ever and ever. Amen.">1 Timothy 1:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-25.htm" title="And when he showed them the entrance into the city, they smote the city with the edge of the sword; but they let go the man and all his family.">Jdg 1:25</a>; because, “if the translation were to be, <span class="ital">To the only wise God, </span>it would imply that there are some gods who are not wise. Or if we render the clause, <span class="ital">To God only wise, </span>the reader might be apt to think that God hath no perfection but wisdom.” Whereas “the apostle’s meaning is, that glory ought to be ascribed to God alone in the highest degree: or that God alone is entitled thereto, in and of himself;” all other beings, to whom any glory is due, deriving their title to it from the perfection which God has communicated to them, or the authority which he has bestowed on them: <span class="ital">be glory </span>in all the churches on earth, and in the general assembly and church of the firstborn in heaven; <span class="ital">through Jesus Christ for ever </span>— Through his mediation and grace, through which alone guilty and sinful creatures can give glory to God in an acceptable manner; and let every believer say, <span class="ital">Amen!</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“Thus endeth Paul’s Epistle to the Romans; a writing which, for sublimity and truth of sentiment, for brevity and strength of expression, for regularity in its structure, but above all, for the unspeakable importance of the discoveries which it contains, stands unrivalled by any human composition; and as far exceeds the most celebrated productions of the learned Greeks and Romans, as the shining of the sun exceedeth the twinkling of the stars.” <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/16.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>16:25-27 That which establishes souls, is, the plain preaching of Jesus Christ. Our redemption and salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ, are, without controversy, a great mystery of godliness. And yet, blessed be God, there is as much of this mystery made plain as will bring us to heaven, if we do not wilfully neglect so great salvation. Life and immortality are brought to light by the gospel, and the Sun of Righteousness is risen on the world. The Scriptures of the prophets, what they left in writing, is not only made plain in itself, but by it this mystery is made known to all nations. Christ is salvation to all nations. And the gospel is revealed, not to be talked of and disputed about, but to be submitted to. The obedience of faith is that obedience which is paid to the word of faith, and which comes by the grace of faith. All the glory that passes from fallen man to God, so as to be accepted of him, must go through the Lord Jesus, in whom alone our persons and doings are, or can be, pleasing to God. Of his righteousness we must make mention, even of his only; who, as he is the Mediator of all our prayers, so he is, and will be, to eternity, the Mediator of all our praises. Remembering that we are called to the obedience of faith, and that every degree of wisdom is from the only wise God, we should, by word and deed, render glory to him through Jesus Christ; that so the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ may be with us for ever.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/romans/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Now to him - This and the two following verses are found in many manuscripts at the close of <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/14.htm">Romans 14</a>. Its proper place, however, is here; and the apostle thus concludes the whole Epistle with an ascription of praise.<p>To him ... - To God; be glory; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-20.htm">Romans 16:20</a>.<p>Is of power - Greek, Is able; who has power; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-20.htm">Ephesians 3:20</a>; Jde 1:24, "Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling," etc. God only can keep Christians in the path of salvation; and it was well to bring that truth prominently into view at the close of the Epistle.<p>To establish you - To strengthen and confirm you.<p>According to my gospel - According to the gospel which I preach; the doctrines which I have been defending in this Epistle. It is called "his" gospel, not because he was the author of it, or because others did not preach it also, but because he had been "particularly" defending it in this Epistle. The doctrines which he had advanced were just those which were suited to strengthen and confirm them, - the doctrine of justification, of election, of perseverance, and of the protection and favor of God to both Jews and Gentiles. These were the doctrines which he had defended; and it might easily be shown that "these" are the doctrines that give stability to the Christian faith, hope, and love.<p>And the preaching of Jesus Christ - Not his "personal" preaching; but according to that preaching of which Christ is the author and the subject; and particularly, as the following clause shows, to the doctrines by which the partition between the Jews and the Gentiles was broken down, and by which they were admitted to the same privileges and hopes.<p>According to the revelation - According to the communication of what has been so long concealed, but which is now made manifest. The word "revelation" refers to the "publication" of the plan by the gospel.<p>Of the mystery - The word "mystery" means properly what is "hidden" or "concealed," and is thus applied to any doctrine which was not before known. It does not mean necessarily what is "unintelligible;" but what had not been before revealed; see the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-11.htm">Matthew 13:11</a>. The word here seems to refer to the principal doctrines of the gospel; its main truths, which had been concealed, especially from the entire Gentile world, but which were now made known.<p>Which was kept secret - Which were kept in "silence" (Greek, &#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;  sesige&#772;menou), were not divulged or proclaimed.<p>Since the world began - In all past times. This refers particularly to the Gentiles. The Jews had some obscure intimations of these truths, but they were now made known to all the world. The phrase "since the world began" is in Greek, "in eternal times;" that is, in all past times; or, as we should say, they have been "always" concealed. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/romans/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>25. Now to him that is of power&#8212;more simply, as in Jude 24, "to Him that is able."<p>to stablish&#8212;confirm, or uphold<p>you, according to my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ&#8212;that is, in conformity with the truths of that Gospel which I preach, and not I only, but all to whom has been committed "the preaching of Jesus Christ."<p>according to the revelation of the mystery&#8212;(See on [2276]Ro 11:25).<p>which was kept secret since the world began&#8212;literally, "which hath been kept in silence during eternal ages."<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/romans/16.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> He concludes all with an excellent doxology; wherein, first, he describes God, and then he ascribes eternal glory to him. He describes him by two of his attributes or perfections: the first is his <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">power; </span> He is able to establish you; i.e. in grace and in truth; to keep you from falling into sin and into error. The Scripture often attributes our establishment unto God: see <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-13.htm" title="To the end he may establish your hearts blameless in holiness before God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints.">1 Thessalonians 3:13</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-17.htm" title="Comfort your hearts, and establish you in every good word and work.">2 Thessalonians 2:17</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-3.htm" title="But the Lord is faithful, who shall establish you, and keep you from evil.">2 Thessalonians 3:3</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-10.htm" title="But the God of all grace, who has called us to his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that you have suffered a while, make you perfect, establish, strengthen, settle you.">1 Peter 5:10</a></span>. Our own weakness and Satan’s power are such, that unless God did establish us, we shonld soon totter and fall: see <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-4.htm" title="Who are you that judge another man's servant? to his own master he stands or falls. Yes, he shall be held up: for God is able to make him stand.">Romans 14:4</a></span>, and the notes there. Our establishment is further amplified by the instrumental cause thereof, which is the <span class="ital">gospel; </span> touching which, several things are here to be noted. First, he calls it <span class="ital">my gospel, </span> because he was the preacher and publisher thereof: see <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-16.htm" title="In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel.">Romans 2:16</a></span>, and the notes there. Secondly, he calls it <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">the preaching of Jesus Christ:</span> which may be taken actively, for the preaching of our Lord himself; so the doctrine of salvation is called, the word that was <span class="ital">spoken by the Lord, </span><span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-3.htm" title="How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed to us by them that heard him;">Hebrews 2:3</a></span>: see <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-23.htm" title="And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people.">Matthew 4:23</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-35.htm" title="And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease among the people.">Matthew 9:35</a></span>. Or rather passively, for the gospel which was preached concerning Jesus Christ: see <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-1.htm" title="Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, separated to the gospel of God,">Romans 1:1</a>,3</span>, and the notes there. Thirdly: He calls it a <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">mystery, which was kept secret since the world began, but now is made manifest:</span> see parallel places, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-7.htm" title="But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world to our glory:">1 Corinthians 2:7</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-9.htm" title="And to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning of the world has been hid in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ:">Ephesians 3:9</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-26.htm" title=" Even the mystery which has been hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints:">Colossians 1:26</a></span>. Some restrain this to the calling of the Gentiles; but it is better understood of the whole doctrine of the gospel, concerning the Trinity, the incarnation of the Son of God, &c., which. although it was in some sort made known under the Old Testament, yet, in respect of the present light and revelation, it was a hidden <span class="ital">mystery.</span> <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/romans/16.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Now to him that is of power to stablish you,.... God is here described by his power, and the particular instance of it is the establishing of his people; that is, in the Gospel, as the Syriac version reads the next clause, and in the profession of it, with grace in their hearts, and in the exercise of it, and more lively and cheerful discharge of duty; See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-11.htm">Romans 1:11</a>; <p>according to my Gospel; this is the means by which God usually establishes his people in faith and holiness; it is, indeed, an act of divine power, and which there is reason to hope and believe will be exerted; for words which express the power of God to do this, or the other thing, generally import willingness to do it, as the word does here; but then this is commonly done in the use of means: and that is the Gospel, than which nothing has a greater tendency to, and is better calculated for, and with a divine blessing always issues in the establishment of the saints. The apostle calls the Gospel his, not because he was the author of it, or the subject of it; but because he was the minister of it; it was that Gospel which he was sent and qualified to preach, and did preach fully and faithfully, and which he explains by the following clauses: <p>and the preaching of Jesus Christ: being that Gospel which Jesus Christ himself preached, for which he was anointed and sent, and which first began to be spoken by him in its power and purity, and in such a manner as it never was before or since: and of which he also is the subject; it treats of his person, offices, righteousness, blood, sacrifice, and salvation; and which when preached aright is done in his name, by his authority, through gifts, grace, and strength received from him, and with a view to his glory: it follows as a further explanation of it, <p>according to the revelation of the mystery; by which is meant, not, as some think, only the calling and conversion of the Gentiles through the preaching of the Gospel, though what is said of it well agrees with it; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-3.htm">Ephesians 3:3</a>; nor merely the mystery of Christ's incarnation and redemption by him; but the whole Gospel, and all the truths of it, which is often in Scripture called a "mystery", because the reason of many of its important doctrines does not clearly appear to the carnal reason of men; and the "modus" of several of them will ever remain inexplicable by us, as the doctrine of the Trinity, the sonship of Christ, and his incarnation, the resurrection, &amp;c. though the things themselves are most clearly revealed, as here "revelation" is ascribed unto them; by which is meant not that internal revelation of them, by the Spirit of God to the souls of men, though absolutely necessary to the understanding of them in a spiritual manner; nor the revelation of them to the apostles by Christ, by which, and not by men, they were taught and received; but that revelation which they have made of them in the external ministry of the word: <p>which was kept secret since the world began, or "from eternal times": from all the ages of the former dispensation, or that have run out from the beginning of the world; not that this mystery of the Gospel was entirely unknown, nor any hints given of it in those ages; for there certainly were, as to our first parents after the fall, to Abraham, Moses, David, Isaiah, and others; but it was but obscurely revealed, only some dark intimations were given of it; it was exhibited in types, shadows, and sacrifices; and, in a comparative sense, was wrapped up in darkness and silence, in reference to the more clear discovery and open exhibition of it under the Gospel dispensation. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/romans/16.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{7}</span> Now to him that is of power to stablish you according to my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the <span class="cverse3">{l}</span> mystery, which was kept secret since the world began,</span><p>(7) He sets forth the power and wisdom of God with great thanksgiving, which especially appears in the gospel, and makes mention also of the calling of the Gentiles, to confirm the Romans in the hope of this salvation.<p>(l) That secret and hidden thing, that is to say, the calling of the Gentiles.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/romans/16.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-25.htm" title="Now to him that is of power to establish you according to my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery, which was kept secret since the world began,">Romans 16:25</a>. <span class="greekheb">Στηρίξαι</span>] <span class="ital">to make firm and stedfast</span>. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-32.htm" title="But I have prayed for you, that your faith fail not: and when you are converted, strengthen your brothers.">Luke 22:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-11.htm" title="For I long to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift, to the end you may be established;">Romans 1:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-2.htm" title="And sent Timotheus, our brother, and minister of God, and our fellow laborer in the gospel of Christ, to establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith:">1 Thessalonians 3:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-17.htm" title="Comfort your hearts, and establish you in every good word and work.">2 Thessalonians 2:17</a>, <span class="ital">et al.</span> The description of God by <span class="greekheb">τῷ δυναμένῳ ὑμᾶς στηρίξαι</span> corresponds to the entire scope of the epistle.

Chrysostom, Theodoret, Theophylact, Wolf, Koppe, Tholuck); or (<span class="greekheb">κατά</span> of the <span class="ital">regulative modal character</span>): <span class="ital">after the fashion</span> of my gospel (Hofmann).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The expression <span class="greekheb">τὸ εὐαγγελ</span>. <span class="greekheb">μου</span>, <span class="ital">the gospel preached by me</span>, cannot, seeing that in Rome Pauline Christianity was in the ascendant, be accounted, on an impartial consideration of the apostolic consciousness, and in comparison with <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-16.htm" title="In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel.">Romans 2:16</a> (see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-14.htm" title="Whereunto he called you by our gospel, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.">2 Thessalonians 2:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-8.htm" title="Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel:">2 Timothy 2:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-2.htm" title="And I went up by revelation, and communicated to them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them which were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain.">Galatians 2:2</a>), as in itself surprising, least of all when we attend to the added: <span class="greekheb">καὶ τὸ κήρυγμα Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ</span>.

This <span class="ital">humility</span>, amidst all the boldness in other respects of his apostolic consciousness, suggested itself the more to his heart, because in connection with a praise of <span class="ital">God</span>. With this view of the genitive agree substantially Rückert, de Wette, Fritzsche, Baumgarten-Crusius, Ewald. The more usual explanation: the preaching <span class="ital">concerning Christ</span> (Erasmus, Luther, Calvin, and many others, including Köllner, Tholuck (?), Reithmayr, Philippi), yields after <span class="greekheb">τὸ εὐαγγ</span>. <span class="greekheb">μου</span> somewhat of tautology, and forfeits the thoughtful correlation between <span class="greekheb">μου</span> and <span class="greekheb">Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ</span>. The personal <span class="ital">oral</span> preaching of <span class="ital">Christ Himself during His earthly life</span> (Grotius, Wolf, Koppe, Böhme, Hofmann), to which Paul never expressly refers in his epistles (not even in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-1.htm" title="Stand fast therefore in the liberty with which Christ has made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.">Galatians 5:1</a>), is not to he thought of.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">κατὰ ἀποκάλυψιν μυστηρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.] co-ordinated to the preceding <span class="greekheb">κατὰ</span> … <span class="greekheb">Χριστοῦ</span>, and likewise dependent on <span class="greekheb">στηρίξαι</span>. In the exalted feeling of the sublime <span class="ital">dignity</span> of the gospel, in so far as he has just designated it as the <span class="greekheb">κήρυγμα</span> <span class="ital">of Jesus Christ</span>, the apostle cannot leave the description of its character without also designating it further according to its grand and <span class="ital">sacred contents</span> (not according to its <span class="ital">novelty</span>, as Hofmann explains, which lies neither in the text nor in the connection), and that with a theocratic glance back upon the <span class="ital">primitive</span> counsel of salvation of God: <span class="ital">as revelation of a secret kept in silence in eternal times</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-26.htm" title=" Even the mystery which has been hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints:">Colossians 1:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-9.htm" title="And to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning of the world has been hid in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ:">Ephesians 3:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-4.htm" title="According as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love:">Ephesians 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-7.htm" title="But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world to our glory:">1 Corinthians 2:7</a>).

The article was not requisite with <span class="greekheb">ἀποκ</span>., since the following genitive has no article, and, besides, a preposition precedes (Winer, p. 118 f. [E.

But <span class="greekheb">μυστηρίου</span>, if it was to be in itself the <span class="ital">definite</span> secret, must have had the article (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-3.htm" title="How that by revelation he made known to me the mystery; (as I wrote before in few words,">Ephesians 3:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-9.htm" title="And to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning of the world has been hid in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ:">Ephesians 3:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-26.htm" title=" Even the mystery which has been hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints:">Colossians 1:26</a>); hence we must explain “<span class="ital">of a secret</span>,” so that it is only the subsequent concrete description which expresses <span class="ital">what</span> secret is meant: “<span class="ital">in respect to the revelation of a secret, which was kept silent in eternal times, but now has been brought to light</span>,” etc. Among the <span class="ital">varying</span> explanations, the only one linguistically correct is that of Fritzsche (comp. Köllner, Rückert, Tholuck, and Philippi), who makes <span class="greekheb">κατὰ ἀποκ</span>. <span class="greekheb">μυστ</span>. dependent not merely on <span class="greekheb">στηρίξαι</span>, but on <span class="greekheb">τῷ δὲ δυναμ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὑμᾶς στηρ</span>. taken together, and takes <span class="greekheb">κατά</span> as <span class="ital">in consequence of</span>, thus namely: “qui <span class="ital">potest</span> vos <span class="ital">corroborare</span> in … <span class="ital">secundum patefactionem arcani, h. e.</span> postquam facta est patefactio arcani, <span class="ital">i. q.</span> <span class="greekheb">ἐπεὶ ἀπεκαλύφθη μυστήριον</span>;” more exactly Rückert, Philippi, Tholuck: <span class="ital">in correspondence with</span> the revelation, etc. But no necessity exists for taking <span class="greekheb">κατά</span> here in another sense than previously (as <span class="ital">e.g.</span> there is such a necessity, obviously, with <span class="greekheb">κατʼ ἐπιταγήν</span> immediately below); on the contrary, after the words, “who is in a position to strengthen you in respect of the gospel,” the idea “secundum patefactionem arcani” would be superfluous and self-evident, and therefore the weighty mode of its expression would be without motive and turgid. It would be otherwise if <span class="greekheb">κατὰ ἀποκάλυψιν κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. were intended to establish not the <span class="ital">ability</span> of God, but His <span class="ital">willingness</span>. Incorrectly, in fine, Olshausen and older expositors think that <span class="greekheb">τὸ γεγενημένον</span> should be supplied: “<span class="ital">which preaching has taken place through revelation of a secret</span>,” etc. This Paul would have known how to <span class="ital">say</span> properly, had he <span class="ital">meant</span> it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">χρόνοις αἰων</span>.] <span class="ital">Period in which</span> the <span class="greekheb">σεσιγ</span>. took place; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-11.htm" title="And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries.">Acts 8:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-20.htm" title="And after that he gave to them judges about the space of four hundred and fifty years, until Samuel the prophet.">Acts 13:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/2-20.htm" title="And if you utter this our business, then we will be quit of your oath which you have made us to swear.">Joshua 2:20</a>; Winer, p. 205 [E.

Bengel: “tempora primo sui initio <span class="ital">aeternitatem</span> quasi praeviam attingentia.” Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-9.htm" title="Who has saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began,">2 Timothy 1:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-2.htm" title="In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began;">Titus 1:2</a>. As at almost every word of the doxology, Lucht has taken offence at the expression <span class="greekheb">χρόνοις αἰων</span>.[53] And Reiche incorrectly understands the course of eternity <span class="ital">down to the time of the prophets</span>.

Comp. Weiss, <span class="ital">bibl. Theol</span>. p. 293. Suggestively Bengel remarks: “V. T. est tanquam horologium in suo cursu tacito; N. T. est sonitus et pulsus aeris.” The <span class="ital">silence</span> respecting the secret was first put an end to by the preaching of the N. T., so that now the <span class="greekheb">φανέρωσις</span> came in its place; and up to that time even the <span class="ital">prophetic</span> language was, in reference to the world, as yet a <span class="ital">silence</span>, because containing only <span class="greekheb">συνεσκιασμένως</span> (Theodoret) what afterwards (“<span class="ital">a complemento</span>,” Calovius) was to become through the <span class="ital">evangelical</span> preaching manifest, brought clearly to light (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-19.htm" title="Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God has showed it to them.">Romans 1:19</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-21.htm" title="But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;">Romans 3:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-4.htm" title=" That I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak.">Colossians 4:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_peter/1-10.htm" title="Of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come to you:...">1 Peter 1:10-11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-20.htm" title="Who truly was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you,">1 Peter 1:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/titus/1-2.htm" title="In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began;...">Titus 1:2-3</a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/romans/16.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/16-25.htm" title="Now to him that is of power to establish you according to my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery, which was kept secret since the world began,...">Romans 16:25-27</a>. The doxology. St. Paul’s letters, as a rule, terminate with a benediction, and even apart from the questions of textual criticism, connected with it, this doxology has given rise to much discussion. The closest analogies to it are found in the doxology at the end of Ephesians 3, and in Jude (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/judges/1-24.htm" title="And the spies saw a man come forth out of the city, and they said to him, Show us, we pray you, the entrance into the city, and we will show you mercy....">Judges 1:24-25</a>); there is something similar in the last chapter of Hebrews (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-20.htm" title="Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant,">Hebrews 13:20</a> f.), though not quite at the end; Pauline doxologies as a rule are briefer (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-25.htm" title="Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever.

Amen.">Php 4:20</a>), and more closely related to what immediately precedes. This one, in which all the leading ideas of the Epistle to the Romans may be discovered, though in a style which reminds one uncomfortably of the Pastoral Epistles rather than of that to which it is appended, would seem more in place if it stood where [42] [43] and an immense number of MSS. place it—after <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-23.htm" title="And he that doubts is damned if he eat, because he eats not of faith: for whatever is not of faith is sin.">Romans 14:23</a>. It may represent the first emergence and conscious apprehension of thoughts which were afterwards to become familiar; but it cannot be denied that the many distinct points of contact with later writings give it, in spite of all it has of imposing, a somewhat artificial character, and it may not belong to the Epistle to the Romans any more than the doxology in Matthew 6 belongs to the Lord’s Prayer.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[42] Codex Alexandrinus (sæc. v.), at the British Museum, published in photographic facsimile by Sir E.

The whole is a Doxology to the Eternal Father, through the Son, for the gift and manifestation of the world-wide Salvation by Faith, which prophets had foretold and which was now at last fully proclaimed.—On the questions raised about this Doxology, see <span class="ital">Introduction</span>, ii. § 3.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">to stablish you</span>] Cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-11.htm" title="For I long to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift, to the end you may be established;">Romans 1:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-13.htm" title="To the end he may establish your hearts blameless in holiness before God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints.">1 Thessalonians 3:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-17.htm" title="Comfort your hearts, and establish you in every good word and work.">2 Thessalonians 2:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-3.htm" title="But the Lord is faithful, who shall establish you, and keep you from evil.">2 Thessalonians 3:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-10.htm" title="But the God of all grace, who has called us to his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that you have suffered a while, make you perfect, establish, strengthen, settle you.">1 Peter 5:10</a>.

On the whole, the last reference seems the most likely. St Paul thus both qualifies the thought that the Gospel he preached was “his,” and enforces the thought of its absolute truth.—“<span class="ital">Preaching:</span>”—the Gr. word (same as <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-21.htm" title="For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.">1 Corinthians 1:21</a>,) means the <span class="ital">contents of the message, not the act of preaching</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">according to the revelation</span>, &c.] St Paul’s Gospel and the Lord’s Proclamation were “<span class="ital">according to</span>,” in harmony with, this “<span class="ital">unveiling</span>” of the great hidden Truth. The unveiling of the Truth occasioned the proclamation, and was the substance of it. The unveiling and the proclamation were thus coincident and harmonious.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the mystery</span>] On the word “<span class="ital">mystery</span>,” see note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-25.htm" title="For I would not, brothers, that you should be ignorant of this mystery, lest you should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles be come in.">Romans 11:25</a>.—The great Secret here is that of Salvation by Faith for all, of whatever nation, who come with “the obedience of faith” to Christ the Propitiation. See especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/3-3.htm" title="How that by revelation he made known to me the mystery; (as I wrote before in few words,...">Ephesians 3:3-9</a>. Here, however, more than there, the emphasis seems to be on the freedom of the Way of Acceptance as well as on the world-wide largeness of the offer;—on the “obedience of Faith” as well as on the “making of it known to <span class="ital">all nations</span>.” Not that Salvation by Faith was a secret unheard of till the Christian age; (for see ch. 4;) but that its Divine manifestation in the Cross, and consequent unreserved proclamation as the central truth of Redeeming Love, were new.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">which was kept secret since the world began</span>] Lit. <span class="bld">which had been reserved in silence during æonian times</span>, or <span class="bld">periods of ages</span>. The “ages” here probably refer to the whole lapse of periods before the Gospel “age,” perhaps including not only human time with its patriarchal and Mosaic “ages,” and its ranges of pagan history, but the “age” of angelic life. For we gather (cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-10.htm" title="To the intent that now to the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God,">Ephesians 3:10</a>) that even to angels the Incarnation and its results in believing mankind formed a <span class="ital">new</span> manifestation of the Divine wisdom.—The E.

It may have been written by the apostle with his own hand. It differs, indeed, in form as well as fulness, from other autographic conclusions of his Epistles; but it is a suitable and grand ending of an Epistle of the peculiar character of this; summing up pregnantly in the form of a glowing thanksgiving the essential ideas of the whole Epistle, which had been more or less intimated in its preface. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 25, 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now to him that is of power to stablish you according to my gospel</span> (<span class="accented">i.e. the gospel committed unto me to preach</span>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-16.htm">Romans 2:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-11.htm">1 Timothy 1:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-8.htm">2 Timothy 2:8</a>), <span class="cmt_word">and the preaching of Jesus Christ</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, as appears from the use of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> elsewhere, <span class="accented">concerning Jesus Christ.</span> or <span class="accented">the announcement of Jesus Christ.</span> The phrase seems to be added as declaring what Paul's gospel was, rather than as referring back to Christ's personal preaching), <span class="cmt_word">according to the revelation of the mystery</span> (on the meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, see note on Romans 11:25), <span class="cmt_word">which was kept secret</span> (literally, <span class="accented">kept in silence</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>since the world began</span> (literally, <span class="accented">in times eternal</span>)<span class="accented">, <span class="cmt_word"></span>but is now made manifest, and through the Scriptures of the prophets</span> (literally, <span class="accented">prophetic Scriptures<span class="cmt_word"></span>), according to the command. meat of the eternal God, made known unto all the nations unto the obedience of faith.</span> We have seen throughout the Epistle how the Scriptures of the Old Testament are referred to as foretelling the revelation in Christ of the long-hidden mystery (cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-2.htm">Romans 1:2</a>); and it was through showing them to be fulfilled that, in all the apostolic preaching, the <span class="accented">mystery</span>, now <span class="accented">manifested, was</span> made <span class="accented">known</span> to all the nations; and this according to the <span class="accented">commandment</span> or <span class="accented">appoint-</span>merit of God, that the <span class="accented">mystery</span> should thus be now at last made known. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/romans/16.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>This is the only epistle of Paul which closes with a doxology. The doxology (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-23.htm">Romans 14:23</a>) stands at the close of this chapter in most of the very oldest MSS., and in the Peshito or Syriac and Vulgate versions. In a very few MSS. it is omitted or erased by a later hand. In many MSS. including most of the cursives, it is found at the close of ch. 14, and in a very few, at the close of both 14 and 16. Weiss ("Introduction to the New Testament") says that the attempt to prove its un-Pauline character has only been the result of extreme ingenuity.<p>Stablish (&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;)<p>See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-10.htm">1 Peter 5:10</a>.<p>Mystery<p>See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-25.htm">Romans 11:25</a>.
