Stand aside yourself as a mere spectator, and let the wrath of God have free course to accomplish itself as He shall think well. The other most plausible interpretation would be, “Give room to the wrath of your adversary; let it spend itself; resist not evil,” etc., as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-39.htm" title="But I say to you, That you resist not evil: but whoever shall smite you on your right cheek, turn to him the other also.">Matthew 5:39</a>. The sense, “Allow time for your own anger to cool,” cannot be got out of the Greek. The view first stated is to be preferred.<p><span class= "bld">Vengeance is mine; I will repay.</span>—The form of this quotation, which differs both from the LXX. and from the Hebrew, is precisely similar to that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-30.htm" title="For we know him that has said, Vengeance belongs to me, I will recompense, said the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge his people.">Hebrews 10:30</a>. This should be noted as a point of resemblance between St. Paul and the author of that Epistle, but its strength as an argument for the identity of the two is much diminished by the fact that other marked coincidences are found in the literature of this age, which seem to point to the conclusion that forms of text were current (perhaps confined to a few familiar quotations) of which no direct representations have come down to us.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/maclaren/romans/12.htm">MacLaren's Expositions</a></div>Romans<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">STILL ANOTHER TRIPLET<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-19.htm" title="Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place to wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, said the Lord.">Romans 12:19</a> - <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-21.htm" title="Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.">Romans 12:21</a></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The natural instinct is to answer enmity with enmity, and kindliness with kindliness. There are many people of whom we think well and like, for no other reason than because we believe that they think well of and like us. Such a love is really selfishness. In the same fashion, dislike, and alienation on the part of another naturally reproduce themselves in our own minds. A dog will stretch its neck to be patted, and snap at a stick raised to strike it. It requires a strong effort to master this instinctive tendency, and that effort the plainest principles of Christian morality require from us all. The precepts in our text are in twofold form, negative and positive; and they are closed with a general principle, which includes both these forms, and much more besides. There are two pillars, and a great lintel coping them, like the trilithons of Stonehenge.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. We deal with the negative precept.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>‘Avenge not yourselves, beloved, but give place unto wrath.’ Do not take the law into your own hands, but leave God’s way of retribution to work itself out. By avenging, the Apostle means a passionate redress of private wrongs at the bidding of personal resentment. We must note how deep this precept goes. It prohibits not merely external acts which, in civilised times are restrained by law, but, as with Christian morality, it deals with thoughts and feelings, and not only with deeds. It forbids such natural and common thoughts as ‘I owe him an ill turn for that’; ‘I should like to pay him off.’ A great deal of what is popularly called ‘a proper spirit’ becomes extremely improper if tested by this precept. There is an eloquent word in German which we can only clumsily reproduce, which christens the ugly pleasure at seeing misfortune and calls it ‘joy in others’ disasters.’ We have not the word; would that we had not the thing!<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> A solemn reason is added for the difficult precept, in that frequently misunderstood saying, ‘Give place unto wrath.’ The question is, Whose wrath? And, plainly, the subsequent words of the section show that it is God’s. That quotation comes from <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-35.htm" title="To me belongs vengeance and recompense; their foot shall slide in due time: for the day of their calamity is at hand, and the things that shall come on them make haste.">Deuteronomy 32:35</a>. It is possibly unfortunate that ‘vengeance’ is ascribed to God; for hasty readers lay hold of the idea of passionate resentment, and transfer it to Him, whereas His retributive action has in it no resentment and no passion. Nor are we to suppose that the thought here is only the base one, <span class="ital">they are sure to be punished, so we need not trouble</span>. The Apostle points to the solemn fact of retribution as an element in the Divine government. It is not merely automatically working laws which recompense evil by evil, but it is the face of the Lord which is inexorably and inevitably set ‘against them that do evil.’ That recompense is not hidden away in the future behind the curtain of death, but is realised in the present, as every evil-doer too surely and bitterly experiences.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> ‘Vengeance is mine, I will repay, saith the Lord.’ God only has the right to recompense the ungodly and the sinner as well as the righteous. Dwelling in such a system as we do, how dares any one take that work into his hands? It requires perfect knowledge of the true evil of an action, which no one has who cannot read the heart; it requires perfect freedom from passion; it requires perfect immunity from evil desert on the part of the avenger; in a word, it belongs to God, and to Him alone. We have nothing to do with apportioning retribution to desert, either in private actions or in the treatment of so-called criminals. In the latter our objects should be reformation and the safety of society. If we add to these retribution, we transcend our functions.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. Take the positive,-Follow God’s way of meeting hostility with beneficence.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>The hungry enemy is to be fed, the thirsty to be given drink; and the reason is, that such beneficence will ‘heap coals of fire upon his head.’ The negative is not enough. To abstain from vengeance will leave the heart unaffected, and may simply issue in the cessation of all intercourse. The reason assigned sounds at first strange. It is clear that the ‘coals of fire’ which are to be heaped on the head are meant to melt and soften the heart, and cause it to glow with love. There may be also included the burning pangs of shame felt by a man whose evil is answered by good. But these are secondary and auxiliary to the true end of kindling the fire of love in his alienated heart. The great object which every Christian man is bound to have in view is to win over the enemy and melt away misconceptions and hostility. It is not from any selfish regard to one’s own personal ease that we are so to act, but because of the sacred regard which Christ has taught us to cherish for the blessing of peace amongst men, and in order that we may deliver a brother from the snare, and make him share in the joys of fellowship with God. The only way to burn up the evil in his heart is by heaping coals of kindness and beneficence on his head. And for such an end it becomes us to watch for opportunities. We have to mark the right moment, and make sure that we time our offer for food when he is hungry and of drink when he thirsts; for often <span class="ital">mal-a-propos</span> offers of kindness make things worse. Such is God’s way. His thunderbolts we cannot grasp, His love we can copy. Of the two weapons mercy and judgment which He holds in His hand, the latter is emphatically His own; the former should be ours too.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">III. In all life meet and conquer evil with good.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>This last precept, ‘Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good,’ is cast into a form which covers not only relations to enemies, but all contact with evil of every kind. It involves many great thoughts which can here be only touched. It implies that in all our lives we have to fight evil, and that it conquers, and we are beaten when we are led to do it. It is only conquered by being transformed into good. We overcome our foes when we win them to be lovers. We overcome our temptations to doing wrong when we make them occasions for developing virtues; we overcome the evil of sorrow when we use it to bring us nearer to God; we overcome the men around us when we are not seduced by their example to evil, but attract them to goodness by ours.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Evil is only thus transformed by the positive exercise of goodness on our part. We have seen this in regard to enemies in the preceding remarks. In regard to other forms of evil, it is often better not to fight them directly, but to occupy the mind and heart with positive truth and goodness, and the will and hands with active service. A rusty knife shall not be cleaned so effectually by much scouring as by strenuous use. Our lives are to be moulded after the great example of Him, who at almost the last moment of His earthly course said, ‘Be of good cheer: I have overcome the world.’ Jesus seeks to conquer evil in us all, and counts that He has conquered it when He has changed it into love.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/romans/12.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/12-19.htm" title="Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place to wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, said the Lord....">Romans 12:19-20</a></span>. <span class="ital">Dearly beloved </span>— So he softens the rugged spirit; <span class="ital">avenge not yourselves </span>— On those that have injured you, whatever wrongs you may receive; <span class="ital">but rather give place unto wrath </span>— Yield to the wrath of the enemy: <span class="ital">for it is written, Vengeance is mine </span>— It properly belongs to me; <span class="ital">and I will repay </span>— The deserved punishment; <span class="ital">saith the Lord </span>— Or perhaps the original expression, <span class="greekheb">δοτε τοπον τη οργη</span>, might be more properly rendered, <span class="ital">leave room for wrath; </span>that is, the wrath of God, to whom vengeance properly belongs. “This precept,” says Macknight, “is founded, as in religion, so in right reason, and in the good of society. For he who avenges himself, making himself accuser, and judge, and executioner, all in one person, runs a great hazard of injuring both himself and others, by acting improperly, through the influence of passion.” <span class="ital">Therefore </span>— Instead of bearing any thoughts of hurting them that abuse you, however unkindly and unjustly; <span class="ital">if thine enemy hunger, feed him </span>—<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Even with your own hand: yea, if it be needful, put bread into his mouth: <span class="ital">if he thirst, </span>&c. — That is, on the whole, do him all the good in thy power: <span class="ital">for in so doing </span>— As Solomon urges, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/25-21.htm" title="If your enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat; and if he be thirsty, give him water to drink:">Proverbs 25:21</a>,) <span class="ital">thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head </span>— Thou wilt touch him so sensibly, that he will no more be able to stand against such a conduct, than to bear on his head burning coals; but will rather submit to seek thy friendship, and endeavour, by future kindness, to overbalance the injury. “The metaphor is supposed to be taken from the melting of metals, by covering the ore with burning coals. Thus understood, the meaning will be, In so doing, thou wilt mollify thine enemy, and bring him to a good temper. This, no doubt, is the best method of treating enemies: for it belongs to God to punish the injurious, but to the injured to overcome them, by returning good for evil.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><span class="ital">“So artists melt the sullen ore of lead, By heaping coals of fire upon its head:</span></span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><span class="ital">In the kind warmth the metal learns to glow, And, pure from dross, the silver runs below.”</span></span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>That the expression is used here in this sense, seems evident from the following verse, where we are commanded to overcome evil with good.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/12.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>12:17-21 Since men became enemies to God, they have been very ready to be enemies one to another. And those that embrace religion, must expect to meet with enemies in a world whose smiles seldom agree with Christ's. Recompense to no man evil for evil. That is a brutish recompence, befitting only animals, which are not conscious of any being above them, or of any existence hereafter. And not only do, but study and take care to do, that which is amiable and creditable, and recommends religion to all with whom you converse. Study the things that make for peace; if it be possible, without offending God and wounding conscience. Avenge not yourselves. This is a hard lesson to corrupt nature, therefore a remedy against it is added. Give place unto wrath. When a man's passion is up, and the stream is strong, let it pass off; lest it be made to rage the more against us. The line of our duty is clearly marked out, and if our enemies are not melted by persevering kindness, we are not to seek vengeance; they will be consumed by the fiery wrath of that God to whom vengeance belongeth. The last verse suggests what is not easily understood by the world; that in all strife and contention, those that revenge are conquered, and those that forgive are conquerors. Be not overcome of evil. Learn to defeat ill designs against you, either to change them, or to preserve your own peace. He that has this rule over his spirit, is better than the mighty. God's children may be asked whether it is not more sweet unto them than all earthly good, that God so enables them by his Spirit, thus to feel and act.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/romans/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Dearly beloved - This expression of tenderness was especially appropriate in an exhortation to peace. It reminded them of the affection and friendship which ought to subsist among them as brethren.<p>Avenge not yourselves - To "avenge" is to take satisfaction for an injury by inflicting punishment on the offender. To take such satisfaction for injuries done to society, is lawful and proper for a magistrate; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-4.htm">Romans 13:4</a>. And to take satisfaction for injuries done by sin to the universe, is the province of God. But the apostle here is addressing private individual Christians. And the command is, to avoid a spirit and purpose of revenge. But this command is not to be so understood that we may not seek for "justice" in a regular and proper way before civil tribunals. If our character is assaulted, if we are robbed and plundered, if we are oppressed contrary to the law of the land, religion does not require us to submit to such oppression and injury without seeking our rights in an orderly and regular manner. If it did, it would be to give a premium to iniquity, to countenance wickedness, and require a man, by becoming a Christian, to abandon his rights.<p>Besides, the magistrate is appointed for the praise of those who do well, and to punish evil-doers; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-14.htm">1 Peter 2:14</a>. Further, our Lord Jesus did not surrender his rights <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-23.htm">John 18:23</a>; and Paul demanded that he himself should be treated according to the rights and privileges of a Roman citizen; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-37.htm">Acts 16:37</a>. The command here "not to avenge ourselves" means, that we are not to take it out of the hands of God, or the hands of the law, and to inflict it ourselves. It is well known that where there are no laws, the business of vengeance is pursued by individuals in a barbarous and unrelenting manner. In a state of savage society, vengeance is "immediately taken," if possible, or it is pursued for years, and the offended man is never satisfied until he has imbrued his hands in the blood of the offender. Such was eminently the case among the Indians of this country (America). But Christianity seeks the ascendancy of the laws; and in cases which do not admit or require the interference of the laws, in private assaults and quarrels, it demands that we bear injury with patience, and commit our cause unto God; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a>.<p>But rather give place unto wrath - This expression has been interpreted in a great variety of ways. Its obvious design is to induce us not to attempt to avenge ourselves, but to leave it with God. To "give place," then, is to leave it for God to come in and execute wrath or vengeance on the enemy. Do not execute wrath; leave it to God; commit all to him; leave yourself and your enemy in his hands, assured that he will vindicate you and punish him.<p>For it is written - <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-35.htm">Deuteronomy 32:35</a>.<p>Vengeance is mine - That is, it belongs to me to inflict revenge. This expression implies that it is "improper" for people to interfere with that which properly belongs to God. When we are angry, and attempt to avenge ourselves, we should remember, therefore, that we are infringing on the prerogatives of the Almighty.<p>I will repay ... - This is said in substance, though not in so many words, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-35.htm">Deuteronomy 32:35-36</a>. Its design is to assure us that those who deserve to be punished, shall be; and that, therefore, the business of revenge may be safely left in the bands of God. Though "we" should not do it, yet if it ought to be done, it will be done. This assurance will sustain as, not in the "desire" that our enemy shall be punished, but in the belief that "God" will take the matter into his own hands; that he can administer it better than we can; and that if our enemy "ought" to be punished, he will be. "We," therefore, should leave it all with God. That God will vindicate his people, is clearly and abundantly proved in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/1-6.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:6-10</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/6-9.htm">Revelation 6:9-11</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-40.htm">Deuteronomy 32:40-43</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/romans/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19-21. avenge not, &c.&#8212;(See on [2258]Ro 12:14).<p>but rather give place unto wrath&#8212;This is usually taken to mean, "but give room or space for wrath to spend itself." But as the context shows that the injunction is to leave vengeance to God, "wrath" here seems to mean, not the offense, which we are tempted to avenge, but the avenging wrath of God (see 2Ch 24:18), which we are enjoined to await, or give room for. (So the best interpreters).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/romans/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Dearly beloved; </span> he useth this friendly compellation, the better to persuade to the following duty, which is so hard to flesh and blood. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Avenge not yourselves:</span> you had an exhortation to this purpose, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-17.htm" title="Recompense to no man evil for evil.

But it is better referred to the wrath of God, which they seem to prevent who seek revenge: q.d.

The Rev. brings out better the force of the original: Vengeance belongeth unto Me. The quotation is from <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-35.htm">Deuteronomy 32:35</a>. Hebrew, To me belongs vengeance and requital. Septuagint, In the day of vengeance I will requite. The antithesis between vengeance by God and by men is not found in Deuteronomy. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-30.htm">Hebrews 10:30</a>. Dante, listening to Peter Damiano, who describes the abuses of the Church, hears a great cry. Beatrice says:<p>"The cry has startled thee so much,<p>In which, if thou hadst understood its prayers,<p>Already would be known to thee the vengeance<p>Which thou shalt look upon before thou diest.<p>The sword above here smiteth not in haste,<p>Nor tardily, howe'er it seem to him<p>Who, fearing or desiring, waits for it."<p>"Paradiso," xxii, 12-18.<p>Compare Plato: Socrates, "And what of doing evil in return for evil, which is the morality of the many - is that just or not? Crito, Not just. Socrates, For doing evil to another is the same as injuring him? Crito, Very true. Socrates, Then we ought not to retaliate or render evil for evil to any one, whatever evil we may have suffered from him.... This opinion has never been held, and never will be held by any considerable number of persons" ("Crito," 49). Epictetus, being asked how a man could injure his enemy, replied, "By living the best life himself." The idea of personal vindictiveness must be eliminated from the word here. It is rather full meting out of justice to all parties. </body></html>
